      "text": "Critics find \"Two Strangers (Carry a Cake Across New York)\" to be a charming but slight romantic comedy musical that succeeds primarily on the strength of Sam Tutty's breakout performance and its sincere, old-fashioned appeal, though many note it stretches thin over its two-hour running time. While some reviewers embrace its gentle, Gen Z-friendly rom-com formula as a refreshing sleeper hit, others criticize the show for being overly sentimental, forgettable, and lacking the substance to justify its length.",

Reviewers consistently highlight the show's refreshing intimacy, innovative staging, gentle humor, and surprising emotional depth that balances charm with genuine pathos.",

However, many reviewers find the adaptation lacks a clear reason for existing, citing an overly faithful book that overexplains the familiar story, structural problems, and a tendency toward earnest melodrama that doesn't fully justify the musical treatment.",

While a few reviewers find the show's chaotic, irreverent humor uneven or too niche, the overwhelming majority celebrate it as the funniest comedy on Broadway in years, with its campy, queer sensibility and sharp physical comedy creating a communal theatrical experience that audiences find irresistible.",

While most reviewers commend David Cromer's direction, the realistic design elements, and co-star Namir Smallwood's work, some find the characters thinly drawn and question whether this early Letts work achieves the visceral impact it needs to fully succeed as horror-tinged drama.",
