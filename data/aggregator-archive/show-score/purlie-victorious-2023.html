GO IF YOU: You want to see an old play that was a hit when it first opened.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: You have a low tolerance for over-the-top cartoonish acting.\n\nALSO: I don’t know what Jesse Green is talking about. The play tries too hard across the board to be funny and the end result was that it wasn’t funny. Every performance, with the exception of the great Billy Eugene Jones (one of the best actors in New York) was broad and strange. One of the fundamentals of making comedy work is to play it as straight as possible. Kenny Leon may be the most overrated director. He has the tendency to completely ruin shows with his obsession with speed and broad strokes. Kara Young’s performance was excruciating and not deserving of the praise and awards. She’s a better actor than that. I can only assume Leon destroyed her performance.","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/open-graph/user_review/641215","@type":"Review"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org","name":"Alyssa 8198","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/member/395595","@type":"Person"},"reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org","bestRating":100,"worstRating":0,"ratingValue":93,"@type":"Rating"},"reviewBody":"Excellent Revival Of 1961 Ossie Davis Play. GO IF YOU: Revival of Ossie Davis' 1961 play opened at Music Box 9/27/2023 w outstanding Leslie Odom Jr. in lead \u0026 great supporting cast. Don't miss it.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: You'd dislike fast-falking actors, sarcasm, satire or show of historical racism in the Jim Crow south. But its availabe thru 7/19/24 on PBS.\n\nALSO: streaming, so even if you can't afford a Broadway ticket you can catch this masterful production. The acting is amazing, w taught timing, perfect sets, costumes in an overall pitch perfect production. There's not much of interest on Broadway now, but this is very good indeed.","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/open-graph/user_review/640670","@type":"Review"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org","name":"Rachel 3326","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/member/624393","@type":"Person"},"reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org","bestRating":100,"worstRating":0,"ratingValue":84,"@type":"Rating"},"reviewBody":"Absorbing, Clever, Great Acting, Intelligent, Resonant.

GO IF YOU: too late to see it now, as it closed around the time I saw it, but you did not miss much.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: you want a high level of entertainment. This was not worth my time.\n\nALSO: There is so much effort that is put into each theater production. Many of my producer friends spend years getting the show on stage, thus I'm always trying to be objective when writing about any of the new productions on Broadway. I still often have to ask myself a question: why? Why this show, and why now? And who is it for.\n6 Tony nominations for Purlie Victorious announced on April 30th prompted me to write about my experience of seeing this show. This was the only performance during which I nodded off... It clearly was not a show for me. The heavy southern dialect prevented me from understanding many of the lines, and the constant shouting was making me feel like leaving. This clearly was not a show for everyone. Should I consider the historical value of the story when judging the show? Maybe. I just was not sold with neither the story, nor the delivery. Somehow though all 44 Tony judges thought otherwise. I must mentioned that there is a reason why the show closed after 4 months.","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/open-graph/user_review/635783","@type":"Review"}]}</script>

CRITIC’S PICK: “‘Purlie Victorious’...is every bit as scathingly funny as the 1961 reviews said it was. But even though times have surely changed everything dark in the play is still dark, and the lightness no less necessary.”

"Flat-out hilarious and stacked with topflight performances led by Leslie Odom, Jr. and Kara Young, 'Purlie Victorious' is also a triumph when it comes to timing. Suffice it to say the play speaks directly to today’s racial tumult."

“ ‘Purlie Victorious’ was a radical play for Broadway in 1961, when the civil-rights movement was garnering national attention...The play remains radical today, and for the same reason...More important, the production, directed by&nbsp;Kenny Leon, Broadway’s go-to helmer of black-themed plays reinvigorates the jesting that animates the antic action.”

“The themes of ‘Purlie Victorious’ — segregation, racial terror and the unjustness of sharecropping — are no laughing matter. Yet the brilliance of the performers in this first Broadway revival since its original run, and their ability to lean into the playfulness of Davis’ comedy, present the euphoric and revelatory experiences of being Black while commenting on the absolute absurdity of racism.”

“The production treats us to this sort of divinely worked-out moment in every scene. Sometimes, a cast in a well-made comedy can let us know they’re playing for keeps and, at the same time, for fun. This is the fine line that ‘Purlie Victorious’ walks so beautifully.”

“The pleasures of&nbsp;’Purlie Victorious’&nbsp;aren't just verbal. The high-energy production often has the physicality of a top-notch farce, with characters running back and forth across the stage...’Purlie Victorious’ manages to have fun without shying away from the historical reality of Black oppression.”

“Beyond the opportunity it offers to discover, or rediscover, Davis’s still-fresh, still-impressive play itself, she is arguably the best reason to catch this excellent production.”

“I went into Purlie Victorious wondering if it might not feel dated or off-topic in terms of today's politics; I left in awe of the script's vigor, its distinctive mix of hilarity and righteous anger, and its insistence that, when it comes to racial injustice, we're all in it together. After a couple of seasons of plays filled with despair and anguish, Davis' humor has a bracing effect; countering evil with ridicule, he diminishes it, robbing it of its power. It's a weapon more playwrights could stand to wield.”

“Even while playing around with exaggerated stereotyping to accentuate the satirical comedy, it is clear that Ossie Davis, writing in the midst of the American Civil Rights Movement, strove mightily to achieve a balance between the ludicrous and a powerful message of equality and the potential for a better world. Everyone involved in this production has been able to articulate this balance to a high degree, so that we leave the theater on a decidedly positive and hopeful note, even if the hard work to bring that hope to fruition never ends.”

“Satire doesn’t always age particularly well. Fortunately, the new production of Ossie Davis’ 1961 play&nbsp;’Purlie Victorious’&nbsp;has sidestepped any issues about its being dated for two reasons, one good and one bad. The good is that director Kenny Leon has provided such a breakneck, well-staged rendition, superbly performed by its terrific ensemble, that the fun never lags. The bad is that the issues depicted in the play have lost little of their resonance even in these supposedly ‘post-racial’ times.”

“Most critical to the success of the evening, perhaps, is the work of director Leon. He honors Davis’s every intention, both written and unwritten in the script. And, more than that, he appears to be channeling what the author would want the play to stand for after the intervening 60-odd years, and how the wise activist Davis would address what is happening in the country right now.”

“There is nothing funny about the way racism has been codified into American systems of law, education, capitalism, etc. But shows like ‘Purlie Victorious’ work because they satirize the ludicrousness of these injustices and mock the partisans that continue to espouse them. The show should sit at the top of “must-see” lists for anyone who enjoys big-laugh comedies that take a piercing look at serious topics.”

“Under the assured guidance of director Kenny Leon, the entire cast steps lightly, and boldly, at the same time: a magical feat. The show is beautifully paced, exquisitely designed (Derek McLane), costumed (Emilio Sosa) and lit (Adam Honoré); what’s more, it pays honor to legendary actor/writer/activist Ossie Davis with love and respect.”

“It’s classic comedy – bait and switch, slave out-smarting his master, disguises, romantic intrigue, spies, sex and triumph over evil...The wisdom is that humanity triumphs through comedy delivered with love which builds community and heals the tremendous pain of oppression.”

"Although 'Purlie Victorious' is a revival, the play feels very current. The audience hears no new message but the same humorous dialogue Davis wrote 60 years ago seems appropriate today. So this humor has a wry quality to it. Doesn’t feel like we’ve made much progress."

“The success of the play on the page and in this production, directed by Kenny Leon, comes from striking the right tone. The seriousness of the underlying issues is always present alongside the comedic gloss.  We are laughing while seeing the darkness in all the humor.”

Odom must toggle between sounding like a comic mountebank (“I ain’t never in all my life told a lie I didn’t mean to make come true, some day!”) and like an impassioned civil rights advocate (“We want our cut of the Constitution…”) As deft as the acting is, the audience also winds up toggling – between the (sometimes outdated) comedy of the plot and the (often still timely) underlying outrage.

“These days, we’ve all become used to shots in the arm whose side effects only come to the fore a day or two later. ‘Purlie Victorious’ is that kind of much-needed theatrical medicine.”

Purlie Victorious, running a swift and intermissionless 100 minutes, is theatre for everyone: truly funny, socially meaningful, historically educational, politically progressive, appealingly accessible, emotionally inspiring, and marvelously performed. One hopes it’s still remembered when Tony time comes around.

“Despite all his sermonizing, Purlie never turns into a pedagogue, thanks to Davis, who has loaded the preacher’s speeches with great one-liners and epigrams — none of which will be repeated here. They need to be experience first-hand in the theater...‘Purlie Victorious’ is the funniest show now performing on Broadway”

Purlie Victorious commits to the power of theatre to make people uncomfortable, and also the value and necessity of doing so. In today’s world of short attention spans, many of us are used to being able to stop watching when something pushes us too far, but in a theatre we don't have that luxury. I'm grateful for theatrical spaces that makes people sit with their discomfort, process it, ride it out, and keep going. In addition to laughter, the play evoked serious ideas to ponder and percolate.

“For a brief second, we are reminded of true venomous nature of the Old South. But then, the jokes continue, Ol’Cap’n gets his just desserts and&nbsp;’Purlie’—both the character and the play—&nbsp;emerges truly victorious.”
