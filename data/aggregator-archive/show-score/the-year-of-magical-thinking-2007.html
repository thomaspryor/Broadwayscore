GO IF YOU: You want to see an extraordinary one woman show.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: are not a fan of Joan Didion or do not like physical closeness between audience and actor.\n\nALSO: Kathleen Chalifant's performance is exquisite. Seeing this play in an intimate church setting is a remarkable experience and a gift to the audience. I saw Vanessa Redgrave in the original Broadway production in 2007 and thought her performance was brilliant. Chalifant's performance is so different from Redgrave's and I found it richer and more nuanced. Perhaps because I am older myself, or perhaps because the setting is so intimate, this performance resonated with me on such a deep level. I really hung on Chalifant's every word and expression. Joan Didion's writing is remarkable too - all the more so when brought to life by an actor as great as Chalifant.","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/open-graph/user_review/517613","@type":"Review"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org","name":"Howard 6295","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/member/109382","@type":"Person"},"reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org","bestRating":100,"worstRating":0,"ratingValue":90,"@type":"Rating"},"reviewBody":"Absorbing, Great Acting, Great Staging, Great Writing, Intelligent.

GO IF YOU: you have a pulse. Chalfant makes you feel like she is addressing you personally. Grief, denial and acceptance, but not in a maudlin manner.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: you are uncomfortable with the subject of tragedy and death...and affirmation.\n\nALSO: We were fortunate to see the final performance in a magnificent apartment overlooking CPW. Twenty 'guests' at a cocktail party, in a semi-circle, hearing Kathleen Chalfant tell you about her (as Joan Didion) harrowing experience of losing her loved ones. Although gut-wrenching, not a sob story as she does not ask for your pity. If you EVER get a chance to see this production, especially in a such an intimate setting, do not miss it. Chalfant is resplendent and glowing and the 90 minutes goes by quickly. She provides the 'magic' in this show. Thanks to the hostess who allowed us to be in her fabulous apartment (we are all very jealous!) and for the goodies she so graciously offered afterwards.","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/open-graph/user_review/508137","@type":"Review"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org","name":"Ingrid 6239","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/member/97536","@type":"Person"},"reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org","bestRating":100,"worstRating":0,"ratingValue":100,"@type":"Rating"},"reviewBody":"Absorbing, Delightful, Great Acting, Masterful, Profound.

GO IF YOU: You appreciate theater for the relationship forged between performer and audience. You love thoughtful scripts, Didion, Kathleen Chalfont.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: You need elaborate sets, multiple performers. This is a one-person gem of intimacy; it is wrenching.\n\nALSO: IMHO this is a terrific improvement on the Broadway/Redgrave production. First, because the smaller space builds connection. And second, because Chalfont has warmth. Admittedly warmth is not exactly Didion-like, but it truly adds to the theatrical experience.","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/open-graph/user_review/500858","@type":"Review"}]}</script>

Do not see it if: are not a fan of Joan Didion or do not like physical closeness between audience and actor. Kathleen Chalifant's performance is exquisite. Seeing this play in an intimate church setting is a remarkable experience and a gift to the audience. I saw Vanessa Redgrave in the original Broadway production in 2007 and thought her performance was brilliant. Chalifant's performance is so different from Redgrave's and I found it richer and more nuanced. Perhaps because I am older myself, or perhaps because the setting is so intimate, this performance resonated with me on such a deep level. I really hung on Chalifant's every word and expression. Joan Didion's writing is remarkable too - all the more so when brought to life by an actor as great as Chalifant.&quot;,&quot;fiveStarScore&quot;:4.8,&quot;helpfulVotesCount&quot;:0,&quot;id&quot;:282873,&quot;liked&quot;:false,&quot;score&quot;:95.0,&quot;showtimeDate&quot;:null,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.show-score.com/theatre-shows/the-year-of-magical-thinking?utm_campaign=the-year-of-magical-thinking\u0026utm_medium=referral\u0026utm_source=ss#%23trusted_review_282873&quot;,&quot;verified&quot;:false,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:null,&quot;displayName&quot;:&quot;Mary 8329&quot;,&quot;external&quot;:false,&quot;followersCount&quot;:3,&quot;following&quot;:false,&quot;id&quot;:409250,&quot;reviewsCount&quot;:32,&quot;profileUrl&quot;:&quot;https://www.show-score.com/member/mary-8329&quot;,&quot;badges&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:79893,&quot;level&quot;:1,&quot;tooltip&quot;:&quot;Tastemaker 1, based on the number of people following this person.

Chalfant makes you feel like she is addressing you personally. Grief, denial and acceptance, but not in a maudlin manner. Do not see it if: you are uncomfortable with the subject of tragedy and death...and affirmation. We were fortunate to see the final performance in a magnificent apartment overlooking CPW. Twenty 'guests' at a cocktail party, in a semi-circle, hearing Kathleen Chalfant tell you about her (as Joan Didion) harrowing experience of losing her loved ones. Although gut-wrenching, not a sob story as she does not ask for your pity. If you EVER get a chance to see this production, especially in a such an intimate setting, do not miss it. Chalfant is resplendent and glowing and the 90 minutes goes by quickly. She provides the 'magic' in this show. Thanks to the hostess who allowed us to be in her fabulous apartment (we are all very jealous!) and for the goodies she so graciously offered afterwards.&quot;,&quot;fiveStarScore&quot;:5.0,&quot;helpfulVotesCount&quot;:1,&quot;id&quot;:282869,&quot;liked&quot;:false,&quot;score&quot;:100.0,&quot;showtimeDate&quot;:null,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.show-score.com/theatre-shows/the-year-of-magical-thinking?utm_campaign=the-year-of-magical-thinking\u0026utm_medium=referral\u0026utm_source=ss#%23trusted_review_282869&quot;,&quot;verified&quot;:false,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://d4ov6iqsvotvt.cloudfront.net/uploads/user/avatar/588231/thumb_1655263473-thumbnail.jpg&quot;,&quot;displayName&quot;:&quot;Mark Aracelis&quot;,&quot;external&quot;:false,&quot;followersCount&quot;:24,&quot;following&quot;:false,&quot;id&quot;:588231,&quot;reviewsCount&quot;:132,&quot;profileUrl&quot;:&quot;https://www.show-score.com/member/mark-aracelis&quot;,&quot;badges&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:89352,&quot;level&quot;:4,&quot;tooltip&quot;:&quot;Tastemaker 4, based on the number of people following this person.

"The play is a report back from an emotional abyss, yet for all its intensity, it isn’t grim or overwrought. It’s rigorously self-scrutinizing, dryly self-mocking, fairly stunned — somehow both unsentimental and consumed with love."
