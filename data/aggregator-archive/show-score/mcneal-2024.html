GO IF YOU: you like Robert Downey Jr. and want to see the scary truth of AI's impact on our world.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: you become easily confused and not interested in heavy subjects.\n\nALSO: Robert Downey Jr., in the title role, successfully makes the transition from screen to stage; a feat not easily done. He brings his trademark quirks and seriousness, which is highlighted by his excellent supporting cast, including Ruthie Ann Mills and Melora Hardin. The thin line of reality and fantasy is blurred further when AI becomes an obsession for McNeal and his plagiaristic tendencies. You will laugh, you will cry, you will shocked and confused in the most absorbing ways when you realize just how much AI can reveal the truth while obscuring simultaneously.","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/open-graph/user_review/648955","@type":"Review"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org","name":"C 3337","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/member/625131","@type":"Person"},"reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org","bestRating":100,"worstRating":0,"ratingValue":50,"@type":"Rating"},"reviewBody":"Confusing, Disappointing, Dizzying, Great Acting, Great Staging. GO IF YOU: You like Robert Downey Jr and specifically want to see him play another sarcastic and arrogant tortured genius.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: You want a play to make any sense or have any point of anything to say, you are sensitive to any number of difficult topics (see below).\n\nALSO: My best guess is that this playwright was attempting to imitate what would happen if you fed every Broadway show in history into a generative AI model. However, I'm not sure that proving a person can be just as incoherent as a computer counts for much. You've got every cliche in the book: a tortured white man genius who mistreats everyone around him, family drama that explodes in shocking revelations, the carnage of mostly women that reflect or protagonist back to us, and so on. While the acting, sets, projections, staging, and pretty much every element but the writing are genuinely strong, there is no making up for the fact that this play doesn't have anything to say. It's yet another nonsensical work that only exists where it does because it is capitalizing off of a famous name. I left thinking and feeling nothing.\n\nSpoiler but this play does touch on (though in no way meaningfully explores) suicide, mental illness, alcoholism, sexual abuse by a parent, abortion, misogyny, and racism.","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/open-graph/user_review/648896","@type":"Review"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org","name":"Molly 4158","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/member/637442","@type":"Person"},"reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org","bestRating":100,"worstRating":0,"ratingValue":79,"@type":"Rating"},"reviewBody":"Ambitious, Entertaining, Great Staging, Relevant.

GO IF YOU: into pondering AI in the context of plagiarism and interpretations of reality. An excellent cast and a great set.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: McNeal has slow scenes and is unfocused, but it works as a whole.

GO IF YOU: you want to see Robert Downey, Jr. hamming it up and acting like Tony Stark as a Nobel Prize-winning author; invested in AI’s effects on us.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: you need more than a big celebrity lead in a 1.5-hour drama; dislike shows reliant upon tech-heavy backgrounds; bothered by death/suicide.\n\nALSO: Without “spoilers,” I’ll note that McNeal is about spectacle and eerie “what ifs?” in relation to creativity, writing, and how we perceive the world. Robert Downey, Jr. is still finding his “writer voice” as Jacob McNeal, whose wife has committed suicide, whose son knows too much about his father’s “writing practices,” who seems close to liver failure (according to his doctor, played by Ruthie Anne Miles), and who is awaiting a Nobel Prize in Literature. But where does AI end and human ideas begin? Why does AI-generated material skew towards the “happy” ending and not the more morose – and realistic? And can we be sure that anything we’re seeing (or reading or hearing) isn’t created in some pixelated world that has blended the words of others? Where do we find our own voice and vision? There's a sleight-of-hand here. And there isn’t enough for greats like Andrea Martin and Melora Hardin to do or say. Yet, as a writer/English teacher, I am invested in the ethical and creative questions.","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/open-graph/user_review/648848","@type":"Review"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org","name":"Dylan S.","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/member/589765","@type":"Person"},"reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org","bestRating":100,"worstRating":0,"ratingValue":82,"@type":"Rating"},"reviewBody":"Absorbing, Ambitious, Clever, Thought-Provoking. GO IF YOU: You enjoy Robert Downey Jr. and the consequences of AI.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: You don't want to sit for 75 minutes watching a show about AI.\n\nALSO: This show is still in previews at the time of writing this, but this play has some potential. The writing is good, but it could use some tightening up. The tech is stunning, though. Robert Downey Jr. delivers a great performance as if Tony Stark were a Nobel Prize-winning author who decided to use AI to write books, but the consequences are severe.\n\n***SPOILER ALERT***\nThe whole thing was just an idea for a book. AI wrote the whole story. We spent 90 minutes watching it, but we could not create an ending because McNeal wants the character to commit suicide, but AI won't write it. \n\nI think this show was good, but it was not the best play I've seen.","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/open-graph/user_review/648829","@type":"Review"}]}</script>
