GO IF YOU: you love scattered stories about a successful band making an album following their #1 album, going through creative stress and struggles.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: You can’t sit through an extremely long show.\n\nALSO: This show had a lot of brilliant moments both musically as well as certain scenes. The actors were incredible but many of the dramatic moments and monologues were milked way too much and didn’t feel earned, more shoehorned. The show is WAY too long and could have used cuts all over the place, there were many conversations between characters that they’d had multiple times throughout the show and served little to drive the show forward. The dramatic pauses were extremely overdone and unearned, they felt like a means to just lengthen the already overlong show. If they could cut 40 minutes from the runtime (and the 100% could here without losing much in terms of plot or character development) then this should could be one of the greatest. The stand out for me were the actors that played Diana and Grover, their performances felt the most dynamic and worth the ride. The others were fun to have but their dramatic moments felt like a slough to get through (more a direction note).","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/open-graph/user_review/648671","@type":"Review"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org","name":"marc 6302","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/member/111351","@type":"Person"},"reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org","bestRating":100,"worstRating":0,"ratingValue":79,"@type":"Rating"},"reviewBody":"Ambitious, Great Acting, Intelligent, Intense, Slow.

It is interesting to witness the changes in the characters after years of working together. Do not see it if: you want a fast moving story. Creating is sometimes a slow process as seen in the play. I can see many finding the play boring or too slow. The play’s band feels similar to a fictional Fleetwood Mac working on an album for many years. Cast has great chemistry together. Great songs by Will Butler. The staging doesn’t always work for the whole theater which is unfortunate.

Do not see it if: much dialog is (purposely) banal; @3hrs+ flags at times; shows pain, but not why musicians luv what they do. 1. This holistic production focuses not only on the musicians but also the sound engineers, and we find they are the unsung heroes of making an album. 2. Particularly satisfying: we see certain characters change over time. The engineer, Grover, initially a gopher, becomes a trusted advisor to the musicians. The Stevie Nicks-inspired character, lacking self-confidence and dependent on her boyfriend/band-leader, by the end has the confidence to assert herself as an artist. 3. The sound system, that allows the audience to both listen in on intimate dialog while hearing w precision the gorgeous, driving music of the group, is a marvel.

<div class="show-page-v2__about text-justify">
<p>1976 rock band faces fame's edge, exploring creative chaos, breakup or breakthrough.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="js-read-more-text hidden">
<p>In the heart of Broadway's excitement, Stereophonic takes center stage as a critically acclaimed new play. Presented by producers Sue Wagner, John Johnson, Seaview, Sonia Friedman Productions, Linden Productions, and Ashley Melone &amp; Nick Mills, this theatrical gem by David Adjmi moves from its world premiere at Playwrights Horizons to Broadway's Golden Theatre. Directed by Daniel Aukin and featuring original songs by Will Butler of Arcade Fire, Stereophonic has dominated "Best Theater of 2023" lists, earning high praises from The New York Times, New York Magazine, The Washington Post, and more.</p><p>The narrative of Stereophonic unfolds within the pulsating atmosphere of a music studio in 1976. An up-and-coming rock band finds itself on the verge of superstardom while recording a new album. As pressures escalate, the band faces the potential for both breakup and breakthrough. Adjmi's masterful storytelling invites the audience to intimately immerse themselves in the powder keg process of a band on the brink of blowing up, accompanied by the creative brilliance of the Stereophonic team.&nbsp;</p>
