GO IF YOU: you’re looking for a show that sheds light on human nature.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: you’re not into classic theater or don’t like theater in the round.\n\nALSO: This was a very good production (and adaptation) of a very good story. Sam Gold also once again does an excellent job staging in the round, creating a space where you’re always involved in the action and never feel “cheated” by having a “backside view”.\n\nPerformances are solid across the board. Strong and Imperioli are fantastic as rival brothers. Thomas Jay Ryan (who has long been delighting audiences off-Broadway) is a standout, as always. It’s nice to see him back on Broadway.\n\nThe mid-show “break” with shots of aquavit was a nice touch, as were the folk songs by a very talented cast of “townspeople”.\n\nOverall worth seeing!.","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/open-graph/user_review/642253","@type":"Review"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org","name":"Crup_Crup","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/member/609024","@type":"Person"},"reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org","bestRating":100,"worstRating":0,"ratingValue":99,"@type":"Rating"},"reviewBody":"Great Acting, Great Writing, Masterful, Relevant, Riveting. GO IF YOU: You want a solid story that thoughtfully explores public health, politics and human nature, and having it brought to life by a stellar cast.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: You have an aversion to Ibsen and/or his works.\n\nALSO: This show is a prime example of a production nailing every aspect: script (raise a glass to Henrik Ibsen!), acting, set, lighting, etc. so that I was captivated by what was shown on stage and simultaneously able to process the play's thematic relevance for today, which added richness to my viewing experience. The main draw for me was the premise and how it was realized through Ibsen's writing. The excellent performances by Jeremy Strong and Michael Imperioli were a very pleasant bonus. One point off for the frankly unnecessary \"intermission\" and the chaos of people trying to get a sample of the sponsored alcohol. Take that part out, and I would have absolutely no quibbles with this production.","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/open-graph/user_review/642139","@type":"Review"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org","name":"MusicaltheMusical","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/member/614763","@type":"Person"},"reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org","bestRating":100,"worstRating":0,"ratingValue":97,"@type":"Rating"},"reviewBody":"Absorbing, Great Acting, Great Staging, Thought-Provoking. GO IF YOU: you want to see a play with fantastic acting, and a thought provoking story. Without giving out spoilers, the 5 minute break is very fun!.\nDON'T GO IF YOU: you don't want to see a 2 hour show without an intermission. You cannot arrive on time.\n\nALSO: There are no bad seats in the house - you will not be able to see all the actors faces at all times, but the theater is small enough that even from the standing room area, you could clearly see the actors facial expressions.","sameAs":"https://www.show-score.com/open-graph/user_review/641849","@type":"Review"}]}</script>

</h2>

<div class="show-page-v2__about text-justify">
<p>Jeremy Strong &amp; Michael Imperioli lead a gripping revival about betrayal amid a small town's crisis.</p>
<div class="js-read-more-text hidden">
<p>Jeremy Strong, known for his role in <i>Succession</i>, and Michael Imperioli from <i>The Sopranos</i> and&nbsp;<i>The White Lotus</i> join forces in an enthralling revival of Henrik Ibsen's powerful classic, <i>An Enemy of the People</i>, returning to Broadway for a 16-week run. </p><p>In this compelling play, a conscientious small-town physician (Strong) prides himself on being an upright member of his tightly-knit community. However, when he discovers a catastrophe that risks the lives of everyone in town, he sounds the alarm. His world is shattered when those in authority, including his own brother (Imperioli), not only attempt to silence him but also plot his downfall.</p><p>Presented in a strictly limited engagement, this fresh adaptation comes from the creative mind of Tony Award® nominee Amy Herzog, renowned for her reimagining of Ibsen's <i>A Doll's House</i> last Broadway season, and is helmed by Tony Award-winning director Sam Gold.</p>
