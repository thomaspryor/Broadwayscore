  "articleBody": "Wicked is back on the road across the country, and the reviews are in! The cast includes Talia Suskauer (Elphaba), Allison Bailey (Glinda), Sharon Sachs (Madame Morrible) and Tony Award and Drama Desk Award winner Cleavant Derricks (The Wizard). The Broadway sensation Wicked looks at what happened in the Land of Oz...but from a different angle. Long before Dorothy arrives, there is another young woman, born with emerald-green skin, who is smart, fiery, misunderstood, and possessing an extraordinary talent. When she meets a bubbly blonde who is exceptionally popular, their initial rivalry turns into the unlikeliest of friendships...until the world decides to call one \"good,\" and the other one \"wicked.\" With a thrilling score that includes the hits \"Defying Gravity,\" \"Popular\" and \"For Good,\" Wicked has been hailed by The New York Times as \"the defining musical of the decade,\" and by Time Magazine as \"a magical Broadway musical with brains, heart, and courage.\" NBC Nightly News calls the hit musical \"the most successful Broadway show ever.\" Now the 5th longest running show in Broadway history, Wicked is the winner of over 100 international awards including the Grammy Award and three Tony Awards. Since opening in 2003, Wicked has been performed in over 100 cities in 16 countries around the world (U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Japan, Germany, Holland, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, The Philippines, Mexico, Brazil, Switzerland and China) and has thus far been translated into six languages: Japanese, German, Dutch, Spanish, Korean and Portuguese. Wicked has been seen by over 60 million people worldwide and has amassed over $5 billion in global sales. Based on the novel by Gregory Maguire, Wicked has music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, and a book by Winnie Holzman. The production is directed by Tony Award winner Joe Mantello with musical staging by Tony Award winner Wayne Cilento. Wicked is produced by Marc Platt, Universal Stage Productions, The Araca Group, Jon B. Platt and David Stone. Ovens Auditorium - Charlotte, NC Adam Bell, Charlotte Observer: The show itself, for the few uninitiated, depicts the intertwined lives of the two witches. There's Bailey's Glinda \"the good,\" a soprano who hits all the right notes, but brings her character down to earth in the melancholy reprise of \"I'm Not That Girl.\" She also gets the timing just right on several throwaway comic bits. And Talia Suskauer's green-hued \"wicked\" Witch of the West, Elphaba, simply owns the role from the start, whether it's her yearning softly that \"I'm Not That Girl,\" or the crowd-pleasing, first act finale belting \"Defying Gravity.\" No one is gonna bring her down. Music Hall at Fair Park - Dallas, TX Emily Short, BroadwayWorld: It was an incredible experience to be back in a theater watching a live performance. The cast and crew of Wicked delivered a show that we all desperately needed. The acting was flawless, the singing was striking, the costumes were perfect, the set transported us directly to the heart of Oz, and the lighting was the tool that brought everything together. I would like to say a big \"CONGRATULOTIONS!\" to everyone who was involved in this performance. I know because I saw it, \"I have been changed for the better,\" and you will be, too. Fox Cities Performing Arts Center - Appleton, WI Warren Gerds, We Are Green Bay: Two personalities drive the story, and the performers playing those personalities are top-flight talent for all they do and how they do it. Glinda is goody-two-shoes sweet until push comes to shove. She's portrayed by Allison Bailey, who molds special bits of voice and body, like a swift leg kick to accent a cute word. Elphaba automatically off-turns people in the story with her green skin and bristly, straightforward mouth until she lets known her warmth. She's played by Talia Suskauer, a spitfire all around. Whether in solo or as a duet, Allison Bailey and Talia Suskauer sing in tight and sensational ways. They make a compelling team. The roles are huge, requiring energy akin to that delivered by pro athletes performance after performance. Elphaba literally rises above with full-out, heart-torn singing, notably in \"Defying Gravity\" that ends Act I in a wowing rush. Wednesday, the house filled with a roar. Playhouse Square - Cleveland, OH Howard Gollop, The Chronicle: This production is a cut above the previous tour that came through Cleveland a few years back. But even in a lesser effort, \"Wicked\" remains the kind of celebration preteen girls (and older women) can savor. Only this time, the magic may transcend into a much broader appreciation. Sheri Gross, Cleveland Jewish News: As Elphaba, Suskauer embraces her vulnerable side and her admirable strength as her character develops from a \"green\" teen to a mature advocate for the underdog. Her incredible vocal prowess is showcased in all of her musical numbers, but especially in \"Defying Gravity,\" when her body and soul are lifted into the air, and her big booming voice carries us with her. Segerstrom Center for the Arts - Costa Mesa, CA Michael Quintos, BroadwayWorld: What helps the show feel as relevant and as entertaining now as it did during its early years is certainly helped by a fresh cast bringing new and exciting life to these now familiar characters. This post-lockdown relaunched national tour is headlined by two spectacular leads: the intriguing Talia Suskauer as Elphaba and the effervescent Allison Bailey as G(a)linda. Christopher Smith, The Orange County Register: Elphaba is the brainy counterpoint, and Talia Suskauer's treatment of this older-and-wiser-than-her-years woman - one burning with a social conscience and an acute understanding of all the ways she fails to fit in - was sourced in acting that that is affectingly internalized. Not an easy feat is as joyfully noisy a show as \"Wicked\" is. Spokane Arena - Spokane, WA Carolyn Lamberson, The Spokesman-Review: As Elphaba, Talia Suskauer brings an intriguing combination of awkwardness and determination to the future Wicked Witch of the West. We empathize with her because we can see she is kind and loveable. And Suskauer has a lovely voice, too, fully on display whether she's singing the lovely first-act number \"I'm Not That Girl\" or the soaring anthem \"Defying Gravity.\" As Glinda, Allison Bailey has the showy part. Sure, she plays the ditzy (but not really dumb) blonde, but Bailey shows that she is a deft comic. Aside from possessing a pretty soprano voice, Bailey can make even Glinda's really awkward dance moves look hilarious, and her timing is impeccable when Glinda drops her patented one-liners. SAFE Credit Union Performing Arts Center - Sacramento, CA Courtney Symes, BroadwayWorld: Admittedly, this was my first time seeing Wicked (a sensitive subject for a theatre-goer). They had me hooked with the flying monkeys before the curtain even opened but, when it did, I was immediately transported to another world. A world of magical steampunk-meets-Beetlejuice-meets Sweeney Todd costumes, wondrous characters, and settings that inspired open-mouthed awe. If I had thought that was enough (I did!), they had much more in store! Orpheum Theater - Omaha, NE Courtney Brummer-Clark, Omaha.com: No one may \"mourn the wicked\" witch, but there are certainly reasons to celebrate her. Or at least the version of her portrayed by tour actress Lissa deGuzman. As Elphaba, deGuzman's performance could equal, if not surpass, those who wear the same black hat on the Broadway stage. To say her vocal range in songs like \"The Wizard and I,\" \"Defying Gravity\" and \"No Good Deed\" was powerful is an understatement. Columbus Theatre - Columbus, OH Christina Mancuso, BroadwayWorld: Lissa deGuzman is fairly new to the Wicked world, landing her dream role of Elphaba and joining the tour in late March after playing Jasmine in the touring production of ALADDIN. While very technically precise vocally and endearingly awkward, deGuzman really got her rhythm going in the second Act. She showed her tenderness and vulnerability with Jordan Litz (Fiyero) in \"As Long as You're Mine,\" and belted out a triumphant \"No Good Deed,\" officially claiming her title as Wicked Witch of the West. Boston Opera House - Boston, MA Don Aucoin, The Boston Globe: As the opening notes to \"Wicked\" sounded on Thursday night, a little girl seated in front of me excitedly reached over and clasped her mother's hand. There it was, the old \"Wicked\" magic, undimmed. That snapshot instant - and the palpable joy the girl evinced throughout the ensuing performance at the Citizens Bank Opera House - told the larger story of this singular musical. Orpheum Theatre - Minneapolis, MN Jared Fessler, BroadwayWorld: It may have been my twelfth time seeing this show, but it's been over a few years since I last saw it. I know the production, songs, story, etc but every time that I have seen it, I always catch something new and especially with this production, the show that I went to had. I also enjoy how each of the talented cast members in this production in particular stays true to their characters but also puts their spins on their characters. There were moments when I was like \"oh I don't remember that line, was that added recently?\" It was just so good to see the electrifying staging, costumes, set, and the very talented cast! Basil Considine, Twin Cities Arts Reader: If those are the bones of the show, what will you get from seeing the national tour of Wicked? For starters, killer performances by Lissa deGuzman as Elphaba (better know as the Wicked Witch of West) and Jennafer Newberry as her foil Galinda (better known as Glinda the Good). Their comedic repartee and duetting are standout features of the show. Another standout is the special effects, particularly the use of lighting in combination with practical effects to create engrossing, rippling tableaus of color. When Elphaba takes to the skies at the end of Act 1, it is simply cool. Chrysler Hall - Norfolk, VA Page R. Laws, Daily Press James M. Nederlander Theatre - Chicago, IL Dennis Polkow, New City Stage: Despite the atemporal quality that \"Wicked\" exudes, coming back to it is a reminder that it was always a traditional Broadway musical in form. Stephen Schwartz's remarkably clever and melody-driven songs are character-driven and move the action forward. We feel what they feel. We have empathy even when many Ozians and even the Wizard himself cannot. The one-liners and gags are almost vaudeville-like in their simplicity, although are never oversold. Sheri Flanders, Chicago Sun Times: The camaraderie between deGuzman and Newberry is palpable, and they're a fun pair to watch, sparring and sniping across the stage as Elphaba is brutally bullied by, well, everyone. Eventually Galinda's minuscule conscience catches up with her, and she befriends Elphaba, going against her superficial instincts. Although there were several children in attendance in the audience, I caution parents that this play is not a morality tale for kids, as the duo's friendship is ultimately more \"frenemy\" than friend. Dr. Phillips Center - Orlando, FL Aaron Wallace, BroadwayWorld: Its songbook is the sonic equivalent of Technicolor, a veritable Emerald City of songs that slap. You undoubtedly know \"Defying Gravity,\" a song to which approximately 99.3% of the Dr. Phillips audience gratefully resisted adding their unsolicited voices on Thursday night. That left room for the star of the show, Lissa deGuzman, to belt that ballad on a broom like nobody's business - and like nobody's Elphaba. Quinn Rosebook, Attractions Magazine: While this was my fourth time seeing the show, it was my fiancé's first! He said it was a fun, energetic show that had everything he expected, but also that he was surprised by some of the plot, and really loved the callbacks and references to the original Wizard of Oz story and the 1939 film. I say that it remains one of my favorites and that \"Wicked\" is a quintessential musical must for any theater fan. Straz Center - Tampa, FL Deborah Bostock-Kelley, BroadwayWorld: While Jennafer and Lissa were spellbinding opposites, Natalie Venetia Belcon, as Madame Morrible, stole the stage with her huge booming vocals in \"The Wizard and I.\" Timothy Shew, as the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, was the perfect fraudster. When he sings, \"Cause I think everyone deserves the chance to fly and helping you with your ascent allows me to feel so parental,\" little does he know to whom he's singing. Kravis Center for the Performing Arts - West Palm Beach, FL Mary Damiano, Palm Beach Daily News: As Glinda, Newberry has the showier role and wrings hilarity out of her dialogue. But DeGuzman is a powerhouse. Whether lamenting that the handsome new student won't see her as anything but the green outcast on \"I'm Not That Girl,\" or looking toward a bright future and fulfilling her potential on \"The Wizard and I,\" or literally soaring to new heights on the show's signature song \"Defying Gravity,\" DeGuzman portrays Elphaba's many facets with spunk and poignancy. Fox Theatre - St. Louis, MO Tina Farmer, Riverfront Times: Jennafer Newberry, as Glinda, and Lissa deGuzman, as Elphaba, fill their characters with distinct personalities without missing a note in the cleverly constructed but often vocally challenging score. Newberry shows Glinda's heart while making the most of every ditzy, goofy moment, and her misuse of oddly combined words gets laughs without ever demeaning the character. DeGuzman gives us an Elphaba, who occasionally reveals her pain and vulnerability in ways that are compelling and relatable. The performers give us fully formed characters to embrace, and their exceptional vocals were textured, emotional and powerful in every part of their ranges. It is so satisfying to hear rich, pure alto tones that perfectly complement the soprano notes. Wharton Center - East Lansing, MI David Winkelstern, City Pulse: Every cast member in the 30-plus troupe gives an outstanding performance. (That includes Sharon Sachs, who replaced Natalie Venetia Belcon in Thursday night's (May 11) show as Madame Morrible.) Oz's Munchkins, ensemble townspeople and exquisite principals demonstrate rare talent in singing, dancing and athleticism in the constantly evolving musical by Stephen Schwartz. Hobby Center for the Performing Arts - Houston, TX Armando Urdiales, BroadwayWorld: The cast of the current Wicked tour is truly exceptional, bringing the beloved characters of Elphaba (Olivia Valli) and Glinda (Celia Hottenstein) to life with extraordinary talent. Their chemistry on stage is palpable, as they navigate the complex relationship between the misunderstood green-skinned Elphaba and the popular and bubbly Glinda. The vocal prowess and emotional depth of the actors truly shine through, capturing the hearts of the audience from the opening number to the final bow. Fox Theatre - Atlanta, GA Wendell Brock, AJC: Time can reshape how some emotional material lands, and I can’t help but notice how “Wicked” ricochets in new and unexpected ways. For instance, when the nasty business about animals being stripped of their dignity and their ability to speak rears its head, you may recognize something akin to the culture wars of the present day. Hate is omnipresent, as are pretenders hiding behind curtains. Sammie Purcell, Rough Draft Atlanta: But as soon as the curtain rises, it doesn’t really matter if you’ve never seen “Wicked’ or if you’ve seen it 100 times. The magic and strength of Stephen Schwartz’s music is still as potent today as it was 20 years ago, the story just as winkingly sly and emotionally resonant. And with two dynamite leading ladies at the helm, this production is not one to miss.  Peace Center - Greenville, SC Paul Hyde, Greenville Journal: The current cast of the national tour is stunning. Olivia Valli, who knocked our socks off a mere 18 months ago when she visited the Peace Center as Vivian Ward in “Pretty Woman,” returns in this tour as Elphaba, the green Wicked Witch of the West who is loathed by the people of Oz for the sin of being different. Durham Performing Arts Center - Durham, NC Nicole Ackman, BroadwayWorld: The national tour’s cast does a splendid job of breathing new life into the story, from Tara Kostmayer’s earnest Nessarose to Kyle McArthur’s enthusiastic Boq. Olivia Valli has all the pluck and inner fire an Elphaba needs, in addition to great vocals that make “The Wizard and I” and “No Good Deed” highlights of the show. But Celia Hottenstein’s Glinda is also excellent, perfectly hitting all the subtle acting points that make her a rather tragic character. In the opening “No One Mourns the Wicked,” she seems to be trying to convince herself as she tells the munchkins her “good news.”  Saenger Theatre - New Orleans, LA Keitha Spera, NOLA.com Historic Tennessee Theatre - Knoxville, TN Alan Sherrod, Arts Knoxville: The producers, keenly aware of past successes, have built on the fact of Kristin Chenoweth as Glinda and Idina Menzel as Elphaba in those original leading roles by subsequently casting replacements with singer/actresses that can bring their own big, distinctive voices and dramatic abilities without challenging the success of the original characterizations. In this production, Olivia Valli as Elphaba and Celia Hottenstein as Glinda have embraced the legacies of their characters with vocal and dramatic strength, but have also imbued those characters with fresh twists and shadings that are keenly contemporary. Detroit Opera House - Detroit, MI Carmichael Cruz, Click On Detroit:  Olivia Valli, who last graced Detroit in Pretty Woman: The Musical in 2021, is misunderstood green girl Elphaba. The granddaughter of Frankie Valli, Olivia flies high in the role both figuratively and literally (see: ‘Defying Gravity’). Valli hits every note with confidence and her version of “No Good Deed” will be permanently etched into my mind. Valli also isn’t afraid to be goofy. Her playfulness in the beginning of Act I makes her even more likeable, and she has one of the best solo dances in “Dancing Through Life.” Celia Hottenstein is a firecracker Glinda. Never missing a beat, Hottenstein’s comedic timing had the audience erupting with laughter. She makes the role her own and is just a pure joy to watch in “Popular.” Her high sopranos are beautiful and Hottenstein makes it part of her comedy. Civic Center Music Hall - Oklahoma City, OK Lillie-Beth Brinkman, The Journal Record: Visually, the show is also amazing, and some of those involved are worth noting here: elaborate set designs from Eugene Lee, glittery costumes from Susan Hilferty and interesting lighting from Kenneth Posner, sound from Tony Meola, projections by Elaine J. McCarthy, wigs and hair by Tom Watson and special effects by Chic Silber. Elphaba breaking free of expectations in The “Defying Gravity” scene was especially poignant. Bass Concert Hall - Austin, TX Dani Dudek, Austin.com:  In addition to being a story of female friendship, it also focuses on much bigger issues like discrimination and governmental corruption. It’s done in such a fun and entertaining way, taking the story of The Wizard of Oz to a whole new level. Lynn Beaver, BroadwayWorld: his production is here for us to enjoy because of an spectacularly talented cast and crew. The WICKED tour is so well-tuned, one can believe that one has been transported straight to Broadway. The only slight flaw comes from the venue itself. The sound system at Bass Concert Hall is a continuing problem I have found on my many visits. Some of the chorus songs sound muddy, lacking the crisp clarity needed to hear every lyric clearly.  Orpheum Theatre Memphis - Memphis, TN AniKatrina Fageol, BroadwayWorld: The show is visually stunning as well as magical. Susan Hilferty's and Eugene Lee's award winning costume design and scenic design make the show fun and whimsical for all ages. Audiences will immediately notice the Great Dragon Clock (look up) overhead and the images of the Emerald City are some of my favorite in musical set design. The costumes, make-up, and wigs make you feel like you have stepped into the Hunger Games's Capitol and we are left wondering why on earth Elphaba is considered the strange one (although she fits right in in the Emerald City, as she proclaims during \"One Short Day\".  Bushnell Theater - Hartford, CT Christopher Arnott, The Hartford Courant: The bottom line is that “Wicked” has everything going for it, from characters that great musical theater actors clamor to play to awesome sets where a giant metal dragon is just a subtle detail to the sinuously sweet Stephen Schwartz score to the tart Winnie Holzman dialogue. Familiar Oz characters are spread out carefully so they get big crowd-rousing entrances, and the unfamiliar Oz characters (spoiler alert) become familiar ones. Princess of Wales Theatre - Toronto, Canada Lauren Gienow, BroadwayWorld: Lauren Samuels brings a sort of quiet strength to the role of Elphaba that I haven’t quite seen before. We see Elphaba’s hopes get dashed a few times early in the play and she brushes herself off and handles it with a stiff upper lip in a way that we get the sense that she has dealt with this for her entire life. As the stakes get higher, and her cause becomes bigger than herself, so do her reactions. This slow burn into an absolutely epic, and quite frankly, terrifying (in the best way) performance of No Good Deed is worth the ticket price alone! Orpheum Theatre - San Francisco Linda Hodges, BroadwayWorld: Like the twister that brings Dorothy to Oz, there are unexpected twists and turns in this wondrous tale told through song. Stephen Schwartz’s musical genius is evident. He crafts a cohesive, overarching story through music, while each character’s songs reveal much about them individually. Glinda’s songs are light and airy, while Elphaba’s resonate at a more serious level. The tone and timbre of the music guide our feelings about each character. Lily Janiak, San Francisco Chronicle: Actors are like shadows, going through the right motions but leaving no marks. If Bohmer’s Glinda finds a bunch of little places to add overexcited kicks and purrs, her singing either misfires or fizzles out. Samuels’ Elphaba can let rip a mighty belt, but she whiffs the role’s comedy, as if Elphaba were too one-dimensionally virtuous to do anything but be taken seriously. Karen D'Souza, Mercury News: Despite showing its age on stage, particularly in the draggy first act, “Wicked” still enchanted the opening night audience with its signature blend of YA fantasy tropes and sappy power ballads. Other musicals should be green with envy over this die-hard fan base. Keller Auditorium - Portland Krista Garver, BroadwayWorld: The current national tour is everything this show should be – visually stunning, well-sung, and overall a delightful night at the theatre. It also has the strongest Elphaba/Glinda/Fiyero trio I’ve ever had the pleasure of seeing. Paramount Theatre - Seattle, WA Jay Irvin, BroadwayWorld: Samuels blows the roof off the theater.  She’s funny, engaging and a killer voice, especially in the iconic “Defying Gravity” which managed to elicit more than a few tears of joy in some folks around me.  Bohmer too is a powerhouse in voice and character, but I did feel she was straining a bit the night I saw.  But she certainly made up for all that as the show progressed and her character blooms.  And both women together had that incredible chemistry that the show requires. Civic Theatre - San Diego, CA Sandi Masori, San Diego Jewish World: The sets are amazing, multi-layered and make use of fog, lights, and steam punk style backdrops and facades.  It was a great mix of building physical pieces and making use of modern technology without it feeling overly digital.  There were so many little details in the set that even once you thought you had taken it all in you would notice something new.  Like the patterns on the wings of the dragon that hangs above the curtain, or that the clock starts on 1 and ends on 13. Morrison Center for the Performing Arts - Boise, ID Kate Noden, Boise Weekly: This cast was absolutely captivating, with each member contributing something essential that made the performance come to life. Glinda (Austen Danielle Bohmer) and Elphaba (Lauren Samuels) shared a magnetic connection that radiated in every shared moment. Eccles Theater - Salt Lake City, UT Tyler Hinton, BroadwayWorld: WICKED is a worldwide blockbuster for good reason--the appealing book by Winnie Holzman (based on Gregory Maguire's novel) and inspired score by Stephen Schwartz tug at the heartstrings while the spectacular staging (including elaborate costumes by Susan Hilferty, hair and wigs by Tom Watson, sets by Eugene Lee, lighting by Kenneth Posner, projections by Elaine J. McCarthy, and other special effects) stimulates the senses. Tulsa Performing Arts Center - Tulsa, OK James D. Watts Jr., Tulsa World: The national touring production of 'Wicked,' presented by Celebrity Attractions, opened its three-week run May 28 at the Tulsa PAC, and this adaptation of Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel by composer Stephen Schwartz and librettist Winnie Holzman remains a dazzling and immensely satisfying spectacle of sound and light, music and movement. Murat Theatre - Indianapolis, IN The Marriage Matinee, BroadwayWorld: Olivia Valli was a charming Elphaba. Of course, you won’t get cast as Elphaba without the voice to match, and there was no exception here. Valli delivered humor and depth in equal measure to show us why Elphaba is the unexpected heroine we need. I appreciate the subtle ways she made Elphaba her own. There was no sense of “copying” the original that made it stale. Her delivery undoubtedly moved the audience, especially in the iconic number “Defying Gravity” where she makes the brave decision to stand on her own. I noticed more than one audience member in tears as we went into intermission.  Lisa Gauthier Mitchison, Nuvo: In the current tour, Zoe Jensen plays Glinda and, June 18-22, Elphaba was played by Olivia Valli (June 24-July 6, the part will be played by Jessie Davidson). No disrespectation to director Joe Mantello or Valli, but I wasn’t a fan of Elphaba’s initial portrayal. She was much too coltish -- a slightly cringy adult trying to act like a kid. However, Valli absolutely nailed “Defying Gravity,” which is notorious for being one of the most demanderating musical belts ever. From there, Valli’s Elphaba showed more poise as her character’s arc played out.   Chloe McGowan, Indianapolis Recorder: One of the things that makes “Wicked” so special is the stylistic choices each actress brings to the roles of Elphaba and Glinda, specifically in the numbers “Popular,” “Defying Gravity” and “No Good Deed.” In my review of “Wicked: Part One,” I said that I’d seen several different Elphabas take the stage over the years, but truthfully, I have never seen a performance quite like Olivia Valli’s. Uihlein Hall at Marcus Center For The Performing Arts - Milwaukee, WI Kelsey Lawler, BroadwayWorld: From what I saw, the people were left totally thrilled by this touring production, leaping to their feet with thunderous applause at the final curtain call. And it was earned. This Wicked ticks all the necessary boxes: fantastic leads, swoony Fiyero, lush costumes, seamless practical effects. It’s all here, just like we’ve come to expect since Wicked’s 2003 debut. Shea's Performing Arts Center - Buffalo, NY Michael Rabice, BroadwayWorld: WICKED assuredly is fulfilling it's destiny in the esteemed world of L. Frank Baum's beloved characters. Just as classics like THE SOUND OF MUSIC will live on in many revivals, WICKED has worked it's way into the musical canon and will undoubtedly continue to charm audiences, just as it did at Shea's Buffalo last night, 22 years after its stage debut. Gail Golden, Buffalo Rising: The touring company of Wicked at Shea’s is a sumptuous and satisfying production – for  both audiences who are new to Wicked and for audiences who have seen Wicked before. It was my third time seeing a production of Wicked, and it was a very enjoyable evening. Landmark Theatre - Syracuse, NY Linda Lowen, This is CNY: Having seen “Wicked” with nearly all its original cast on Broadway over 20 years ago, I can confidently say this touring company delivers across-the-board performances that are every bit as good; if you miss this, unless you head down to Broadway, you won’t see their equal again. Hippodrome Theatre - Baltimore, MD Timoth David Copney, BroadwayWorld: First off, a huge shout-out to the entire ensemble. These heroes too often go unsung, so hear me clearly: this group is so talented it boggles the imagination. And don’t get me started on those Flying Monkeys. Their death-defying aerial work — whirling and twirling through space — was thrilling. Elphaba was not the only challenger of gravity on that stage… or in the air above it. Constance Beulah, DC Theater Arts: Visually, the production is stunning. Wicked has always been a feast for the eyes, and this tour fully delivers. The scenery is intricate and immersive, filled with towering mechanical structures, glowing green and red accents, and a sense of constant motion. Gears turn, backdrops fall, and the world of Oz feels alive, ominous, and unforgiving. The design reinforces the idea that the characters are trapped inside a vast system that values obedience over integrity. The Hippodrome’s stage allows these elements to breathe, creating scale without sacrificing emotional intimacy. Herb Merrick, MD Theatre Guide: “Wicked” has taken the Oz the story beyond a fantasy story for children because it addresses many important subjects such as the loyalty of friendship, the desire to “fit in” socially with others, political consciousness of civil and animal rights, and racism. This is a show that is as meaningful to adults as it is to children.  Benedum Center for the Performing Arts - Pittsburgh, PA Toby Tabachnick, The Jewish Chronicle: The production at the Benedum is outstanding. Zoe Jensen plays Glinda with the over-the-top narcissism that defines the role and makes it so fun, but also delivers depth of character. She is the perfect complement to Jessie Davidson’s Elphaba, who strikes an inspired balance of nerdiness, compassion, intellect and determination. And, boy, can she sing. The show’s third number, “The Wizard and I,” left this audience member wanting more, and Davidson delivered later in the first act with a plaintive “I’m Not That Girl,” and then the show-stopping “Defying Gravity.” Alexis Papalia, Trib Live: But aside from the serious stuff, “Wicked” is a bright, fizzing, sparkly spectacle of a musical. Taking cues from the original “Wizard of Oz,” much of the musical feels like it’s in Technicolor, whether in Glinda’s pink dresses or in the verdant lights of the Emerald City.",

<p>Adam Bell, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article253972728.html">Charlotte Observer</a>: The show itself, for the few uninitiated, depicts the intertwined lives of the two witches. There&#39;s Bailey&#39;s Glinda &quot;the good,&quot; a soprano who hits all the right notes, but brings her character down to earth in the melancholy reprise of &quot;I&#39;m Not That Girl.&quot; She also gets the timing just right on several throwaway comic bits.

<p>Emily Short, <a target="newwinddow" href="/dallas/article/BWW-Review-WICKED-Brings-Dallas-Back-Together-20210808">BroadwayWorld</a>: It was an incredible experience to be back in a theater watching a live performance.

The acting was flawless, the singing was striking, the costumes were perfect, the set transported us directly to the heart of Oz, and the lighting was the tool that brought everything together. I would like to say a big &quot;CONGRATULOTIONS!&quot; to everyone who was involved in this performance. I know because I saw it, &quot;I have been changed for the better,&quot; and you will be, too.</p><!-- Ezoic - Article Insertion 3 - long_content -->

Glinda is goody-two-shoes sweet until push comes to shove. She&#39;s portrayed by Allison Bailey, who molds special bits of voice and body, like a swift leg kick to accent a cute word. Elphaba automatically off-turns people in the story with her green skin and bristly, straightforward mouth until she lets known her warmth. She&#39;s played by Talia Suskauer, a spitfire all around. Whether in solo or as a duet, Allison Bailey and Talia Suskauer sing in tight and sensational ways. They make a compelling team. The roles are huge, requiring energy akin to that delivered by pro athletes performance after performance. Elphaba literally rises above with full-out, heart-torn singing, notably in &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; that ends Act I in a wowing rush. Wednesday, the house filled with a roar.</p><!-- Ezoic - Article Insertion 4 - longer_content -->

And Suskauer has a lovely voice, too, fully on display whether she&#39;s singing the lovely first-act number &quot;I&#39;m Not That Girl&quot; or the soaring anthem &quot;Defying Gravity.&quot; As Glinda, Allison Bailey has the showy part. Sure, she plays the ditzy (but not really dumb) blonde, but Bailey shows that she is a deft comic. Aside from possessing a pretty soprano voice, Bailey can make even Glinda&#39;s really awkward dance moves look hilarious, and her timing is impeccable when Glinda drops her patented one-liners.</p><!-- Ezoic - Article Insertion 6 - longer_content -->

I know the production, songs, story, etc but every time that I have seen it, I always catch something new and especially with this production, the show that I went to had. I also enjoy how each of the talented cast members in this production in particular stays true to their characters but also puts their spins on their characters. There were moments when I was like &quot;oh I don&#39;t remember that line, was that added recently?&quot; It was just so good to see the electrifying staging, costumes, set, and the very talented cast!</p>

Their comedic repartee and duetting are standout features of the show. Another standout is the special effects, particularly the use of lighting in combination with practical effects to create engrossing, rippling tableaus of color.

Stephen Schwartz&#39;s remarkably clever and melody-driven songs are character-driven and move the action forward. We feel what they feel.

Eventually Galinda&#39;s minuscule conscience catches up with her, and she befriends Elphaba, going against her superficial instincts. Although there were several children in attendance in the audience, I caution parents that this play is not a morality tale for kids, as the duo&#39;s friendship is ultimately more &quot;frenemy&quot; than friend.</p><!-- Ezoic - Article Insertion 11 Mobile - incontent_8 -->

Newberry shows Glinda&#39;s heart while making the most of every ditzy, goofy moment, and her misuse of oddly combined words gets laughs without ever demeaning the character. DeGuzman gives us an Elphaba, who occasionally reveals her pain and vulnerability in ways that are compelling and relatable. The performers give us fully formed characters to embrace, and their exceptional vocals were textured, emotional and powerful in every part of their ranges. It is so satisfying to hear rich, pure alto tones that perfectly complement the soprano notes.</p>

In this production, Olivia Valli as Elphaba and Celia Hottenstein as Glinda have embraced the legacies of their characters with vocal and dramatic strength, but have also imbued those characters with fresh twists and shadings that are keenly contemporary.</p>

<p>Carmichael Cruz, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/entertainment/2024/01/30/review-wicked-still-has-brains-heart-and-courage-at-the-detroit-opera-house/">Click On Detroit:</a>&nbsp; Olivia Valli, who last graced Detroit in&nbsp;<em>Pretty Woman: The Musical</em>&nbsp;in 2021, is misunderstood green girl Elphaba. The granddaughter of Frankie Valli, Olivia flies high in the role both figuratively and literally (see: &lsquo;Defying Gravity&rsquo;). Valli hits every note with confidence and her version of &ldquo;No Good Deed&rdquo; will be permanently etched into my mind. Valli also isn&rsquo;t afraid to be goofy. Her playfulness in the beginning of Act I makes her even more likeable, and she has one of the best solo dances in &ldquo;Dancing Through Life.&rdquo; Celia Hottenstein is a firecracker Glinda. Never missing a beat, Hottenstein&rsquo;s comedic timing had the audience erupting with laughter. She makes the role her own and is just a pure joy to watch in &ldquo;Popular.&rdquo; Her high sopranos are beautiful and Hottenstein makes it part of her comedy.</p>

<h2>Civic Center Music Hall - Oklahoma City, OK</h2>

<p>Lillie-Beth Brinkman, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://journalrecord.com/2024/02/on-the-town-wicked-was-wickedly-good/">The Journal Record</a>:&nbsp;Visually, the show is also amazing, and some of those involved are worth noting here: elaborate set designs from Eugene Lee, glittery costumes from Susan Hilferty and interesting lighting from Kenneth Posner, sound from Tony Meola, projections by Elaine J. McCarthy, wigs and hair by Tom Watson and special effects by Chic Silber. Elphaba breaking free of expectations in The &ldquo;Defying Gravity&rdquo; scene was especially poignant.</p>

<h2>Bass Concert Hall - Austin, TX</h2>

<p>Dani Dudek, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://austin.com/wicked-the-musical-will-have-you-flying-high-in-austin/">Austin.com</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to being a story of female friendship, it also focuses on much bigger issues like discrimination and governmental corruption. It&rsquo;s done in such a fun and entertaining way, taking the story of&nbsp;The Wizard of Oz&nbsp;to a whole new level.</p>

<p>Lynn Beaver, <a target="newwinddow" href="/austin/article/Review-WICKED-Musical-Magic-At-Bass-Concert-Hall-20240317">BroadwayWorld</a>:&nbsp;his production is here for us to enjoy because of an spectacularly talented cast and crew.

The only slight flaw comes from the venue itself. The sound system at Bass Concert Hall is a continuing problem I have found on my many visits. Some of the chorus songs sound muddy, lacking the crisp clarity needed to hear every lyric clearly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AniKatrina Fageol, <a target="newwinddow" href="/memphis/article/Review-WICKED-at-Orpheum-Theatre-Memphis-20240405">BroadwayWorld</a>:&nbsp;The show is visually stunning as well as magical.&nbsp;<a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Susan-Hilferty/" target="newwinddow">Susan Hilferty</a>&#39;s and&nbsp;<a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Eugene-Lee/" target="newwinddow">Eugene Lee</a>&#39;s award winning costume design and scenic design make the show fun and whimsical for all ages. Audiences will immediately notice the Great Dragon Clock (look up) overhead and the images of the Emerald City are some of my favorite in musical set design. The costumes, make-up, and wigs make you feel like you have stepped into the Hunger Games&#39;s Capitol and we are left wondering why on earth Elphaba is considered the strange one (although she fits right in in the Emerald City, as she proclaims during &quot;One Short Day&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Bushnell Theater - Hartford, CT</h2>

<p>Christopher Arnott, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.courant.com/2024/04/27/theater-review-wicked-is-as-great-and-powerful-as-ever-in-three-week-return-to-the-bushnell/">The Hartford Courant</a>:&nbsp;The bottom line is that &ldquo;<a target="newwinddow" href="https://cloud.broadwayworld.com/rec/tt.cfm?fromlink=2128749&amp;regid=&amp;articlelink=https%3A%2F%2Fticketmaster.evyy.net%2Fc%2F2299526%2F271177%2F4272%3Fu%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fwicked-touring-tickets%2Fartist%2F864373">Wicked</a>&rdquo; has everything going for it, from characters that great musical theater actors clamor to play to awesome sets where a giant metal dragon is just a subtle detail to the sinuously sweet Stephen Schwartz score to the tart Winnie Holzman dialogue. Familiar Oz characters are spread out carefully so they get big crowd-rousing entrances, and the unfamiliar Oz characters (spoiler alert) become familiar ones.</p>

<h2>Princess of Wales Theatre - Toronto, Canada</h2>

<p>Lauren Gienow, <a target="newwinddow" href="/toronto/article/Review-Thank-Goodness-for-WICKED-at-Mirvishs-Princess-of-Wales-Theatre-20240609">BroadwayWorld</a>:&nbsp;<a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Lauren-Samuels/" target="newwinddow">Lauren Samuels</a>&nbsp;brings a sort of quiet strength to the role of Elphaba that I haven&rsquo;t quite seen before. We see Elphaba&rsquo;s hopes get dashed a few times early in the play and she brushes herself off and handles it with a stiff upper lip in a way that we get the sense that she has dealt with this for her entire life. As the stakes get higher, and her cause becomes bigger than herself, so do her reactions. This slow burn into an absolutely epic, and quite frankly, terrifying (in the best way) performance of&nbsp;<em>No Good Deed</em>&nbsp;is worth the ticket price alone!</p>

<h2>Orpheum Theatre - San Francisco</h2>

<p>Linda Hodges, <a target="newwinddow" href="/san-francisco/article/Review-WICKED-at-Orpheum-Theatre-20240831">BroadwayWorld</a>:&nbsp;Like the twister that brings Dorothy to Oz, there are unexpected twists and turns in this wondrous tale told through song.&nbsp;<a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Stephen-Schwartz/" target="newwinddow">Stephen Schwartz</a>&rsquo;s musical genius is evident. He crafts a cohesive, overarching story through music, while each character&rsquo;s songs reveal much about them individually. Glinda&rsquo;s songs are light and airy, while Elphaba&rsquo;s resonate at a more serious level. The tone and timbre of the music guide our feelings about each character.</p>

<p>Lily Janiak, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/orpheum-wicked-sf-review-19666781.php">San Francisco Chronicle</a>: Actors are like shadows, going through the right motions but leaving no marks. If Bohmer&rsquo;s Glinda finds a bunch of little places to add overexcited kicks and purrs, her singing either misfires or fizzles out. Samuels&rsquo; Elphaba can let rip a mighty belt, but she whiffs the role&rsquo;s comedy, as if Elphaba were too one-dimensionally virtuous to do anything but be taken seriously.</p>

<p>Karen D&#39;Souza, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/08/31/review-wicked-mostly-still-charms-in-return-to-where-it-all-started/">Mercury News</a>:&nbsp;Despite showing its age on stage, particularly in the draggy first act, &ldquo;<a target="newwinddow" href="https://cloud.broadwayworld.com/rec/tt.cfm?fromlink=2128749&amp;regid=&amp;articlelink=https%3A%2F%2Fticketmaster.evyy.net%2Fc%2F2299526%2F271177%2F4272%3Fu%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fwicked-touring-tickets%2Fartist%2F864373">Wicked</a>&rdquo; still enchanted the opening night audience with its signature blend of YA fantasy tropes and sappy power ballads. Other musicals should be green with envy over this die-hard fan base.</p>

<h2>Keller Auditorium - Portland</h2>

<p>Krista Garver, <a target="newwinddow" href="/portland/article/Review-WICKED-at-Keller-Auditorium-20241018">BroadwayWorld</a>:&nbsp;The current national tour is everything this show should be &ndash; visually stunning, well-sung, and overall a delightful night at the theatre. It also has the strongest Elphaba/Glinda/Fiyero trio I&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of seeing.</p>

<h2>Paramount Theatre - Seattle, WA</h2>

<p>Jay Irvin, <a target="newwinddow" href="/seattle/article/Review-WICKED-at-The-Paramount-Theatre-20241108">BroadwayWorld</a>:&nbsp;Samuels blows the roof off the theater.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s funny, engaging and a killer voice, especially in the iconic &ldquo;Defying Gravity&rdquo; which managed to elicit more than a few tears of joy in some folks around me.&nbsp; Bohmer too is a powerhouse in voice and character, but I did feel she was straining a bit the night I saw.&nbsp; But she certainly made up for all that as the show progressed and her character blooms.&nbsp; And both women together had that incredible chemistry that the show requires.</p>

<h2>Civic Theatre - San Diego, CA</h2>

<p>Sandi Masori, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.sdjewishworld.com/2025/02/07/wicked-at-broadway-san-diego-is-a-story-of-friendship/">San Diego Jewish World</a>:&nbsp;The sets are amazing, multi-layered and make use of fog, lights, and steam punk style backdrops and facades.&nbsp; It was a great mix of building physical pieces and making use of modern technology without it feeling overly digital.&nbsp; There were so many little details in the set that even once you thought you had taken it all in you would notice something new.&nbsp; Like the patterns on the wings of the dragon that hangs above the curtain, or that the clock starts on 1 and ends on 13.</p>

<h2>Morrison Center for the Performing Arts - Boise, ID</h2>

<p>The Marriage Matinee, <a target="newwinddow" href="/indianapolis/article/Review-WICKED-Hits-Harder-Than-You-Remember-Murat-Theatre-20250622">BroadwayWorld</a>:&nbsp;<a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Olivia-Valli/" target="newwinddow">Olivia Valli</a>&nbsp;was a charming Elphaba. Of course, you won&rsquo;t get cast as Elphaba without the voice to match, and there was no exception here. Valli delivered humor and depth in equal measure to show us why Elphaba is the unexpected heroine we need. I appreciate the subtle ways she made Elphaba her own. There was no sense of &ldquo;copying&rdquo; the original that made it stale. Her delivery undoubtedly moved the audience, especially in the iconic number &ldquo;Defying Gravity&rdquo; where she makes the brave decision to stand on her own. I noticed more than one audience member in tears as we went into intermission.&nbsp;</p>

She was much too coltish&nbsp;--&nbsp;a slightly cringy&nbsp;adult trying to act like a kid.&nbsp;However, Valli&nbsp;absolutely nailed &ldquo;Defying Gravity,&rdquo; which&nbsp;is notorious for being one of the&nbsp;most&nbsp;demanderating&nbsp;musical&nbsp;belts&nbsp;ever. From there, Valli&rsquo;s Elphaba showed more poise as her character&rsquo;s arc&nbsp;played out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Timoth David Copney, <a target="newwinddow" href="/baltimore/article/Review-WICKED-at-The-Hippodrome-20251222">BroadwayWorld</a>:&nbsp;First off, a huge shout-out to the entire ensemble. These heroes too often go unsung, so hear me clearly: this group is so talented it boggles the imagination. And don&rsquo;t get me started on those Flying Monkeys. Their death-defying aerial work &mdash; whirling and twirling through space &mdash; was thrilling. Elphaba was not the only challenger of gravity on that stage&hellip; or in the air above it.</p>

The scenery is intricate and immersive, filled with towering mechanical structures, glowing green and red accents, and a sense of constant motion. Gears turn, backdrops fall, and the world of Oz feels alive, ominous, and unforgiving. The design reinforces the idea that the characters are trapped inside a vast system that values obedience over integrity. The Hippodrome&rsquo;s stage allows these elements to breathe, creating scale without sacrificing emotional intimacy.</p>

<h2>Benedum Center for the Performing Arts - Pittsburgh, PA</h2>

<p>Toby Tabachnick,<a target="newwinddow" href="https://jewishchronicle.timesofisrael.com/still-popular-wicked-soars-again-in-its-return-to-pittsburgh/"> The Jewish Chronicle</a>:&nbsp;The production at the Benedum is outstanding. Zoe Jensen plays Glinda with the over-the-top narcissism that defines the role and makes it so fun, but also delivers depth of character. She is the perfect complement to Jessie Davidson&rsquo;s Elphaba, who strikes an inspired balance of nerdiness, compassion, intellect and determination. And, boy, can she sing. The show&rsquo;s third number, &ldquo;The Wizard and I,&rdquo; left this audience member wanting more, and Davidson delivered later in the first act with a plaintive &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Not That Girl,&rdquo; and then the show-stopping &ldquo;Defying Gravity.&rdquo;</p>
