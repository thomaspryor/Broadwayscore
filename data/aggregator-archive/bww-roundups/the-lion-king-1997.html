  "articleBody": "The National Tour of The Lion King returned to the stage in 2021 and has continued touring across the country since. Read the reviews here! The cast includes Spencer Plachy as \"Scar,\" Gerald Ramsey as \"Mufasa,\" Gugwana Dlamini as \"Rafiki,\" Nick Cordileone as \"Timon,\" Jürgen Hooper as \"Zazu,\" Ben Lipitz as \"Pumbaa,\" Darian Sanders as \"Simba,\" Kayla Cyphers as \"Nala,\" Keith Bennett as \"Banzai,\" Martina Sykes as \"Shenzi\" and Robbie Swift as \"Ed.\" Jaylen Lyndon Hunter alternates the role of \"Young Simba\", along with Charlie Kahler. Giraffes strut, birds swoop, gazelles leap - the entire Serengeti comes to life. And as the music soars, Pride Rock slowly rises from the stage. This is The Lion King. A spectacular visual feast, this adaptation of Disney's much-loved film transports you to a dazzling world that explodes with glorious colors, stunning effects and enchanting music. At its heart is the powerful and moving story of Simba, and his epic journey from wide-eyed cub to his destined role as King of the Pridelands. Read the reviews so far below! Playhouse Square KeyBank State Theatre - Cleveland, OH Roy Berko, BroadwayWorld: South African, Gugwana Diamini, who has appeared in both stage and film versions of The Lion King, shines as the storytelling Rafiki. Ben Lipitz (Pumbaa, the warthog) and Nick Cordileone (Timon, the meerkat) delight. Their \"Hakuna Matata\" is a show highlight. Darian Sanders (Adult Simba) and Kayla Cyphers (Adult Nala) have fine singing voices, but develop shallow characterizations. Their \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight,\" was lovely. Mark Meszoros, News-Herald: \"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\" - with Young Simba, Young Nala, Zazu and the ensemble - is as infectious as ever, as is the aforementioned celebration of possessing no worries, \"Hakuna Matata.\" Disappointedly, though, when it comes to the performance of the late all-important \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight,\" it is, in fact, hard to feel the love. That said, \"The Lion King\" continues to pack its usual visual punch, letting you get lost in its vibrant colors - the burnt orange, the sky blue - of its scenic design (Richard Hudson) and be wowed yet again by its impactful lighting design (Donald Holder), never more evident than during the sudden reveal of the enormous skeleton in the elephant graveyard. Howard Gollop, The Chronicle: As the saying goes, absence makes the heart grow fonder, but there may be more to the enjoyability of this \"The Lion King\" than a slogan: The cast and crew of 2021's \"The Lion King\" seem to try harder - and the audience seems to clap harder as well. Kerry Clawson, Akron Beacon Journal: I was also struck by both the martial arts-evoking, warrior movements that actress Kayla Cyphers executed as Nala steeled herself to find help for the dying Pridelands in \"Shadowland,\" contrasted later with the beautiful way she curved and nestled her head in her loving movements with Darian Sanders' Simba. Sanders, brand new to the Simba role, is likable with his bright persona and brilliant smile. But his vocals were too quiet and tearful for us to hear him for the first part of Simba's heartbreaking number \"Endless Night,\" with the actor taking too long to open up with his singing. Sanders showed off his powerful pipes later, in the inspiring \"He Lives in You,\" where Simba rediscovers his kingly self. Majestic Theatre - San Antonio, TX Bryan Stanton, BroadwayWorld: Young Simba and Young Nala played by Jaylen Lyndon Hunter and Nia Mulder were a dynamic duo that kept the audience on their toes as only two young cubs can. We laughed, we were scared for them, we rejoiced when they were free from danger, and we mourned with Hunter. These young actors connected, I'm sure, with many parents in the audience who could see a tiny bit of their own children on the stage. John Hanlon, 930 AM The Answer: In terms of the production itself, the look of the feature is magnificent. The computer animation helps bring the settings to life but the characters and dialogue never feel as genuine as it once did. Even though the images are more realistic, everything else feels less so. This is a reboot that can't escape from the shadow of its far superior predecessor. While other recently remakes (including Aladdin, Cinderella and the underrated Pete's Dragon) richly added new layers to their well-known stories, this version of The Lion King sadly never does. Orpheum Theatre - Memphis, TN AniKatrina Fageol, BroadwayWorld: The show's opener, The Circle of Life, immediately captivates the audience and pulls them right into the scene as we all gather at Pride Rock to honor the future King of the Pride lands. Adults immediately become children and children gasp with wonder as giant puppets and beautifully costumed actors come from the audience and set the scene at Pride Rock. Gugwana Dlamini's first notes as Rafiki add to the magic, transporting us all back to our childhoods when we first saw that sunrise on our televisions. The audience cheered every time a new character made an entrance and native Memphian Jaylen Lyndon Hunter received an enormous Memphis welcome as he made his entrance as Young Simba. Denver Center for the Performing Arts - Denver, CO Alex Miller, On Stage Colorado: There's not much I can say about this show that most don't already know, but as a first-timer, I can confirm that this one lives up to the hype surrounding the No. 1 musical of all time (it surpassed $8 billion in revenue in 2017, per Wikipedia). Somehow, though, despite being a super high-end production and an earnings juggernaut, the production now in Denver still came across as warm, authentic and presented by a cast that truly enjoyed doing it (this despite some of the cast having done literally thousands of shows). Detroit Opera House - Detroit, MI Stefani Chudnow, BroadwayWorld: Starting from the opening number, you're immediately immersed in the universe of the Pride Lands. The Lion King isn't just a \"Disney show\" - it's an experience from beginning to end. This extends beyond the costumes and the choreography - the score and the singing is sure to give you chills. Some of these songs include the aforementioned \"Circle of Life,\" as well as \"They Live in You,\" the Oscar-winning tune \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight,\" \"Shadowland,\" \"Endless Night\" and \"He Lives in You (Reprise).\" On the other side of the spectrum, there are also songs that are there simply to make you smile, such as \"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\" and \"Hakuna Matata,\" two songs that were made famous by the original film. Gary Graff, The Oakland Press: From the minute the house lights go down and the puppet animals - elephants, rhinos, etc. - parade down the center aisles, it feels like the return of old friends and we're transported directly to the African savanna as the blockbuster Disney film comes to theatrical life in characteristically awe-inspiring fashion. With its inventive staging, costuming, special effects and dancing (choreographed by onetime Detroiter Gawain Garth Fagan), \"The Lion King\" (running through Feb. 20 at the Detroit Opera House) has not aged at all in the 25 years since its debut, and its tale as old as time is welcome and comforting - a two-and-a-half-hour spirit of \"Hakuna Matata.\" Bass Concert Hall - Austin, TX Richard Whittaker, The Austin Chronicle: First staged only three years after the release of the 1994 animated classic, The Lion King will always be seen as original director Julie Taymor's production. It's driven by her melding of the film's Broadway-friendly tunes and family-friendly plot with her fascination with the extreme potential of the stage, her experience with and research into differing global puppetry styles, and culturally respectful approach (since inception, The Lion King has always had a predominantly Black cast). Yet the book by the film's director Roger Allers and cowriter Irene Mecchi also plays a significant role in why the musical can run almost double the animated originator's length. The inherent themes are amplified, most especially Mustafa's frustrations with young Simba, and Simba's guilt at his father's loss. Civic Center Music Hall - Oklahoma City, OK Brandy McDonnell, The Oklahoman: Happily, \"The Lion King\" never fails to move audiences, even after multiple viewings. This was at least my third time to see the musical, and I was still captivated when the mandrill Rafiki (the spirited Gugwana Diamini) called out \"Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba (roughly translated from Zulu as \"There comes a lion\") to start the \"Circle of Life\" rolling. ASU Gammage - Tempe, AZ Timothy Shawver, BroadwayWorld: It's the innovative, collaborative visuals Taymor has assembled from Richard Hudson's scenic design, the lighting design by Donald Holder, hair and make up by Michael Ward, costumes by Taymor, and masks and puppets by Taymor and Michael Curry, that are responsible for that success. Their designs, rooted in traditional African and Asian storytelling like shadow puppetry and Bunraku, achieve visuals astonishing for their lack of modern tech. They're impressive for their simplicity; we can see the puppeteers inside the elephants. Ms. Taymor believes the best tech of all is in the viewer's imagination. San Jose Center for the Performing Arts - San Jose, CA Linda Hodges, BroadwayWorld: The Lion King is rich with themes of good versus evil, the delicate balance of nature and of course the circle of life of which we are all a part. The story stands alone, but it doesn't hurt to have music by Elton John and lyrics by Tim Rice. Their work is complimented beautifully with additional music and lyrics by Lebo M, Mark Mancina, Jay Rifkin, Hans Zimmer and the clearly multi-talented Julie Taymor. With a book by Roger Allers and Irene Mecchi, the theatrical version of Disney's The Lion King garnered 11 Tony nominations and 6 wins and ranks as the highest grossing musical of all time. Add it to your bucket list then go online and get your tickets now! Civic Theatre - San Diego, CA San Diego Union-Tribune Centennial Hall at the University of Arizona - Tucson, AZ Madi Lynn Kingsbury, The Daily Wildcat: The cast did amazing. The audience could feel the emotional connection between young Simba, played by Jordan Pendleton, and Mufasa, played by Gerald Ramsey. Their father-son relationship is playful, yet Mufasa is very protective over Simba. Zazu, played by Jürgen Hooper, Timon and Pumbaa, played by Tony Freeman and John E. Brady, respectively, drew lots of laughter from the crowd. Their playful banter with the other actors was simply hilarious. Rafiki, played by Gugwana Dlamini, added the comedic relief as well as the heartfelt messages throughout the show. George S. and Dolores Dore Eccles Theatre - Salt Lake City, Ut Tyler Hinton, BroadwayWorld: Enough cannot be said about the unique, mesmerizing experience that unfolds due to the scenic design by Richard Hudson, costume design by Julie Taymor, lighting design by Donald Holder, mask and puppet design by Julie Taymor and Michael Curry, hair and makeup design by Michael Ward, and choreography by Garth Fagan. Nancy Van Valkenburg, Gephardt Daily: The musical is renowned not only for its music, but for its vividly colored and innovative costumes, masks, and clever puppetry. Julie Taymor is the talent behind the original production and served as the director, costume designer and, with Michael Curry, as mask and puppet designer. Scott Renshaw, Salt Lake City Weekly: Julie Taymor's stage adaptation of the 1994 Disney animated hit is itself 25 years old by now, so the particulars of how she visualizes the narrative-still a loose interpretation of Hamlet, with the young lion Simba (played as a youth during this performance by Jaylen Lyndon Hunter, and as an adult by Darian Sanders) dealing with the death of his father Mufasa (Gerald Ramsey) and the usurpation of the throne by his uncle Scar (Spencer Plachy)-might already be familiar in theory to theater-goers. From elaborate headdresses to puppets, from shadow-play to birds spun overhead on wires, animal characters are brought to life in every conceivable way. And nearly every one of those ways contributes a sense of mystery, majesty and emotion distinct from the playfulness of the source-material, while still remaining family-friendly. Saenger Theatre - New Orleans, LA Brad Rhines, NOLA.com Cadillac Palace Theatre - Chicago, IL Chicago Tribune Sheri Flanders, Chicago Sun-Times: Like the 1994 animated Disney masterpiece, the play opens with the song \"The Circle of Life/Nants' Ingonyama,\" which won a Grammy for best arrangement, instrumentals and vocals. The music alone (sung exceptionally by Gugwana Dlamini as Rafiki) is enough to bring tears to your eyes, but when paired with puppets by Julie Taymor and director Michael Curry that mimic animals crossing the plains; giraffes, elephants, antelope, birds .... it's breathtaking. The audience gasped audibly multiple times, amazed at the sheer artistry on display. Marni Pyke, Daily Herald: A strong Broadway in Chicago cast spins a sizzling Lion King from Ramsey's gravitas to the feistiness of Jaylen Lyndon Hunter, one of two actors playing young Simba. As the adult Simba, Darian Sanders grabs control of the narrative the minute he swings onto stage. He conveys the pain and self-doubt racking the character, but balances it with that sense of humor that makes Simba arguably Disney's best hero. Civic Center Of Greater Des Moines - Des Moines, IA DC Felton, BroadwayWorld: What makes \"The Lion King\" a continued success comes from one name, Julie Taymor. Her vision and fingerprints are seen in multiple places during the show, from directing to costumes and her work with Michael Curry on puppetry. Walking into the theatre, I always look forward to the show's opening, which alone is worth the ticket price. This time, I could focus on all the different puppetry styles throughout the show. Each one, from shadow puppet to rod puppet, hand puppet to full body puppet, comes together to tell the beautiful story we see onstage. When the puppetry, blocking, and Garth Fagan's amazing choreography comes together, it's one of my favorite moments of theatre. Overture Center - Madison, WI Sydney Vasquez, The Cap Times: The costume and set designs are just as important to the story as the plot itself. Each animal that roams the stage is constructed and depicted differently. The birds are vaulted into the air as high-tech kites. Those who play giraffes are almost unrecognizable as people, as they're cradled within their costumes and vaulted by stilts. Gazelles are placed on the spokes of a rigged bicycle to mimic their frolic. Kennedy Center - Washington, DC Jake Bridges, BroadwayWorld: The most recent touring production of THE LION KING, now playing at The Kennedy Center until July 29th, somehow accomplishes both. The story, songs, and characters are well known, timeless, and familiar, of course. What I did not expect was that, after so many years, I would still be captivated by the exquisite puppetry, beautiful costumes, and towering scenery that are still arguably director Julie Taymor’s, and so many others, finest work. I knew what was coming, and I was still in awe of these impressive technical achievements on stage. Judging by the positive reactions of my fellow audience members, I was not alone in these sentiments. It’s a testament to just how groundbreaking the artistry of the show was and still is. The show premiered in 1997 and yet it still inspired the “oos” and “ahs” of nearly all the patrons in the Kennedy Center’s cavernous Opera House this past Friday.  Susan Brall, MD Theatre Guide: “The Lion King” lives up to the hype, even after almost twenty-five years. You could see it on the faces of the children many of whom were barely past toddler age. They, like the rest of us, were totally enchanted. “The Lion King” remains a wonderful musical for children and for those of us who are still children at heart. Proctor's Theatre - Schenectady, NY Bill Kellert, Nippertown:  The lion king, Mufasa, was performed with great heart by Gerald Ramsey, his evil brother Scar was William John Austin, whose deep mellifluous tones filled the vast theater. Nick LaMedica hysterically played Zazu, the young Simba’s nanny and Mufasa’s council. Tony Freeman and Robbie Swift portrayed the thoroughly delightful Timon and Pumbaa, the meerkat, and the warthog. Darian Sanders took on the role of the adult Simba with youthful exuberance and another wonderfully powerful voice. The ensemble singers and dancers matched note for note and step for step, the excellent performances of the entire cast of characters. Popejoy Hall - Albuquerque, NM Adrian Gomez, Albuquerque Journal:  Twenty-six years since its debut, the tour is a well-oiled machine, with a cast and crew that is chock-full of talent. To be part of the tour equals excellence – as every note was hit and every stage cue met. Segerstrom Center for the Arts - Costa Mesa, CA Michael Quintos, BroadwayWorld: Even today, nearly three decades later, the show remains a remarkable achievement in the high-reaching possibilities of what live theater (with a robust corporate-funded budget) can do: combining gorgeous artistry and smart, creative design with popular, mass-appealing, well-executed elements (something Disney knows how to handle with their films and theme parks), all spearheaded by its chief creative mastermind Julie Taymor, a director notable for her visual acumen in both the theatrical and cinematic mediums. Her ingenious efforts to transform a \"kids' movie\" into a genuinely artistic, culturally expansive stage show that all ages and demographics can appreciate helped score Tony Awards for herself as a Director and Costume Designer and the show itself for Best Musical. Maverick Bohn, SoCal Thrills: The Lion King was able to deliver something fresh, fun, and surprising, yet something also familiar and timeless, paving a path to that very first viewing and bringing me right back to that seat all those years ago. Twenty years felt like twenty seconds, and without a doubt left me in awe to the very end. Orpheum Theatre Minneapolis - Minneapolis, MN Jared Fessler, BroadwayWorld: The cast's talent is nothing short of extraordinary. Mukelisiwe Goba's portrayal of Rafiki commands attention, particularly during the powerful opening of \"Circle of Life.\" Gerald Ramsey's deep, resonant voice brings authority to the role of Mufasa, and his rendition of \"He Lives In You\" is simply stunning. Aniya Simone and Julian Villela shine as Young Nala and young Simba, respectively, infusing energy and charm into \"I Just Can't Wait to Be King.\" Peter Hargrave's portrayal of Scar exudes villainy, showcasing both his vocal prowess and acting prowess. Nick LaMedica's Zazu adds a delightful touch of humor, while Nick Cordileone and William John Austin bring Timon and Pumbaa to life with infectious chemistry and liveliness. Forest VanDyke, Martina Sykes, and Robbie Swift excel as the hyenas, their camaraderie evident in their performances. Darian Sanders and Khalifa White deliver captivating performances as Simba and Nala, their chemistry shining through in poignant moments such as \"Shadowland\" and \"Endless Nights.\" Ohio Theatre - Columbus, OH Paul Batterson, BroadwayWorld: THE LION KING’s opening number of “Nants Ingonyama” and “The Circle of Life” is perhaps one of the most breathtaking beginnings to a musical I have ever seen.  As Rafiki, Goba’s voice pierces the darkness to call the animals to Pride Rock for the announcement of the birth of Simba. She is complimented by percussionists Stefan Monssen and Reuven Weizberg on either side of the stage while actors portraying birds join the refrain from the box seats above the stage. Slowly a parade of animals converge with a pair of elephants walking down the side aisles of the theater while panthers and gazelles join the masses coming in from stage left and right. Taymor’s costumes accent a wide variety of animals with a bicycle being used to show the galloping of the gazelles. There were some misfires here and there. Standing behind Pumbaa to conduct his movement, Cordileone is clad in a shiny green suit that makes him look like a miniature version of the Jolly Green Giant, sans the vegetables. Hobby Center for the Performing Arts - Houston, TX Brett Cullum, BroadwayWorld:  It is a juggernaut, a crowd-pleaser, and now a staple of musical theatre. It has mind-blowing practical puppets, songs everyone knows by heart, and a sense of pageantry that represents what is best about seeing theater live in front of you. It expanded the cartoon version to include representations of ballet, African dancing, and a sense of filling any space it comes to. The stage does not bind the performers, and the show remains an immersive experience like no other. The Texas Tasty: From the moment the curtain rose, the production’s visual grandeur was evident. The intricate puppetry and stunning costumes, designed by the visionary Julie Taymor, brought the African savanna to life in a way that felt both authentic and magical. The life-sized elephant marching down the aisle and the graceful giraffes towering over the stage were highlights that drew gasps of amazement from the audience. Blumenthal Performing Arts Center: Belk Theater - Charlotte, NC Madeline Holly-Carothers, Q City Metro: As the musical’s opening number, it really sets the tone for the entire show and helps “The Lion King” immediately stand out from other productions I’ve seen by utilizing the entire theater, making it a more immersive experience. Peace Center - Greenville, SC Richard Whiting, Index-Journal Fox Theatre - Atlanta, GA Emma Loggins, Fanbolt:  The sheer scale and level of detail in this production are nothing short of breathtaking, reminding fans why The Lion King has cemented its status as a true Broadway masterpiece. National Arts Centre - Ottawa, ON Courtney Castelino, BroadwayWorld:  It is easy to see why it continues to be so successful, thirty years after the release of the animated film upon which it is based. A classic tale of good versus evil, the story also relays the importance of family and the interconnectedness of all life on Earth. Samara Caplan and Laura Gauthier, APT613: The score features songs by Elton John and Tim Rice from the original animated film, as well as three new songs for the stage production, with additional musical material by South African Lebo M, Mark Mancina, Jay Rifkin, Julie Taymor and Hans Zimmer. Musicians play over 80 different instruments from all over the world which enhances the story and contributes to the blend of Western and African sounds. With one of the most iconic Disney villain songs in Be Prepared and the Oscar-winning love song Can You Feel the Love Tonight, you will be drawn into each song from beginning to end. Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts - Hartford, CT Nancy Sasso Janis, Patch: Peter Hargrave, who has performed on the Disney Cruise Line, is the delicious villain Scar, nailing the classic comedic lines of his character. Darnell Abraham (Washington in “Hamilton” tours) has a great singing voice that he shows off as the king, Mufasa.  Lisa Covi, Berkshire On Stage: On stage at The Bushnell, the production hits hard and fast at the beginning with the score by Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and others that have a vibe between Graceland and Zulu chant. The stylish scenery is simple and evocative, incorporating cast members as grasslands and scrim to project upon. The elephants in the room (along with lions, gazelles, and hyenas) are large hybrid costume/props that resemble puppets the performers inhabit. The distinctiveness of this particular show is the way that the cast performs the drama and music in a physical style using these mechanical devices. The effects blend lighting and music to consistently awe the audience. Christopher Arnott, Hartford Courant Shea's Performing Arts Center - Buffalo, NY Peter Hall, Buffalo Rising: The puppets were stunning, of course, and as fascinating as I remembered them, but I swear the costumes were brighter than ever. Trust me, even if you’ve seen the original 1994 animated film, or the 2019 live-action remake, or a previous stage production, this touring production proves that THE LION KING hasn’t lost any of its magic over the years.  If anything, its themes of responsibility, redemption, friendship, and love, resonate more strongly than ever in 2024. With performers of such high caliber bringing these beloved characters to life in a musical that, as I mentioned, won six Tony awards, including “Best Musical,” even though it’s a reviewer’s cliche, this really is a “must-see.” Fox Cities Performing Arts Center - Appleton, WI Jarrod Michael, BroadwayWorld: One of the most captivating aspects of The Lion King is its rich celebration of African culture, brought to life through its music, movement, and visual storytelling. The ensemble, with their vibrant costumes and dynamic choreography, embodied the heartbeat of the savannah, seamlessly blending traditional African rhythms with theatrical precision.  Kelli Arseneau, Post Crescent: Sejosingoe may have given the standout performance of the night. Rafiki, often played by a woman in the musical, is a sort of shaman for the Pride Lands, acting as an intermediary between the living and the spiritual world. The character, who is supposed to be a mandrill — but has a rather ambiguous costume design — is also a narrator for the show, though she rarely speaks in English. Hippodrome Theatre - Baltimore, MD Constance Beulah, DC Theater Arts: Adapted from the book of the same name written by Roger Allers and Irene Mecchi, this musical doesn’t just come to life; it gives you life. From the very first note, you begin an astounding journey to Pride Rock in the most amazing way. Do yourself a favor and go ahead and spring for the orchestra seating. It’s well worth it. Broward Center For The Performing Arts - Fort Lauderdale, FL Rob Stafford Hagwood, Sun Sentinel: Comported with that Disney discipline (we all know it when we see it), the production is visually stunning enough to keep toddlers to the timeworn engaged for two and a half hours including a 15 minute intermission. Straz Center - Tampa, FL Deborah Bostock-Kelley, BroadwayWorld: Vocally, the show is a powerhouse. Rafiki (Mukelisiwe Goba) is a force with vocals that soar effortlessly, filling the theater with soulful energy. Her role as narrator and spiritual guide is sung with such depth and clarity it gives the show its heart. Meanwhile, Zazu, Pumbaa, and Timon balance comic relief and musical precision perfectly. With voices so close to the original Disney film, you'd swear they'd been lifted right off the animation cells. The cast and ensemble deliver throughout, layering harmonies, chants, and percussive sounds into a musical landscape that feels rich and immersive. Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts - Orlando, FL Albert Gutierrez, BroadwayWorld: And yet, as I said before, watching this all unfold in a theatre is a vitally different and superior experience to watching the film. One reason that the stage version feels like a wholly superior experience can be found in its approach of blending different cultures into one cohesive experience for the audience. Music Hall at Fair Park - Dallas, TX Manuel Mendoza, KERA News: An elephant tromping toward the stage is not something you see every day. Slinking giraffes either. Never has a show contained so much verticality. This ever-morphing menagerie manipulated by actors who also voice the characters almost constantly fills the theater, top to bottom, side to side. Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium - Calgary Louis B. Hobson, Calgary Herald: The Lion King, as originally conceived and designed by Julie Taymor, is a testament to what is possible in live theatre. She makes it clear by the way the actors wear their masks, headdresses and costumes that these are people, and that the story is decidedly human even though it is set in an animal kingdom. She is not only responsible for the staging, but for the design of the costumes, puppets and masks. Paramount Theatre - Seattle, WA Candice McMillan, Seattle's Child: Tony Award-winning director Julie Taymor co-designed the masks and puppets, which are the stars of this show. It would be a different experience if the lions were merely actors in furry, yellow cat suits. Instead, the performers and the costumes operate together in symbiotic harmony, highlighting the humanity of the story, without losing the wild beauty of the animal kingdom.",

<h2>Playhouse Square KeyBank State Theatre - Cleveland, OH</h2>

<p>Roy Berko, <a target="newwinddow" href="/cleveland/article/BWW-Review-THE-LION-KING-at-Key-Bank-State-TheatrePlayouse-Square-20211007">BroadwayWorld</a>: South African, Gugwana Diamini, who has appeared in both stage and film versions of <a target="newwinddow" href="/shows/The-Lion-King-10106.html">The Lion King</a>, shines as the storytelling Rafiki. <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Ben-Lipitz/">Ben Lipitz</a> (Pumbaa, the warthog) and <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Nick-Cordileone/">Nick Cordileone</a> (Timon, the meerkat) delight. Their &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot; is a show highlight. <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Darian-Sanders/">Darian Sanders</a> (Adult Simba) and <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Kayla-Cyphers/">Kayla Cyphers</a> (Adult Nala) have fine singing voices, but develop shallow characterizations.

<p>Mark Meszoros, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.news-herald.com/2021/10/06/not-the-finest-lion-king-to-visit-cleveland-but-playhouse-square-run-feels-special-for-obvious-reasons-theater-review/">News-Herald</a>: &quot;I Just Can&#39;t Wait to Be King&quot; - with Young Simba, <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Young-Nala/">Young Nala</a>, Zazu and the ensemble - is as infectious as ever, as is the aforementioned celebration of possessing no worries, &quot;Hakuna Matata.&quot; Disappointedly, though, when it comes to the performance of the late all-important &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight,&quot; it is, in fact, hard to feel the love. That said, &quot;The Lion King&quot; continues to pack its usual visual punch, letting you get lost in its vibrant colors - the burnt orange, the sky blue - of its scenic design (<a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Richard-Hudson/">Richard Hudson</a>) and be wowed yet again by its impactful lighting design (<a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Donald-Holder/">Donald Holder</a>), never more evident than during the sudden reveal of the enormous skeleton in the elephant graveyard.</p><!-- Ezoic - Article Insertion 2 - mid_content -->

<p>Howard Gollop, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://chroniclet.com/news/277497/theater-review-lion-king-returns-renewed-at-reopened-playhouse-square/">The Chronicle</a>: As the saying goes, absence makes the heart grow fonder, but there may be more to the enjoyability of this &quot;The Lion King&quot; than a slogan: The cast and crew of 2021&#39;s &quot;The Lion King&quot; seem to try harder - and the audience seems to clap harder as well.</p>

<p>Kerry Clawson, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/entertainment/arts/2021/10/07/joy-of-lion-king-brings-just-the-needed-jolt-to-theatergoers-at-playhouse-square/6020993001/">Akron Beacon Journal</a>: I was also struck by both the martial arts-evoking, warrior movements that actress <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Kayla-Cyphers/">Kayla Cyphers</a> executed as Nala steeled herself to find help for the dying Pridelands in &quot;Shadowland,&quot; contrasted later with the beautiful way she curved and nestled her head in her loving movements with <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Darian-Sanders/">Darian Sanders</a>&#39; Simba. Sanders, brand new to the Simba role, is likable with his bright persona and brilliant smile. But his vocals were too quiet and tearful for us to hear him for the first part of Simba&#39;s heartbreaking number &quot;Endless Night,&quot; with the actor taking too long to open up with his singing. Sanders showed off his powerful pipes later, in the inspiring &quot;He Lives in You,&quot; where Simba rediscovers his kingly self.</p><!-- Ezoic - Article Insertion 3 - long_content -->

<h2>Majestic Theatre - San Antonio, TX</h2>

<p>Bryan Stanton, <a target="newwinddow" href="/san-antonio/article/BWW-Review-THE-LION-KING-STAMPEDES-INTO-THE-MAJESTIC-at-Majestic-Theatre-20211027">BroadwayWorld</a>: Young Simba and <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Young-Nala/" target="newwinddow">Young Nala</a> played by <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Jaylen-Lyndon-Hunter/" target="newwinddow">Jaylen Lyndon Hunter</a> and <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Nia-Mulder/" target="newwinddow">Nia Mulder</a> were a dynamic duo that kept the audience on their toes as only two young cubs can. We laughed, we were scared for them, we rejoiced when they were free from danger, and we mourned with Hunter. These young actors connected, I&#39;m sure, with many parents in the audience who could see a tiny bit of their own children on the stage.</p>

<p>John Hanlon, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://930amtheanswer.com/content/entertainment-reviews/the-lion-king-review">930 AM The Answer</a>: In terms of the production itself, the look of the feature is magnificent. The computer animation helps bring the settings to life but the characters and dialogue never feel as genuine as it once did. Even though the images are more realistic, everything else feels less so. This is a reboot that can&#39;t escape from the shadow of its far superior predecessor. While other recently remakes (including Aladdin, Cinderella and the underrated Pete&#39;s Dragon) richly added new layers to their well-known stories, this version of The Lion King sadly never does.</p><!-- Ezoic - Article Insertion 4 - longer_content -->

Adults immediately become children and children gasp with wonder as giant puppets and beautifully costumed actors come from the audience and set the scene at Pride Rock. <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Gugwana-Dlamini/" target="newwinddow">Gugwana </a><a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Gugwana-Dlamini/" target="newwinddow">Dlamini</a>&#39;s first notes as Rafiki add to the magic, transporting us all back to our childhoods when we first saw that sunrise on our televisions.

<h2>Denver Center for the Performing Arts - Denver, CO</h2>

<p>Alex Miller, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.onstagecolorado.com/lion-king-returns-to-denver/">On Stage Colorado</a>: There&#39;s not much I can say about this show that most don&#39;t already know, but as a first-timer, I can confirm that this one lives up to the hype surrounding the No. 1 musical of all time (it surpassed <em>$8 billion</em> in revenue in 2017, per Wikipedia). Somehow, though, despite being a super high-end production and an earnings juggernaut, the production now in Denver still came across as warm, authentic and presented by a cast that truly enjoyed doing it (this despite some of the cast having done literally thousands of shows).</p><!-- Ezoic - Article Insertion 5 - longer_content -->

<h2>Detroit Opera House - Detroit, MI</h2>

This extends beyond the costumes and the choreography - the score and the singing is sure to give you chills. Some of these songs include the aforementioned &quot;Circle of Life,&quot; as well as &quot;They Live in You,&quot; the Oscar-winning tune &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight,&quot; &quot;Shadowland,&quot; &quot;Endless Night&quot; and &quot;He Lives in You (Reprise).&quot; On the other side of the spectrum, there are also songs that are there simply to make you smile, such as &quot;I Just Can&#39;t Wait to Be King&quot; and &quot;Hakuna Matata,&quot; two songs that were made famous by the original film.</p><!-- Ezoic - Article Insertion 6 - longer_content -->

<p>Gary Graff, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.theoaklandpress.com/2022/01/29/the-lion-king-offers-timeless-escape-at-detroit-opera-house/">The Oakland Press</a>: From the minute the house lights go down and the puppet animals - elephants, rhinos, etc. - parade down the center aisles, it feels like the return of old friends and we&#39;re transported directly to the African savanna as the blockbuster Disney film comes to theatrical life in characteristically awe-inspiring fashion. With its inventive staging, costuming, special effects and dancing (choreographed by onetime Detroiter Gawain Garth Fagan), &quot;The Lion King&quot; (running through Feb. 20 at the Detroit Opera House) has not aged at all in the 25 years since its debut, and its tale as old as time is welcome and comforting - a two-and-a-half-hour spirit of &quot;Hakuna Matata.&quot;</p>

<h2>Bass Concert Hall - Austin, TX</h2>

<p>Richard Whittaker, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/arts/2022-04-12/review-the-lion-king-roars-strong/">The Austin Chronicle</a>: First staged only three years after the release of the 1994 animated classic, <em>The Lion King</em> will always be seen as original director Julie Taymor&#39;s production. It&#39;s driven by her melding of the film&#39;s Broadway-friendly tunes and family-friendly plot with her fascination with the extreme potential of the stage, her experience with and research into differing global puppetry styles, and culturally respectful approach (since inception, <em>The Lion King</em> has always had a predominantly Black cast). Yet the book by the film&#39;s director Roger Allers and cowriter Irene Mecchi also plays a significant role in why the musical can run almost double the animated originator&#39;s length. The inherent themes are amplified, most especially Mustafa&#39;s frustrations with young Simba, and Simba&#39;s guilt at his father&#39;s loss.</p><!-- Ezoic - Article Insertion 7 - longer_content -->

This was at least my third time to see the musical, and I was still captivated when the mandrill Rafiki (the spirited Gugwana Diamini) called out &quot;Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba (roughly translated from Zulu as &quot;There comes a lion&quot;) to start the &quot;Circle of Life&quot; rolling.</p>

<p>Timothy Shawver, <a target="newwinddow" href="/phoenix/article/Review-THE-LION-KING-at-Gammage-Auditorium-20220711">BroadwayWorld</a>: It&#39;s the innovative, collaborative visuals Taymor has assembled from <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Richard-Hudson/" target="newwinddow">Richard Hudson</a>&#39;s scenic design, the lighting design by <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Donald-Holder/" target="newwinddow">Donald Holder</a>, hair and make up by <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Michael-Ward/" target="newwinddow">Michael Ward</a>, costumes by Taymor, and masks and puppets by Taymor and <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Michael-Curry/" target="newwinddow">Michael Curry</a>, that are responsible for that success. Their designs, rooted in traditional African and Asian storytelling like shadow puppetry and Bunraku, achieve visuals astonishing for their lack of modern tech. They&#39;re impressive for their simplicity; we can see the puppeteers inside the elephants. Ms. Taymor believes the best tech of all is in the viewer&#39;s imagination.</p><!-- Ezoic - Article Insertion 9 Mobile - incontent_6 -->

<p>Madi Lynn Kingsbury,<a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.wildcat.arizona.edu/article/2022/09/a-lion-king-review"> The Daily Wildcat</a>: The cast did amazing. The audience could feel the emotional connection between young Simba, played by Jordan Pendleton, and Mufasa, played by Gerald Ramsey. Their father-son relationship is playful, yet Mufasa is very protective over Simba. Zazu, played by J&uuml;rgen Hooper, Timon and Pumbaa, played by Tony Freeman and John E. Brady, respectively, drew lots of laughter from the crowd. Their playful banter with the other actors was simply hilarious. Rafiki, played by Gugwana Dlamini, added the comedic relief as well as the heartfelt messages throughout the show.</p>

<p>Nancy Van Valkenburg, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://gephardtdaily.com/local/review-the-lion-king-tour-brings-amazing-visuals-vitality-to-eccles-stage/">Gephardt Daily</a>: The musical is renowned not only for its music, but for its vividly colored and innovative costumes, masks, and clever puppetry. Julie Taymor is the talent behind the original production and served as the director, costume designer and, with Michael Curry, as mask and puppet designer.</p>

<p>Scott Renshaw, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.cityweekly.net/BuzzBlog/archives/2022/10/03/theater-review-the-lion-king-at-broadway-at-the-eccles">Salt Lake City Weekly</a>: Julie Taymor&#39;s stage adaptation of the 1994 Disney animated hit is itself 25 years old by now, so the particulars of how she visualizes the narrative-still a loose interpretation of Hamlet, with the young lion Simba (played as a youth during this performance by Jaylen Lyndon Hunter, and as an adult by Darian Sanders) dealing with the death of his father Mufasa (Gerald Ramsey) and the usurpation of the throne by his uncle Scar (Spencer Plachy)-might already be familiar in theory to theater-goers. From elaborate headdresses to puppets, from shadow-play to birds spun overhead on wires, animal characters are brought to life in every conceivable way. And nearly every one of those ways contributes a sense of mystery, majesty and emotion distinct from the playfulness of the source-material, while still remaining family-friendly.</p><!-- Ezoic - Article Insertion 12 Mobile - incontent_9 -->

<p>Sheri Flanders, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/11/20/23469505/lion-king-review-chicago-cadillac-palace-disney-musical-gugwana-dlamini-peter-hargrave">Chicago Sun-Times</a>: Like the 1994 animated Disney masterpiece, the play opens with the song &quot;The Circle of Life/Nants&#39; Ingonyama,&quot; which won a Grammy for best arrangement, instrumentals and vocals. The music alone (sung exceptionally by Gugwana Dlamini as Rafiki) is enough to bring tears to your eyes, but when paired with puppets by Julie Taymor and director Michael Curry that mimic animals crossing the plains; giraffes, elephants, antelope, birds .... it&#39;s breathtaking. The audience gasped audibly multiple times, amazed at the sheer artistry on display.</p>

<p>Marni Pyke, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.dailyherald.com/entlife/20221121/the-pride-of-broadway-returns-with-purrfect-the-lion-king">Daily Herald</a>: A strong Broadway in Chicago cast spins a sizzling Lion King from Ramsey&#39;s gravitas to the feistiness of Jaylen Lyndon Hunter, one of two actors playing young Simba. As the adult Simba, Darian Sanders grabs control of the narrative the minute he swings onto stage. He conveys the pain and self-doubt racking the character, but balances it with that sense of humor that makes Simba arguably Disney&#39;s best hero.</p>

<h2>Civic Center Of Greater Des Moines - Des Moines, IA</h2>

<p>DC Felton, <a target="newwinddow" href="/des-moines/article/Review-THE-LION-KING-at-Des-Moines-Performing-Arts-20230403">BroadwayWorld</a>: What makes &quot;The Lion King&quot; a continued success comes from one name, <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Julie-Taymor/" target="newwinddow">Julie Taymor</a>. Her vision and fingerprints are seen in multiple places during the show, from directing to costumes and her work with <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Michael-Curry/" target="newwinddow">Michael Curry</a> on puppetry. Walking into the theatre, I always look forward to the show&#39;s opening, which alone is worth the ticket price. This time, I could focus on all the different puppetry styles throughout the show. Each one, from shadow puppet to rod puppet, hand puppet to full body puppet, comes together to tell the beautiful story we see onstage. When the puppetry, blocking, and <a target="newwinddow" href="/people/Garth-Fagan/" target="newwinddow">Garth Fagan</a>&#39;s amazing choreography comes together, it&#39;s one of my favorite moments of theatre.</p>

Each animal that roams the stage is constructed and depicted differently. The birds are vaulted into the air as high-tech kites. Those who play giraffes are almost unrecognizable as people, as they&#39;re cradled within their costumes and vaulted by stilts. Gazelles are placed on the spokes of a rigged bicycle to mimic their frolic.</p>

<h2>Kennedy Center - Washington, DC</h2>

<p>Jake Bridges, <a target="newwinddow" href="/washington-dc/article/Review-THE-LION-KING-at-The-Kennedy-Center-20230626">BroadwayWorld</a>:&nbsp;The most recent touring production of&nbsp;THE LION KING, now playing at The Kennedy Center until July 29th, somehow accomplishes both. The story, songs, and characters are well known, timeless, and familiar, of course. What I did not expect was that, after so many years, I would still be captivated by the exquisite puppetry, beautiful costumes, and towering scenery that are still arguably director&nbsp;Julie Taymor&rsquo;s, and so many others, finest work. I knew what was coming, and I was still in awe of these impressive technical achievements on stage. Judging by the positive reactions of my fellow audience members, I was not alone in these sentiments. It&rsquo;s a testament to just how groundbreaking the artistry of the show was and still is. The show premiered in 1997 and yet it still inspired the &ldquo;oos&rdquo; and &ldquo;ahs&rdquo; of nearly all the patrons in the Kennedy Center&rsquo;s cavernous Opera House this past Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Susan Brall, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://mdtheatreguide.com/2023/06/theatre-review-disney-presents-the-lion-king-at-kennedy-center/">MD Theatre Guide</a>:&nbsp;&ldquo;The Lion King&rdquo; lives up to the hype, even after almost twenty-five years. You could see it on the faces of the children many of whom were barely past toddler age. They, like the rest of us, were totally enchanted. &ldquo;The Lion King&rdquo; remains a wonderful musical for children and for those of us who are still children at heart.</p>

Nick LaMedica hysterically played Zazu, the young Simba&rsquo;s nanny and Mufasa&rsquo;s council. Tony Freeman and Robbie Swift portrayed the thoroughly delightful Timon and Pumbaa, the meerkat, and the warthog. Darian Sanders took on the role of the adult Simba with youthful exuberance and another wonderfully powerful voice. The ensemble singers and dancers matched note for note and step for step, the excellent performances of the entire cast of characters.</p>

Her ingenious efforts to transform a &quot;kids&#39; movie&quot; into a genuinely artistic, culturally expansive stage show that all ages and demographics can appreciate helped score Tony Awards for herself as a Director and Costume Designer and the show itself for Best Musical.</p>

<p>Maverick Bohn, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://socalthrills.com/lion-king-returns/">SoCal Thrills</a>:&nbsp;The Lion King&nbsp;was able to deliver something fresh, fun, and surprising, yet something also familiar and timeless, paving a path to that very first viewing and bringing me right back to that seat all those years ago. Twenty years felt like twenty seconds, and without a doubt left me in awe to the very end.</p>

<h2>Ohio Theatre - Columbus, OH</h2>

<p>Paul Batterson, <a target="newwinddow" href="/columbus/article/Review-THE-LION-KING-at-Ohio-Theatre-20240616">BroadwayWorld</a>:&nbsp;THE LION KING&rsquo;s opening number of &ldquo;Nants Ingonyama&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Circle of Life&rdquo; is perhaps one of the most breathtaking beginnings to a musical I have ever seen.&nbsp; As Rafiki, Goba&rsquo;s voice pierces the darkness to call the animals to Pride Rock for the announcement of the birth of Simba. She is complimented by percussionists Stefan Monssen and Reuven Weizberg on either side of the stage while actors portraying birds join the refrain from the box seats above the stage. Slowly a parade of animals converge with a pair of elephants walking down the side aisles of the theater while panthers and gazelles join the masses coming in from stage left and right. Taymor&rsquo;s costumes accent a wide variety of animals with a bicycle being used to show the galloping of the gazelles. There were some misfires here and there. Standing behind Pumbaa to conduct his movement, Cordileone is clad in a shiny green suit that makes him look like a miniature version of the Jolly Green Giant, sans the vegetables.</p>

<h2>Hobby Center for the Performing Arts - Houston, TX</h2>

<p>Brett Cullum, <a target="newwinddow" href="/houston/article/Review-DISNEYS-THE-LION-KING-at-Hobby-Center-for-the-Performing-Arts-20240713">BroadwayWorld</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a juggernaut, a crowd-pleaser, and now a staple of musical theatre. It has mind-blowing practical puppets, songs everyone knows by heart, and a sense of pageantry that represents what is best about seeing theater live in front of you. It expanded the cartoon version to include representations of ballet, African dancing, and a sense of filling any space it comes to. The stage does not bind the performers, and the show remains an immersive experience like no other.</p>

<p><a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.thetexastasty.com/around-town/review-the-lion-king-roars-to-life-in-houston/">The Texas Tasty:</a>&nbsp;From the moment the curtain rose, the production&rsquo;s visual grandeur was evident. The intricate puppetry and stunning costumes, designed by the visionary Julie Taymor, brought the African savanna to life in a way that felt both authentic and magical. The life-sized elephant marching down the aisle and the graceful giraffes towering over the stage were highlights that drew gasps of amazement from the audience.</p>

<p>Courtney Castelino, <a target="newwinddow" href="/ottawa/article/Review-DISNEYS-THE-LION-KING-at-National-Arts-Centre-20241026">BroadwayWorld</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to see why it continues to be so successful, thirty years after the release of the animated film upon which it is based. A classic tale of good versus evil, the story also relays the importance of family and the interconnectedness of all life on Earth.</p>

<p>Samara Caplan&nbsp;and&nbsp;Laura Gauthier, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://apt613.ca/review-the-lion-king-at-the-nac-until-november-10/">APT613</a>:&nbsp;The score features songs by Elton John and Tim Rice from the original animated film, as well as three new songs for the stage production, with additional musical material by South African Lebo M, Mark Mancina, Jay Rifkin, Julie Taymor and Hans Zimmer. Musicians play over 80 different instruments from all over the world which enhances the story and contributes to the blend of Western and African sounds. With one of the most iconic Disney villain songs in&nbsp;Be Prepared&nbsp;and the Oscar-winning love song&nbsp;Can You Feel the Love Tonight, you will be drawn into each song from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Nancy Sasso Janis, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://patch.com/connecticut/hartford/theater-review-disneys-lion-king-tour-bushnell">Patch</a>:&nbsp;Peter Hargrave, who has performed on the Disney Cruise Line, is the delicious villain Scar, nailing the classic comedic lines of his character. Darnell Abraham (Washington in &ldquo;Hamilton&rdquo; tours) has a great singing voice that he shows off as the king, Mufasa.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Lisa Covi, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://berkshireonstage.blog/2024/11/16/review-the-lion-king-at-the-bushnell/">Berkshire On Stage</a>:&nbsp;On stage at&nbsp;<a target="newwinddow" href="https://bushnell.org/">The Bushnell</a>, the production hits hard and fast at the beginning with the score by Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and others that have a vibe between Graceland and Zulu chant. The stylish scenery is simple and evocative, incorporating cast members as grasslands and scrim to project upon. The elephants in the room (along with lions, gazelles, and hyenas) are large hybrid costume/props that resemble puppets the performers inhabit. The distinctiveness of this particular show is the way that the cast performs the drama and music in a physical style using these mechanical devices. The effects blend lighting and music to consistently awe the audience.</p>

Trust me, even if you&rsquo;ve seen the original 1994 animated film, or the 2019 live-action remake, or a previous stage production, this touring production proves that THE LION KING hasn&rsquo;t lost any of its magic over the years.&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything, its themes of responsibility, redemption, friendship, and love, resonate more strongly than ever in 2024. With performers of such high caliber bringing these beloved characters to life in a musical that, as I mentioned, won six Tony awards, including &ldquo;Best Musical,&rdquo; even though it&rsquo;s a reviewer&rsquo;s cliche, this really is a &ldquo;must-see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jarrod Michael, <a target="newwinddow" href="/appleton/article/Review-THE-LION-KING-at-Fox-Cities-Performing-Arts-Center-20250111">BroadwayWorld</a>:&nbsp;One of the most captivating aspects of&nbsp;The Lion King&nbsp;is its rich celebration of African culture, brought to life through its music, movement, and visual storytelling. The ensemble, with their vibrant costumes and dynamic choreography, embodied the heartbeat of the savannah, seamlessly blending traditional African rhythms with theatrical precision.&nbsp;</p>

Rafiki, often played by a woman in the musical, is a sort of shaman for the Pride Lands, acting as an intermediary between the living and the spiritual world. The character, who is supposed to be a mandrill &mdash; but has a rather ambiguous costume design &mdash; is also a narrator for the show, though she rarely speaks in English.</p>

From the very first note, you begin an astounding journey to Pride Rock in the most amazing way. Do yourself a favor and go ahead and spring for the orchestra seating. It&rsquo;s well worth it.</p>

<p>Deborah Bostock-Kelley, <a target="newwinddow" href="/tampa/article/Review-DISNEYS-THE-LION-KING-at-the-Straz-Center-20250407">BroadwayWorld</a>:&nbsp;Vocally, the show is a powerhouse. Rafiki (Mukelisiwe Goba) is a force with vocals that soar effortlessly, filling the theater with soulful energy. Her role as narrator and spiritual guide is sung with such depth and clarity it gives the show its heart. Meanwhile, Zazu, Pumbaa, and Timon balance comic relief and musical precision perfectly. With voices so close to the original Disney film, you&#39;d swear they&#39;d been lifted right off the animation cells. The cast and ensemble deliver throughout, layering harmonies, chants, and percussive sounds into a musical landscape that feels rich and immersive.</p>

One reason that the stage version feels like a wholly superior experience can be found in its approach of blending different cultures into one cohesive experience for the audience.</p>

<h2>Music Hall at Fair Park - Dallas, TX</h2>

<p>Manuel Mendoza,&nbsp;<a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.keranews.org/arts-culture/2025-06-11/broadway-dallas-lion-king-review">KERA News</a>:&nbsp;An elephant tromping toward the stage is not something you see every day. Slinking giraffes either. Never has a show contained so much verticality. This ever-morphing menagerie manipulated by actors who also voice the characters almost constantly fills the theater, top to bottom, side to side.</p>

<h2>Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium - Calgary</h2>

<p>Louis B. Hobson, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/theatre/review-the-lion-king-a-majestic-show-for-the-child-in-all-of-us">Calgary Herald</a>: The Lion King, as originally conceived and designed by Julie Taymor, is a testament to what is possible in live theatre. She makes it clear by the way the actors wear their masks, headdresses and costumes that these are people, and that the story is decidedly human even though it is set in an animal kingdom. She is not only responsible for the staging, but for the design of the costumes, puppets and masks.</p>

<h2>Paramount Theatre - Seattle, WA</h2>

<div class="nobreak"><p>Candice McMillan, <a target="newwinddow" href="https://www.seattleschild.com/the-lion-king-seattle-paramount-review/">Seattle&#39;s Child</a>:&nbsp;Tony Award-winning director Julie Taymor co-designed the masks and puppets, which are the stars of this show. It would be a different experience if the lions were merely actors in furry, yellow cat suits. Instead, the performers and the costumes operate together in symbiotic harmony, highlighting the humanity of the story, without losing the wild beauty of the animal kingdom.</p></div>
