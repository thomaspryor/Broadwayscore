Photo credit: Marc Brenner</figcaption></figure>\n<p>British director Jamie Lloyd really, really wants you to know that he’s responsible for the staging of the new revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s 1993 musical <em>Sunset Boulevard</em>, newly arrived on Broadway after a hit London engagement. The production by “The Jamie Lloyd Company” features both opening and post-performance credits unspooled on a giant screen. And in one of the show’s many meta-theatrical touches, a coffee mug emblazoned with the company’s logo is prominently displayed. Forget directing: what Lloyd is really a master of is self-promotional branding.</p>\n<p>The production starring former Pussycat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger is bound to prove divisive, with purists howling at the radically stylized, minimalist reinterpretation and others likely to be thrilled by the undeniably striking, full-throttle staging. This critic is firmly in the former camp, even while admitting that the show is wildly entertaining on its own bizarre terms. Revise your expectations accordingly and you’ll have a good time, as long as you don’t expect to actually see, you know, <em>Sunset Boulevard</em>.</p>\n<p>Indeed, those unfamiliar with the musical or Billy Wilder’s classic 1950 film starring Gloria Swanson are likely to be confused by this version which renders the noir-like narrative in, to say the least, abstract terms. Although an opening graphic informs us that the setting is 1949, most of the ensemble wear athletic leisurewear as if fitting in the performance between workout sessions. Unlike the massive sets of the original production which depicted, among other things, former movie star Norma Desmond’s baroque Hollywood mansion, Soutra Gilmour’s set design consists of little more than the occasional chair. (Not that you’ll be able to even see those considering how much stage fog is unleashed.)</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/10/20/sunset-blvd-nicole-scherzinger-is-norma-desmond-in-glorious-black-and-white/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>And don’t even try to figure out the timeline: Scherzinger, at age 46, seems much too young for the role (I know, Swanson was only a few years older, but still), and seems roughly the same age as David Thaxton, who plays her loyal manservant and (spoiler alert) former director Max Von Mayerling. And unlike the grotesque pairing of Swanson and William Holden in the film, the romance between her and young screenwriter Joe Gillis (Tom Francis, who won an Olivier Award for his performance) seems all too natural, especially with the lithe Scherzinger parading around the stage clad only in a black slip.</p>\n<p>Like his fellow iconoclastic director Ivo van Hove, Lloyd loves incorporating filmed elements into his productions, with this staging featuring so many video segments, projected on that aforementioned giant screen, that it’s surprising the concession stand doesn’t sell popcorn. Now, with <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> it makes a certain kind of sense considering the subject matter and milieu. But as usual Lloyd drives the concept into the ground (literally, during a car race sequence featuring a giant close-up of Francis’ sweaty face) and Scherzinger playing so much to the camera that the whole show might as well be on TikTok. You wonder why Lloyd insists on working in the theater if what he really wants to be, like all of us, a movie director.</p>\n<p>The staging reveals Lloyd working hard, oh so hard, to impress us with his ingenuity, including his by-now familiar schtick of having the performers address their dialogue not to each other but directly to the audience. That “Hey, I’m directing here!” approach is most strikingly demonstrated in the title number in which we first see live video footage of Francis walking around backstage as his fellow castmates engage in such behavior as discreetly snorting coke, posing with a life-size cut-out of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and, in Scherzinger’s case, writing the phrase “Mad About the Boy” in red lipstick on her dressing room mirror. Then he walks out of the theater onto 44<sup>th</sup> Street and dramatically performs the song, surrounded by menacing looking bodyguards and NYPD officers (your tax dollars at work!) as New Yorkers and tourists whip out their cell phones to film the bizarre spectacle. It’s an impressive feat of logistics and an undeniable <em>coup de théâtre,</em> but what the hell it has to do with <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> is anybody’s guess. But then, the same can be said about most of the proceedings.</p>\n<p>All of that said, the evening is certainly not boring. You can’t take your eyes off Scherzinger, miscast as she is, even if her performance at times makes kabuki theater look subtle. She plays nearly every scene like Swanson’s climactic “I’m ready for my close-up” moment in the film, and though the overall effect ultimately proves exhausting (for both performer and audience) she’s hypnotic from first moment to last. And she sings the hell out of the two showstoppers “With One Look” and “As If We Never Said Goodbye,” even with their tempos slowed down to a dirge.</p>\n<p>Francis, whose hunkiness is demonstrated by his frequently stripping down to black boxer briefs, delivers a solid supporting turn even if he’s been directed to recite his dialogue in as much of a monotone as possible. Thaxton proves a compellingly menacing Max, albeit one who frequently gets laughs with his deadpan facial expressions and line readings, while Grace Hodgett Young makes for a charming Betty Schaefer even if her role in this revised rendition doesn’t really make any sense.</p>\n<p>The show, which has cut a few of the numbers and features rewritten lyrics to others, is so relentlessly iconoclastic that it seems to exist only its own rarified universe. Evaluating it as a production of <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> seems beside the point, since Lloyd only seems concerned with the material insofar as he can put his own stamp on it.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Sunset Blvd. opened October 20, 2024 at the St. James Theatre.

When he takes one on, which he regularly does with great eagerness (most recently here: <em>A Doll’s House</em>,<em> Cyrano de Bergerac</em>,<em> Betrayal</em>), he presents it devoid of anything approximating a traditional set. His impulse is to stress the material, minus the (distracting?) enhancement that furnishings bring. He retains only the essentials. Perhaps for obvious reasons, he doesn’t eliminate lights and sound.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He’s done it again with the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Don Black-Christopher Hampton musical <em>Sunset Boulevard</em>, based, of course, on Billy Wilder’s 1950 film of the same name. Customers playing plenty for tickets, will find that this <em>Sunset Blvd. </em>lacks, among other glittering aspects, anything like a grand staircase, though it does feature Jack Knowles’ carefully concentrated lights and Adam Fisher’s imposing sound.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result—which gloriously stars Nicole Scherzinger as fading silent-screen idol Norma Desmond—is unique. In my view, nothing quite like it has ever previously been seen on a Broadway stage or, recently, a West End stage. And whether that’s unadulterated praise remains a question. The immediate answer is weighted toward the positive, since this time waving his revival wand, Lloyd is not merely reducing the film and the musical to its basics but is after a larger point about making black-and-white films.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/10/20/sunset-blvd-take-a-walk-on-the-stylized-side/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On previous revivals, he had set-and-costumes designer Soutra Gilmour keep whatever cast is at work in black and white. He does so again here—all black—but this outing she’s pointedly remaining true to the black-and-white screen where, despite the actual color range, the wardrobe only appears black, white, and shades of gray. (For this <em>Sunset Blvd. </em>red eventually appears, but detailing when, where, and why amounts to a spoiler.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This time Lloyd’s black is very deliberately commenting on the finished quality of movies. Once they’re wrapped and printed, that’s it. They’re frozen in time. Lloyd enlarges this irreversible truth by using constant onstage videoing to remind spectators that the actors are regularly, if not always, facing cameras—the images then seen on an upstage screen—as if they were filming. (Nathan Amzi and Joe Ransom are the busy-busy video and cinematography designers.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> the movie, Gloria Swanson unforgettably tells C. B. DeMille she’s ready for her close-up. In <em>Sunset Blvd. </em>all the focal characters are repeatedly ready for their close-ups, so much so that when Norma outright says she’s ready for hers in the unforgettable finale, Wilder’s cathartic edge is slightly diminished.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lloyd’s determination to demonstrate that Norma is giving a screen performance is primarily focused on Scherzinger. It’s as if her every expression, her every gesture is calculated. The impression is that at every performance—she’s already played it many times in London where she won an Olivier award—she plays it exactly as she has every previous performance and will every subsequent performance. The strategy is possibly most apparent in her interpretation of the beloved anthems “With One Look” and “As If We Never Said Goodbye.” Her attack on each note, her every movement is so precise, it’s as if this is, as with movies, the take meant for posterity.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audience is watching her finished filmed performance. The night I attended, Scherzinger’s renditions, the very raising of her arms at the strategic measures, the extended climactic notes as she concluded “As If We Never Said Goodbye” triggered the desired theater reaction: a standing ovation. (Alan Williams is the music director.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At all Lloyd’s demands of her, former Pussycat Doll Scherzinger is ready, willing, and able to comply. The singing is unrelentingly strong. That she’s too young to play the role isn’t a factor here. Lean with long black hair flowing and in a tight black mini dress, she’s asked only to present the unremitting Norma Desmond drive and ultimate madness. She presents it completely.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tall <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> tale is, as always, narrated by down-at-heel, frustrated screenwriter Joe Gillis (Tom Francis, acquitting himself with rugged and properly trapped aplomb). Still gracing the brooding action are ubiquitous butler/former husband Max Von Mayerling (David Thaxton, stern and expressionless almost to the somber end) and young studio worker Betty Schaefer (Grace Hodgett Young, beautiful and nicely determined.) Lloyd and choreographer Fabian Aloise frequently bring on a hot ensemble to dance up a nervous storm whenever the dramaturgical weather warrants it.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lyricists-bookwriters Black and Hampton have taken only some liberties with the original Wilder-Charles Brackett-D. M. Marshman Jr. script. They leave out, for two instances, Norma’s amusing Charlie Chaplin imitation and the former silent screen stars bridge game. They do hold on to crucial elements like the burial of Norma’s adored chimpanzee.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incidentally, there is a second-act opener, through which Francis robustly intones the title number, while…well, while Joe takes a time-consuming walkabout. It’s videoed 100% live by camera operator Shayna McPherson. Just know it’s a gimmick and leave it at that.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often during <em>Sunset Blvd.</em>, Norma insists on informing Joe that in Hollywood “we gave the world new ways to dream.” It surely can be said that with his revivals, especially with this one, the estimable Jamie Lloyd attempts to give the theater world new ways to scheme. You go, guy.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Sunset Blvd. opened October 20, 2024 at the St. James Theatre.

Photo: Daniel Rader</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Tried and true classics are, quite naturally, regularly revisited by future generations. The experience of reading a novel remains precisely as the author envisioned, unless revisionists or censors intrude and “improve”; a classic motion picture remains as was, unless you make the mistake of watching a remake. Plays and musicals, though, are created at a certain moment in time with live performers in productions that are necessarily ephemeral. New productions of old classics are inevitably going to differ from the legendary originals.</p>\n<p>Kenny Leon’s production of <em>Our Town</em>, which is in many ways respectful to the spirit of playwright Thornton Wilder, starts with a cacophony of prayer. At the preview attended, whether by directorial intention or simply an errant sound mix, the first and dominant thing this viewer heard emanating from the loudspeakers was the Hebrew prayer known as the Shema. While we did not attend the original production of <em>Our Town</em> in 1938, one imagines that the Shema was the last thing Wilder or innovative director/producer Jed Harris (born Jacob Horowitz) intended or dreamed would be heard in their fictional New Hampshire community of Grover’s Corners. Here, the combined Muslim, Jewish and Christian prayers are followed by ensemble singing with a relatively contemporary sound.</p>\n<p><em>Our Town</em>, as fashioned by the playwright, is intended to begin with what appears to be a stage manager stepping on the empty stage, setting up some chairs and a table, cueing the lights, and informing the audience that “the play is called Our Town.” Hence, the character is referenced in the script and the program, but not onstage, as “Stage Manager.” This stage-manager-setting-the-scene concept helps justify Wilder’s choice to have his play presented with minimal scenery and mostly invisible props. In the new production at the Barrymore, we get five minutes or so of song, as well as a couple dozen actors clambering up the aisles onto the stage <em>before</em> a bearded Jim Parsons ambles in to introduce us to what we have been watching for five minutes already.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/10/10/our-town-kenny-leon-smartly-repopulates-thornton-wilder-for-2024/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Leon is an intelligent and cogent director who has done continually fine work over the past seasons (including <em>Purlie Victorious</em>, <em>Home</em>, <em>A Soldier’s Play</em> and <em>Ohio State Murders</em>). He explains in a program note that his concept is to be true to the play while relevant to the audience: “in this production, time is then and now with the intention of speaking to the people sitting in the theatre today.” This is reasonable enough. Despite this shakily, non-Wilderesque start to the proceedings, Leon does indeed accomplish what he intended, making <em>Our Town</em> relevant to audiences steeped in the very different world of today.</p>\n<p>A professional production, overall, and one which is worthy of commendation. (Excepting the simple-looking but exceptional lighting design by Allen Lee Hughes, which enhances Wilder’s theme and deserves a higher level of praise.) But that leads to a second issue when dealing with oft-produced classics. Are we to judge revivals by their effectiveness, or lack thereof, to contemporary audience members who have never seen or read it? Or by how well the production does by the material? A play as familiar as <em>Our Town</em> has a built-in advantage, from a ticket-sales aspect. But many of us have seen multiple productions of the play; I have watched Henry Fonda, Paul Newman and Spalding Gray amble on and introduce us to Wilder’s world of Grover’s Corners.</p>\n<p>Parsons is OK in the role, although without the authority of the above actors. He seems far more comfortable when he has a few lines to deliver as an actual townsfolk (Mrs. Forrest, a crotchety neighbor, or Mr. Morgan at the soda fountain) than while serving as homespun narrator. One expects that Richard Thomas—onstage as newspaper editor Webb, and like Parsons an iconic television star from his years as John-Boy on <em>The Waltons</em>—would be more effective in the role. Thomas is in good company. Katie Holmes (Mrs. Webb), Michelle Wilson (Mrs. Gibbs), and Billy Eugene Jones (Doc Gibbs) all do well, while that inveterate scene-stealer Julie Halston earns good-natured laughs without unduly disrupting the proceedings.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_21990\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-21990\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21990\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sized-Ephraim-Sykes-Richard-Thomas-Zoey-Deutch-Photo-by-Daniel-Rader.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sized-Ephraim-Sykes-Richard-Thomas-Zoey-Deutch-Photo-by-Daniel-Rader.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sized-Ephraim-Sykes-Richard-Thomas-Zoey-Deutch-Photo-by-Daniel-Rader.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sized-Ephraim-Sykes-Richard-Thomas-Zoey-Deutch-Photo-by-Daniel-Rader.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sized-Ephraim-Sykes-Richard-Thomas-Zoey-Deutch-Photo-by-Daniel-Rader.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sized-Ephraim-Sykes-Richard-Thomas-Zoey-Deutch-Photo-by-Daniel-Rader.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-21990\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ephraim Sykes, Richard Thomas and Zoey Deutch in Our Town. Photo: Daniel Rader</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Zoey Deutch makes an impressive stage debut as Emily Webb, the youngster we follow from love and marriage to death. Deutch is smart, sympathetic and knowing from first to last, with perhaps the strongest performance of the group. She is joined by an a highly likable Ephraim Sykes as George. That said, George’s final scene at Emily’s grave on the hilltop cemetery—usually one of the play’s most emotionally-wrenching moments—here falls unaccountably flat.</p>\n<p>So here we have a sturdily functional production of the Wilder classic. But when you walk out of a revival thinking how thrilling the play was the <em>last</em> time you saw it—well that’s a problem, isn’t it? David Cromer’s 2009 production at the Barrow Street Theatre (and elsewhere) was vibrant, stunning and altogether unforgettable. The new Broadway production is—well, not.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Town opened October 10, 2024 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre and runs through January 19, 2025.

Photo: Daniel Rader</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thornton Wilder has been quoted as saying of his most famous and most produced play <em>Our Town</em>, set in fictional Grover’s Corners, New Hampshire, “This play is about everywhere.” What he means to convey, if explanation is necessary, is that artistically and succinctly <em>Our Town</em> demonstrates that by closely examining the extremely particular, a universal truth is revealed.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thornton Wilder Society, where statistics are carefully monitored, reports that something like 400 <em>Our Town</em> productions appear annually, and be assured they’re not all showing up in New Hampshire. They’re done across the country—not just in high schools—and around the globe for the simple reason that spectators on whatever continent are regularly convinced that Grover’s Corners is no more nor less than a replica of their town.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilder was that prescient and remains so in the latest Broadway revival (five previously, since the 1938 opening just about exactly 86 years ago). This time the director is Kenny Leon, who’s taken a few liberties with the script—all happily acceptable and certainly approved by the vigilant Wilder Estate. It could be said that Leon is offering an <em>Our Town</em> “for our time,” as the saying goes, a time when a seriously threatened democracy has generated a nation-wide longing for unity across racial lines.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/10/10/our-town-thornton-wilders-classic-in-functional-but-less-than-gripping-revival/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the outset, stateside casts have always been white, in recognition of the likely population of any equivalent Grover’s Corners at the time Wilder sets the ground-breaking play, 1901-13. Leon mixes Black and white when what used to be called non-traditional casting has become the predominant traditional casting. Another way to phrase it is that he’s made Wilder’s implicit quite visibly explicit.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His choice is beautifully achieved. This time out, the Webb family is headed by Grover’s Corners Sentinel editor Webb (Richard Thomas, whose John-Boy in <em>The Waltons</em> of rural Virginia all but predicted he’d one day take on this role). He and Mrs. Webb (Katie Holmes), children Emily (Zoey Deutch) and Wally Webb (Hagan Oliveras) are white, whereas Dr. Gibbs (Billy Eugene Jones), Mrs. Gibbs (Michelle Wilson) and their children George (Ephraim Sykes) and Rebecca (Safiya Kaijya Harris) are Black.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means, of course, that when George and Emily marry—after playing the exquisite soda fountain scene wherein they first pledge themselves to each other—they represent a mixed marriage. This is hardly surprising in 2024 when television commercials frequently feature interracial marriages.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leon depicts them with care on a Beowulf Boritt set that is not the space Wilder describes as “an empty stage in half-light.” Seen upstage is a high and weathered gray wall that suggests the side of an old barn. On it are hung several gray chairs. Under the Allen Lee Hughes lights, sit a few other aging furnishings.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entrance of a stage manager, another change in Wilder’s order, is delayed while 27 members of the cast stroll in and around a piano where Donald Webber, Jr. begins playing what’s identified in the program as “Braided Prayer,” for which Abraham Jam includes prayers from Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths. The complex composition, movingly delivered, is another instance of the literal and figurative harmony Leon wants underlined in his interpretation.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only when the prayers are finished does Stage Manager (Jim Parsons in his second Broadway appearance in the last six months and marvelously at ease in it) enter through an upstage door in the wall and introduce the play and Grover’s Corners. (Would Wilder have okayed Leon’s revise? A good guess would be yes.) Incidentally, there are audience members sitting in a few rows, stage right and left, as if in church or court.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Stage Manager arrives, Leon guides the cast through a scrupulously rewarding version of the text. To a man and woman, they are commendable, including Julie Halston as gossipy wedding-lover Mrs. Soames and Webber as heavy drinking, deeply depressed Simon Stimson. Bill Timoney, Doron Jépaul, and John McGinty as the town milkman—hearing-impaired in Leon’s take—also snare their scenes more than handily.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gibbs and Webb broods are impressive emotionally, Sykes and Deutch especially effective over their strawberry ice cream sodas. If anyone is taxed beyond the call of duty, it’s Holmes. Throughout, the actors, deprived of props, are required to mime activities such as sipping ice cream sodas. It often looks as if Holmes, tied to her kitchen apron, has entire meals to prepare. No easy pantomiming task, so bows to her for extraordinary effort.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leon unfolds <em>Our Town</em> without intermission (Wilder might not have gone for that), but the director does have the Stage Manager indicate act starts and finishes, as the untrimmed dialog states. It used to be said (perhaps it still is) that average small-town citizens only have their names in the paper three times—birth, marriage, death.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accordingly, in act one Dr. Gibbs returns from delivering twins. In act two George and Emily marry. In act three Emily has died young and joins other deceased Grover’s Corners citizens in the graveyard. An argument could be made that Wilder’s third <em>Our Town</em> act is the best ever written for a 20th-century American play. Moreover, it may boast the best single line—delivered heart-searingly here by Deutch’s Emily—“Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it?—every, every minute?”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Kenny Leon’s very welcome <em>Our Town</em>, patrons are guaranteed to appreciate Thornton Wilder’s genius every, every minute.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Our Town opened October 10, 2024 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre and runs through January 19, 2025.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some plays that, when revived, you wish would present themselves as dated, plays that could then be enjoyed or disdained as reminders of a darker era. One group of them surely deals with racism, particularly racist American. How wonderful, even miraculous, it would be if those dramas, when brought back, could be received as reminders of a now distant time, dramas to shake a head over and reflect satisfyingly that those bad days are, thank heaven, gone.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, such wishes have yet to be granted when the subject raises its hobgoblin head. Racism still blights the United States so crucially and cruelly that what’s occurring in today’s political climate must be considered a nasty spike in racist attitudes, a hardly gentle reminder being David Henry Hwang’s <em>Yellow Face</em>, currently making its Broadway bow. First seen at the Public Theater in December 2007 and subsequently an Obie winner and Pulitzer Prize finalist, it returns with the same director, Leigh Silverman, and one of its original players, Francis Jue.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smiles and laughs it elicits, true enough, because Hwang writes it as an autobiographical comedy-drama. Wittily, he puts himself, DHH—as impersonated by square-jawed Daniel Dae Kim in a crackerjack performance—at its center. In large part, he insists that in many of the ensuing mishaps the joke’s on him. Smart fellow, this on-stage (and, of course, off-stage) Hwang. He recognizes that a man who can make fun of himself will in turn have audiences laughing simultaneously at and with him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/10/01/yellow-face-laugh-reflect-repeat/\">[<em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As playwright, Hwang recalls many past distractions, digressions, and indiscretions but focuses on three: (1) his well-publicized 1991 protest, with some equally prominent others, against Actors Equity and, specifically, Welsh actor Jonathan Pryce’s starring on Broadway as a Eurasian man in Cameron Macintosh’s imported<em> Miss Saigon</em> blockbuster; (2) his passing off as Asian the very Caucasian Marcus Gee (Ryan Eggold) in the disastrous, money-losing <em>M. Butterfly</em> follow-up, <em>Face Value</em>, a revue that prompted his <em>Yellow Face</em> self-examination; and (3) the investigated Far East National Bank that his father HYH (Jue), founded and on the board of directors of which DHH sat under duress.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Filling in these stops—many of them substantially enhanced by Yee Eun Nam’s projections—Hwang wrings humor from Marcus’s initial resistance to passing himself off as Asian but, when the guise proves fruitful in the casting department, exploiting it to a rewarding fare-thee-well, most prominently with Asian girlfriend, Leah (Shannon Tyo).  Hwang gets almost as much mileage from the Far East National Bank stew as well as the government pursuit of Wen Ho Lee (also Jue), the Los Alamos scientist suspected of purloining classified papers. He throws tough, no-joke-provoking punches at a name-withheld (Jeff Gerth, Tim Golden?) <em>New York Times</em> reporter (Greg Keller), who unrelentingly covered the FENB situation. (Note: Eventually, Hwang admits that not everything he presents on Arnulfo Maldonado’s sleek, sliding panel set, as lighted by Lap Chi Chu, is true. Sorry, no hints to be yielded here.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As recalling the (sometimes made-up?) events, Hwang mostly aims to be funny, as numerous others cast members, primarily Kevin Del Aguila and Marinda Anderson, put themselves through innumerable quick and comic changes. It may be that some of these segments are more amusing to Hwang than to the audience and could stand judicious trimming from the 105-minute entertainment.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When toward the play’s end Hwang arrives at his compelling, even compulsive, revelation, however, he’s deeply serious. Responding to his own quite personal impulse, he reveals that he’s written <em>Yellow Face</em> to confront the guise he regards himself as wearing professionally, the face he’d assumed through his earlier works as a Chinese playwright.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Yellow Face</em> could, of course be written as “yellowface”—a descriptive companion to blackface, the once familiar, now in disrepute performing style. Indeed, there’s something valiant about Hwang’s reaching this self-facing (self-defacing?) conclusion. There’s something touching is his removing the unseen mask—the imagined make-up he obviously never literally brushed on—that in this final <em>Yellow Face</em> development lifts the self-involved piece to a praise-worthy height.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, be aware, his look in the mirror—where the face seen is an embarrassing reflection—could very well encourage spectators to do their own mask-shedding.  Many thanks to the now relievedly unmasked Hwang for that.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yellow Face </b><strong>opened October 1, 2024, at the Todd Haimes Theatre and runs through November 24.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>“When you write an autobiographical play, no one uses their real name. That would be self-indulgent,” says a character named DHH in <em>Yellow Face</em>, a play by David Henry Hwang (<em>M. Butterfly</em>).</p>\n<p>The audience at the Todd Haimes Theatre, where <em>Yellow Face</em> has just opened in a lively revival, laughs heartily. Partly because DHH, played by Daniel Dae Kim—of TV’s <em>Lost</em> and <em>Hawaii Five-0</em>—has a wicked way with a one-liner. Also because Hwang is so proudly flaunting his dramaturgical transgression. But mostly because we have been laughing at DHH for the last 90 minutes. Not many writers would be willing to be the butt of so many jokes.</p>\n<p>First produced in 2007 at the Public Theater and directed by Leigh Silverman, who helms this revival, the semiautobiographical comedy starts with story of Hwang’s high-profile involvement with the 1990 <em>Miss Saigon</em> Broadway protest. For the uninitiated, Hwang and others were objecting to the casting of Jonathan Pryce, a Welsh actor, as a Eurasian pimp. (Hwang wrote a letter to Actors’ Equity, which somehow, cough cough, got leaked to <em>The New York Times</em>: “I had dared to suppose that the yellowface days of Charlie Chan and Fu Manchu had been relegated forever to the closets of historical kitsch.…”) Eventually Pryce went on, and won a Tony for the role. Hwang decided to write a play about it, a “backstage farce about a musical in which the lead actor is a Caucasian playing an Asian.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/10/01/yellow-face-playwright-david-henry-hwang-has-fun-unmasking-himself/\">[<em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>You might not remember 1993’s <em>Face Value</em>, which had a rocky out-of-town tryout in Boston and closed on Broadway after eight previews, never reaching its official opening night. And here’s where art stops imitating life. In <em>Yellow Face</em>, DHH ends up casting—oops!—a white guy, Marcus G. Dahlman (TV star Ryan Eggold of <em>New Amsterdam</em> and <em>The Blacklist</em>, making a very compelling Broadway debut), in an Asian role. But he doesn’t own up to his mistake until years later—leading to a national scandal and public humiliation, not to mention “Marcus Gee” getting roles like the King in <em>The King and I</em>. (If you saw Daniel Dae Kim’s terrific turn as the King in London or on Broadway, that tidbit is extra-funny.)</p>\n<p>Broadway insiders will appreciate all “appearances” by actor/Tony-winning <em>M. Butterfly</em> star B.D. Wong, British super-producer Cameron Mackintosh, Shubert Theatres president Bernard Jacobs, casting directors Vinnie Liff and Jay Binder, Public Theater impresario Joe Papp, then-<em>New York Times</em> chief theater critic Frank Rich, and director Jerry Zaks. Those characters, and many others, are all portrayed by the insanely versatile trio of Kevin Del Aguila, Marinda Anderson, and Shannon Tyo, who must take on at least a dozen roles each. Though she does a pretty good Cameron Mackintosh, Tyo—a standout the past few seasons in off-Broadway shows including <em>The Chinese Lady</em>, <em>The Far Country</em>, <em>The Comeuppance</em>, and <em>Regretfully, So the Birds Are</em>—is especially good as Leah Anne Cho, Marcus Gee’s girlfriend and DHH’s ex. I couldn’t help but dream-cast her and Eggold in a revival of <em>Chinglish</em>, Hwang’s 2011 comedy of cross-cultural misunderstandings and malapropisms.</p>\n<p>Hwang has called <em>Yellow Face</em> a “stage mockumentary,” but there’s more to the piece than theater jokes. Perhaps the best character is DHH’s father, HYH, a self-described “Chinese Republican banker” who idolizes Jimmy Stewart and Frank Sinatra. He’s played by the incomparable Francis Jue, who won an Obie for playing HYH in 2007 and, intriguingly, played a character named DHH in the 2019 David Henry Hwang–Jeanine Tesori musical <em>Soft Power</em>. Jue is a comic dynamo (“You know, your <em>M. Butterfly</em>—that play is a little weird,” HYH says to his son), but in many ways proves <em>Yellow Face</em>’s moral compass. And every good comedy needs a little gravitas.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Yellow Face</em> opened Oct. 1, 2024, at the Todd Haimes Theatre and runs through Nov. 24.

Photo: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Star power is not to be underestimated. Not only can it bring in audiences who may not normally attend new Broadway plays, it can also infuse a problematic work with a gravitas it might not normally possess. Such is the case with Lincoln Center Theater’s production of the new drama by Ayad Akhtar (<em>Disgraced,</em> <em>The Invisible Hand</em>) that touches on such themes as artificial intelligence, plagiarism, and writerly inspiration without really coming to grips with any of them. But it doesn’t matter, thanks to the presence of Robert Downey Jr. in the title role. Downey, who recently won an Oscar for the film <em>Oppenheimer</em> and is here making his stage debut, brings such charisma and magnetism to <em>McNeal</em> that it’s easy to overlook the play’s flaws.</p>\n<p>His character, Jacob McNeal, feels uncomfortably like an archetype, an acerbic, acclaimed novelist wrestling with private demons including his wife’s recent suicide. A heavy drinker who has trouble staying on the wagon even while taking medications for a serious health issue, McNeal comes across like Philip Roth minus the Jewishness or Norman Mailer minus the machismo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/09/30/mcneal-robert-downey-jr-stars-in-riveting-new-play/\">[<em>Read Roma Torre’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>As the play begins, he’s informed that he’s the latest recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature, an honor to which he responds by going on a bender after the awards ceremony and being photographed in a public fountain in his underwear. He’s certainly a handful for his long-suffering publicist (Andrea Martin, predictably hilarious), who finally manages to snag him a long hoped-for New York Times profile despite the fact that he had an affair with one of the paper’s editors (Melora Hardin) that didn’t end well.</p>\n<p>Yes, McNeal is the sort of lovable rogue who enjoys fame and fortune while screwing up every relationship in his life, including the one with his son Harlan (Rafi Gavron), who blames him for his mother’s death. When they see each other after a long estrangement, Harlan threatens to reveal that McNeal’s upcoming book has been plagiarized from an unusual source.</p>\n<p>McNeal’s response proves surprising in more ways than one, including a dramatic revelation that brings the play into tawdry territory that feels unearned. It also provides the character one of many opportunities to expound on how writers inevitably borrow from each other, citing such authors as Shakespeare and David Foster Wallace as examples.</p>\n<p>It’s a recurring theme of the play which eventually delves, often amusingly, into the literary ramifications of the sort of A.I. that can mimic a writer’s style to an uncanny degree. Large-scale projections (designed by Jake Barton) provide numerous examples of the phenomenon via texts and, more strikingly, a series of images in which Downey’s face morphs into various other figures including Barry Goldwater, the subject of one of McNeal’s novels.</p>\n<p>But the playwright doesn’t succeed in blending the evening’s formulaic storyline with its philosophical musings. We never really feel any emotional engagement with the characters, many of whom seem diagrammed as if by A.I. And while the ideas being thrown about are intellectually engaging up to a point, they ultimately feel like a poorly thought-out think piece.</p>\n<p>But then there’s Downey, who despite his lack of theatrical experience makes his McNeal fascinating despite the character feeling like a Frankenstein’s monster composed of various literary figures. Delivering his witticisms in that trademark dry, deadpan fashion that made his Tony Stark an iconic figure in Marvel movies, he’s onstage for nearly all the play’s 100 minutes and proves compelling throughout. He’s well matched by such supporting players as Melora Hardin, Brittany Bellizcare, Saisha Talwar, and Ruthie Ann Miles, who all make vivid impressions in underwritten roles.</p>\n<p>Director Bartlett Sher delivers a typically lavish LCT staging, dominated by Michael Yeargan and Jake Barton’s set designs so sleekly modernistic that it makes Apple stores feel like antique shops.</p>\n<p><strong>McNeal opened September 30, 2024, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater and runs through November 24.

Photo: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><br />\nLet it be known that I have never used ChatGPT or any other AI generated content to write my reviews…and that is true at least until the foreseeable future…which is when Ayad Akhtar’s phenomenally prescient play <i>McNeal</i> takes place.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>And I must admit, seeing how incredibly impressive ChatGPT is in crafting and imitating great work, the temptation is very real. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before I get into the merits of the play and Lincoln Center’s thrilling production, something else that’s very real is the extraordinary talents of its leading man. Making his Broadway debut, Robert Downey Jr., who most of us know only through his film work, is a great stage actor. As famed novelist Jacob McNeal, an egotistical, self-acknowledged asshole, he is a fascinating creature treading the line between obnoxious and seductive.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You can’t take your eyes off him…and happily, he’s on stage for the entirety of Akhtar’s 90-minute drama. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We first meet him in his doctor’s office being warned to stay off the booze which has already ravaged his liver.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>It’s October and all he cares about is the imminent announcement from the Nobel committee naming the winner of the Literature Prize.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/09/30/mcneal-robert-downey-jr-brings-real-star-power-to-a-sometimes-artificial-feeling-play/\">[<em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The play actually begins before we even see him. The set lights up revealing a giant phone screen as the words are typed out “Who will win the Nobel prize in literature this year?” And after the answer comes back speculating the names of several other famed authors, we see the cursor moving with the next prompt asking “What is the likelihood Jacob McNeal will win the Nobel prize this year?” No spoiler alert here but McNeal does find out who wins while still in the doctor’s office.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the story progresses, it becomes clear that, despite his refusal to admit it, he does use ChatGPT in his writing, a lot of it. We come to discover it’s the extension of a practice started years earlier when he stole (or is it “borrowed”?) the works of others. And after years of being criticized for hating women in his stories, suddenly his latest book features a strong female protagonist. Turns out, that was stolen too in a disgraceful act of plagiarism. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s easy to see how and why someone like McNeal would find artificial intelligence so appealing. All he has to do is input classic works &#8211; <i>King Lear, Madame Bovary, Hedda Gabler, Oedipus Rex</i><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>etc. &#8211;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>and then ask the app to rewrite them “in the style of Jacob McNeal”. And what might take humans days if not weeks and months to accomplish, ChatGPT can produce results in seconds. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Akhtar, the Pulitzer Prize winning author of  <em>Disgraced</em> 11 years ago, may be in the running yet again.  His writing is crisp and compact but it’s also richly complex. Each scene featuring key figures in McNeal’s life reveals another sordid layer in his warped personality. With his doctor &#8211; the excellent Ruthie Ann Miles &#8211; he’s self-destructive. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite his agent’s best efforts to capitalize on his star power, McNeal is uncooperative and difficult. Andrea Martin is terrific in the role exhibiting just the right mix of gleeful swagger and exasperation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">McNeal’s son, Harlan, is a very troubled young man. And no wonder. His mother, a frustrated writer, suffered mentally in the shadow of her egocentric husband, and committed suicide years earlier when Harlan was a boy. Left to be raised by McNeal in what must have been a fairly loveless home, he is now filled with loathing for his father. Their chilling scene together is raw and intensely bitter, Rafi Gavron in his first Broadway role delivers a heartbreaking performance as a son betrayed by not one but both of his parents. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A scene featuring McNeal’s interview with a <em>New York Times</em> reporter assigned to profile the acclaimed novelist brings out McNeal’s arrogance and contrarian nature.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Right off the bat he asks the young African American reporter if she’s &#8220;a diversity hire”; and later states that he “envied Harvey Weinstein.” Brittany Bellizeare, also making her Broadway debut, does a nice job as a woman who’s offended by McNeal but also finds his honesty surprisingly refreshing. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The last encounter is with McNeal’s former lover. Melora Hardin is engaging as Francine Blake, a writer and editor with whom he tries to re-ignite the relationship. She’s not interested at first but softens and then rejects him after describing all the ways he stole the sensitive details of her life for his so-called “art,” saying his hubris is repulsive. At this point in the production, the physical world and the cyber merge, and it’s hard to make sense of what’s real. Or are we in a virtual hallucination? </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Akhtar’s prophetic tale is rendered in a production that’s directed exquisitely by Bartlett Sher. It’s a gorgeous collaboration marrying technology, the spoken word, performance, story and stage craft all in one cohesive design. In between each scene, the stage is filled with a panoramic evocation of artificial intelligence that’s so integral to the narrative, it must be regarded as another character. And by play’s end, much like Hal, the rogue computer from <i>2001: A Space Odyssey,</i> the technology seems to come alive. Credit the artistry of the design team Michael Yeargan &amp; Jake Barton who crafted the sets, and Barton’s stunning projections. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As spectacular as it all appears, Downey Jr.’s performance is the linchpin of the entire production, and it’s a tribute to his gifts as an actor that he turns the work into an engrossing study of the intersection of art and the powers of cyber science. His McNeal is a deeply flawed individual and yet one who recognizes his shortcomings, though not enough to change. He explains “computers are our fondest enablers.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At play’s end, we see the screen light up again with the prompt: “Please write a final speech for an audience confused by what is real and what isn’t, inspired by Prospero’s final speech to the audience in Shakespeare’s <i>The Tempest.</i>” What pops up is a soliloquy closely matching the eloquence of the Bard’s words. I had to know if it was actually the product of AI, and so I asked the production team. The response was &#8220;Ayad did not use GPT to write the play&#8217;s text&#8230;only the last speech&#8217;s final couplet, which was generated by AI.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Those two lines are indeed poetic, but considering everything else in Akhtar&#8217;s exceptional play is human made, I find it hard to believe that anything artificial intelligence could come up with would be as wholly rewarding and profound. </span></p>\n<div>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: inherit;\">McNeal opened September 30, 2024, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater and runs through November 24.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Though Jez Butterworth’s new play, <em>The Hills of California</em>—which just opened at the Broadhurst Theatre after premiering in January on the West End—takes its title from a jazzy, sun-soaked 1948 song by Johnny Mercer, this elegiac, superbly written drama feels more akin to another tune, one that you’ll hear late in the show: the wistful, Depression-era lullaby “Dream a Little Dream.”</p>\n<p>“Just hold me tight and tell me you’ll miss me/ While I’m alone and blue as can be.” A genuine plea for affection, and for a true emotional connection—that’s what a group of 30-something sisters are searching for, and trying desperately to achieve, as their mother lies dying in their childhood home in Blackpool, England.</p>\n<p>“It could be today. Could be tomorrow,” Penny (Ta’Rea Campbell), the kindly nurse who’s tending to their mum, tells the youngest, Jill (Helena Wilson). “How long is a piece of string?” Thus begins the inevitable morbid waiting game for sisters Jill, Ruby (Ophelia Lovibond), and Gloria (Leanne Best); they’re also waiting for the eldest, Joan, whose appearance is so questionable she might as well be called Godot.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/09/29/the-hills-of-california-jez-butterworths-piercing-gaze-on-four-sisters/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The year is 1976, but you’d never know it from the looks of the parlor: With its tattered tiki bar and nonworking jukebox, the resort—it’s called the Seaview, though it doesn’t have one—appears stuck in a tacky midcentury time warp.</p>\n<p>Gloria’s goofball husband, Bill (Richard Short), and Ruby’s nondescript nice-guy hubby, Dennis (Bryan Dick), are also on the scene, but Butterworth quickly dispatches them on some errand or another. Unlike his previous plays—most notably, the chest-thumping <em>Jerusalem</em> (2009)—<em>Hills</em> focuses squarely on the female characters. After all, the playwright is the father of four daughters; he’s had a good glimpse into these dynamics.</p>\n<p>But this is no standard-issue dysfunctional family drama; it&#8217;s also a meticulously crafted, emotion-packed memory play. With one rotation of Rob Howell’s spectacular towering set—anchored by a labyrinthian Escher-like staircase that seems to stretch to the sky—we’re back in 1955, in the Seaview Luxury Guesthouse and Spa, which is not luxurious and almost certainly doesn’t have a spa. <em>Hills</em> toggles between decades with ease—a credit to director Sam Mendes, whose particular gift is taking sprawling stories (see: Butterworth’s <em>The Ferryman</em>; <em>The Lehman Trilogy</em>) and making them feel intimate.</p>\n<p>In the kitchen, Young Jill (Nicola Turner), Young Ruby (Sophia Ally), Young Gloria (Nancy Allsop), and Young Joan (Lara McDonnell)—under the watchful eye of mom Veronica (<em>The Ferryman</em>’s Laura Donnelly)—practice their four-part harmonies in a quest to become the next Andrews Sisters. Their quest? Possibly. Veronica’s quest? Absolutely.</p>\n<p>“A song is a place to be,” she tells her brood of stars-to-be. “Somewhere you can live. And in that place, there are no walls. No boundaries. No locks. No keys. You can go anywhere.”</p>\n<p>Can you, though? After Luther St. John (David Wilson Barnes), a shady American agent, sees the Webb Sisters perform, he breaks the news to Veronica—boogie-woogie music simply isn’t popular anymore. “Have you heard of Elvis Presley?” he asks. “I’m sorry. I don’t know what that is,” she replies. Of course, Elvis wasn’t exactly an international sensation at that point. A single mother of four in a resort town in Lancashire surely wouldn’t have heard of him. (Butterworth clearly knows, and loves, his music. In the next scene, Dennis talks about seeing Little Richard “supported by a little-known band from Liverpool,” and Bill extols the virtues of “Rock Around the Clock” and “Eleanor Rigby” while tsk-tsking Elkie Brooks and David Bowie. And fans of <em>The Ferryman</em> might recall a Rolling Stones–Beatles–Led Zeppelin discussion over a bottle of Bushmills.)</p>\n<p>Unlike Godot, 1976 Joan eventually arrives (she’s also played by Donnelly), with a Penny Lane coat and laissez-faire attitude. She has a flask of Wild Turkey that she shares with Jillian, a perfect ’70s shag that Ruby wants to copy, and an American accent that annoys Gloria. (“Is that your speaking voice?” she snipes. “You mean the one she’s speaking with,” Jillian retorts.) She also has an amazing story involving pizza, a case of wine, and the Andrews Sisters. Incidentally, all the actors playing the Webb women—both their 1955 and 1976 incarnations—are reprising the roles they played in London, so they&#8217;re well versed in each sibling’s quirks. Gloria likes to play the tough girl, and she comes in like a wrecking ball, but Best reveals the flickers of pain behind those smoky eyes.</p>\n<p>Donnelly—Butterworth&#8217;s longtime partner and muse—gives a pitch-perfect performance as Joan, morphing so convincingly into a groovy chain-smoking hippie that many audience members don’t even realize it’s her. And she’s even better as Veronica. It’s a character we’ve seen before: the overbearing stage mother with an almost intractable belief in her daughters’ talent and an indefatigable commitment to their success—a single mom who’ll do whatever it takes. (One word: <em>Gypsy</em>.) Yet Donnelly makes Veronica truly sing.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Hills of California</em> opened Sept. 29, 2024, and runs through Dec. 22 at the Broadhurst Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within no more than seconds of Natasha Chivers’ lights going up on Rob Howell’s foreboding four-story set for <em>The Hills of California</em>, never-miss director Sam Mendes lets it be known he has his firm grip on Jez Butterworth’s new and acclaimed play in its transfer from London’s West End.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s an indefinable sense of unfolding satisfaction that often instantaneously accompanies exceptional works. Happy to say it struck as soon as agitated Jill (Helena Wilson) began a concerned conversation with nurse Penny (Ta’Rea Campbell) in the cluttered parlor of run-down Blackpool resort Seaview, and its four floors of long staircases rising ominously to signal eventually bleak revelations.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newest play by Butterworth—author of the Tony-winning <em>Ferryman</em>—is a dramedy including music and dance, taking place in 1955 and 1976. Jill is one of the four Webb sisters intent on saying goodbye to their dying mother, who remains unseen on a bed behind a second-floor door. Jill is the one sister who has never left the house.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/09/29/the-hills-of-california-le-jez-hot/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, Ruby (Ophelia Lovibond) arrives with what she regards as her ho-hum husband Dennis (Brian Dick). Not too long after they darken the Seaview entrance, Gloria (Leanne Best) barges in, a mass of long-held grudges fueling her, with children Patty (Nancy Allsop) and Anthony (Liam Bixby).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joan, who 21 years earlier defected to those California hills, is supposedly on her way but has run into travel problems. Jill insists Joan will return; she&#8217;s promised her dying Mom that the missing sister, long her mother’s favorite, will get to the death bed in the nick of time. (Does Joan get there or doesn’t she is a plot tantalizer; for full appreciation of Butterworth’s aims, audience members are advised to avoid consulting the program’s cast list.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>The Hills of California</em>, then, is the tenebrous tale of often resentful siblings, their bonds sometimes intricately steadfast, sometimes intricately damaged by what they’ve endured in a household with a missing father and an ambitious mother. Make that a rampaging, Momma Rose-like stage mother, Veronica (Laura Donnelly).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As siblings everywhere will attest, Butterworth has landed on a broad and emotionally rich subject. His accomplishment is how he endlessly creates situations in which, over three acts, the sisters consistently align and realign in defense of and in defiance of each other.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They behave similarly in several flashbacks to the sisters’ adolescence when Veronica isn’t merely in good health but on a relentless mission. She’s convinced that her girls will become the world’s successors to the Andrews Sisters. To demonstrate Veronica’s hardcore belief, Butterworth uses the 1955 flashbacks to bring on young Joan (Lara McDonnell), young Gloria (Nancy Allsop), young Jill (Nicola Turner), and Young Ruby (Sophia Ally). While they interact with each other not unlike they do in 1976, Veronica repeatedly drills them on their routines—choreographer Ellen Kane and music supervisor Candida Caldicott at the ready with, for one, the 1940s sisters’ “Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helped by Jack Larkin (Bryan Dick), a conniving performer with connections, Veronica weathers money-crushing setbacks when an American manager, Luther St. John (David Wilson Barnes), agrees to drop by for an audition. Not impressed with what he sees (the subsequent so-so turn cleverly staged by Kane), he allows that the one sister with promotable talent is Joan. After some discussion, Veronica and he agree to a strictly private session with Joan, during which she’ll render her interpretation of the Nat King Cole “When I Fall in Love”—Cole a St. John client, as Butterworth neatly frames it.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision’s outcome, left in the reverberating air for most of the remainder of the play, provides the production’s central drama, if hardly its intermittent humor. The discussions, the arguments, the silences, the relived and intensifying grudges, the temporary alliances between and among the central characters—while other colorful figures caught in the two-era maelstrom swirl around—constitute Butterworth’s wise depiction of family dynamics and how over tortuous time they may or may not work out.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the large cast, it’s necessary to stress the quality performances of all concerned. First by length and commitment to her goal is Donnelly, who tackles the potent role with both hands clenched. (She also serves eerily in another  crucial bit.) Those playing the 1976 and 1955 Webbs are unfailingly strong, Lovibond possessing maybe the best pipes. Other standouts among the full ensemble standouts are Ta-Rea Campbell as seen-it-all nurse Penny, Barnes as shrewd manager St. John, Richard Lumsden as in-house piano accompanist Joe Fogg, and Bryan Dick as both Dennis and wise-cracking Jack Larkin.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(One caveat: The actors speak in North England accents that can call for close listening. Daniele Lydon is the UK dialect coach, Kate Wilson the US vocal coach.)</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, with <em>The Hills of California</em> Butterworth spins on <em>The Ferryman</em>. Again, it’s a welcome spin, wherein he suggests the possibility, if not the guarantee, of  benighted families ultimately reaching acceptable endings. To that point, he inserts “Dream a Little Dream of Me,” invoking the promise or broken promise of familial dreams, whatever they be. Do they ever come true here?  The answer involves a must-see trip to <em>The Hills of California</em>, instantly an early entry into the best-play-of-the-season sweepstakes.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">The Hills of California opened September 29, 2024 at the Broadhurst Theatre and runs through December 22.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The last time many theatergoers saw Mia Farrow onstage in New York, in 2005, she was in a coma, re-creating a lifetime of memories in James Lapine’s flashback-filled <em>Fran’s Bed</em> at Playwrights Horizons.</p>\n<p>In Jen Silverman’s dark comedy <em>The Roommate</em>, just opened at the Booth Theatre, Farrow looks much livelier. She’s bright and bubbly as the overly chatty Sharon, who’s renting out her sprawling Iowa City home to the enigmatic Robyn (three-time Tony winner Patti LuPone, a terrific foil for Farrow), a vegan lesbian slam poet, gardener, and former potter. As she explains, “being a potter can be very stressful.”</p>\n<p>After learning that Robyn drove in from The Bronx (“Isn’t the Bronx…dangerous?” Sharon asks, eyes widening), Sharon brings up her clothing designer son, who lives in Park Slope: “Everybody thinks he’s a homosexual, but he’s not.” She keeps talking. “Some of my son’s friends are homosexual people. Probably most of them.” And keeps talking…eventually confessing: “I kissed a girl once in college.” Consider that Silverman’s version of the proverbial Chekhovian gun.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/09/12/the-roommate-boulevard-comedy-sitcom-style/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Robyn is cagey about her past—and even her present (“I grow things,” she says obliquely)—but the sudden arrival of this mullet-wearing, moto jacket–clad woman in the middle of corn country begs the question: Why? “I imagined wide open skies, I think and rising at dawn… A sort of…restorative manual labor,” she muses. That only makes Sharon more intrigued about her new roomie, and some strategic snooping eventually yields a few clues…which we won’t reveal here. Let’s just call Robyn’s past checkered.</p>\n<p>Unexpectedly, Sharon is far from judgmental, even about the pot plants lining her windowsill—which, of course, she doesn’t recognize (“I thought they were just…weird…plants”). But please don’t call them drugs; they’re “medicinal herbs,” explains Robyn. “Herbs only become drugs when a capitalist economy gets involved.”</p>\n<p>If this were a Hollywood movie, Meryl Streep and Jane Fonda would smoke a joint and bounce around the kitchen while singing Motown songs into their hairbrushes. But Silverman—whose plays also include the historical satire <em>Spain</em>, the Brontë riff <em>The Moors</em>, and the Shakespeare-inspired feminist rant <em>Collective Rage: A Play in 5 Betties</em>—is smarter than that; they smoke, play some music, do a bit of dancing, and begin a tentative friendship.</p>\n<p>A play centered on two mature women in an age group that’s often ignored and rarely explored—in the script, the characters are listed as 50s–70s—could be considered a risk, but since its world premiere in 2015 at the Humana Festival, <em>The Roommate </em>has been produced all over the country, including at the Steppenwolf Theatre Co. and Williamstown Theatre Festival. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that it’s just 100 minutes, requires only one set, and offers two meaty roles. Silverman touches on a too-rarely discussed issue: What happens to women when the kids grow up and move away, and when husbands and partners are out of the picture? Selling a house means losing memories; but finding a roommate or roommates—sharing expenses—means keeping your life in place, while also forging new friendships. (Okay, <em>The Golden Girls</em> tackled this in the mid-’80s to early ’90s, but beyond that, it’s not a popular topic on stage or screen.)</p>\n<p>There are a couple twists—one involves a rather questionable Walmart purchase—that push <em>The Roommate</em> from realistic into far-fetched territory. One, unfortunately, is the ending. Again, no spoilers, but it’s a moment for Sharon that should be brimming with possibility, not hampered by implausibility.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Roommate</em> opened Sept. 12, 2024, at the Booth Theatre.

Photo credit: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>At the beginning of <em>The Roommate</em>, Mia Farrow and Patti LuPone come onstage and acknowledge the audience’s enthusiastic clapping as the play’s credits are projected behind them. The two performers are right to bask in the adulation, since their star power and hugely enjoyable performances are the primary reasons to see Jen Silverman’s play receiving its world premiere after numerous regional productions.</p>\n<p>The wispier-than-gossamer plot involves the <em>Odd Couple</em>-like pairing of two very different characters who find themselves unlikely roommates in a large Iowa house owned by empty-nester Sharon (Farrow). Sharon has apparently placed an ad somewhere that’s been answered by the tough-talking Robyn (LuPone), who’s driven there all the way from the Bronx. Why should this urbanite, lesbian, vegan, crafter of voodoo dolls, leather-jacket wearing, slam poetry performer decide to take up residence in the American heartland? Unfortunately for the purposes of this review, that’s something you’ll have to see the play to find out.</p>\n<p>Resembling the pilot for an unproduced sitcom about two wacky characters who get into a series of crazy misadventures, the evening proves diverting despite the surprisingly sluggish staging by the normally reliable Jack O’Brien. It’s fun to watch the pigtail-wearing, seemingly eternally innocent Sharon respond to Robyn’s series of revelations about her urban lifestyle, which also involves frequent indulging in “medicinal herbs.” You won’t be surprised to learn that by the end of the evening, Sharon has discovered her inner pot-smoking lesbian, as well as some other naughty personality traits she’s picked up from her new roomie who has quite a few secrets to reveal.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/09/12/the-roommate-bronx-bad-girl-meet-midwestern-nervous-nellie/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★☆☆ </a><em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/09/12/the-roommate-bronx-bad-girl-meet-midwestern-nervous-nellie/\">review here</a>.</em>]</p>\n<p>The sort of boulevard comedy that used to appear on Broadway with regularity, <em>The Roommate</em> definitely benefits from the presence of its formidable leads, although it’s hard not to think that it would have been more interesting if the casting had been reversed. LuPone, wearing a wig that could charitably be described as one used by a character looking to conceal her identity, turns out to the unlikely straight man of the duo but still manages to score laughs with her bewildered reactions to her counterpart’s bottomless naivete.</p>\n<p>Farrow, easily convincing as a 65-year-old thanks to her seemingly ageless beauty, demonstrates that her many years working with Woody Allen definitely honed her comic chops (if not her peace of mind). She expertly channels Betty White’s Rose Nylund from <em>The Golden Girls</em> with Sharon’s amusing befuddlement and sweet eagerness to please, and is even funnier when the character comes to gleefully embrace her darker side. She’s also heartbreaking in the play’s final moments, when Sharon faces devastating feelings of loss that she never could have predicted.</p>\n<p>Despite the fine efforts of the performers and solid production values including music by an overqualified David Yazbek, <em>The Roommate</em>, running 100 minutes without an intermission, always feels predictable despite its procession of narrative surprises designed for easy laughs. But that’s no reason not to take advantage of the unique opportunity to watch Farrow and LuPone play off each other with the expert comic timing of seasoned vaudevillians.</p>\n<p><strong>The Roommate opened September 12, 2024 at the Booth Theatre and runs through December 15.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If it’s Broadway clowning you want, with zany antics, extended gaggery, and wholesale chomping of the scenery (not to mention the props), hie thee to the Kingdom of Hudson on West Forty-Fourth Street, where Sutton Foster and friends romp their way through <em>Once Upon a Mattress</em>. Playgoers who don’t care to laugh, or guffaw, or wince at jabs and puns and hold their sides for the sake of decorum need not attend.</p>\n<p>This fractured fairy-tale version of Hans Christian Andersen’s 200-year old “Princess and the Pea” was whipped up in 1959 by composer Mary Rodgers, lyricist Marshall Barer, and bookwriters Barer, Jay Thompson, and Dean Fuller. Revived on Broadway in 1996 (albeit by a director and production team who didn’t seem to realize that the show was supposed to be funny), <em>Once Upon a Mattress</em> has been somewhat overlooked of late—which makes this new-generation revisitation a welcome surprise.</p>\n<p>The folks at City Center saw fit to give <em>Mattress</em> the Encores! treatment in January. Buoyed by the performances of Foster (as Princess Winifred the Woebegone) and fellow mummer Michael Urie (as Prince Dauntless who falls “in love with a girl named Fred”), director Lear deBessonet’s production offered a fast-paced joust of mischievously medieval joy.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/08/12/once-upon-a-mattress-medieval-hellzapoppin-with-laughs-for-days/\"><em>Read Bob Verini’s </em> ★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The low comedy quotient was to be expected; this was the show that launched, back in the Eisenhower administration, the career of Carol Burnett. Burnett’s backwoods moat-swimming rustic Amazonian act proved impossible to follow by performers as diverse as Imogene Coca, Dody Goodman, Jane Connell, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Tracey Ullman.</p>\n<p>Foster—whose career has taken her from the tap-dancing <em>Thoroughly Modern Millie</em> to the good-time-girl Reno Sweeney of <em>Anything Goes</em> to the sensitive <em>Violet</em> to that meat-pie pummeling Mrs. Lovett—is nothing if not a specimen of all-round musical theatre versatility. That range in itself doesn’t necessarily translate into knockabout low-comedy top-banana ability, however. Suffice it to say that Foster’s got a bit of that old Burnett/Lahr/Nancy Walker buffoonery in her backpack—without which, methinks, this <em>Mattress</em> would not be so mirthful.</p>\n<p>Urie, another performer who has demonstrated a knack for high comedy (and highly neurotic comedy), also outdoes himself. While Prince Dauntless appears to have been intended as a mere featured foil for his Princess Fred, Urie elevates the role to something of co-star status. While I can’t imagine many <em>Mattress</em> watchers recalling who played the role formerly, present-day audiences are likely to relish the added value provided by the present prince.</p>\n<p>If the Foster-Urie team has enhanced their skillfully constructed hilarity, and if there are other improved performances on display at the Hudson, the new production does not seem quite so off-the-wall frisky as it did this winter. The recent Encores! transfers of <em>Parade</em> and <em>Into the Woods</em> (to say nothing of the NYTW transfer of <em>Merrily We Roll Along</em>) seem to have been lavished with enhancements and improvements on their way to Broadway. Not quite so, here. Does the reduced size of choreographer Lorin Lattaro’s dance ensemble cut down the ebullience formerly seen in the gimmicky-by-design dance ensembles (starting with “An Opening for a Princess”)? Are music supervisor Mary-Mitchell Campbell and conductor Annbritt duChateau hampered by the reduction from 26 musicians to 16? Or is it due to the switch from the original 1959 orchestrations (Hershy Kay-Arthur Beck-Carroll Huxley) to what seems to be Bruce Coughlin’s effective but less rambunctious 1996 reduction?</p>\n<p>David Zinn’s Encores! scenery, with on-stage band platform, has been retained for the move. So have the costumes of Andrea Hood, although they don’t seem quite so comic-book colorful. On the other hand, lighting designer Justin Townsend (a new addition to the team) adds a palate of popsicle colors that are most helpful. Director deBessonet’s drolly comic touch remains in full flourish, while Amy Sherman-Palladino’s adaptation of the original script breezes along.</p>\n<p>There would likely have been no Broadway transfer sans Foster and Urie, but four of the other six principal players have been recast with varying results. Let’s dwell on the improvements: Daniel Breaker, who developed his comedy chops as the Donkey alongside Foster’s Princess Fiona in the 2008 <em>Shrek The Musical</em>, makes a swell song-and-dance narrator of the proceedings. (One of the miscues of the Encores! staging, for this viewer, was the change in emphasis of the Jester to a more modernistic persona.) Brooks Ashmanskas, too, brings added value as the Wizard. Otherwise, Ana Gasteyer (as Queen Aggravain) and Will Chase (as Prince Harry) join the cast while David Patrick Kelly (as the silent King) and Nikki Renée Daniels (as Lady Larken) have accompanied Foster and Urie for the move.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_21653\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-21653\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21653\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20-Ana-Gasteyer-Michael-Urie-in-Once-Upon-A-Mattress-credit-Joan-Marcus_334.jpg?resize=1200%2C927&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"927\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20-Ana-Gasteyer-Michael-Urie-in-Once-Upon-A-Mattress-credit-Joan-Marcus_334.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20-Ana-Gasteyer-Michael-Urie-in-Once-Upon-A-Mattress-credit-Joan-Marcus_334.jpg?resize=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20-Ana-Gasteyer-Michael-Urie-in-Once-Upon-A-Mattress-credit-Joan-Marcus_334.jpg?resize=1024%2C791&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20-Ana-Gasteyer-Michael-Urie-in-Once-Upon-A-Mattress-credit-Joan-Marcus_334.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-21653\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ana Gasteyer and Michael Urie in Once Upon a Mattress. Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Once Upon a Mattress</em> offers laughs galore; flights of melody highlighted by the light-hearted romantic ballad “In a Little While,” that upbeat paean to “Normandy,” and that clarion-blasted swamp-heroine’s lament, “Shy”; and is likely to leave a wide grin on the face of happy playgoers. While it is not strictly a family musical just for families, it is sure to inculcate an appreciation for low-brow musical comedy artistry in younger audiences so bring ’em along.</p>\n<p><strong>Once Upon a Mattress opened August 12, 2024 at the Hudson Theatre and runs through November 30.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the original production of <em>Once Upon a Mattress</em> back in 1959, the consummate clown Carol Burnett became an established star. In this year’s revival, first at Encores! and now at Broadway’s Hudson Theater, the established star Sutton Foster is revealed as a consummate clown. There were always hints of her inner farceuse, most notably in <em>The Drowsy Chaperone </em>(2006), when as stage star Janet Van De Graaff she demonstrated every talent known in The Biz while insisting “I don’t want to show off.” But under Lear deBessonet’s direction she pulls out every farcical stop, and her delight in showing off is palpable. Amidst a sea of comedic talents, she stands first among equals, and my jaw is still aching from smiling.</p>\n<p>This medieval vaudeville has long been the gateway drug for generations of kids who’ve gone from school productions to become full-fledged theater geeks. Librettists Jay Thompson, Dean Fuller and Marshall Barer saw in the classic yarn of “The Princess and the Pea” the basis for both a sassy parody of fairy-tale tropes, and a touching tale of pairs of true lovers finding each other against all odds. (Some light adaptation from <em>Gilmore Girls’ </em>Amy Sherman-Palladino tightens things up with some new gags.) With opportunities for every member of the ensemble to shine, and a sprightly, toe-tapper of a score from Mary Rodgers (music) and Barer (lyrics), <em>Once Upon a Mattress</em> has gotten familiar but never gets old; and if it ever felt tarnished, Foster and Co. do a lot to bring the luster back.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/08/12/once-upon-a-mattress-sutton-foster-of-the-swamps-reigns-triumphant/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>In the star’s <em>tour de force</em> as Princess Winnifred the Woebegone from the dank marshes of the north, spindly-limbed and ready for action, you can sense loving <em>hommages</em> to comics of the past. Emerging from a moat to the shock of the court of wicked Queen Aggravain (Ana Gasteyer), the detritus that drops from her soggy smock is a reminder of burglar Harpo Marx’s loot endlessly crashing to the floor. (“I can’t imagine what’s keeping that coffee pot,” ad-libbed Groucho….<em>klunk</em>.) The hungry princess scarfing down a gallon of grapes evokes Lucy Ricardo on the chocolates’ conveyor belt. And when the mood strikes her, she breaks the fourth wall to toss flowers and more to delighted spectators, exactly the way I saw Danny Kaye do in <em>Two By Two </em>(not to mention Dame Edna)<em>. </em>None of this is to suggest theft on Foster’s part. Staunchly in the <em>commedia</em> tradition, she makes every bit of <em>lazzi </em>her very own.</p>\n<p>It helps that she’s got a great partner. As her intended Prince Dauntless, Michael Urie not only manages to stay wide-eyed and breathless for two solid hours – no mean feat, that – but he’s able to pull off a cringing-at-mama act while protecting the potential to come into his own at the end, which he does, most royally. He’s a hoot with no trace of the cutes, always a danger in that role.</p>\n<p>Knowing that a vaudeville must also be a variety show, deBessonet has cast Nikki Renée Daniels and Will Chase as her romantic leads, thus ensuring killer voices with comic chops to match. The suave Daniel Breaker (<em>Passing Strange</em>) pulls off his narrator function with grace and charm, with the always-welcome Brooks Ashmanskas as a feckless Wizard in over his head. The entire ensemble exudes endless verve, clad in Andrea Hood’s primary-color medieval duds as if they all jumped out of a tapestry. It’s all good enough to eat, sez I. Moms and dads, you can safely take the kids, and you’ll have every bit as good a time as they will.</p>\n<p>Is there anything to regret in this knock-‘em-out-with-boffo-laughs approach? Maybe a little. Foster bursts in with all the optimistic energy of a field hockey team captain; she is in no way woebegone (notwithstanding her title) and never truly vulnerable, so some poignancy moments are sacrificed. For her part Gasteyer, suitably Maleficent-like in her appearance, never quite commands her terrain as the late Jane White did in the original production. Without a genuine despot in the driver’s seat, there’s little threat. If only Cole Escola could find some time away from <em>Oh, Mary!</em>, I kept thinking, Mrs. Lincoln would find the Queen a role worth quitting the White House for. Now <em>that</em> would be a battle royale.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Once Upon a Mattress opened August 12, 2024 at the Hudson Theatre and runs through November 30.

Photo credit: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When a play begins with one character pointing a gun at another, it’s bound to get your attention.</p>\n<p>That’s certainly the case with Max Wolf Friedlich’s <em>Job</em>, newly transferred to Broadway after a hit Off-Broadway run. Theater veteran Peter Friedman and Sydney Lemmon (Jack’s granddaughter, recently seen in HBO’s <em>Succession</em>) star in this charged two-hander about a fateful encounter between a therapist and his new patient.</p>\n<p>It’s an arresting opening, to be sure, effectively signaling that the playwright seems intent on keeping the audience in suspense throughout the 80-minute one-act which feels simultaneously underdeveloped and attenuated. The story revolves around Loyd (Friedman), an aging, earring-wearing hippieish shrink who designs crafts in his spare time, and Jane (Lemmon), a young woman seeing him for the first time.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/07/30/job-an-unfiltered-drama-for-the-social-media-age/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Jane is not there to deal with garden-variety neuroses. She’s there because the company for which she works is forcing her to be evaluated after a workplace meltdown that went viral on the internet. She works in “User Care” for a social media company, which basically means that she must screen its content for disturbing material, of which there is apparently plenty. “I had a bad day,” she explains in deadpan fashion to Loyd while he watches the video of her epic meltdown on her phone (we only hear her screaming).</p>\n<p>Since the session began with him being held at gunpoint, Loyd is not surprisingly skittish as it continues, at one point jumping out of his chair and screaming in terror as she absentmindedly reaches into her tote bag. And Jane proves less than enthusiastic about having to be there, commenting, “I’m not sure therapy aligns with how I deal with things.”</p>\n<p>We’re kept constantly disoriented throughout the play, with the therapy session periodically interrupted by bizarre sound and lighting effects that signal, well, it’s hard to say. Perhaps Jane’s disturbed state of mind, perhaps that things aren’t quite what they seem, or perhaps that the playwright is aiming more for shock value than coherence. Certainly, the proceedings don’t smack of realism, with Loyd telling his new patient details about tragic events from his life in a way no therapist would. But then again, if he didn’t, the shocking plot twist toward the end wouldn’t make sense.</p>\n<p>That climactic revelation ultimately proves the play’s raison d’etre, and it’s neither convincing nor well earned. Even worse, Friedlich hedges his bets with a deliberately ambiguous climax that smacks less of, say, Pinter, than a writer unsure as to how to end his play.</p>\n<p>Not that the 80 minutes — let’s be generous by ignoring the fact that in real life the session would have ended in 45 — aren’t reasonably compelling. The playwright reveals a gift for sharp dialogue, with the tension frequently broken by some very funny lines. Director Michael Herwitz has staged the talky proceedings for maximum visceral effect, keeping us on edge throughout, and the two performers deliver riveting performances (even if Lemmon occasionally has trouble making herself heard in this larger theater).</p>\n<p>For all the effective stagecraft on display, however, <em>Job</em> (even the title, which many people will assume refers to the Old Testament book, is deliberately confusing) mainly smacks of gimmickry. It’s a psychological thriller that relies too heavily on cheap thrills.</p>\n<p><b>Job opened July 30, 2024, at the Helen Hayes Theater and runs through September 29.

Where Peter Sellers had his Dr. Strangelove, Betty White had her Sue Ann Nivens and Sacha Baron Cohen had his Borat, author/star Cole Escola has their Mary Todd Lincoln: boozy, narcissistic, pottymouthed, and determined to strike out of the subordinate role into which history has placed her.</span></p>\n<p>Escola, who has been packing them in at the Lucille Lortel downtown prior to this transfer to Broadway’s venerable (and Ford’s Theater-like) Lyceum, cops to having done little or no research on our 16th president’s melancholy spouse, and these over-the-top antics over 80 eventful minutes confirm it. This Mary’s unhappiness hinges not on family tragedies, for instance. (There’s many a hearty laugh at the notion that she gives a fig for her kids, or for the Civil War for that matter.) No, her despair is fueled by what she claims was a robust career as a cabaret performer, cruelly cut short by an ambitious husband’s lust for power. (I don’t recall that tidbit from Carl Sandburg’s Lincoln biography, though the tome would’ve been the livelier for its inclusion.)</p>\n<p>O.K., so this isn’t the Mary Todd Lincoln we know. But that’s no barrier to recognizing the astonishingness of what Escola, this gifted artist, has crafted. Mary flounces about in designer Holly Pierson’s black taffeta hoopskirt with a seeming mind of its own, choosing to reveal multicolor panties at strategic moments. Her stringy curls (Leah J. Loukas deserves a special Tony for the wig alone) snap like a whipcrack with every suspicious glare or vicious putdown. The contortions to locate hidden hooch make Nic Cage in <em>Leaving Las Vegas</em> look like a teetotaler; and unlike Mary, Nic wouldn’t stoop to ingest paint thinner as a last resort. This remarkable creature is pure ego without a filter, and it’s a riot to see the Great Emancipator’s better half act out what we know secretly lies in many celebrities’ heart of hearts.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/07/11/oh-mary-dont-ask-for-subtle-comedy/\"><em>Read Michael Sommers’ </em>★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>She’s an original, but as with any original character, the auteur clearly owes debts. To the iconic campy Charleses Ludlam and Busch, for one, who rose out of Greenwich Village dives to boldly normalize the outré. Also present are the influences of TV’s classic sketchmeisters, from Carol Burnett to <em>SNL</em>, whose ability to nail a comic premise and get out with no time wasted is echoed in every sequence here. If <em>I Love Lucy </em>had been set in the nineteenth century, with Lucy Ricardo’s passion to get into show business raised to maniacal overdrive and the CBS censors asleep at the audio cutoff, you’d have something very close to <em>Oh, Mary!</em></p>\n<p>Acting the dominating diva first to last, Escola still proves most generous to the rest of the company, giving each hilarious quirks and opportunities to shine. As Mary’s companion (and snitch), Bianca Leigh always seems ready to bring calm reason to the scene until she lets go with some outrage. James Scully as Mary’s suave acting coach, and Tony Macht as the president’s gullible aide, make strong comic impressions while appearing downright normal by contrast with the star. And in the toughest supporting role, Conrad Ricamora ably walks the fine line between embodying a dignified archetype and hinting at nutty passions within. You can sense the real Abe there. Honest.</p>\n<p>The script, and the direction of Sam Pinkleton (erstwhile choreographer of <em>Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812</em>), start things off at too high a level that eventually leads to some lulls. And Mary’s character arc, while necessarily schizophrenic, could be laid out more cleanly. But with this many laughs and surprises at every juncture, who can be bothered to carp? Does the show merit multiple viewings during its limited run? And is there more than enough room and incentive for a sequel? Oh, Mary, don’t ask.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Oh, Mary! opened July 11, 2024 at the Lyceum Theatre and runs through January 19, 2025.

Photo: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A monumentally silly show, <i>Oh, Mary!</i> arrived at the Lyceum Theatre on Thursday for a 12-week Broadway engagement. Created by and starring comedian-actor-writer Cole Escola as its title figure, <i>Oh, Mary!</i> was a surprise hit Off Broadway earlier this year.</p>\n<p>By now, many readers probably are aware that Escola depicts Mary Todd Lincoln as a whiskey-steeped fruitcake who’s nutty with dreams of renewing her career as a cabaret songbird.</p>\n<p>“People traveled the world over for my short legs and long medleys,” Mary declares.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/07/11/oh-mary-lincoln-drinkin-and-todd/\"><em>Read Bob Verini’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>A ribald cartoon more hysterical than historical, <i>Oh, Mary!</i> sheds unexpected light upon the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and represents the latest generation of gender bent comical entertainment known as camp. Elder viewers reared on the comparatively subtle writing and performance style of Charles Busch are likely to find Escola’s slapdash artistry crude, but there’s no denying he snags laughs.</p>\n<p>Skittering about in voluminous black skirts, corkscrew curls bobbing, Mary weaves and staggers around the presidential office in relentless pursuit of liquor and her ambitions to become a star. Mary’s long-suffering spouse Abraham, who describes her as “foul and hateful,” meanwhile is distracted by suppressed desires of his own and concluding the Civil War with the south.</p>\n<p>“The south of what?” wonders self-centered Mary.</p>\n<p>In an 80-minute series of blackout comedy scenes, Mary rejects embroidery lessons in favor of swilling paint thinner, demoralizes a genteel chaperone and soon gets entangled romantically with a hunky acting teacher, although she feels little need for his Shakespearean coaching. “There is no difference between theater and cabaret,” Mary opines. “Theater is just fewer feathers and flatter shoes.” Eventually and in spite of tragic events, Mary triumphs.</p>\n<p>I blush to admit that Escola is an artist new to me and their charm eludes me so far. Still, it can be amusing to observe the naked ambition that drives Escola’s Mary as she blithely smashes furniture and everybody who gets in her way. This gimlet-eyed termagant’s ruthless egotism is exceeded only by her risibly woeful acting abilities when she auditions to play a role in <i>Our American Cousin</i> at Ford’s Theater.</p>\n<p>It is curious how <i>Oh, Mary!</i> is reminiscent of those gay what-the-hell spoofs that used to pop up in downtown niteries like the basement of The Monster some forty years ago. I fondly recall seeing a musical Christmas pageant once staged there titled <i>Jesus Christ, It’s Your Birthday!</i> – but let’s exit gay memory lane and get back to Broadway, shall we?</p>\n<p>While the script may be flimsy, director Sam Pinkleton’s production looks good at the Lyceum. Before the performance begins, Pinkleton establishes a rowdy mood by foreshadowing Mary’s cabaret urges with loud pre-show recordings of Ethel Merman blasting “You’re the Top,” Barbra Streisand singing live at the Bon Soir and Patti LuPone being louche at Les Mouches. Pinkleton then paces the play’s episodic silliness very neatly with the assistance of designer Cha See’s sharply cued lighting and composer Daniel Kluger’s brisk, bright piano music.</p>\n<p>Spinning around Escola’s whirlwind of a Mary, the supporting players achieve a nice sense of spontaneity, as if they really are making up the show as it happens. Conrad Ricamora’s Lincoln desperately hangs on to his dignity until he doesn’t. James Scully cuts a dashing figure as Mary’s acting coach; Bianca Leigh looks marvelously appalled as Mary’s hapless chaperone; and Tony Macht’s rumpled little presidential aide-de-camp is not the timid pushover he appears to be.</p>\n<p>The dots design collective initially provides a prim White House interior dominated by a pair of double doors, an imposing desk used for special executive action and a portrait of George Washington looking down upon the chaos. When Mary finally realizes her dreams, a radiant heaven of swagged golden draperies and stage fog materializes for a happy ending in song and dance, which shall go undescribed per the request of the press representatives.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Oh, Mary! opened July 11, 2024 at the Lyceum Theatre and runs through January 19, 2025.

Photo credit: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Like people, some plays age better than others. More than four decades ago, I loved Samm-Art Williams’ 1979 <em>Home</em> when I first saw its Negro Ensemble Company production and then again when it transferred to Broadway for its Tony-nominated run. The work is now receiving a Broadway revival by the Roundabout Theatre Company in which its charms prove much more elusive. Although difficult to know for sure, I suspect it’s a combination of the play feeling dated and the current production being lacking in certain respects. Or maybe you just can&#8217;t go home again.</p>\n<p>The work revolves around Cephus Miles (Tory Kittles, <em>The Equalizer</em>), a young Black farmer living in North Carolina who loves nothing more than working the land — except possibly talking, which he does a lot. Mostly to the audience, as he delivers a robust account of his life’s joys and sorrows, the latter of which come to predominate as his beloved uncle and grandfather, who raised him after he became an orphan, both die, leading Cephus to whimsically conclude that God must be vacationing in Miami. Not long after, he loses his high school sweetheart, Patti Mae Wells (Brittany Inge), when she decides to go to college and winds up marrying another man.</p>\n<p>Cephus is then drafted to serve in the military in Vietnam, but being opposed to the war for religious reasons, he winds up serving five years in prison as a draft dodger. Upon his release, he heads to the big city where he becomes involved with a not-so-good woman and loses himself to the temporary pleasures of cocaine and Night Train wine. Not to worry, though, as the play ends happily when the older and wiser Cephus eventually finds his way home to his beloved North Carolina and even gets reunited with his beloved Patti Mae.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/06/05/home-is-where-the-art-is-at-roundabout/\"><em>Read Michael Sommers’ </em> ★★★☆☆<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The story is touching, but the ritualistic telling proves problematic. It’s done in large part through narration, often delivered in a poetical, incantational style that can be distancing. Not helping matters is the fact that the two female members of the cast, Stori Ayers and Inge, are tasked with playing dozens of characters which makes the already confusing narrative even harder to follow.</p>\n<p>Kenny Leon’s bare-bones staging fails to deliver much in the way of vibrant theatricality, making the intimate play feel somewhat lost in the Todd Haimes Theatre. There’s not much visual stimulation either, with set designer Arnulfo Maldonado providing little more than backdrops depicting a field of corn and an urban landscape, the latter accompanied by a fire escape. Dede Ayite’s costumes and Allen Lee Hughes’ warm lighting design can’t be faulted, however.</p>\n<p>Kittles delivers a vibrant, charismatic performance as Cephus, but he doesn’t match the buoyant charm of Charles Brown, the originator of the role. And although Inge is wonderfully endearing as Pattie Mae, she and Ayers are only sporadically effective embodying their multiple characterizations.</p>\n<p>The play’s revival ironically, and sadly, has come to serve as a memorial to its talented playwright, who died at age 78 just days before it went into previews.</p>\n<div><b>Home </b><strong>opened June 5, 2024, at the Todd Haimes Theatre and runs through July 21.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A genuine charmer, <i>Home</i> was a glowing highlight of a 1979-80 Broadway season that fielded major dramas such as <i>Betrayal</i>, <i>Talley’s Folly</i> and <i>Children of a Lesser God</i> as well as musical hits like <i>Evita</i>, <i>Barnum</i> and <i>Sugar Babies</i>.</p>\n<p>Opening on Wednesday, Roundabout Theatre Company’s revival of <i>Home</i> launches the 2024-2025 Broadway season. Let’s hope most of the incoming shows of the new season look nearly as good as <i>Home</i>.</p>\n<p>A three-actor work originally presented by the Negro Ensemble Company, <i>Home</i> may appear small in size but its story expands to reflect significant changes in African-American life during the middle parts of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/06/05/home-not-always-easy-to-go-back/\"><em style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The coming-of-age play centers upon Cephus Miles, a cheerful soul who grows up amid North Carolina’s tobacco fields. His adolescence seems mighty nice, featuring fond relatives and pals, fish fries, moonshine making, and hayloft trysts with pretty Pattie Mae. Yet distant voices keep urging Cephus to quit the farm for the big city.</p>\n<p>A good farmer, Cephus inherits family acres, but troubles arise. Loved ones pass on, Pattie Mae marries somebody else, and when his draft card for the Vietnam conflict arrives, Cephus objects conscientiously to killing. His farm gets sold for taxes while Cephus is confined in federal prison. Maligned as a coward back home following his release, Cephus runs off to the city.</p>\n<p>Cephus’ checkered adventures up North and eventual return to the farm – and his realization how society has evolved over the years even down South – are satisfyingly rendered by author Samm-Art Williams. Often spoken directly to the audience by its characters, the dramedy offers an easygoing blend of narrative, rapturous poetry and ever a warm sense of human comedy, all tied up with a surprise that concludes the story with happy laughter.</p>\n<p>With its often poetic language, Williams’ storytelling is so disarmingly intimate that one nearly overlooks how his larger canvas regards the mass migration of Black Americans from the rural South to the urban centers of the North during the last century.</p>\n<p>In their pleasing Broadway debuts, three capable actors better known for their television credits help to make <i>Home</i> an enjoyable place to spend 90 minutes.</p>\n<p>A genial Cephus, Tory Kittles (“The Equalizer”) never once leaves the stage and yet credibly depicts this companionable fellow through his times as a hot and bothered teenager to a battered, middle-aged bum to a man secure in his sunset prime, while effectively suggesting the character’s ages and attitudes between those lifetime points.</p>\n<p>Two others lend their gleaming voices and versatile physicality to deliver glimpses of dozens of people who quickly pass in and out of Cephus’ world. Most notably they portray contrasting women: Brittany Inge (“Atlanta”) is a sweetly demure Pattie Mae. Stori Ayers (“The Last O.G.”) is laidback yet hilarious as a hard-hearted big city mama. Every now and again they ardently perform the lovely poetic passages that illuminate the play with a special radiance.</p>\n<p>The single flaw to Roundabout’s nice revival is some questionable pacing by Kenny Leon, the director, whose recent Broadway staging of <i>Purlie Victorious</i> was marred by its headlong speed.</p>\n<p>Here, the lyrical opening passages of <i>Home</i> intended to evoke the long ago rural South are nearly lost in the breakneck speed they are spoken. Other poetic sections tend to rush by, too, suggesting that Leon doesn’t trust the audience to appreciate their beauty.</p>\n<p>Leon otherwise gives his well-acted production sufficient atmosphere. A longtime collaborator with Leon, the great Allen Lee Hughes expertly designs sunlight and moonlight and passages of time. Simple, painterly settings designed by Arnulfo Maldonado always keep a patch of those homeland fields in view even when Cephus strays far away. Perhaps just as crucial to the production’s impact is how the designer uses simple fabric borders to reduce the expansive size of the proscenium frame of the Todd Haimes Theatre so the actors can commune more closely with the audience.</p>\n<p><b>Home </b><strong>opened June 5, 2024, at the Todd Haimes Theatre and runs through July 21.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><br />\nThere is not a word of dialogue in <i>Illinoise, </i>but this hybrid production fusing dance and music accomplishes far more than mere words can express. Inspired by Sufjan Stevens’ groundbreaking concept album, <em>Illinois</em>, choreographer Justin Peck came up with his own theatrical concept. With Jackie Sibblies Drury as co–book writer, they crafted a narrative that translates the emotional import of Stevens songs into a unique language that can best be described as poetry in motion.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The 90-minute work is divided into three parts. In the first, we are introduced to Henry (Ricky Ubeda), a young man who seems adrift. He leaves his partner and wanders into a setting that is described in the <em>Playbill</em> as “A special air-filled, hard-to-reach place, where individual people become a community by sharing stories and imagining each other…lit by a campfire.” </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">From the album, the song “Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois” (referred to in the show as “Three Stars”) is a hauntingly beautiful piece. But like much of the production, don’t look for literal representations. Peck, as both director and choreographer, aims for mood, tone, and abstractions in some cases. The opening number sets the stage for a dreamy quality that conveys a figurative rather than literal illustration of the music. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/26/illinoise-stevens-sung-and-danced\">[<em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Each member of the campfire group has a journal or diary which they’re encouraged to share. From “Come On! Feel the Illinoise,” they chant the refrain:<br />\n</span><span class=\"s1\"><i>Are you writing from the heart?<br />\n</i></span><span class=\"s1\"><i>Are you writing from the heart?</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Henry is reluctant at first. But others volunteer. Among the more colorful is “a story about Zombies” set to Stevens’ song “They Are Night Zombies!!” in which Jeanette Delgado is terrorized by dancers wearing zombie masks. They’re revealed to be historic figures—Andrew Jackson, Christopher Columbus, Joseph McCarthy, Ronald Reagan, among others. Presumably it’s a comment on the hold these infamous and controversial figures have on us, even from the dead. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Another camper (Alejandro Vargas) steps up to tell the ghoulish story of serial killer John Wayne Gacy who murdered 27 young men outside of Chicago. Heinous as it is, the lyrics<br />\n</span><span class=\"s1\"><i>And in my best behavior<br />\n</i></span><span class=\"s1\"><i>I am really just like him<br />\n</i></span><span class=\"s1\"><i>Look beneath the floor boards<br />\n</i></span><span class=\"s1\"><i>For the secrets I have hid<br />\n</i></span><span class=\"s1\">imply that we have more in common with Gacy than we think. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">And then to lighten the mood we have Brandt Martinez in a Superman T dancing to the upbeat “The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts.” Mid-song the company cuts loose in an explosion of limbs and body parts flailing gleefully. Moments like that are exhilarating to watch.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The second part brings us Henry’s story, and it is a profoundly captivating tale concerning Henry’s friendship with Carl (Ben Cook) and Shelby (Gaby Diaz). As a young man exploring his sexuality, he starts to think of Carl as something more than a friend. They drive to New York together but the relationship takes a dramatic turn when Henry meets Douglas (Ahmad Simmons) and Shelby takes ill. Carl returns to Illinois to be with Shelby, whom he deeply loves, but Henry decides to stay in New York. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The narrative flows seamlessly from joy to grief to self discovery and eventually liberation. It hits home thanks in large part to the three lead performers who prove themselves equally adept at acting as they are at dancing. Ubeda and Diaz won back-to-back seasons of <em>So You Think You Can Dance</em> but all of them have extensive professional credits which enable them to display tremendous versatility on the St. James stage. I was especially moved by Diaz and Cook’s heartbreaking pas de deux. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If there’s one word to describe the show, it is eclectic. Stevens’ music is often described as indie rock, folk, pop, electronica, you name it. And his lyrics run deep.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>His vast talents as songwriter, composer, singer, and musician easily explain how <em>Illinois</em> was named the best reviewed album of 2005 by Metacritic. With a terrific 14-piece band, he should be very pleased with the quality of the music conducted by the very animated music director Nathan Koci. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Stevens is matched by Peck’s mastery of dance.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>He puts his superb company through their paces with a seeming limitless array of genres, from ballet to modern to tap. The entire effort is marked by a manic discipline in which the movements come off as both organic and controlled. And it can be whimsically inventive as when he speeds the passage of time by choreographing the company to move in fast forward. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A very special mention to the three singers who are also skilled musicians. Elijah Lyons, Tasha Viets-VanLear, and Shara Nova (who performed on the <em>Illinois</em> album) have out-of-this-world voices…at times you’d almost swear they did step off a UFO. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Scenic and lighting designs by Adam Rigg and Brandon Stirling Baker, respectively, provide the perfect backdrop for this intimate work. Picking up from the album art, they paint the ideal setting with ample space for the cast to strut their stuff.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">As successful as <i>Illinoise</i> is as a narrative dance musical, it is somewhat esoteric and likely not everyone’s cup of tea. But even for those folks who may find it artistically challenging, there is much to appreciate. <i>Illinoise</i> is a wonderfully collaborative effort that raises the “barre” for Broadway musicals moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\"><em>Illinoise</em> opened April 24, 2024, at the St. James Theatre and runs through Aug. 10.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anthropologist Polly Wiessner has conjectured that fireside storytelling likely began 400,000 years ago when humans learned to control fire. So book writers Justin Peck and Jackie Sibblies Drury are on to something with their stage adaptation of Sufjan Stevens’ beloved 2005 concept album, <em>Illinois</em>, the second in the every-state series he projected then but doesn’t seem to have lengthened.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They call the resulting dance piece—New York City Ballet artistic adviser Peck being one of our foremost choreographers—<em>Illinoise</em>. It indeed takes place around a campfire, which immediately lends it historical, not to say pre-historical, weight.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pulitzer Prize–winning playwright Drury (<em>Fairview</em>) has said that when Peck approached her to work on adapting Stevens for the stage—all dance, no dialogue—she “wasn’t sure what I would do.” She’s confessed that the prospective enterprise “sounded like crazy time.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She may have a kernel of truth there. There’s no denying that <em>Illinoise </em>is effective, a large billboard on Adam Rigg’s industrial-slash-forest set announcing the title as well as other information. It may be that longtime Stevens fans need only hear the material they love now presented as dance to carry on about it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/26/illinoise-good-noise-to-dance-to/\">[<em>Read Roma Torre’s</em> ★★★★☆<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But providing the cherished songs with a connecting plot hasn’t necessarily resulted in an instantly graspable tale. (Aside from giving his okay, Stevens was not involved in the transfer.) Yes, it’s clear that most of Stevens’ <em>Illinois</em> songs are used for the fireside stories told. It couldn’t be clearer as the dancers gather and gather again around a supposed campfire and then disperse to dance each subsequent story.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What wasn’t clear, at least not to this spectator, is that the stories told were intended to be one man’s reminiscence. They position confused figure Henry (Ricky Ubeda) trying to make sense of his life. They focus specifically on his romantic longing for good friend Carl (Ben Cook), who’s in love with Shelby (Gaby Diaz). They also bring on Douglas (Ahmad Simmons) as Henry’s eventual replacement for Carl.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s an abundance of tender kissing, often on the top of the head, but how it relates to earlier recollections of Illinois-born serial killer John Wayne Gacy isn’t immediately obvious. Neither is the relevance of another earlier tale featuring hooded zombies holding signs identifying themselves as Columbus, Ronald Reagan, Jerry Falwell, and others. Or Superman, man of steel and heart. There’s the suggestion that somehow a political point is being made, but what point and why?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stevens’ songs are sung, of course, but whereas Stevens recorded himself in signature dulcet tones at various New York City studios, <em>Illinoise</em> has three singers—Elijah Lyons as Arctiini, Shara Nova as Basine, Tasha Viets-VanLear as Nacna interpreting the cherished collection. Sporting butterfly wings, they deliver the numbers from high platforms in front of conductor Nathan Koci’s crisp band. (Butterfly wings? Stevens idolators undoubtedly get the reference.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s unfortunate, however, that the sometimes dulcet, sometimes cogently brash sounds Lyons, Nova, and Viets-VanLear deliver aren’t consistently intelligible. Occasionally lyrics are distinct—for infrequent example, “three stars” (evidently alluding to a High Park, Illinois, UFO sighting) and “writing from the heart,” always a valuable place to write from. All the same, too many words are lost, surely a challenge for often Grammy-nominated sound designer Garth MacAleavy. (Stevens, a song man but not a song and dance man, is probably keeping his opinions to himself.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foremost, though, and as instigated by Peck, <em>Illinoise</em> is built to be danced. In addition to those already named, the troupe includes Christine Flores, Byron Tittle, Kara Chan, Rachel Lockhart, Alejandro Vargas, Jeanette Delgado, Brandt Martinez, and Craig Salstein. There’s no gainsaying that they’re a game troupe, ready to throw themselves into every routine created by Peck (Tony winner for the most recent and possibly most danced <em>Carousel</em> ever). Tittle gets a tap turn and turns it into a showstopper.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quick glance at the dancers’ bios shows they all have Broadway résumés to gloat over, but only Salstein and Delgado have histories with ballet troupes. It isn’t that <em>Illinoise</em> stresses ballet; it doesn&#8217;t. But somehow in the dancing there’s the sense that at times Peck looked for the dancers to acquit themselves more sleekly, with more finish.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps he didn’t—certainly he did ask for a kind of awkwardness to fit characterizations—but the choreographic repetitions that crop up as the work progresses suggest that eventually something is lacking. They’re repetitions incorporated into dances intended to accompany quite different stories.  On the other hand, Peck has been quoted saying he wants to strip the “elite” aura from ballet. Perhaps he wants things precisely this way.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A word to the wise: The <em>Playbill</em> comes with a booklet featuring an unidentified species butterfly on the cover. (Anyone want to bet that Stevens can name it?) Inside is Henry’s diary (Drury’s text) scrawled—with deliberately crude illustrations—over 18 pages explaining what’s taking place during <em>Illinoise</em>. The wise ticket buyer will consult it first, thus forgoing all the dance musical’s real-time guesswork.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Illinoise</em> opened April 24, 2024, at the St. James Theatre and runs through Aug. 10.

Photo: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy review. The subject is <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, the out-of-copyright F. Scott Fitzgerald classic now a musical(!), and, pssst, it’s not the one opening in May at Cambridge’s American Repertory Theater.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the one on Broadway right now with book by Kait Kerrigan, music by Jason Howland, lyrics by Nathan Tysen, directed by Marc Bruni, and choreographed by Dominique Kelley. It’s Fitzgerald’s bestseller forcibly brought to the stage by a self-appointed group of eager musicalizers, even if their enhancement(?) is hardly required of a book considered by many the great American novel &#8212; or one of the few great 20th-century American novels, a novel from which not a single word need be removed or added.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But whoa, credit deserves to be given where it’s due. Fitzgerald’s basic <em>Great Gatsby </em>plot has been retained &#8212; well, uh, most of it. Bookwriter Kerrigan, a first-rate lyricist herself, has lifted a large portion of the dialogue, and Tysen has appropriated dialogue and descriptions to develop as lyrics. Notably, Kerrigan includes Fitzgerald’s opening lines and the very last, which may be the most gasp-inducing closing utterance of any stateside novel ever.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/25/the-great-gatsby-all-that-glitters-but-short-on-depth/\"><em>Read Sandy MacDonald’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The year is 1922, and Midwestern-resettled-on-West-Egg-Long-Island Nick Carraway (Noah J. Ricketts), who serves as narrator, lives in a $80-per-month cottage belonging to mysteriously rich Jay Gatsby (Jeremy Jordan), who owns the adjacent mansion. (The shady source of the mogul’s wealth is revealed much later.) By luck, Carraway’s second-cousin-once-removed, Daisy Buchanan (Eva Noblezada), lives in nearby East Egg, and flamboyant party-giver Gatsby is intent on rekindling the romance he enjoyed with her in Louisville before he went to the Great War.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Impoverished then, he couldn’t expect to marry Daisy. Wallowing in wherewithal now, though, he aspires to undo her marriage to horse-owner and incorrigible philander Tom Buchanan (John Zdrojeski), who’s currently wooing Myrtle Wilson (Sara Chase). She’s the dissatisfied wife to oblivious car-service owner George Wilson (Paul Whitty). The ensuing disasters caused by the conflicting entangled relationships are seen through Carraway’s eyes, even as he begins a neither-here-nor-there romance with Daisy’s best friend, golf pro Jordan Baker (Samantha Pauly).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The surface plot is what Kerrigan, Howland, and Tysen give the audience, gussied up big time by Paul Tate dePoo III’s proscenium-bursting sets and production, Linda Cho’s gorgeous period three-piece suits and fashionable frocks, Cory Pattak’s blazing lights, and Brian Ronan’s resounding sound.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than that, Bruni repeatedly places the principals downstage front and center to belt – is “whip” a more descriptive verb? &#8212; the many mediocre power-ballads Howland and Tysen unleash: “For Her,” “My Green Light,” “Past is Catching Up to Me,” “Beautiful Little Fool.” Like any numbers of this season’s loud tuners, they feature high notes strategized to cause audience response not just at their codas but at mid-point. The goal is regularly and successfully met. Choreographer Kelley does the same goal-reaching without too many surprises.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, what’s dished out from this <em>Great Gatsby </em>appropriation is more than enough to give many audiences what they came to see, mainly perhaps audience members who’ve never read the novel and reasonably assume that what’s being presented them on a silver Tiffany platter is Fitzgerald.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It isn’t. <em>The Great Gatsby</em> &#8212; published in 1925 when Princeton-educated Fitzgerald was 29 and steeped in the pluses and minuses of The Roaring Twenties &#8212; is his somber take on the superficial, even destructive behavior of his contemporaries. It’s a serious commentary about his own going along with it. Indeed, it’s nothing less than a tragedy in the long-defined sense. Now, it’s definitely permissible to reshape material as long as the adapters retain the author’s intent.  What’s impermissible is betraying the author’s intent.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which this team commits. In the novel, Carraway talks of disliking all the prominent figures he’s been observing. Bookwriter Kerrigan does repeat his description of Daisy and Tom as “careless people.” (Tom’s outspoken bigotry is ignored.) But toward the denouement, the increasingly aware Nick shouts to Gatsby, “They’re a rotten crowd. You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.” What the bookwriter overlooks is Nick’s immediately thinking to himself that he indeed ranks Gatsby among them: “It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him beginning to end.” Not so incidentally, Nick isn’t quite Fitzgerald’s character, either. Instead, Jordan and he are start-to-finish retooled as that staple of 1950s musical standbys: the weightless secondary romantic team.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, what Kerrigan and cohorts crucially leave out is arriviste’s Gatsby’s background, what he tragically thought would be his path to a truly good life in the optimistic, wrong-headed post-war decade. This <em>Great Gatsby </em>chooses to skip over Jay Gatsby’s being born and raised as James Gatz, a poor boy with not much more than a desire to better himself however he might, a fellow primed to associate with shady businessmen as his ticket to make the millions that’ll finally win him properly trained but insubstantial debutante Daisy.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This musical take on <em>The Great Gatsby</em> presents Jay Gatsby and Daisy Fay Buchanan as a sympathetic couple caught in unfortunate Jazz Age circumstances. In other words, the transfiguration of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s <em>The Great Gatsby</em> is, sorry to report, a travesty.</span></p>\n<p><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">The Great Gatsby </b><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened April 25, 2024, at the Broadway Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Zimmerman and Evan Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s open season for <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, now that the copyright for F. Scott Fitzgerald’s beloved 1925 classic—30 million copies sold!— has expired. We got a rather tacky “immersive” version at the Park Central Hotel last summer. Rachel Chavkin (<em>The Great Comet of 1812…</em>) is cooking up a Broadway-bound contender about to premiere at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge (with songs by Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine, and Thomas Bartlett, it looks promising). And meanwhile, we have an ambitious, flashy, but ill-conceived adaptation that has leaped—from all accounts, zhuzhed up a bit—from the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey.</p>\n<p>“No one ever walks out of a theater humming the scenery,” Richard Rodgers is alleged to have said. In this instance they very well might: Set designer Paul Tate dePoo III has layered in all sorts of flats and furniture and props and projections that swoop in at the speed of light. The mechanics and special effects are a never-ending marvel. Cue the fireworks—for Gatsby’s over-the-top party designed to impress his never-forgotten flame, Daisy! A voluminous double bed—for the trysting Fitzgerald opted not to spell out so literally! An actual pool—for … well, you know what the pool is for.</p>\n<p>The musicalization is off to a disconcerting start. As narrator/observer, Nick Carraway (Noah J. Ricketts), a recent Midwest transplant, is meant to serve as a classic outsider, ill at ease in the rarefied milieu of super-rich Long Island (East Egg for the to-the-manner-born and, across the sound, West Egg for shady parvenus and bootlegging racketeers). In this rendering, Ricketts is called upon to open the play with a surfeit of ambition and spunk, in the form of the song “Roaring On”—as in Roaring ’20s, nicely captured by a mixed-age bunch of actor-dancers costumed by Linda Cho and choreographed by Dominique Kelley.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/25/the-great-gatsby-fitzgeralds-roaring-20s-classic-musicalized-as-a-loud-whimper/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The crowd scenes, with flappers and gangsters cutting loose, are fun to watch. However, many of the twenty-odd songs (music by Jason Howland, lyrics by Nathan Tysen) have a been-there feel, adding to the over-stuffed gestalt of the show as a whole. As evidenced by the flashy stage effects, the creative team has apparently opted to override the clean lines and striking economy of the original text. A musical must of course be padded out with songs, and for the most part the ones assembled here are smart enough—with one peculiar exception, right at the outset.</p>\n<p>It seems downright sadistic to require a fine baritone like Jeremy Jordan (as Gatsby) to hiccup up to a semi-falsetto in his opening paean “For Her”—the “her” being Daisy Buchanan, played to lazy patrician perfection by Eva Noblezada. Jordan survives the vocal trial to sing their duets at full force, and the effect—visual overload swept to dust—is transporting. Gatsby observes at one point in the novel that Daisy’s voice is “full of money,” a quality Noblezada captures effortlessly. Her voice shimmers like candlelight cast across glistening satin.</p>\n<p>Oddly, though, the couple’s relationship doesn’t seem visceral—that king-and-then-some mattress notwithstanding. You’ll catch much more fire flashing between Daisy’s husband, Tom Buchanan (John Zdrojeski, acing the role of an insufferable snob and incorrigible bully), and his ambitious regular squeeze, Myrtle (Sara Chase). The scenes in the whorehouse where they carry out their assignations convey more heat—and humor—than anything going on back at the mansion. Ultimately, in Chase&#8217;s rendering, Myrtle’s cri de coeur when she realizes that Tom’s about to ditch her is the emotional spark point of the entire show. The audience, rapt, falls still.</p>\n<p>It’s a mistake and a distraction to play up a superfluous romance between Daisy’s best friend, the tennis pro Jordan Baker (a nicely acerbic Samantha Pauly), and the improbably gung-ho Carraway. A modern reading, accelerating in recent decades if not assertively stated at the time of publication, would put them at some remove from the heterosexual midpoint. Forcing these two characters into a bumptious rom-com fling is a step too far, and in the wrong direction.</p>\n<p>In any case, we don’t need a third couple providing presumable laughs. We’ve got two sets of tragic dyads to consider, set up by Fitzgerald as antipodes. One pair—Gatsby and Daisy, with Tom as a menacing third wheel—is grossly over-privileged. At the other end of the spectrum huddle Myrtle and her garage-mechanic husband, George (Paul Whitty, a banked fire), who live in an actual ash heap.</p>\n<p>Fitzgerald was subject to the prejudices of his era. The text has been flagged for racist, anti-immigration, and antisemitic motifs, and it’s good to see these tendencies mostly suppressed here. At a minimum, he deserves credit for posing, in stark contrast, the advantages that come with “high” birth and the cost which that privilege exacts of those less fortunate.</p>\n<p>That message comes through clearly here, despite the production team&#8217;s penchant for bells and whistles. If all you’re seeking is a spectacle, you will get one. For some real resonance and depth, though, you may just have to wait a while—or reread the book.</p>\n<p><b><em>The Great Gatsby</em> </b><strong>opened April 25, 2024, at the Broadway Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>An accomplished playwright with something to say and an unconventional but effective way of saying it. A director with an inventive method of following the path of the author’s characters. A scenic designer who latches onto a concept that perfectly and precisely enhances the text. And three malleable actors who make it all feel effortless. Mix ’em together, add a passel of dancing <em>cucarachas</em> (see below), what do you get? Paula Vogel’s <em>Mother Play</em>, the new Second Stage offering at the Helen Hayes.</p>\n<p>A cheerily nostalgic mother’s day celebration this isn’t. A hint about the tone of the evening is on the cover of the playbill: the full title is <em>Mother Play: A Play in Five Evictions</em>.</p>\n<p>Vogel, the author of <em>How I Learned to Drive</em>, <em>Indecent</em>, and other substantial dramas, is so self-assured here that she has Martha (Celia Keenan-Bolger)—the daughter of the mother in question, and the narrator of the occasion—tell us up front what is likely to happen. “By age 11, I had already moved seven times…. When I packed up my brother Carl’s apartment after he died, everything he loved fit into one medium size U-Haul box.” Anyone who lived through the 1980s—at least, in major population centers like New York, San Francisco, or in this case, Washington, D.C.—knows precisely what that means.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/25/mother-play-a-memory-play-plus-cockroaches/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The action begins in 1962 when Martha is 11 and her brother Carl (Jim Parsons) is 13, and progresses “by evictions” to the present. Phyllis (Jessica Lange), whose marriage has apparently just ended, moves her children from apartment to apartment. Or more precisely, the children do the moving while Phyllis sits drinking martinis or just gin-from-the-bottle. Martha is plain and sensible while Carl strives to protect both his sister and mother, the latter of whom seems oblivious to everything except those cockroaches. Which start as mere pests but at one point thoroughly overwhelm the stage in a Dali-esque nightmare of a tap-dancing chorus line. (The projection designer, Shawn Duan, is likely responsible for this sequence.) Outrageous, but it perfectly fits the play, with Phyllis amusing herself by coming up with “maggots and roaches and rats, oh my!”</p>\n<p>It is no surprise that Keenan-Bolger is able to pull off the transformation from pre-teen ugly duckling into her 50s. The actress, who came to notice as Olive Ostrovsky in <em>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</em>, has—through <em>Peter and the Starcatcher</em> and <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>—convinced us that she can play just about anything. Parsons, who made his name in sitcomland, is especially effective as the flamboyant young boy who heads inevitably towards the scourge of the times. Watch for a moment in which Phyllis, awash in memories and gin, describes the birth of her son while Parsons sits silent, overcome by an almost visible shudder of inexpressible shame.</p>\n<p>Lange, for her part, spends the early scenes acting the bad mother, calling for martinis from young Martha and dancing around the various apartments with Carl (to brief but well-devised steps from choreographer Christopher Gattelli). Not as versatile an acting display as her costars, it seems, until eviction 4. Playwright Vogel suddenly dispenses with words, giving Lange an extended pantomime as she adjusts (or rather does not adjust) to life alone, cut off from her children. Dressed in an unlikely silk robe of what seems to be fiery fuchsia—one of the many thrift-shop treasures she boasts about finding— over a bravura stretch of five minutes or so she restlessly tries to listen to music, prepares a microwaved TV dinner, drowns herself in drink, and appears to sink into madness.</p>\n<p>All of this is carefully collated by director Tina Landau (<em>Floyd Collins</em>, <em>Superior Donuts</em>), who does an impressive job with script and cast. Set designer David Zinn translates this play of evictions by having the scenic elements literally unpacked by the actors, with the furniture on casters. How perfect! Toni-Leslie James does a similarly fine job dressing the characters in thrift shop wares, with Phyllis priding herself in the “ten buck” Chanels and Von Furstenbergs she pulls out of the bins with more attention than she pays to her children. Jill BC Du Boff’s soundscape is music-filled—this family listens to the radio together, constantly—while the lights by Jen Schriever and the aforementioned projections combine to keep Vogel’s fanciful drama moving towards its inevitable end.</p>\n<p>At times it seems like Vogel has been inspired by Tennessee Williams’ <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>. At other times—with that problematic mother losing composure during a series of revealing telephone calls, that ignored and emotionally damaged daughter, that son itching to leave home and go out into the dangerous world—it seems like Vogel is consciously giving us an updated version of what might or could have happened to those forlorn Wingfields had they, and Williams, existed 30 years later.</p>\n<p>In any event, Vogel’s play and players merit a visit to the Helen Hayes. Only not as a Mother’s Day treat for dear old mom.</p>\n<p><strong>Mother Play: A Play in Five Evictions opened April 25, 2024 at the Helen Hayes Theater and runs through June 16.

Photo credit: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>You can’t say that <em>Mother Play</em> doesn’t throw a lot into the mix.</p>\n<p>This clearly personal, three-character work by Paul Vogel (<em>How I Learned to Drive</em>) deals with — among other things — alcoholism, sexual orientation, AIDS, financial struggles, dementia, and the eternal struggle between children and disapproving parents. And oh, did I mention the dancing cockroaches?</p>\n<p>Memory plays such as this one can be tricky. Sometimes, as with Tennessee Williams’ <em>The Glass</em> Menagerie (an obvious influence, and there’s a lot of Vogel’s own <em>The Baltimore Waltz</em> in here as well), they turn out to be masterpieces. More often, as with titles too numerous to mention, they come across as unfocused and self-indulgent.</p>\n<p>The latter proves to be case with this clearly personal effort receiving its world premiere by Second Stage at Broadway’s Hayes Theater. Despite its top-flight cast consisting of Celia Keenan-Bolger, Jim Parsons, and a sublime Jessica Lange (making her first Broadway appearance in eight years and the first time she’s appeared in a new play as opposed to works by Williams and O’Neill), <em>Mother Play</em> covers too much ground without providing enough emotional depth to overcome its familiarities.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/25/mother-play-evicting-not-so-dear-old-mom-with-martinis/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Which is not to say that there aren’t many amusing and moving moments along the way, thanks not only to the performers but also the universality of its themes and the playwright’s trenchant wit. But it’s hard not to groan when, early on, Lange’s matriarch announces to her two children, “Today’s the day our lives get better,” and you know, you just know, that they really won’t.</p>\n<p>The play covers roughly four decades, from the early 1960s on, in the lives of Phyllis (Lange) and her two children Carl (Parsons) and his younger sister Martha (Keenan-Bolger), the latter serving as the narrator and a clear stand-in for the playwright. When first seen, the characters are age 37, 14, and 12, respectively, which might be hard to swallow except for Lange’s radiance and Parsons and Keenan-Bolger’s perpetual youthfulness.</p>\n<p>After having been abandoned by their husband and father, about which Martha is deeply embittered, they’re clearly struggling to make ends meet, living in a run-down basement apartment in the Washington, D.C. area. It’s but the first of their many dwellings, as indicated by the work’s subtitle <em>A Play in Five Evictions</em>, with Martha announcing each one to the audience at the beginning of certain scenes.</p>\n<p>As the play proceeds through its intermissionless 105 minutes it depicts the complicated emotional entanglements among the three characters. But it’s not hard to see where it’s going when Phyllis orders her children to make her martinis and they fulfill their request with the expertise of seasoned bartenders, or when Carl demonstrates a precociously deep knowledge of contemporary fashion designers and the works of Virginia Woolf.</p>\n<p>The evening, which features the actors moving the scenery so much around the stage they should be unionized as stagehands, also has its eccentric, surreal elements, including a bizarre obsession with cockroaches, which are plentiful in the family’s less than hygienic living conditions. At one point we see a fleet of them performing a synchronized dance (don’t worry, they’re merely projections) to the tune of, what else, “La Cucaracha.”</p>\n<p>Under the direction of Tina Landau, Keenan-Bolger and Parsons are predictably fine in their roles, even if they’re not being stretched much. But it’s Lange who commands the evening, displaying the sort of star power and stage command that make her a Broadway diva. Just the sight of her in various outfits, including ‘60s-era hippie denim, is a pleasure, and it’s worth the price of admission to see her launch into disco dancing (the audience, predictably, goes wild). She’s even given a lengthy silent, solo interlude in which she listens to music, has a drink, smokes, and attempts to eat a frozen meal that’s made no less unpalatable by generous doses of hot sauce. Other than conveying the character’s loneliness in her older years, the scene doesn’t have much reason for being. But as brilliantly played by Lange, it’s an acting lesson that every budding thespian should study.</p>\n<p><strong>Mother Play: A Play in Five Evictions opened April 25, 2024 at the Helen Hayes Theater and runs through June 16.

Photo: Marc J. Franklin</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Last summer we had the Jack Serio–directed <em>Uncle Vanya</em> in a postage stamp–size private Flatiron loft that seated about 40 people per performance. Now we’re getting Lila Neugebauer’s <em>Uncle Vanya</em> in the ludicrously capacious 1,100-seat Vivian Beaumont Theater. Sometimes, and this is one of those times, bigger does not mean better.</p>\n<p>In Neugebauer’s defense, many directors have been bested by the sheer size of the Beaumont. From the jump, this <em>Vanya</em>, with a new adaptation by Heidi Schreck (<em>What the Constitution Means to Me</em>), feels unmoored, as lost as its restless, lovelorn characters.</p>\n<p>The acerbic Vanya (stage neophyte Steve Carell, acquitting himself nicely) desperately loves the glamorous Elena (Tony winner Anika Noni Rose); Astrov (<em>Primary Trust</em>’s William Jackson Harper), country doctor by day, conservationist by night, also loves Elena; Vanya’s niece, the unglamorous but hardworking Sonia (Alison Pill), secretly loves Astrov; Elena, despite being married to Vanya’s brother-in-law, the much-older Alexander (Alfred Molina), loves no one, except perhaps herself. Alexander loves hearing himself talk. And if you look closely, near the end of the play, you’ll notice the Neighbor (Spencer Donovan Jones) gazing longingly at Sonia—a sweet and subtle touch by Neugebauer and Schreck.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/24/uncle-vanya-anton-chekhovs-updated-bored-folks-more-boring-than-need-be/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Apropos of Chekhov, everyone is unhappy, full of complaints, and struggling to connect. But onstage, these actors really are struggling to connect. As one might expect from the longtime star of the mockumentary-style sitcom <em>The Office</em>, Carell plays up the comedy, but it pretty much works; Vanya gets a lot of zingers (“Nice weather for hanging yourself”) and humorous rants, most of which are aimed at Alexander: “He just hides in his study all day writing, writing—crapping out boring essays nobody will read. I pity the paper!… The man has been writing about art for thirty years—and he knows nothing about art! For thirty years he’s just been regurgitating other people’s ideas about modernism, postmodernism, all that crap. And now he’s been ‘forced to retire’ and nobody gives a shit about him!” Pill imbues Sonia with an almost alarming intensity. It’s a pleasure having Molina onstage again, but he’s nowhere near as irritating as he needs to be as the pompous, gout- and rheumatism-ridden Alexander, the “rotting fish” as Vanya has dubbed him. Meanwhile, Harper is by turns funny, sincere, dead-serious, casually cruel, tender—everything an Astrov should be. And Rose, unfortunately, takes her character’s above-it-all attitude too far; as Alexander’s younger and very beautiful wife, Elena is supposed to seem unattainable, not completely out of reach. She claims to be intrigued by Astrov—enough to fall into an elicit embrace—but there’s simply no spark there.</p>\n<p>Speaking of there…where, exactly, are we? Modern times—judging by the turntable, plastic storage container, and water bottle carried by nanny Marina (the wonderful Mia Katigbak, co-founder of the National Asian American Theatre Company, in her Broadway debut). And presumably somewhere in America, since Vanya mentions “two-hundred dollars” and “almost a thousand bucks” when he and Sonia are going over the books for the farm. Perhaps that explains the disorientation that permeates this entire production.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Uncle Vanya</em> opened April 24, 2024, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater and runs through June 16.

Alison Pill in Uncle Vanya. Photo: Marc J. Franklin</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lila Neugebauer, whose last bang-up directing assignment was Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ <em>Appropriate</em>, has turned to Anton Chekhov’s <em>Uncle Vanya </em>in a new Heidi Schreck translation for Lincoln Center’s Vivian Beaumont. Not that she hasn’t been preparing the production for what is apparently a significant while.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an April 1, 2024 <em>New Yorker</em> profile, Neugebauer is quoted as saying when she received the call from producing artistic director André Bishop about taking <em>Uncle Vanya</em> on, she initially demurred. She’d read the play, of course, but when she had, was “just not getting it.” Nevertheless, she read it again and:</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was stopped in my tracks. Some of the psychologies in the play just feel wildly contemporary—and the people, their anguish and their hilarities, I mean, they are so recognizable.”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/24/uncle-vanya-disoriented-scenes-from-a-country-life/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A curious reaction. Aren’t classics considered classics for the very reason that characters’ psychologies are timelessly contemporary? Aren’t the characters’ anguishes and hilarities recognizable no matter what day or age in which they’re living? Isn’t, for instance, the guilt that ultimately undoes the Macbeths as contemporary now as it was in their world as well as when the Greek dramatists were reporting on human behavior during the fifth century B. C. E.?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, Neugebauer’s take certainly explains her intention &#8212; with Schreck in doubtless agreement &#8212; to ensure that today’s audience understands there’s nothing dated about <em>Uncle Vanya</em>, first seen in 1899. At no point does a family retainer carry a samovar on or off.  At no point does costumer Kaye Voyce dress a secondary figure in threadbare serf rags. The cast is nicely outfitted in clothes that look vaguely of the moment but could pass for any moment of the last half century or more, though there does seem to be a reference to the 1940s.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What of the result, which unfolds on a Mimi Lien set specifying no more than “a country estate and working farm,” with high interior walls giving the impression the estate was once quite grand? There Chekhov’s unforgettable characters are again, speaking in familiar idioms, which &#8212; thank you, Heidi Schreck &#8212; haven’t incorporated obscenities that salt (assault?) the drama lexicon as so many tweaked plays and musicals insist on nowadays. (Chekhov dramas? Chekhov did regard his plays as comedies, suggesting that “comedy” must have had a somewhat different implication in the Russia of his days.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, here, as always, are Vanya (Steve Carell), Sonya (Alison Pill), Professor Alexander (Alfred Molina), Elena (Anika Noni Rose), Astrov (William Jackson Harper), Waffles (Jonathan Hadary), Marina (Mia Katigbak), Maria (Jayne Houdyshell,) and Neighbor (Spencer Donavan Jones) populating Chekhov’s four emotionally complex acts.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And now carrying out what familiar or reworked actions? It would be easy to lose count of how many times these isolated folks &#8212; stuck with each for the depressing nonce &#8212; claim, insist, complain, harangue, moan that they’re bored. Elena’s weary “I’m dying of boredom” might be the most disheartening, but every one of them is afflicted with the incurable mental virus.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s one thing, however, to present boredom, an obligation of any <em>Uncle Vanya</em> production. It’s an entire other thing to unveil a boring production. As the Chekhov idolator who was this reviewer’s plus-one cogently observed, “It’s treacherous territory when it has to be boring.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The unfortunate news is that while not outrightly deficient, this <em>Uncle Vanya</em> &#8212; presenting figures dealing with boredom in an at-sixes-and-sevens societal climate &#8212; is somehow flat more often, surely, than director Neugebauer intends.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The situation mars the performances in different ways. Carell conveys Vanya’s frustrations at having subordinated his dreams (whatever they were) to benefit self-preoccupied, unobservant Alexander. Taking full advantage of one sequence to vent rage and then shame when firing on the professor twice and missing, Carell nonetheless falls short of conveying the man’s debilitating weariness. (Neugebauer stages the sorrowful-hilarious bit beautifully.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elements that should give any <em>Uncle Vanya </em>electricity aren’t met. Throughout, as Chekhov writes it, bored Elena is drawn to Astrov and he to her, but so little unspoken, so little implied occurs between Rose and Harper that when Elena admits her attraction, it’s a virtual surprise. Though the Chekhov-Schreck lines carry Alexander’s infuriating obtuseness, the usually expert Molina doesn’t extract enough from them. It’s as if Alexander’s disinterest has infected Molina’s acting.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the others, only Pill, expressing Sonya’s unrequited longing for Astrov, and Hadary, as truly comic figure Waffles, connect. (Hadary is adept with a concertina, especially in the production’s waning seconds.) Katigbak’s Marina is sufficiently involved. The ever-accomplished Houdyshell (has any actor been busier on Broadway in the last decade?) isn’t called on much and does whatever’s required in a long gray wig.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Uncle Vanya</em> opened April 24, 2024, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater and runs through June 16.

Photo Credit: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Amy Herzog’s play is named after its lead character, but it might as easily have been titled <em>Job</em>.</p>\n<p>Mary Jane is the thirtysomething mother of a nearly three-year-old boy named Alex who was born prematurely and suffers from cerebral palsy and frequent seizures, among other serious health conditions. With the aid of nurses, she devotedly cares for her son in her cramped one-bedroom Queens apartment, sleeping on a sofa bed in the living room since the bedroom has been effectively turned into a pediatric care unit. (We never see Alex, but we hear the constant sounds of his various monitors and life-preserving machines.) Still working remotely to ensure the health care coverage she desperately needs, she’s handling it all alone, her husband having abandoned the family after proving unable to handle the stress. Amazingly, she seems to bear him no ill will. “I hope he finds peace, I really do,” she says.</p>\n<p>In spite of all her travails, Mary Jane manages to exude a stalwart optimism, even if the strain is apparent to others, including Ruthie (Brenda Wehle) her female superintendent who’s unclogging her kitchen sink. “You seem to be someone who’s carrying a lot of tension in her body,” Ruthie observes, before casually adding, “That’s how my sister got cancer.”</p>\n<p>Mary Jane’s sunny attitude may be hard to believe if she weren’t being played by Rachel McAdams, making her Broadway debut in this Manhattan Theatre Club production. The luminous actress, who established her screen stardom via roles in such romantic dramas as <em>The Notebook</em> and <em>The Time Traveler’s Wife</em>, exudes a sunniness that works perfectly for her role as the beleaguered but resilient caretaker whose most frequent utterances are the words “thank you” to those helping her.</p>\n<p>Herzog’s play — first seen here in a 2017 off-Broadway production starring Carrie Coon, which garnered the Best Play award from the New York Drama Critics Circle — is a subtly artful drama that is all the more effective for focusing on the quotidian details of the character’s stressful situation. With the exception of a medical crisis that occurs at the end of the intermissionless play’s first section, it’s composed of quiet interactions between Mary Jane and the women (they’re all women) with whom she comes into contact.</p>\n<p>They include her son’s regular nurse Sherry (April Mathis), who exudes competence; Sherry’s college-age niece Amelia (Lily Santiago), who drops by the apartment at an inopportune time; Brianne (Susan Pourfour), a Facebook friend with a similarly ill child whom Mary Jane counsels about navigating the healthcare system; Dr. Toros (Mathis), a pediatric doctor attending to Alex after he’s hospitalized; Chaya (Pourfour), a Hasidic woman  whose child is hospitalized in the same care unit as Alex: Kat (Santiago), an overbooked music therapist at the hospital who goes out of her way to be helpful; and Tenkei (Wehle), a Buddhist nun with whom Alex has a meaningful encounter.</p>\n<p>Some may find the play tedious in its studious avoidance of histrionics, but in its own quiet way <em>Mary Jane</em> proves heartbreaking in its depiction of the title character’s fierce motherly devotion and refusal to succumb to immobilizing despair, even when it involves carrying all that tension that occasionally results in migraines. She might as well be a character in Samuel Beckett play, unable to go on but still going on.</p>\n<p>Anne Kaufman, repeating her staging from the play’s earlier NYC incarnation at New York Theatre Workshop, has delivered a beautifully calibrated production that expertly mines its subtleties. Featuring little blatant theatricality other than a stunning scene change (courtesy of Lael Jellinek), it features superb performances from its five-woman ensemble, all but the lead actress playing dual roles. McAdams, like so many film or television performers new to the stage, has difficulty with her vocal projection, making some lines unintelligible. But she’s such a warm, winning presence that your heart instantly goes out to her character who, somehow in the face of her anguish, achieves something akin to a state of grace.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Mary Jane opened April 23, 2024, at Samuel J.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guess what, Huey Lewis and the News wild ones! The heart of rock and roll is still beating. Even  louder right now. That throbbing heart is beating on Broadway where a crop of the beloved band’s songs is being given a bouncing treatment in an entertainment dubbed &#8212; what else? &#8212; <em>The Heart of Rock and Roll</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This nice surprise is what’s known as a jukebox musical, a by-now-established category into which any rocker or folksinger’s songbook is fair game for staging, too often not that successfully. But then again, didn’t Irving Berlin see to it his list of hits became hit box-office flicks like <em>Easter Parade</em> and <em>White Christmas</em>?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, give a round of applause to Jonathan A. Abrams, who (from a story by producer Tyler Mitchell and himself) dreamed up a plot in which to lodge the Huey Lewis and the News songs so’s a talented gaggle of singers and dancers can give Great White Way life to them. For added stage heat, choreographer Lorin Latarro grabs every opportunity for her multi-talented troupe to maximize the excitement with inexhaustible energy.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For sure, Abrams isn’t breaking any ground with his light and lively tale. There’s not a minute’s pretense in it, a charge that can be held against too many recent offerings. Thank the Gods of Music for that.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bobby (Cory Cott), an ambitious fellow, is the singer for a band but earns his keep toiling at an established box-manufacturing company where he hopes to become top salesman. Torn between music and salesmanship, he gets in trouble splitting his time. Leaving his four-man group to prosper (or not) as a three-man group (F. Michael Haynie, Raymond J. Lee, John-Michael Lyles), he meets trouble irritating Stone-Box-boss Stone (John Dossett).</p>\n<p>Ignoring advice from company chum Paige (Zoe Jensen) and dating pals Roz (Tamika Lawrence) and Wyatt (Josh Breckenridge), Bobby is further caught in his internal tug-of-war. An increasing distraction is Stone’s appealing but not sufficiently confident daughter Cassandra (McKenzie Kurtz), who’s being wooed by monied, sold-on-himself Princeton grad Tucker (Billy Harrigan Tighe).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps there’s no need to go on about the storyline’s pushes and pulls. Along the way to the finale, which gives optimum power to “The Power of Love,” there’s not much worry over how things will end. That eventuates when Bobby must decide to honor the contract he signed with Stone Box or the one he signed with Chrysalis Records.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is an act-two sequence, however, where Bobby talks about a difficult and regretful relationship with his father. It takes only a few minutes but successfully deepens the musical’s mood while not at all jarring what’s come before or what follows. Bookwriter Abrams deserves favorable comment on that.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also deserving credit for his sensitivity is Cott as he plays Bobby’s reflective moment. Looking for much of the show as if he’s just come from pressing weights, Cott dispenses not only rock’n’roll grit but leavens it with an unpushed charm matched by the entire cast, especially Kurtz, Dossett, Jensen, Lawrence, Breckenridge, and even Tighe at Tucker’s worst moments.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choreographer Latarro &#8212; only just finished with her hunky-dory work on <em>The Who’s Tommy</em> work &#8212; opens the second act with a demanding work-out routine. Not that all her routines don’t demand her dancers to expend their utmost. There’s one that even has the terpers joyfully stomping on bubble wrap. Talk about inspiration.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to “The Power of Love,” what other Huey Lewis and the News Top 40ers are on hand (and foot)? Too many to list here, but the title tune, naturally, and likely any others a die-hard fan would want to hear, all lovingly attacked by conductor Will Van Dyke and a bubbly (bubble-gummy?) rock band.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without any of the other members of the creative team giving the impression they’re attempting to knock off the audience’s socks, set designer Derek McLane, lighting designer Japhy Weideman, sound designer John Shivers, and costume designer Jen Caprio come through like loyal pals.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A note to costumer Caprio: Princeton’s colors are orange and black. No Princeton blazer would be orange and blue, as they are here. The heart of any gung-ho Princeton man or woman (aren’t they all gung-ho?) confronted with an orange and blue blazer might instantly stop beating.</span></p>\n<div><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">The Heart of Rock and Roll </b><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened April 22, 2024, at the James Earl Jones Theatre.

Photo credit: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>You can’t blame Peter Morgan for wanting to move on from the British royal family. After all, he’s exhaustively dramatized their peccadilloes for years in such acclaimed works as <em>The Queen</em> and the Netflix series <em>The Crown</em>, and there’s only so many times you can go back to the Queen Elizabeth well, as deep as it is. So it’s not surprising that he’s moved on to more diabolical and murderous real-life intrigue with his new play dramatizing the rise of Vladimir Putin thanks to the Russian oligarchs who put him into power only to discover that they’ve created a monster. Featuring brilliant performances by Michael Stuhlbarg as Russian-Jewish businessman Boris Berezovsky and Will Keen, repeating his Olivier Award-winning London performance, as Putin, <em>Patriots</em> is the sort of gripping real-life drama that only makes you want to learn more.</p>\n<p>The playwright’s gift for making recent history come alive are on ample display in this work that originated in 2022 at London’s Almeida Theatre. Early in the play, we see the first fateful meeting between Berezovsky, a child math prodigy who amassed a fortune in various businesses, and Putin, then the deputy mayor of St. Petersburg. Berezovsky asks him for help in smoothing the way for a car dealership in a prized area of the city, and makes it clear that he’s more than willing to compensate him for the favor. Putin rebuffs the offer of a new car, sternly declaring that he doesn’t accept bribes.</p>\n<p>“C’mon, are you even Russian?” an uncomprehending Berezovsky teases.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/22/patriots-a-startling-autocrat-oligarch-expose/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Not long afterward, Berezovsky, who is almost killed in an assassination attempt, meets Alexander Litvinenko (Alex Hurt), a lieutenant colonel in the Anti-Organized Crime Unit, and tries to lure him into working for him as his personal security head. Berezovsky’s canny seductiveness becomes illustrated when he sends a fawning note to Litvinenko’s wife Marina (Stella Baker), a ballroom dancing teacher, who tries but fails to convince her husband to take the job. It’s only when his superiors order him to murder Berezovsky that the upright Litvinenko resigns and goes to work for the businessman, a decision that would ultimately have fatal consequences.</p>\n<p>When it comes time for a faltering Boris Yeltsin (Paul Kynman) to step down from the presidency, Berezovsky personally selects Putin, whose political career he had since promoted, as his successor, assuming that he can be easily controlled. Needless to say, things don’t go quite as planned, with Putin, who at first professed a desire to liberalize the country, quickly transforming into a brutally autocratic leader who turns on the very oligarchs who help put him into power, especially the one who was most responsible.</p>\n<p>Because most of its characters and situations are less familiar than the events dramatized in Morgan’s previous works, <em>Patriots</em> proves somewhat less accessible. The playwright also throws a bit too much into the mix, such as the flashback scenes featuring Berezovsky’s interactions with his former professor (Ronald Guttman) in which they engage in intellectual discussions about topics ranging from mathematical theories to Russian society, and his complicated relationship with Roman Abramovich (Luke Thallon, excellent), a young oil company owner with whom he begins a shady business relationship that ultimately leads to a crushing defeat.</p>\n<p>But throughout the play’s lengthy running time, Morgan delivers the sort of brilliantly observed characterizations at which he excels. In Stuhlbarg’s wildly entertaining, outsized performance, Berezovsky emerges a man who deeply loves both his country and his extravagant lifestyle, complete with nubile young girlfriends and Caribbean fishing vacations. He becomes deeply outraged by his protégé’s betrayal, not only on personal terms but also because he sees that Putin is taking his country back to the past.</p>\n<p>Keen is absolutely chilling as the reptilian Putin, brilliantly using body language to convey the former KGB officer’s metamorphosis from mild-mannered bureaucrat to murdering dictator, along the way carefully practicing how to present himself while looking in a mirror. Early in the play, when Putin professes a desire to leave his security past behind and enter the world of politics, Berezovsky comments, “You no longer wish to police people. You wish to set them free.” Keen merely shrugs uncomprehendingly, the gesture speaking volumes.</p>\n<p>Rupert Gould’s kinetic direction prevents the work from succumbing to the relentlessly dense dialogue, providing a vivid theatricality enhanced by Miriam Buether’s versatile set design dominated by the sort of impossibly long table at which Putin famously conducts his meetings, Jack Knowles’ piercing lighting, and Adam Cork’s frequently startling sound design and score (be prepared for some very loud explosions).</p>\n<p>There are times when <em>Patriots</em> feels unwieldly, throwing so much at the audience that it feels an effort to keep up. But by the end it fully justifies its ambitions, bringing events of which most of us are only tangentially aware into deeper focus. The play may be complicated, but so is the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Patriots opened April 22, 2024, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre and runs through June 23.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the far-right pro-Putin Republican caucus, here’s <em>Patriots</em>, a contemporary drama that ought to offer the misguided Congressional contingent much confirming pleasure. It chronicles the marauding autocrat as he achieves his dictatorial grip. To accomplish such a welcome feat, Peter Morgan – responsible, among other acclaimed works, for the Tony-nominated <em>Frost/Nixon</em> and <em>The Crown</em> &#8212; has done it again.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His drama tells the irresistibly jolting tale of Boris Berezovsky (Michael Stuhlbarg), one of Russia’s richest oligarchs, whose holdings included a television station claiming to report truth, automobile businesses through a complicated partnership, and more. During the Boris Yeltsin years, the endlessly ambitious man was responsible for plucking one-time KGB officer Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin (Will Keen) from obscure bureaucrat to prime minister and then president.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the while, so-called kingmaker Berezovsky expected to keep his initially reluctant nominee under a firm thumb. As Morgan follows the record, however, that isn’t the way the increasingly assured Putin experiences it.  When at a crucial moment, the inflexible mentor reminds his mentee of the chronology, the exchange goes in only rancorous part &#8212; Putin: “The fact is I am president?” Berezovsky: “I put you there.” Putin: “That’s opinion. Not fact.”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/22/patriots-russian-history-rendered-with-shakespearean-theatricality/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The intrepid playwright, it needs be specified, is interested in the gnarled Berezovsky-Putin relationship but not exclusively. He also follows Berezovsky on his parabolic entanglement with devious upstart Roman Abramovich (Luke Thallon), who engineers business deals (automobiles, primarily) that yield millions for both men. That’s until it no longer redounds to Berezovsky’s benefit.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morgan’s biography goes back to Berezovsky’s childhood, when, nine-years-old, he’s recognized as a mathematics genius by Professor [Grigori] Perelman (Ronald Guttman). But his enthusiasm for Berezovsky’s math career doesn’t stick due to the young man’s business-cum-politics ambition.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running into irrevocable problems with Putin &#8212; who comes to regard the man as an enemy of the state (there is a car bombing from which Berezovsky escapes with burn wounds) &#8212; Berezovsky flees Russia in 2000. There, he spends the rest of his life as, he insists, a Russian patriot. Nonetheless, he wrangles with Putin from a distance, hoping to return to the land he loves. Berezovsky dies &#8212; hanged, but perhaps not by his own hand &#8212; in 2013 at his Ascot, England mansion.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morgan gets it all in on Miriam Buether’s handsome, multi-leveled set, at the highest rise a double door behind which is a mirror both Berezovsky and Putin use to admire their reflection. Morgan’s enviable way with dialogue is his trick. The primarily contentious duologues Berezovsky holds with Putin, Abramovich and, at first, with doggedly honest security guard and eventual Putin victim Alexander Litvinenko (Alex Hurt) have a reverberatingly authentic ring.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In equally suasive language, Putin explicitly demands that Berezovsky demonstrate loyalty, even as he denies any reason to return loyalty to Berezovsky. Which raises this stateside question: Does the adamant loyalty declaration sound familiar? Does an ex-president now in court come to mind, a man who requires loyalty from those in his circle while not pledged to its return? Does the sequence render <em>Patriots</em> that much more pertinent for today’s American audiences?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inextricable from the undeniable enterprise’s triumph are the performances of an entire ensemble, Stuhlbarg chief among them. Returning to Broadway after too long an absence while accumulating film and television resumé additions, the exemplary actor, stocky but unrelievedly energetic, rarely allows focus elsewhere when he’s not only in charge but charging. His body so rubbery he sometimes resembles an undulating wave, he’s up and down designer Buether’s many steps indefatigably &#8212; the steps possibly symbolic of who outranks whom.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stuhlbarg’s voice goes on the same play-long charge. To intimidate any of his momentary targets, he might begin a speech with a sultry whisper, then erupt in a torrent of furious emotion. When he’s reminding Putin who put him where he is, he’s in a relentless fury. Throughout, he’s snapping his fingers, slapping his palms, repeatedly holding his arm wide, as if to indicate an easy control of his world.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a scene where Berezovsky, a Jew and increasingly falling out of favor as such, reckons with Abramovich about their partnerships, he’s suddenly Shylock in <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> Shylock. Instantly, Stuhlbarg’s breadth is demonstrated. Is <em>King Lear</em> next?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will Keen, who won an Olivier Award for his Almeida and West End <em>Patriots</em> performance, makes what is often termed an auspicious Broadway debut. His resemblance to Putin isn’t entirely his doing, of course, but he makes the most of it. He’s cleverly seen finding Putin’s self-assured stance. He echoes the chilly manner, the cynical smile, the obnoxious pride. One view the audience is denied is a shirtless Putin.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Roman Abramovich is not a well-recognized figure here, Thallon has no need to impress as a lookalike, but from his entrance as a nervous young man hoping to obtain Berezovsky’s patronage to his attained oligarchic status, he skillfully completes the play’s threatening triumvirate.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pulling all this together &#8212; with Jack Knowles’ dramatic lighting, Adam Cork’s sound and original music, and Ash J. Woodward’s striking video design &#8212; is Rupert Goold. Ever since he startled Manhattan audiences with his 2008 <em>Macbeth</em>, he has never lowered his standards.  He has only raised them. <em>Patriots</em> is a new high.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One significant achievement Peter Morgan and Goold attain is putting the word “patriot” under severe scrutiny. The play and production implicitly make the vital point that those who blatantly appropriate “patriot” in self-satisfied promotion are often the least likely worthy of the designation.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Patriots opened April 22, 2024, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre and runs through June 23.

Photo: Marc Brenner</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In his 2017 memoir <em>Sense of Occasion</em>, Harold Prince, who directed the 1966 production of <em>Cabaret</em>, reflects on the Kander and Ebb musical’s legacy. “In the 50 years since <em>Cabaret</em> premiered,” he writes, “sadly I still believe ‘it <em>can </em>happen here.’ Maybe wherever human beings live, it can happen. We have to accept that possibility. If so, how damned sad.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps that’s why, in Rebecca Frecknall’s impressive fresh-from-London Broadway revival, the first glimpse of a swastika—emblazoned on an armband worn by the entrepreneur Ernst (Henry Gottfried)—barely yields a reaction from the audience. But when nightclub singer Sally Bowles (Gayle Rankin) tosses back a prairie oyster—raw egg and Worcestershire sauce, “heaven for a hangover”—the groans and icks come through loud and clear.</p>\n<p>Is the idea of consuming an uncooked egg that unsettling? Or have we simply become resigned to the growing presence of fascists in our midst? On social media, on cable news, in elected office…How damned sad indeed.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/21/cabaret-come-for-the-pre-show-and-oh-theres-also-the-musical/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Wait! We were supposed to leave our troubles <em>outside</em>. If you haven’t done that by the time the opening number, “Willkommen,” starts, your Emcee—played by Eddie Redmayne in his second Broadway stint (the last being his Tony-winning turn in 2010’s <em>Red</em>) as part clown, part contortionist—commands you to do so: “We have no troubles here. Here, life is beautiful.”</p>\n<p>It’s easy to get caught up in the spell of this <em>Cabaret</em>, which is all about mood from the moment you enter down a dumpster-lined alley (we promise, it gets prettier). The creators have devised a 75-minute prologue with bars on every floor, original music, and performers in various nooks and crannies. (Alaïa, Iron Bryan, Will Ervin Jr., Sun Kim, and Deja McNair are the dancers and Brian Russell Carey, Francesca Dawis, Maeve Stier, and Michael Winograd the musicians credited.) Be sure to leave yourself time to enjoy at least part of the pre-show, so you can wander through all three levels, each assigned a decidedly different look and theme by scenic, theater, and costume designer Tom Scutt; Red Bar gives off a Kubrick vibe, and the Green Bar has a giddy, absinthe-soaked feel. The theater—sorry, the Kit Kat Club—is, indeed, beautiful.</p>\n<p>Everything in this <em>Cabaret</em> plays out on a small round central stage: American writer Cliff Bradshaw (Ato Blankson-Wood, woefully miscast in a pivotal role), meeting Ernst on a train; the introduction of the Cabaret girls, Rosie (Paige Smallwood), Lulu (David Merino), Frenchie (Gabi Campo), Texas (MiMi Scardulla), Fritzie (Natascia Diaz, who doubles as the sailor-loving Fraulein Kost), and Helga (Ayla Ciccone-Burton), “each and every one a virgin”; all of Sally’s Kit Kat Club performances; Jewish fruit shop owner Herr Schultz (Steven Skybell) wooing landlady Fraulein Schneider (Bebe Neuwirth) with a pineapple; the engagement party in Herr Schultz’s fruit shop; and more. At first it’s very clear what’s real and what’s just a performance: The Kit Kat girls rotate playfully on a turntable like confections; the Emcee pops up from beneath the stage on a platform wearing a variety of Scutt’s garish get-ups (the best, and most haunting, is the pearl-trimmed skeleton-harlequin hybrid in “Money”). Herr Schultz’s proposal and the love duet, “Married,” must be very real, because Skybell (star of 2018’s Yiddish <em>Fiddler on the Roof</em>, directed by the original Emcee, Joel Grey) and Neuwirth, a Tony winner for Kander and Ebb’s 1996 <em>Chicago</em> revival, will bring you to very real tears.</p>\n<p>But Frecknall smartly blurs the lines. All we’re really sure of is that we’re in Weimar-era Berlin. When the Emcee sings the echoey, haunting Aryan anthem “Tomorrow Belongs to Me,” he’s wandering through some kind of dreamland populated by wooden doll-size white men. In “Maybe This Time,” while Sally imagines another life for herself—“Not a loser anymore/ Like the last time and the time before,” she sings—she’s technically in Cliff’s room, but she’s also in some other liminal space. (The self-searching songs, “Maybe This Time” and “Cabaret,” are Rankin’s most powerful numbers.) At the end of “What Would You Do?,” Fraulein Schneider is singing atop a platform in the middle of the stage. The lamps on the tables are lit—like we’re in the club watching a performance, not the devastation of a woman who’s just traded her happiness to guarantee her survival.</p>\n<p>“Where are your troubles now?” asks Redmayne’s shape-shifting Emcee, cowed into submission in the final scene. “Forgotten? I told you so.” Not at all. And thank goodness for that.</p>\n<p><strong><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Cabaret </b><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened April 21, 2024, at the Kit Kat Club (August Wilson Theatre).  Tickets and information: <a style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-text-opacity: 1;\" href=\"https://kitkat.club/cabaret-broadway/\">kitkat.club</a></strong></strong></p>\n",

Photo credit: Marc Brenner</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As the title song goes, “Come to the cabaret, old chum, come to the cabaret.” And the creators of the new revival being presented at the August Wilson Theatre — sorry, the “Kit Kat Club at the August Wilson Theatre” — <em>really</em> want you to come to the cabaret. To that end, just as in the original London incarnation, they’re dramatically reconfigured the venue and transformed it into a multi-level nightclub in which you’re invited to be your most decadent self. Or, at least spring for expensive drinks and snacks while waiting for the show proper to begin.</p>\n<p>Theatergoers are advised to arrive at least an hour early to experience the “Prologue,” featuring nine dancers and musicians performing in three spaces — dubbed the “Vault Bar,” “Green Bar,” and “Red Bar” — located in the theater’s dressed-up lobbies. To get there, you don’t go through the main entrance, but rather an alley, after which your phone is affixed with a sticker over the camera lens and you’re handed a shot of schnapps. It’s all so decadent, darling.</p>\n<p>It’s designed to get you into the mood for the familiar musical featuring a score by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Joe Masteroff, and it’s certainly impressive. It doesn’t really have much to do with the actual show, mind you, with the acts and atmosphere less redolent of Weimar-era Germany than a Lower East Side, retro-style burlesque show. And the irony is that it ultimately feels unnecessary, as the production directed by Rebecca Frecknall more than stands up on its own.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/21/cabaret-immersive-ambitious-all-too-timely/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The disorientation is further amplified upon entering the theater, which has had many of its seats ripped out and replaced by cabaret-style tables. The playing area, surrounded by the audience on all sides, is a large circular platform through which the performers are occasionally given the opportunity to pop up like jacks in the box. Or, to descend, as if to the bowels of hell.</p>\n<p>This is not your parents’ <em>Cabaret</em>, but it is akin to the Sam Mendes production that took London and Broadway by storm several decades ago. At this point, the musical may never be presented in a traditional proscenium theater again. After all, what would be the fun in that?</p>\n<p>As for the show itself (I know, it almost seems like an afterthought), it has been given an undeniably powerful if somewhat imperfect staging. Among its chief strengths are its lead performances, or at least most of them, with Eddie Redmayne repeating his Olivier Award-winning performance (at least through early September) as the leering Emcee. He’s not quite as menacing as Alan Cumming in the Mendes production, at times seeming fragile and almost adorable. But the actor is certainly mesmerizing, using his angular physicality and androgynous looks to tremendous effect and employing his natural charisma to such a degree that you can’t take your eyes off him. During many dramatic scenes involving the other characters he silently lurks at the edge of the stage, doing nothing but making it seem like everything.</p>\n<p>Gayle Rankin’s Sally Bowles proves equally stunning. Her performance takes some warming up to, lacking the glamour and sexuality that have come to be associated with the role. Her Sally is more desperate and pathetic, and ultimately more moving, with her rendition of “Maybe This Time” registering with a hauntingly aching vulnerability. And she absolutely kills the title song, delivering it as the extended primal scream of a woman having an existential breakdown.</p>\n<p>Ironically, however, Sally is not the heart and soul of the evening. That would be Bebe Neuwirth’s Fraulein Schneider and Steven Skybell’s Herr Schultz. The veteran performers nearly steal the show as the older couple who joyously find love late in their lives, with Schultz gifting her with pieces of fruit as if they were precious gems, only to tragically lose it in the face of the growing Nazi menace. Investing their performances with pathos and humor, they’re deeply moving, and Neuwirth’s rendition of “What Would You Do?” is the best I’ve ever heard. Also making a strong impression is Natascia Diaz as Kost, Schneider’s prostitute tenant who claims her clients are various relatives.</p>\n<p>Not making such a strong impression, unfortunately, is Ato Blankson-Wood as Clifford Bradshaw. Partially, it’s the fault of the character, who is more of an observer than participant in the proceedings. But the actor’s bland work here doesn’t even rise to that level, displaying next to no chemistry with Rankin and seeming at times as if he’s wandered in from another show.</p>\n<p>The conceptual staging isn’t fully successful either. It works beautifully for the musical numbers set in the Kit Kat Club, but the book scenes, presented sans scenery or significant props in the center platform, seem overly abstract, as if the show was taking place not in 1930s-era Berlin but rather a celestial plane. Or, more accurately, a plane significantly lower down.</p>\n<p>The general look of the show is as garish as you would expect, even more so, especially with Redmayne’s costumes, designed by Tom Scutt, in which he’s made to look at various times as a circus clown and militarized harlequin, complete with Nazi helmet. His Emcee is rather most frightening when simply sporting blonde hair and wearing a nondescript suit, the same look adopted by all the other characters while standing on the revolving stage in stiff formation during the production’s chilling finale.</p>\n<p>That’s the ironic thing about this <em>Cabaret</em>. The main selling point seems to be all the bells and whistles, and no doubt many audience members will get a kick out of all of the immersiveness. But it feels most powerful when simply getting down to the basics. And when it does, you’ll be ready glad you’ve come to <em>Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Cabaret </b><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened April 21, 2024, at the Kit Kat Club (August Wilson Theatre).  Tickets and information: <a style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-text-opacity: 1;\" href=\"https://kitkat.club/cabaret-broadway/\">kitkat.club</a></strong></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Marc J. Franklin</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Hell’s Kitchen </em>is a distinctly superior entry in the jukebox musical genre, which has been booming in number (if not creativity) of late. Librettist Kristoffer Diaz, he of the highly theatrical and moving wrestling spectacle <em>The Elaborate Entry of Chad Deity, </em>crafts a highly theatrical version of singer-songwriter Alicia Keys’ wrestling with adolescence that is moving throughout.</p>\n<p>If it incorporates familiar coming-of-age tropes (overbearing-mother issues, absent-father issues, boyfriend issues, rebelliousness, why-am-I-here questions), it does so with an emotional authenticity that audiences should find easy to embrace. At the same time, Keys’ song hits are artfully woven into the plot, and executed by a first rate creative team.</p>\n<p>The title <em>Hell’s Kitchen </em>is something of a misnomer. We hear about the hardscrabble, rough-and-tumble part of Manhattan between 34th and 59th, and from 8th Avenue to the Hudson. We certainly see it in Robert Brill’s ingenious arrangements of scaffolding and platforms, against Peter Nigrini&#8217;s arresting photocollage projections. From time to time “Ali” (newcomer Maleah Joi Moon) encounters seaminess of the type the resident adults hope Mayor Giuliani will clean up. (What can I say, the year is 1998, hindsight is 20/20.) Still, most of the action takes place in and around Manhattan Plaza, the fabled apartment complex/enclave known as “Broadway’s Bedroom.” Would the title <em>Manhattan Plaza </em>lack punch? Maybe so.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/20/hells-kitchen-welcome-to-alicia-keys-new-york/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Anyway, Manhattan Plaza is the long-time home of artists of all stripes, and it’s where our heroine chafes under the iron fist of mom Jersey (Shoshana Bean), a onetime chorine who wants Ali safe indoors. Natch, that’s a call for the girl to break free. She develops an attachment to a jack-of-all-trades street drummer named Knuck (Chris Lee), prompting a huge to-do at home. But aside from a quick run in with the cops as act one is ending, that’s it for the Perils of Ali.</p>\n<p>To say that the story isn’t phonied up with melodramatic incident is a distinct compliment, because what <em>is</em> dramatized – the yearning for purpose of a young person of unfocused energy and inchoate dreams – is not just universal, but at the heart of the score’s poetry. Between Ali’s surly pain, Jersey’s refusal to back down, and Keys’ emotionally charged lyrics, there’s plenty of opportunity for us to feel Ali’s anguish and root for her.</p>\n<p>The play’s true “event” begins as Ali is having one of her sulks in her building’s all-purpose meeting room. Elegant as the Grand Duchess in <em>Anastasia</em>, elderly resident Miss Liza Jane (Kecia Lewis, superb) arranges herself at the grand piano, and quick as you can say “Duke Ellington” Ali is hooked. She discovers her soul in music while Miss Liza Jane offers life lessons – again, a familiar trope, but Moon and Lewis are such warm, vital presences that every encounter becomes a high point. You feel as if you’re really in on the birth of a creative gift.</p>\n<p>Director Michael Greif is in fine fettle on the streets of Manhattan again (less gritty than in <em>Rent</em>, but we do get a reprise of tub drumming). Keeping the acting believable and smart isn’t hard to do when you cast your show this well. Bean – and Brandon Victor Dixon, an act two <em>deus ex machina</em> as Ali’s wandering dad – are two of the glories of today’s musical theater, and their chemistry is as smokin’ as their acting and singing. (Each seems effortlessly to drop 20 years in a flashback to their courtship.) Lee is a quiet revelation as Knuck, tenderness irrepressible within a rough exterior. And I don’t want to predict too much about young Ms. Moon’s future, if only for fear of jinxing it, but she possesses all the pipes and personal sang-froid to go places. For now, it&#8217;s enough to assert that she’s Ali to the life.</p>\n<p>Still and all, the secret sauce of this entertainment package is choreographer Camille A. Brown. While many a show highlights athletic, exuberant street dance in all its forms, Brown is determined to tell story <em>through</em> dance. Her ensemble is never there just to show off, but participates to reflect and extend character. As Ali visualizes a future with Knuck, pairs of dancers express her vision; when she issues her independence manifesto through the thrilling “Girl on Fire,” the chorus provides active encouragement. The highlight of much of this Broadway season has been choreography, and Brown’s work ranks among the very best.</p>\n<p><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Hell&#8217;s Kitchen </b><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened April 20, 2024, at the Sam S.

Photo: Marc J. Franklin</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Location, location, location.</p>\n<p>The simple fact that, after premiering at downtown’s Public Theater in late 2023, <em>Hell’s Kitchen</em> has moved uptown—just a stone’s throw from the area for which the show is named—can’t be why the musical plays better on Broadway. (Can it?) But it certainly doesn’t hurt. Because when Ali (played by the incandescent Maleah Joi Moon) tells us that she and her mom “live on the 42nd floor of a 44-story building on 43rd Street between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, right in the heart of the neighborhood some people know as Hell’s Kitchen,” the audience at the Shubert Theatre erupts in applause and cheers.</p>\n<p>The locals know she’s referring to Manhattan Plaza, the high-rise affordable housing development occupied by performing artists, where <em>HK</em> creator and composer Alicia Keys spent her formative years. And the tourists have certainly heard of the neighborhood (even if their frame of reference doesn’t extend beyond <em>Taxi Driver</em>).</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/20/hells-kitchen-alicia-keys-life-inspires-a-swell-musical/\"><em>Read Bob Verini’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>So the crowd is immediately <em>into</em> it. And the very first number we hear is “The Gospel,” from Keys’ 2016 album <em>Here</em>, a song that, in an interview with PBS, Keys described as “an ode to New York…the New York I know, about who lives there, what they look like, what’s their story, the doors that revolve them in and out…and our dreams and wishes and the things we’re trying to escape and where we end up and how we get there and who we are.”</p>\n<p>Keys’ own words are perhaps the best description of her own show: an ode to New York, a love letter to the city (and the people) that helped her become the artist she is today.</p>\n<p><em>Hell’s Kitchen</em> is powered by a catalog of her hits and contains a few similar biographical elements—a girl named Ali, her eventual embrace of the piano, the Manhattan Plaza locale. But it’s not a biomusical à la <em>MJ</em> or <em>Beautiful</em>. It’s simply the story of a sassy 17-year-old struggling to find herself in NYC in the 1990s. (Dede Ayite is the designer responsible for the perfectly on-point throwback streetwear looks, from rugby shirts and logo jerseys to baggy jeans and Timberland boots.) Along the way, she falls for the much-older Knock (Chris Lee), a housepainter/bucket drummer; fights at every meal with her mom, Jersey (Shoshana Bean); and, in a fit of anger, wanders into her building’s Ellington Room and meets Miss Liza Jane (the vocal powerhouse Kecia Lewis), a gifted pianist and fierce role model who’ll become her teacher and mentor.</p>\n<p>That first encounter with Miss Liza Jane gives rise to the intoxicating “Kaleidoscope,” a new-for-the-show song that represents Ali’s artistic awakening: “Nights like this they belong in the Guinness/ Nights like this never want them to finish,” she sings. It’s an exhilarating number—the dancers move in overlapping circles like, well, a kaleidoscope—and a perfectly placed moment. (A humble suggestion to the Tony Awards producers: “Kaleidoscope” would be a beautiful way to open the telecast. Keys could play the piano and start the song; plus, it features Moon and the incredible ensemble. And host Ariana DeBose could easily take on Camille A. Brown’s intricate choreography.)</p>\n<p>If only all of Keys’ songs fit so easily into Kristoffer Diaz’s libretto. The biggest head-scratcher: “Pawn It All,” sung by an angry Jersey to Ali’s dad, Davis (the velvet-voiced Brandon Victor Dixon). Perhaps the creators simply wanted to give Bean a show-stopping song—as well as something for her character to do besides pour water, chop vegetables, and serve dinner. But bursting into her ex’s audition at a nightclub and throwing all of her jewelry at the booker? And why is Bean closing her eyes and belting like she’s onstage at 54 Below?</p>\n<p>“The Gospel,” “The River,” and, of course, “Empire State of Mind”—that’s where <em>Hell’s Kitchen</em> truly shines. Notice how Brown’s choreography—a dazzling mix of social dance, step, and modern—captures the constant, chaotic movement of the city. It’s no spoiler to reveal that “Empire State of Mind,” Keys’ and Jay-Z’s 2009 anthem immortalizing the “concrete jungle where dreams are made of,” ends the show. There’s really no other way this ode to Keys’ New York could end.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hell’s Kitchen</em> opened on Broadway April 20, 2024, at the Shubert Theatre.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A three-hour play about an unnamed 1970s band recording an album, set entirely in the recording studio: That’s, essentially, the elevator pitch for <em>Stereophonic</em>, which just opened on Broadway after a sold-out 10-week run at Playwrights Horizons in late 2023. But that doesn’t even begin to describe the genius on display at the Golden Theatre.</p>\n<p>David Adjmi’s play follows a Fleetwood Mac–esque band—married bassist Reg (Will Brill) and keyboardist-vocalist Holly (Juliana Canfield), drummer-manager Simon (Chris Stack), and guitarist-singer Peter (Tom Pecinka) and lead singer Diana (Sarah Pidgeon), also a couple—over one year, two studios, and various breakups, breakdowns, coke binges, drunken displays…and somewhere between all of that they manage to record a banger of an album, with a little help from sound engineers/emotional punching bags Grover (Eli Gelb) and Charlie (Andrew R. Butler).</p>\n<p>The songs themselves aren’t really the point of <em>Stereophonic</em>; we hear almost all of them only in snippets, and they’re all performed behind a glass window. (Extra kudos to sound designer Ryan Rumery, who manages to bring out every blazing riff and power chord.) They are, however, all originals, written by Will Butler of Arcade Fire fame, and all fantastic; the official cast recording will be released May 10 digitally and June 14 on CD.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/19/stereophonic-birthing-a-rock-album-with-playfulness-and-passion/\"><em>Read Bob Verini’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The in-between stuff, the non-musical moments, are what interests Adjmi. There’s Reg’s beautifully bizarre pot-fueled riff on Sausalito houseboats: “They’re like kinetic sculpture. It’s like Mecca! It’s like the mountain! It’s like mythology!” Peter’s casual dismissal of his Olympic champ swimmer brother (“He’s good, but I think he’s a little overpraised”). Holly’s realization that Reg’s drinking and drugging has gotten out of hand: “I’m not wiping your face anymore in the middle of the night so you don’t choke on your vomit. I’m not coming to the pub at 4 am to pick you off the floor.” Peter’s callous critiques of Diana, one of which comes after the band locks in a flawless version of her slow-burn ballad “Bright”: “Your ego is getting in the way. And you need to decide if you’re gonna be a mediocre songwriter or push it to the next level.” That’s when we realize that Diana is a rising star à la Stevie Nicks, and if the men at the label know what’s good for them, they’ll offer her a solo album; Peter realizes it too, and he suggests that they have a baby (“I think it’ll make us closer”). Pidgeon is especially wrenching in this scene.</p>\n<p>If you know Adjmi’s work, you know he’s a skilled satirist: Think of <em>3C</em>, his sexed-up send-up of <em>Three’s Company</em>; his highly comic <em>Marie Antoinette</em>, in which the French queen periodically chats with a prophetic sheep; and his tea-sipping society-matron monologue <em>Elective Affinities</em>. <em>Stereophonic</em> does take a few (deserved) jabs at the music industry—the giant bag of cocaine, for instance—but Adjmi is delving into much, much more: ambition, creation, the quest for perfection, the arduous artistic process, the price of fame… There’s a reason the show is three hours. (Check out <em>The Beatles: Get Back</em>, which follows the Fab Four as they were making the 1970 album <em>Let It Be</em>. The three episodes of the Peter Jackson–directed docuseries total nearly 8 hours!)</p>\n<p>Could <em>Stereophonic</em> have lost five minutes here or there? Maybe. Could director Daniel Aukin have tightened up the pace a bit? Perhaps. But as one character explains: “Music isn’t supposed to be perfect. It’s not about that. It’s about relating to each other; and making something from your soul.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Stereophonic</em> opened on Broadway April 19, 2024, at the Golden Theatre and runs through January 12, 2025.

Photo by Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Playwright David Adjmi’s extensive resume has included an intimate portrait of Syrian Jews in Brooklyn (<em>Stunning</em>), a fanciful contempo take on <em>Marie Antoinette, </em>and <em>3C</em>, a controversial sexed-up parody of the sitcom <em>Three’s Company. </em>Interesting work all around, but none of it prepares us for the hyperrealistic triumph that is <em>Stereophonic</em>, now at the Golden Theatre for a limited run after a similarly limited run at Playwrights Horizons.</p>\n<p>This saga of a torturous year in the life of a rock group and their trusty engineers as they struggle to craft a new album – heavily inspired by Fleetwood Mac’s legendary <em>Rumours</em> – is quite simply terrific. And a huge part of its success is due to the obvious eagerness of all concerned, actors and production team alike, to wrap themselves inside a thoroughly researched, brilliantly imagined slice of life.</p>\n<p>Any &#8220;People At Work&#8221; play has a lot going for it. Whatever interpersonal conflicts or private ruminations the characters engage in, they always know they have to get back to making the donuts (as in <em>Superior Donuts</em>) or the sandwiches (as in <em>Clyde’s</em>), or to pitching real estate (as in <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em>). The rhythms of the job establish the rhythms of the action. There’s no end of inspiration for stage business. Nothing beats anchoring drama to labor.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/19/stereophonic-were-with-the-band/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Since the labor in <em>Stereophonic </em>is making music, Will Butler, late of the Grammy-winning indie-rock Arcade Fire, provides half a dozen songs whose “creation” we eavesdrop on, in dribs and drabs over many a late-night session – songs amusingly reminiscent of <em>Rumours </em>cuts and performed live by the cast. (Nothing beats anchoring actors to live instruments.) Even as Adjmi’s characters are beset by tumultuous personal and professional conflicts, many of them clearly based on reported experiences of the Fleetwood Mac cohort, they snap-to when it’s time to pick up the guitar or sit at the piano or drumset. At the mic, each is alive and confident in their artistry. When the beat stops, they’re as lost and screwed up as the rest of us. This cast is constantly required to morph from fragile civilians to confident pros and back again, and it never gets old.</p>\n<p>Of the players, central are Sarah Pidgeon as the premiere vocalist insecure because she can’t play an instrument, and Tom Pecinka as her gaslighting husband, jealous of his wife’s superior songwriting skill. Equally invaluable, and impossible to forget, are engineers Grover (Eli Gelb) and Charlie (Andrew R. Butler), the play’s hilarious Vladimir and Estragon. (Sooner will Godot arrive than their wayward quintet assemble for the next take.)</p>\n<p>The verisimilitude of <em>Stereophonic </em>extends to every aspect of its presentation. You can practically inhale the cold coffee, stale pizza and weed permeating designer David Zinn’s recording studio, idiosyncratic yet generic. (When the locale shifts from Sausalito to L.A., the set changes not one iota.) Given the 1976-77 time period (“It’s like fucking Watergate around here!,” someone exclaims), costume designer Enver Chakartash goes mad with enough groovy tie-dye, embroidered shirts and bell bottoms to make a Boomer squeal with delight (this one did, anyhow). Jiyoun Chang’s lighting deftly shifts moods without compromising the realism of a harshly-lit sandbox for musicians to play in. And the ear is as stimulated as the eye, thanks to sound designer Ryan Rumery’s manipulating of spoken dialogue, tunes amplified or acoustic, as well as the sounds of silence.</p>\n<p>Speaking of manipulation, director Daniel Aukin understands that while time is a river, rivers need license to rush or to linger. He allows sequences to breathe with real life, which means racing through overlapping dialogue here, or indulging daringly long pauses there. The 3-hours-and-five-minutes running time is atypical for Broadway, but like one track of an album giving way to another, the scenes create a haunting cycle of tension and release, and justify the time expended. You won’t see more assured direction this year, I feel sure of it.</p>\n<p>Adjmi’s busy bees are met at selected, even random moments in the course of their year of activity. Whenever we drop in, there are moments of high drama and others of rollicking humor. Often both, in the fumbling efforts of the addled British bassist (a dazzling Will Brill) to battle his addictions so as not to lose his long-suffering wife (Juliana Canfield, a mesmerizing presence throughout).</p>\n<p>Yet every so often amidst the hurlyburly, Euterpe, muse of music, smiles. Talent trumps turmoil, and out of the blue something magical flies into those microphones to be laid down on tape. We share the band’s elation – it’s the very same elation we’ll feel when we buy the record and experience a timeless cut for the first time – and even dour, keeps-his-own-counsel drummer Simon (Chris Stack, superb) can’t hold back. “We’re such a good band!” he can exclaim, pulling his colleagues, his co-religionists one might better say, into one giant group hug.</p>\n<p>Once again, in the end, it’s all about the work.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Stereophonic opened April 19, 2024, at the John Golden Theatre and runs through January 12, 2025.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>There’s nothing wrong with this season’s crop of chronically ailing Broadway musicals, it turns out, that can’t be set right by a little talent. Well, make that a lot of talent, or even a whole lot of talent. Upon the well-worn heels of no less than 11 anemic new musicals comes Shaina Taub to Broadway’s rescue with the provocative, mirthful, entertaining, and irrepressibly rousing <em>Suffs</em>.</p>\n<p>Taub’s masterwork—and her first musical to reach Broadway—was initially staged two Aprils back at the Public Theater, in the same space that originally hosted <em>Hamilton</em>, <em>Fun Home</em>, <em>Caroline or Change,</em> and <em>A Chorus Line</em>. Which is, all in all, pretty fine company. The downtown <em>Suffs</em> showed great promise, although in need of the type of developmental rewriting and refining of the sort which is impossible to accomplish when the composer-lyricist-bookwriter cannot sit out front and watch the show because she is onstage playing the leading role. In the interim, Taub has not only refined the piece; she has rethought it.</p>\n<p>Among other elemental shifts, <em>Suffs</em>—now at the Music Box—has a knockout new ragtime opening number (“Let Mother Vote”), which is used as something of a recurring theme:</p>\n<p><em>Let mother vote<br />\n</em><em>We’ll nurse the USA<br />\n</em><em>Until corruption, greed and vice<br />\n</em><em>Are sweetly swept away</em></p>\n<p>There is also an exhilarating closing number (“Keep Marching”), which all but gets the audience marching in place as these suffs of a hundred years ago tell their present-day descendants:</p>\n<p><em>We did not end injustice and neither will you<br />\n</em><em>But still we made strides so we know you can too<br />\n</em></p>\n<p>Thus, Taub and company get the show off to a faster start and end it with a bigger bang, with other significant alterations along the way. At the same time, the author retains her underlying rallying cry:</p>\n<p><em>How will we do it when it’s never been done?<br />\n</em><em>How will we find a way where there isn’t one?</em></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/18/suffs-the-brilliant-new-musical-that-demands-to-be-heard/\"><em>Read Roma Torre’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>“Suffs” is short for suffragists. As one of the characters explains, “suffragettes is what the papers call us to make us seem like kewpie dolls instead of legitimate reformers.” The time is 1913. Eager young firebrand Alice Paul (Taub) approaches the venerated Carrie Chapman Catt (Jenn Colella) of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, suggesting that perhaps society luncheons and polite lobbying are ineffective methods for getting the women of America the right to vote. Paul assembles a ragtag team to fight the battle: fellow Swarthmore graduate Lucy Burns (Ally Bonino), glamorous socialite Inez Milholland (Hannah Cruz), immigrant socialist Ruza Wenclawska (Kim Blanck), and eager scribe Doris Stevens (Nadia Dandashi). The last is enlisted as recording secretary of the group; Stevens’ 1920 book “Jailed for Freedom” served as source material for Taub. (All of the major characters are historical figures.)</p>\n<p>They are joined by such real-life personages as Chicago journalist Ida B. Wells (Nikki M. James), Gilded Age millionaire Alva Belmont (Emily Skinner), and political operative Dudley Malone (Tsilala Brock), who resigns his position with President Woodrow Wilson (Grace McLean) in protest. (Taub has written Malone and Wilson, along with other minor male characters, to be performed by an all-women cast.) Together, this band of suffs wages the battle that leads to passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1919, allowing women the right to vote. White women, at least. As is the case with so many of our American freedoms, equality does not always mean <em>equality</em>—a topic addressed with candor by Taub and delivered with power by James in “Wait My Turn.”</p>\n<p>Director Leigh Silverman (<em>Violet</em>) has retained most of the players from the Public, with the production marked by a distinctive supporting cast: James, a Tony-winner for <em>Book of Mormon</em>, giving a nuanced and powerful performance; McLean, of <em>Natasha, Pierre and The Great Comet of 1812</em>, repeating her devastatingly wicked portrayal of the 28th president; and Colella, of <em>Come from Away</em>, who uncomfortably comes to realize that the objectionable Alice Paul resembles her younger self. Similarly impressive in less flashy roles are Cruz (of <em>The Connector</em>, who has moved from her downtown chore as the fiery immigrant into the role originated by Philippa Soo), Bonino, and the delectable team of Dandashi and Brock—whose characters sing about “If We Were Married” and in 1921 did indeed get married.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20929\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20929\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20929\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/3-Nikki-M.-James-as-Ida-B.-Wells-and-Suffs-Company.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/3-Nikki-M.-James-as-Ida-B.-Wells-and-Suffs-Company.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/3-Nikki-M.-James-as-Ida-B.-Wells-and-Suffs-Company.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/3-Nikki-M.-James-as-Ida-B.-Wells-and-Suffs-Company.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/3-Nikki-M.-James-as-Ida-B.-Wells-and-Suffs-Company.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/3-Nikki-M.-James-as-Ida-B.-Wells-and-Suffs-Company.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-20929\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kim Blanck, Hannah Cruz, Nikki M.

Skinner plays the flashy role of the millionaire benefactor with her customary comedic flair. Look closely, though, and you’ll notice that it is Skinner who comes on at a critical moment  as a drably worn Tennessee mother, tugs at the heartstrings, and in effect changes American history.</p>\n<p>The physical production, which was among the less successful aspects downtown, has been redesigned from scratch. Now we have a spare, open scheme featuring Washingtonian columns and frequent silhouettes across the wide horizon. The new team includes scenic designer Riccardo Hernández (who, between Sunday’s <em>Lempicka</em> and Tuesday’s <em>Sally &amp; Tom,</em> has had a busy week), costume designer Paul Tazewell (<em>Hamilton</em>), lighting designer Lap Chi Chu (<em>Camelot</em>), and hair designer Charles G. LaPointe (<em>Hamilton</em>). There is also a replacement choreographer, Mayte Natalio (<em>How to Dance in Ohio</em>). Music director Andrea Grody (<em>The Band’s Visit</em>) has remained on the podium, leading a 12-piece band in new orchestrations by Michael Starobin (<em>Sunday in the Park with George</em>) with the composer and Grody providing the vocal arrangements</p>\n<p>There hasn’t been a new musical written singlehandedly by a first-time-on-Broadway composer-lyricist-bookwriter starring in their own musical since—when? As best I can tell, back in 1901 when that flag-waving George M. Cohan did it. This would be an impressive accomplishment even if the work, itself, were ordinary. Taub’s talent, though, is extraordinary: as a performer, yes, but even moreso as a songwriter with a canny theatricality and an uncanny future.</p>\n<p><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Suffs </b><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened April 18, 2023, at the Music Box Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><br />\nIt’s been nearly nine years since <i>Hamilton</i> took Broadway by storm, and now comes a worthy successor. Much like Lin-Manuel Miranda’s tour de force, <i>Suffs</i>, short for suffragists, showcases the creative prowess of Shaina Taub, who assumes the roles of writer, composer, lyricist, and lead performer. But the comparison goes well beyond historical subject matter. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Both productions seamlessly blend narrative and music while portraying determined individuals grappling with seemingly insurmountable challenges. While <i>Hamilton</i> chronicles Alexander Hamilton’s pivotal role in shaping the nation, <i>Suffs</i> sheds profound light on Alice Paul’s crusade for women’s suffrage.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The musical begins in 1913; the suffrage movement was already many decades old, and with virtually no progress, women were becoming frustrated. We first meet the president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Carrie Chapman Catt (Jenn Colella) who advocates for a gradual approach, preaching &#8220;slow and steady, not until the country is ready.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Enter young upstart Alice Paul (Shaina Taub) who’s impatient for change, and the two women lock heads over the direction of the movement. Paul starts her own organization, The National Woman’s Party, and recruits like-minded activists to join her. They are the heroes of <i>Suffs</i>, but shamefully, they are largely absent from our history books: Paul’s best friend and former college mate Lucy Burns (Ally Bonino), posh firebrand Inez Milholland (Hannah Cruz), Socialist agitator Ruza Wenclawska (Kim Blanck), and the eager young scribe Doris Stevens (Nadia Dandashi).</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/18/suffs-shaina-taub-wins-by-a-landslide/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">They are all white women which raises another conflict &#8211; women of color, embodied by the great journalist Ida B. Wells (Nikki M. James) and reformer Mary Church Terrell (Anastasia McCleskey) are told to wait their turn. Wells isn’t having it and James will surely earn a much deserved Tony nomination for her powerful performance singing the stirringly defiant anthem “Wait My Turn”:</p>\n<p><em>You want me to wait my turn</em><br />\n<em>To simply put my sex before my race</em><br />\n<em>Oh! Why don’t I leave my skin at home</em><br />\n</span><em><span class=\"s1\">And powder up my face?<br />\nGuess who always waits her turn?<br />\n</span><span class=\"s1\">Who always ends up in the back?<br />\nUs lucky ones born both female and black </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Taub’s meticulous research is evident as she nimbly depicts the complex issues and actions of the suffragists during the seven years leading up to ratification of the 19th Amendment. The women’s resilience is tested amid all the fruitless visits to an unyielding President Woodrow Wilson (the wonderfully sardonic Grace Mclean), the elections, the conventions, the protests, the arrests, the assaults, the hunger strikes, the torture and constant abuse. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While it could so easily turn wonky, Taub never loses sight of the emotional toll on these women, devoting their lives to the never-ending struggle.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>And so, for every song of defiance (“Finish the Fight” and “Show Them Who You Are”) there’s another questioning why they do it. In the beautifully plaintive ballad “Worth It”, even the take-no-prisoners Paul laments the sacrifices she’s forced to make:</p>\n<p><em>What would my life look like if I wasn’t so consumed by this?</em><br />\n</span><em>I see women with their children in the park and I feel a little ache</em><br />\n<em><span class=\"s1\">Is knowing that kind of love really something I’m willing to miss?<br />\nAnd will I feel like a failure no matter what choice I make?</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Taub composed more than 30 songs for the show and each of them strikes a resonant chord, both melodic and lyrically rich. “Keep Marching” is so rousingly tuneful, it’s still with me; and the delightfully humorous “G.A.B” (“Great America Bitch”) injects the 20th century suffs with a touch of 21st century badassery. The audience ate it up. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The streamlined production features minimal set pieces with little more than pillars and wood panels that open and close. That gives director Leigh Silverman and choreographer Mayte Natalio a wide berth to skillfully arrange the movements of the all-female cast. Silverman achieves quite a balancing act combining just the right mix of earnest authenticity and contemporary relevance. And she’s able to pull it off with an outstanding company. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The women making their Broadway debuts are all sublime. Hannah Cruz as the socialite Inez Milholland who famously led the DC protest march astride a white horse, exudes glamour and charisma with a radiant heart; Ally Bonino as Lucy Burns, the realist of the militant suffs, and Kim Blanck the hot-headed Polish socialist, supply equal parts humor and pathos. Nadia Dandashi as Doris Stevens, the suffs secretary who published books about the movement and Tsilala Brock, playing Dudley Malone as an early 20th century version of a woke man, remind us that marriage was an economic death sentence for women back then.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">   </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And as for the veterans, impressive as she was in <i>Come From Away, </i>Jenn Colella does it again, this time acing the role of an imperious leader who preferred to fight ”ladylike” rather than ruffle any male feathers, and she is phenomenal. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So great to see the always excellent Emily Skinner in two key roles playing “rich old broad” Alva Belmont who bankrolled Paul’s NWP, and as a rural southern mother who singlehandedly saved the day. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Finally, kudos to Shaina Taub for her incomparable talents. The woman is so gifted it’s hard to know where to start, but let’s just say her work on this production is nothing short of masterful. (I was fortunate to see two press performances, as Taub was out when I first attended. I am happy to report that understudy Hawley Gould is every bit as captivating in the role.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Suffs</i>, much like <i>Hamilton</i>, transcends entertainment, serving as a poignant reminder that history matters.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>In an era where women&#8217;s rights face renewed threats, <i>Suffs</i> stands as a testament to the perseverance of those who came before us. And it offers inspiration and possibly a blueprint to take up the mantle and continue the march to achieving true equality which still remains well out of reach. Aside from all that, dramatically speaking, it’s just that good!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">By show’s end, I kept thinking about that timeless adage: &#8220;Well-behaved women rarely make history.&#8221; Thanks to Taub, Silverman, and their remarkable ensemble, <i>Suffs, </i>like <i>Hamilton</i> before it, is poised to etch its own place in theatre history.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Suffs </strong><strong>opened April 18, 2023, at the Music Box Theatre.

Photo: Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\nA big plus punching-up revivals of <em>The Wiz</em> is that not just anybody gets to play Dorothy. Usually, a healthy search precedes the casting, newcomers and relative newcomers the subjects of such serious foraging. This time around Dorothy is Broadway debutante Nichelle Lewis &#8212; and she’s got more than enough of what it takes.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A voice to stop clocks in only her first notable asset. She flaunts personality and acting acumen to back that up. She’s ready for all the choreography JaQuel Knight throws her way, and there’s plenty. From start to finish &#8212; even when Dorothy’s longing to get back home &#8212; Lewis gives the impression she’s having the time of her life.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good part of the reason is that she’s the central figure in a much loved enterprise. No need to go into detail about a 1975 property that Charlie Smalls (music, lyrics) and William F. Brown (book) made when adapting L. Frank Baum’s “The Wonderful World of Oz” into an All-Black presentation.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/17/the-wiz-not-an-oz-picious-revival/\"><em>Read Bob Verini’s </em>★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 1939 M-G-M Judy Garland starrer is tv-aired enough for everyone to know the story of a young girl, kidnapped by a tornado, who arrives in enchanted Oz to be joined by brainless Scarecrow (Avery Wilson), heart-missing Tinman (Phillip Johnson Richardson), and courage-lacking Lion (Kyle Ramar Freeman) on a journey to Emerald City, where a Wizard (Wayne Brady) will supposedly grant their various wishes.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along the way &#8212; on Hannah Beachler’s zingy sets, in the imaginative costumes Sharen Davis supplies the entire ensemble, under Ryan J. O’Gara’s brilliant lights, and backed by Daniel Brodie’s enhancing videos and projections &#8212; the fearsome foursome treads the Yellow Brick Road, infusing unflagging vitality into the beloved Baum tale, much of this wrought by director Schele Williams.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the strongest element <em>The Wiz</em> boasts is Small’s score. Forty-nine years ago, “Ease on Down the Road” and “Home” eased on out of the show to knock at the American Songbook’s increasingly difficult to attain standards roster.  The other Smalls inclusions retain listenability hardly common in todays’ tuner crop.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To assure that the earworm-y ditties get their due (and more), everyone asked to solo has a voice equal to Lewis’ power. Not a one of them &#8212; including Deborah “Nobody’s Supposed to Be Here” Cox as Glinda &#8212; is denied the chance to hit notes high enough to rattle the rafters. Also, not a one resists indulging the kind of sanctified American-Idol melismas that have audience members hooting mid-song.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dancing in these lively circumstances is also a non-stop achievement, beginning with the tornado. To suggest its ravages, choreographer Knight has his primed troupers dervishing in filmy grey outfits. It may be that a tornado has never been more symbolically presented on a stage. (That’s even if anyone has previously had to meet a tornado challenge.) As routines accumulate, neither Knight nor his dancers show any signs of tiring.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all the show-stopping singing and dancing and voluptuous acting &#8212; from most prominently Lewis, Freeman, Richardson, and Wilson &#8212; it could be said that <em>The Wiz</em> gives the enthusiastic audience its money’s worth.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">True and not so true. What about giving the audience more than its money’s worth? What about giving the ticket buyers a better tale than this backwards glance is currently providing? Or is this version of <em>The Wiz</em> not so much a backward glance as a flash forward? As a matter of disappointing fact, what’s on view now is not entirely Williams’ book.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the program, Amber Ruffin, who neatly revised last season’s <em>Some Like It Hot</em> with Matthew Lopez, is announced as having added material. How much? According to supplied info, she’s boldly, not to say brazenly, reworked 50 percent of it. In one interview, she has vouched of her contributions, “We made a choice to not modernize it, but to make it so it could always go up at any time—I honestly feel like this version could go up 30 years from now and you don’t have to change a word, and it is fine.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not so fast. What’s on view right now isn’t even “fine” for 2024. That includes just about the entire second act, which gets going at Emerald City with a green-tinged production number.  In Ruffin’s revise the Wizard is seen even before the Wicked Witch does any menacing &#8212; a Wicked Witch called Evillene and played by Melody A. Betts, who’s also an adoring Aunt Em.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When this supposedly contemporized Wizard begins wizzing, he’s no longer exposed as a benevolent aging fellow but is depicted as a tough galoot supposedly protecting his Emerald City citizens from some curse or other that needs lifting. Evillene, when she finally makes an appearance, is menacing but hardly as throttling as spectators expect. More specifics will not be itemized because they’d only confirm that this new shuffle – intended to address racism in a politicized gaze at the classic? &#8212; packs nowhere near the delightfully timeless horror that audiences have long known and still love.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two concluding observations: 1) Lewis goes through both <em>Wiz</em> acts flaunting long, polished fingernails. Some may find it strange that a young girl living in a rural Kansas cabin appears to have an expert manicurist at her disposal; and 2) There is no Toto.</span></p>\n<p><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">The Wiz </b><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened April 17, 2024, at the Marquis Theatre.

Photo by Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Those with fond memories of M-G-M’s 1939 <em>Wizard of Oz,</em> or William F. Brown and Charlie Smalls’ brash, funky 1975 Tony winner <em>The Wiz, </em>might elect to give the current revival of the latter a pass. It could break your heart. On the other hand, devotees of <em>American Idol</em> oversinging<em>, </em>or the plotless buffoonery of traditional British panto, can safely ease on down the road to the Marquis Theater.</p>\n<p>Most of the beats that you remember from past versions are gone or strangely altered. At rise, we hear “Dorothy! A tornado’s coming,” and Aunt Em (Melody A. Betts) emerges to persuade her lonely niece (Nichelle Lewis) to bring in the wash. The storm obligingly waits for Em to deliver two pages of exposition about Dorothy’s late parents and her bullies at school, and fixes the locket those bullies busted while singing about “The Feeling We Once Had.”</p>\n<p>Boom! A projection effect blows open the farm and we end up in… New Orleans? Well, not Munchkinland, anyway. (No Munchkins.) But there’s a dead witch under the house for sure, and a colorfully garbed ensemble of Ozians dancing and vogueing everywhere. I have never seen so much vogueing in a single musical. In the poppy field, outside the Emerald City, inside the Emerald City and in the Wicked Witch’s castle. Vogueing and athleticism, that’s Oz’s signature. (JaQuel Knight’s choreography is impressive at first, but doesn’t wear well with repetition.)</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/17/the-wiz-revival-doesnt-ease-down-the-road-easily/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Another witch, Addaperle (Allyson Kaye Daniel) makes jokes at her late sister’s expense: “She flat. Flat as she can be. I mean, this woman is so flat that instead of a coffin, we are gonna use a manila envelope.” Enter Glinda (Deborah Cox): “Wow, you look like an angel.” “Thanks, I moisturize.” Amber Ruffin is credited with “additional material for this production,” but after her sharp work on <em>Some Like It Hot’s</em> book I am loath to ascribe any of these groaners to her. Wanting to go home, Dorothy is pointed in the Wiz’s direction but must assume the corpse’s silver slippers to “Ease On Down the Road.” Yet it’s not a road at all, just a cadre of drum majors in yellow capes and big black hats. Couldn’t anyone come up with something yellow on the floor for the characters to walk on?</p>\n<p>Dorothy encounters the usual suspects, but what do you know, the Wicked Witch was responsible for everyone’s woes: stealing the heart of the Scarecrow (Avery Wilson), rusting the Tinman (Phillip Johnson Richardson); and scaring the guts out of the Lion (Kyle Ramar Freeman). Turns out the Wiz (Wayne Brady, bland and underused) and the Emerald City generally have similarly been cursed, for no one may leave its gates. So Dorothy’s tracking down Evillene (Betts again) is actually pointedly motivated, and rendered pretty easy, too, what with the Witch telegraphing her Achilles heel (“What is a bucket of water doing up here? Guards, take it away!”).</p>\n<p>Under Schele Williams’ direction, the story is perfunctory, just a series of disconnected scenes. Moment by moment there is little character reality to play: Dorothy’s need to get home is never felt, and there’s no urgency in her journey. Songs and dances don’t arise naturally from the action, just one big variety show. I lost count of the number of songs that shoot up to a high note designed (successfully) to elicit spontaneous applause. Of the cast, Richardson comes off best because he’s allowed most of the time to speak like a normal person. Betts is a warm, nurturing Aunt Em anyone would click their heels to come home to, but with everyone shouting like crazy, her Evillene never becomes scary. She’s just one more yeller.</p>\n<p>As for Dorothy, young Ms. Lewis has undeniable star quality, and it&#8217;s not her fault that she seems confused as to whether, at any given moment, she’s supposed to be worried, bold, sassy, or Dr. Phil. (Yes, she’s constantly giving advice, and it’s she, not the Wiz, who wraps up the plot.) Never mind, there are good things in this young lady’s future, you can bet.</p>\n<p>To be completely honest, the show has always had a tough time of it. The original production was drastically unsuccessful during its tryout, until the producer fired the director and handed over the reins to Geoffrey Holder, at that point the show’s costume designer. He was widely credited with turning the show into a hit. This time around, perhaps they opted for a place holder instead of a Holder in place.</p>\n<p>I should also point out that nobody bites the Witch in this version, because Dorothy’s dog has been excised. In toto.</p>\n<p><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">The Wiz </b><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened April 17, 2024, at the Marquis Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy and Eden Espinosa</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps it’s fitting that <em>Lempicka</em>, the musical about painter Tamara de Lempicka (1898-1980), is visually triumphant. Bravos and bravas are due any number of the creative staff members contributing to the tuner’s grandeur as well as to the 10-strong singer-dancers, all choreographed by so-busy-this-season Raja Feather Kelly, who translates to the stage the Polish-Jewish artist’s often breath-takingly sensuous (mostly) women and men.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huzzahs to Paloma Young for the atmospheric 1920s-30s costumes worn by Lempicka’s subjects, including her daughter Kizette and Rafaela, one of her lesbian lovers. They brilliantly conjure the period’s ultra-fashionable looks. And bows to Bradley King for lighting the clothes to so they capture the illumination in Lempicka’s works, not unlike the way Vermeer’s light drapes his figures.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cheers for Riccardo Hernández, whose set keenly reflects the Art Deco curves and angled lines that prevailed in the period when the rich-by-marriage to Baron Tadeusz Lempicki portraitist had rich Parisians eagerly commissioning her work.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/14/lempicka-a-paint-by-numbers-old-school-musical/\"><em>Read Sandy MacDonald’s </em>★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At one moment in the proceedings, Lempicka (the determined, stalwart Eden Espinosa, newly from Michael John LaChiusa’s <em>The Gardens of Anuncia</em>) says of her work’s purpose, “Make the flesh glow.” This is indisputably true of those mentioned above, as coordinated by director Rachel Chavkin, always reliable for a bang-up job with something along the same  scale of this property. (Recall what she accomplished with the Broadway realization of <em>Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1912.</em>)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chavkin easily – okay, it comes off looking easy &#8212; obtains the entrancing painterly glow but doesn’t reap anything approaching equal results with the other more central <em>Lempicka</em> elements: Carson Kreitzer’s lyrics (memorializing Lempicka was her concept) and the book she co-wrote with Matt Gould, who composed the music.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, there isn’t much glow to the manuscript as they go about retelling what is known of Lempicka. Her life is far from obscure. She became a baroness three years after, at 16, meeting the baron; gave birth to Kizette; and came through the First World War after sacrificing to liberate her war-prisoner husband. She was known to have male and female lovers, to have married a second time after divorcing, and living out the rest of her life in California and Mexico, where she died. Furthermore, she pursued a 1930s career as fascist shadows lengthened and her art &#8212; as well as her renowned promiscuity &#8212; threatened to put her out of business, and worse.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kreitzer and Gould have stuck to some of these sketchy details and have taken liberties with others, the most significant involving Lempicka’s love life. It seems as if they decided their crucial concentration should feature the artist, husband Tadeusz (Andrew Samonsky), with whom she carries on an often-distant relationship, and with Rafaela (Amber Iman), a prostitute.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Rafaela appears to be known to Lempicka biographers, whether she was one-third of an exclusive Tamara-Tadeusz triangle does not seem historically verified. More likely, the bookwriters decided they’d present Rafaela as a composite of the women and men with whom Lempicka dallied. They assumed the situation would constitute a believable story. They’re more trite than right. (Tadeusz’s dalliances are dealt with in a brief exchange between the defiant Tamara and him.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attempting to lend <em>Lempicka</em> a canvas broader than Lempicka’s voluptuous canvases, Kreitzer and Gould arrange a stylized look at the Russian Revolution &#8212; and its eventually sending Tamara and Tadeusz, penniless and unprepared to work for a living, to Paris. They bookend that theatrical documentation with a fascist-foreboding routine, highlighted by symbolic figure Marinetti (the hyper-active George Abud) conjuring Hitler’s rise. (Choreographer Kelly, always at the ready, has his indefatigable contingent execute gestures subtly suggesting German citizens “Heil”-ing.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gould’s music and Kreitzer’s lyrics don’t do much to substantiate the drama, either. The score is not short on offerings but is short on anything memorable. More frequently than not, the numbers impress as recitative hoping to be mistaken for melodic song. Unfortunately, they remain not much more than rising and falling notes eventually adding up to pompous repetition &#8212; all the while music director Charity Wicks conducts a 10-person band with gusto.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kreitzer’s lyrics don’t improve matters. (Has she written them first, handed them to Gould, expecting him to compose strictly according to what he’s received?) There are moments throughout when characters begin songs that should expand emotion &#8212; Tadeusz’s “Wake Up” for one, Rafaela’s “The Most Beautiful Bracelet” for another. They do their bidding but only thanks to performers Samonsky and Iman.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, Kreitzer, Gould and director Chavkin rely on the cast to turn second-rate material into first-rate audience-grabbers. Their success is strictly due to cast members’ bravura intoning, for which thanks especially to Zoe Glick as Kizette, Natalie Joy Johnson as lesbian-club owner Suzy Solidor, and Beth Leavel as a rich patron.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First among the magic-makers is, of course, Espinosa, one of the foremost Broadway belters of the last couple of decades. Vivifying material about an artist’s dealing with design, with color, with form &#8212; not unlike Sondheim finishing Georges Seurat’s “A Sunday Afternoon on the Grand Jatte” &#8212; Espinosa glorifies “I Will Paint Her.” With “Woman Is,” she ends the first act on a definite high note.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Towards the final curtain, Lempicka, languishing in Hollywood, drops this observation: “No one knows what will survive.” Naturally, she’s talking about her work, but she has something more far-reaching to suggest, and it certainly leaves the <em>Lempicka</em> purveyors with great hope about their own dubious production’s future.</span></p>\n<p><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Lempicka </b><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened April 14, 2024, at the Longacre Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Power-contralto Eden Espinosa strives mightily  to keep <em>Lempicka</em> – an overstuffed, formulaic musical – in forward motion, to mixed effect. Despite the evident willingness of co-creators Carson Kreitzer and Matt Gould to play fast and loose with history, the show plugs along like a Bugatti (an emblematic subject of the Polish-born painter) in need of a lube job.</p>\n<p>Espinosa portrays painter Tamara de Lempicka (1898-1980) at various stages in her life and career, in a scrambled timeline starting with the bitter reflections of an elderly, one-time art star seated on a park bench, daubing dejectedly. “Plane, lines, form,” she mutters, “plane, color, light…” (Kreitzer likes employing lists as lyrics). “Circling the drain, in Hollywood,” Lempicka laments. Cue the swirling dissolve, or the stage equivalent thereof.</p>\n<p>Flashback – unnecessarily far back – to a dewy bridal scene in 1916, when Lempicka married Tadeusz Lempicki, a socially prominent Polish lawyer. The scene is gratuitous and saccharine, but at least serves to introduce Andrew Samonsky’s silky, seemingly effortless tenor.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/14/lempicka-admired-artist-tamara-de-lempicka-musicalized-with-limited-artistry/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The newlyweds’ idyll is short-lived. For those in the audience unschooled in 20<sup>th</sup>-century history, we’re given hints of trouble to come via projections (designed by Peter Nigrini). Russia is in violent flux. As a member of the hitherto elite, Tadeusz is jailed and Tamara bargains with a commandant (George Abud) for his release.</p>\n<p>The historical account suggests that this was a relatively civilized exchange – if sexual favors rendered under duress can be categorized thus – but the musical goes all out in depicting a hellish descent into brutal debauchery. Abud, in this and subsequent scenes in which he plays assorted roles, goes all in, jacked up and shamelessly spotlight-grabbing.</p>\n<p>Wouldn’t adequate lighting be a <em>sine qua non</em> for painters? Once the couple flees to Paris (set designer Riccardo Hernández works in Eiffel-esque girders as markers), the atmosphere – effective chiaroscuro by lighting designer Bradley King – is mostly cavelike, nocturnal.</p>\n<p>Abruptly, with little by way of a segue, we’re seeing a gutter-flower – resplendent Amber Iman – straddling a skeletal Bugatti-chassis and wowing a crowd with a <em>cri de coeur</em>: “Don’t Bet Your Heart.” This is the prostitute Rafaela, based on a real-life muse – and presumed lover –  of Lempicka’s. Rafaela will be back (she and Tamara spend a lot of time in bed, thrashing out their relationship), but this is Iman’s shining moment, worth the overall tedium of admission.</p>\n<p>Also notable is Natalie Joy Johnson as Suzy Solidor, founder of the famed lesbian club La Vie Parisienne (here redubbed Le Monocle). Initially blending into the corps (unremarkable choreography by Raja Feather Kelly), Johnson gradually acquires a distinctive persona and cheerleads a rousing ensemble number, “Women,” stylishly costumed by Paloma Young in sexy-modernist monochrome.</p>\n<p>Transforming Lempicka’s appearance through six decades proves a challenge, and the platinum wig provided by Leah I. Loukas is a disaster: it’s an immutable, muffling casque. (Even marcelled waves tend to get mussed in bed.)</p>\n<p>If you spend the first two hours wondering why Beth Leavel (a Tony Winner for <em>The Drowsy Chaperone</em>) is so grievously underused, wait for it. Playing the Baroness (a patron), Leavel, not the marathoning Espinosa, gets the eleven-o’clock number, as a moribund wife graciously passing along the torch. The gist: “Take my husband – please.”</p>\n<p>Is the scene unapologetically sentimental? You bet – as is the entire project, a garbled paean to an ambitious woman who, under duress and with a healthy helping of ego, carved her own path. Lempicka deserves – deserved – better.</p>\n<p><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\"></b><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Lempicka opened April 14, 2024, at the Longacre Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><br />\nIt’s pretty remarkable to consider that S. E. Hinton published “The Outsiders” when she was just 18 years old growing up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>That was 57 years ago; and the novel detailing the troubled lives of the young Greasers and the Socs (derivative of “Socialites”) remains a staple in school reading lists to this day. Its realistic depiction of teenage angst and gang violence pitting the rich kids versus the poor turned it into a young adult classic despite its literary shortcomings. It’s been criticized for its occasional cliches and contrivances which were readily apparent in the 1983 film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. And that’s why I expected the stage version to be a mixed bag. To my very pleasant surprise, as musical adaptations go this season, <i>The Outsiders</i> jumps to the head of the class.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Everything about this production feels original and dynamic. Directed by Danya Taymor, it’s a terrific collaboration highlighting all of the novel’s virtues while sidestepping most of the clunkier aspects. Many in the gifted cast are making their Broadway debuts; and the entire experience is enhanced by a creative team marked by youthful energy. And while you might think a story about teenagers in the 1960’s would be hopelessly dated today, it’s not. Thanks to canny stylizing and an emphasis on character development, the effect is deeply engaging and universal. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s basically a coming of age tale featuring Ponyboy Curtis, a bright 14-year-old who’s orphaned and living with his two older brothers, Darrel and Sodapop. As Ponyboy, Brody Grant is quite a find. He’s so thoroughly invested in the role, it almost doesn’t matter that his vocals aren’t always clear. I doubt it’s intentional but as a young insecure teen, it fits the part. </span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/11/the-outsiders-lets-get-ready-to-rumble/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em> ★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hinton uses the framing device of a journal which Ponyboy is writing about his life as a Greaser in Tulsa. Of the three brothers, he’s the one with a future. Cliched perhaps but his appreciation of literature and poetry, quoting Robert Frost’s “Nothing Gold Can Stay” was all part of Hinton’s effort to counter the Greaser stereotypes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Darrel, the oldest brother, is played by Brent Comer. He sings beautifully alongside middle brother Sodapop, the ripped Jason Schmidt who’s a lot more than eye candy. The three of them convincingly deliver a stirring portrait of a family split at the seams. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Much like <i>West Side Story’s</i> Sharks and Jets, The Greasers and Socs are constantly battling. The Socs have money, better clothes and cars. The Greasers have little more than each other and they are a close knit fraternity. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ponyboy’s best friend is Johnny Cade. Sky Lakota-Lynch, as a sweet kid from a very broken home, is heartbreaking. The one female lead in the story is Cherry Valance, a Soc who breaks ranks once she discovers that Ponyboy is sensitive and smart. Emma Pittman, possessing a crystalline voice, is lovely in the role.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the movie, Matt Dillon stands out as Dallas, the resident leader of the pack and hardened delinquent just out of county lock-up. In the musical, he’s played by Joshua Boone. He’s clearly a strong actor with a great voice but the role requires more danger than the stoicism he projects. Dillon exhibits a charisma on screen that makes him a natural leader despite his recklessness. That quality is lacking in Boone’s performance. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The plot is thin but to the credit of book writers Adam Rapp and Justin Levine, the focus is on the relationships; the librettists provide a lot of backstory and intimate exchanges which were largely missing in the film version. Here it’s quite heavy and moving, particularly involving Ponyboy and his brothers who are struggling to hold what’s left of their frayed family together. Darrel, described as somewhere between an older brother and father, sings:<br />\n</span><span class=\"s1\"> <em>I keep treading water but sink like a stone</em>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Key to the success of the production is the excellent score composed by Jamestown Revival (Jonathan Clay &amp; Zach Chance) along with Justin Levine who’s got a huge hand in the show, additionally credited with Music Supervision, Orchestration and Arrangements. Each song is woven seamlessly into the narrative.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The opening number “Tulsa ’67” is a perfect scene setter.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>And that’s followed by the upbeat “Grease Got A Hold”, in which Ponyboy is gleefully inducted into the Greaser gang.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>The songs are an eclectic bunch, tuneful and soul-baring when needed. My favorite, sung by the brothers, is an exquisite ballad, “Throwing in the Towel,” with the lyrics:<br />\n<em>I know your head is full of doubt</em><br />\n<em>But brother that’s what love is all about</em><br />\n<em>Don’t go throwing in the towel.</em></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The staging is another huge plus.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>Director Taymor has established herself as a worthy heir to her Aunt Julie’s stellar career. She keeps the action moving with flair and gritty authenticity.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And like her aunt, she’s innovative, making clever use of simple objects. Planks and tires are just about all the props she needs to create the Tulsa landscape &#8211; from a drive-in movie theater to a train to a pond filled with water. A broken down car parked stage left serves as bed, concession stand, playground, you name it. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Add to all this, thrilling dance and fight choreography under the direction of Rick and Jeff Kuperman. The brothers were happily given free rein to ply their exceptional skills. With tremendous athleticism, their dance movements are powerfully evocative.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> T</span>he climactic rumble between the warring gangs is an extended ballet that’s as fittingly violent as it is graceful. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That rumble scene is staged amid a drenching rainstorm. Credit AMP featuring Tatiana Kahvegian for the marvelous “Scenography.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The entire technical design team deserve bows for their contributions combining special effects, lights and sound to artfully suggest settings featuring a raging fire, a drive-in complete with giant screen, and a church high on a hill, among so much else.</span></p>\n<p>The show appeals on so many levels. If the catchy songs, dynamite choreography and heartfelt sentiment don’t grab you, all those hunky young men displaying gobs of talent should do the trick. Injecting a healthy dose of testosterone is always hard to resist. But that’s just a bonus. <i>The Outsiders</i> is an emotionally and viscerally satisfying work.

Photo credit: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Watching the new Broadway musical <em>The Outsiders</em>, it’s hard to shake the feeling that you’ve seen it all before. It’s not just because of the source material, including both S.E. Hinton’s classic YA novel and Francis Coppola’s 1983 film adaptation featuring a slew of young Hollywood hunks. It’s also because the show inevitably recalls <em>West Side Story</em> in its tale of warring youth gangs and a star-crossed romance (not to mention, of course<em>, Romeo and Juliet</em>) and, in its exuberantly choreographed dances featuring athletic young performers<em>, Newsies</em>. This musical adaptation, featuring a book by Adam Rapp and Justin Levine and a score by Levin and Jonathan Clay and Zach Chance (better known as the band Jamestown Revival) proves a perfectly respectable effort with many laudable elements. What it mostly seems to lack is a reason for being.</p>\n<p>Except, of course, to further the growing trend of new musicals based on recognizable literary and cinematic properties, amply in evidence on a stretch of 45<sup>th</sup> Street that features marquees emblazoned with such similar efforts as <em>The Notebook</em> and <em>Water for Elephants</em>. The block doesn’t so much conjure up the magic of Broadway as the not particularly inspired line-up of a movie revival house, if such things still existed.</p>\n<p>Early in the show you may actually think you’re in a movie theater, since we’re treated to a clip of the classic Paul Newman film <em>Cool Hand Luke</em> projected in large size form. The movie inspires both the central character, 14-year-old Ponyboy Curtis (Brody Grant, long past adolescence), and the opening song, “Tulsa ’67,” in which he sets the scene in detailed fashion. He has two supportive older brothers, Darrell (Brent Comer) and Sodapop (Jason Schmidt, who ups the onstage heat by taking off his shirt within seconds), who are raising him after the death of their parents in a car accident.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/04/11/the-outsiders-the-popular-novel-and-film-is-now-a-killer-musical/\"><em>Read Roma Torre’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Ponyboy, whose intellectual aspirations and sensitivity are demonstrated by his reading Dickens’ <em>Great</em> <em>Expectations</em>, hangs out with the introspective, emotionally scarred Johnny (Sky Lakota-Lynch). Along with several others, they’re known as the lower-class “Greasers,” in contrast with the more upscale “Socs,” who live on the other side of the tracks. Among the Greasers is the bad boy Dallas (Joshua Boone), who treats Ponyboy and Johnny as if they were family members.</p>\n<p>When Cherry Valance (Emma Pittman), the girlfriend of one of the Socs, strikes up a friendly flirtation with Ponyboy, it sets off a tragic chain of events including an accidental killing for which Ponyboy and Johnny have to go into hiding, a church fire in which they risk their lives to rescue a group of children, a suicide, and a massive brawl between the two gangs, represented by a lavishly choreographed dance in which the performers are drenched in rain. The last element is impressively handled, to be sure, but as the water soaked their heavily muscled bodies, I kept waiting for them to break into the chorus of “Flashdance (What a Feeling).” (And what’s the story with all these onstage soakings? Between this and <em>The</em> <em>Notebook </em>next door, the neighborhood may soon be facing a water emergency.)</p>\n<p>It’s hard not to be flip about the melodramatic storyline, which doesn’t feel at home onstage and probably only resonates with adolescents or adults permanently stuck in the condition. Rapp and Levine’s book is relatively faithful to the source material, although some significant plot elements have been altered.  (Less importantly, in the book Ponyboy was reading <em>Gone with the Wind,</em> but that wouldn’t exactly fly in these politically correct times. Also, <em>Great Expectations</em> makes for a better song title.) And speaking of political correctness, in this rendition, needless to say, the Greasers are notably racially diverse and have even allowed a girl into the gang.</p>\n<p>If you can get past the general rehashedness of it all, <em>The Outsiders</em> has many things going for it. The folk-rock sounding score features some terrific songs, including the two aforementioned numbers and the powerful “Stay Gold,” even if by the end of the evening they all start to sound the same. Grant delivers a charismatic, beautifully sung performance as Ponyboy, and Boone proves a commanding presence as the ill-fated Dallas. Indeed, the entire young ensemble is attractive and dynamic, and it’s easy to imagine several of them breaking out big time in the future. Rick Kuperman and Jeff Kuperman’s muscular choreography serves the material well, as do the technical elements, although the bare-bones, barnlike set design, by a collective known as “AMP featuring Tatiana Kahvegian,” leaves something to be desired unless you really have a thing for tires. Although I did get a kick out of the hood of the onstage car being converted into a bed, a scenic conceit that ironically mirrors the awkward transition of the angst-ridden source material into a wholesome musical.</p>\n<div><b>The Outsiders </b><strong>opened April 11, 2024, at the Bernard Jacobs Theatre.

Photo: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure>\n<p>★★★★☆ <strong>An Enemy of the People</strong></p>\n<p>Between those overgrown mutton-chop whiskers, tiny wire-rimmed spectacles and cold, thin-lipped glare, portraits of Henrik Ibsen suggest that the Norwegian playwright is likely the oldest and deadest white guy in world literature.</p>\n<p>Looks are deceiving. Although Ibsen departed the planet in 1906, right now he’s got a major Broadway hit with <i>An Enemy of the People. </i>On top of that, our venerable Father of Realism rates a comical tribute in <i>Ibsen’s Ghost</i> currently at an Off Broadway house.</p>\n<p>As a lover of works old and new (aren’t we all?), it made me happy to note so many spectators standing in the rear of a sold-out Circle in the Square to see Ibsen’s <i>An Enemy of the People</i>, a drama that proves to be both old and new. Ibsen composed his play some 140 years ago and now Amy Herzog provides a fresh version of this dark comedy about a maligned whistleblower. Last week, the production packed the 828-seat theater to 103% capacity</p>\n<p>The marquee allure of TV series favorites Jeremy Strong and Michael Imperioli, who face off as siblings clashing over the truth, no doubt initially fired up <i>An Enemy of the People</i> as a hot ticket for its 16-week stint. Smartly staged by director Sam Gold in a relatively intimate in-the-round space, the well-acted production subsequently won many positive reviews. (My good colleague <a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/03/18/an-enemy-of-the-people-ibsens-classic-trivialized-with-gimmickry-and-ice-cubes/\">Frank Scheck</a> did not think so highly of the show.)</p>\n<p>Count me as somebody impressed. Theatergoers able to nab a ticket to sit (or even stand) will witness a bold drama that proves to be terribly current in its depiction of public mistrust, moral corruption and civic failure as environmental disaster threatens. While the story unfolds in Victorian days and is performed in 1880s clothes, the drama has been pointed to reflect our troubled social and political times all too clearly.</p>\n<p>In the same way Herzog sharply adapted <i>A Doll’s House</i> last season, she trims and Americanizes this knotty Ibsen text into a quick, cogent two hours. Herzog mostly sticks to Ibsen’s story set in a Norwegian resort town. A well-meaning physician/scientist with zero social skills, Stockmann discovers the water supply is tainted by upstream industries. Trying to warn the public, the doctor expects his bad news will compel the community to correct the problem.</p>\n<p>But the city government &#8212; whose mayor is Stockmann’s antagonistic brother &#8212; proves unwilling to bear the vast expense. Fearful of losing a lucrative tourist trade, the council rejects the doctor’s report.</p>\n<p>As the drama reaches its climax during an increasingly hostile town meeting whipped up by the press and elected officials, phrases familiar to our Covid-19 weary ears like “unproven science” and “theories as facts” are madly flung around. “Ask yourselves,” Stockmann implores the angry crowd, “Is what I am saying dangerous? Or is ignorance dangerous?” His motives impugned and his findings canceled, the ostracized doctor finally retreats from the struggle.</p>\n<p>Having read and seen the play a dozen times since encountering it in college, Ibsen’s final ironic plot twist involving the citizenry during the closing scene still somehow startles me. It&#8217;s so nasty! Younger viewers new to this drama may be shocked by such cynicism. Underlining Ibsen’s bitter theme about the craven, self-serving nature of most individuals, Herzog’s adaptation might well be retitled <i>The Enemy Is the People.</i></p>\n<p>In his original closing moments, Ibsen at least allows the disillusioned Stockmann to realize a moral victory in which he utters the quotable declaration, “The strongest man in the world is he who stands most alone.” No such assertion rings out in Herzog’s conclusion as the doctor merely expresses vague hopes for a better world in the faraway future. It is an oddly Chekhov-like fadeout to an otherwise characteristically combative Ibsen social drama.</p>\n<p>Much as in his immediately preceding <i>A Doll’s House</i> and <i>Ghosts</i>, Ibsen similarly explores in <i>An Enemy of the People</i> multiple variations on the truth: Discovering the truth. Telling the truth. Obscuring the truth. Facing the truth. Disbelieving the truth. Not to mention twisting the truth, social or otherwise, sometimes beyond reality.</p>\n<p>Oh, that Ibsen: A great playwright on the cutting edge. What can be more current in our doubtful national conversation nowadays than the debatable subject of truth?</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20545\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20545\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20545\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ghosting.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ghosting.jpeg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ghosting.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ghosting.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ghosting.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ghosting.jpeg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-20545\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Charles Busch in Ibsen&#8217;s Ghost. Photo: James Leynse</figcaption></figure>\n<p>★★☆☆☆ <strong>Ibsen’s Ghost</strong></p>\n<p>Meanwhile back in 1906, Suzannah Ibsen is frantically dealing with the skeletons falling out of her newly deceased husband’s closet in <i>Ibsen’s Ghost</i>.</p>\n<p>Playwright Charles Busch, always his own finest leading lady, subtitles his latest comedy as “an irresponsible biographical fantasy” in which he depicts Ibsen’s not-so-very merry widow during a revelatory week following the funeral.</p>\n<p>Reminiscing about their 50-year marriage, Suzannah admits that existence with the Norwegian genius could be bleak. “After I gave birth to our only child, a visit to my bedroom was as tantalizing to Ibsen as an amateur production of <i>Peer Gynt</i>,” she confesses.</p>\n<p>Suddenly confronted by numerous inconvenient truths about rivals, dalliances and illegitimate offspring, Suzannah hustles to do away with incriminating evidence; perhaps most amusingly in a letter burning episode that reeks of <i>Hedda Gabler</i>. Although the overlong <i>Ibsen’s Ghost</i> is nowhere near Busch’s top tier comedies, quintessential Ibsenites can at least have some fun in spotting various references and spoofs as they pop up in this Primary Stages production. Yes, of course a gun materializes.</p>\n<p>An elaborate parlor setting (love that Scandinavian porcelain stove) and opulent 1900s clothes deck out the production that is brightly enacted within a dark 19<sup>th</sup> century proscenium frame at 59E59 Theaters. These plush visuals lend considerable weight to a pretty staid piece of literary foolery. Had Busch composed this saga back during his naughtier Theatre in Limbo days, Ibsen’s peccadillos and Suzannah’s intrigues probably would have been bawdier and a lot funnier.</p>\n<p>Interpreting even lesser material, it is always a treat to see Busch evoke his transcendental magic as a humorous specialist in female characterizations. Glowering beneath an auburn pompadour and striking grand attitudes in widow’s weeds (later a peach-colored negligee) as the distraught, rivalrous and sometimes randy Suzannah, Busch recalls at times the late, great Uta Hagen at her hammiest.</p>\n<p>Speaking of great artists, Judy Kaye splendidly leads a sterling supporting company who manage to give the wonderfully false impression that everything they are saying and doing is hilarious.</p>\n<p>If his latest comedy is not among his best, it is apparent that as a theater scholar Busch knows Ibsen’s favored themes well enough to spin <i>Ibsen’s Ghost</i> around matters involving the truth.

As a result, the saga of little Tommy Walker, told through Townshend’s genius words and music, gains greater emotional impact than ever.</p>\n<p>Most of us have (thank God) been spared the extent of our hero’s damage from infancy to early adulthood: driven catatonic after witnessing a murder; sexually abused by one relative and tormented by another; mindlessly idolized and exploited both during and after his period as, so goes the lyric, “that deaf, dumb and blind kid.”</p>\n<p>But it’s a fable. And as with any great fable, everyone is able to locate themselves within its gaze. It’s McAnuff’s gift to us that in this production, empathy with those who have been ill-used, or those who ache to find their place in life, is inescapable.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/03/28/the-whos-tommy-the-ground-breaking-rock-opera-seen-heard-felt-in-sizzling-revival/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>It starts with the employment of technology to clarifying ends. There’s spectacle aplenty, but always suggestive rather than literal. Scenic designer David Korins keeps vertical and horizontal lines in motion to frame the action, echoing the mirror into which Tommy sightlessly gazes. Peter Nigrini’s projections establish place and mood with cinematic montages and a range of colors and chiaroscuro, supplemented by lighting designer Amanda Zieve’s artfully selective palette. Tantalizing associations are made to sources as diverse as <em>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari </em>(in the darkest moments of Tommy’s trauma and attempted recovery), and <em>Triumph of the Will </em>(when the Pinball Wizard, restored to consciousness, is elevated to near-messianic status).</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20722\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20722\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-20722\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TOMMY_1117_PJZEDIT_v002.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ali Louis Bourzgui and the ensemble of The Who's Tommy.

Photo by Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>How Gareth Owen’s sound design manages to convey every word of every lyric is a mystery to me, but he enables us to follow the action with full understanding of character motivation, an essential factor in empathy. Lorin Latarro’s choreography cooperates by eschewing extraneous watch-me stunts in favor of group expressiveness. A WWII farewell jitterbug, for instance, is infused with desperation born of the knowledge that this dance may be the boys’ last. The bullying Teddy-boys led by Cousin Kevin (Bobby Conte, sinewy and insidious) establish individual personalities, but also click together like a Swiss watch when Tommy’s pinball expertise is revealed and they become “influencers.” From start to finish, Latarro’s is first-class storytelling-through-dance.</p>\n<p>First-class, too, is the ensemble McAnuff has assembled. Conte and the other supporting players make indelible impressions, particularly Adam Jacobs (Broadway’s first <em>Aladdin</em>, now grown to complex manhood) and the laser-focused Alison Luff as the Walkers. As for Ali Louis Bourzgui, who shoulders the role of adult Tommy, I can only say that he commands the stage like… well, like the Sensation the libretto alleges he becomes.</p>\n<p>This lucidly-told incarnation, which began its life in 2023 at Chicago’s Goodman Theater, creates an intermission buzz in the house unlike most I’ve encountered in decades of theatergoing – perhaps not since the premiere of <em>Rent, </em>coincidentally also at the Nederlander. Then, as now, a driving rock-based score was performed with panache. (You can’t beat “Pinball Wizard” as a rousing act one closer.)</p>\n<p>But there’s something more, something to do with the nexus of the onstage action and the problems to which we’ll return when we exit onto 41st St. again. I believe the audience, like Tommy’s parents in song, “believe their own eyes.” We see in Townshend’s postwar English drifters (as so many did in Jonathan Larson’s Alphabet City vagabonds), flawed, recognizable human beings whose joys and sorrows hit us right where we live. This production creates <em>transcendent </em>enjoyment. Not “I get it, I love it,” but rather: It gets me. It understands me.</p>\n<p><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">The Who&#8217;s Tommy </b><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened March 28, 2024, at the Nederlander Theatre.

Photo: Mathew Murphy, Evans Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When <em>The Who’s Tommy</em> first detonated on Broadway in 1993, director Des McAnuff won the Tony, and damned if he won’t do it again this season &#8212; or at least snag a nomination. His revival direct from Chicago’s Goodman Theatre, with Tony-winning book by him and The Who’s rock’n’roll genius and committed guitar smasher Pete Townsend, is just about perfect as it relies on 30 years of technology progress to bring it up-to-thrilling-often-chilling-date.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For its look and sound, he’s got set designer David Korins, projection designer Peter Nigrini, costumer Sarafina Bush, lighting designer Amanda Zieve, and sound designer Gareth Owen operating as if they were stage conjurers stirring a sizzling cauldron. It’s true that the sleek, stark industrial result isn’t the first of its kind, but it indisputably reaches new heights.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their work is, of course, in the service of The Who’s ground-breaking 1969 rock opera, the tale of deaf, dumb and blind Tommy Walker, whose “See Me Feel Me Touch Me Heal Me” must be among the most famous eight words in any 1960s rock song and whose undiminished sense of touch turns him into a pinball wizard with influence over millions.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/03/28/the-whos-tommy-a-rock-classic-is-triumphantly-reborn/\"><em>Read Bob Verini’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having imagined the story under the influence of Indian spiritual master Meher Baba during the days when the likes of the Beatles were racing to India for guidance, Townsend put a plot together with some of the best items from his chart-climbing two-record <em>Tommy</em> set &#8212; “Pinball Wizard” “Acid Queen,” “Listening to You,” “Fiddle About,” and “I’m Free,” prominent among them.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time, the storyline, was considered by many as relatively loose, a series of dots open for connecting by McAnuff when Townsend and he collaborated on the 1993 stage adaptation. (Ken Russell’s 1975 film, with The Who’s Roger Daltrey as Tommy, took quite different liberties.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, Tommy &#8212; initially intended by Townsend to be born deaf, dumb, and blind &#8212; is robbed of those senses when his father returns from World War II after having been reported missing and presumed dead. In a dramatic moment Captain Walker shoots his mother’s new boyfriend, whereupon both adult Walkers insist to Tommy that he hasn’t heard or seen any such thing.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The young boy reacts accordingly. His parents repeatedly try to restore his sight and hearing, but no luck. His only interests are pinball machines and standing before a mirror. Only when frustrated Mrs. Walker smashes the mirror does he regain his senses and, as the pinball wizard he’s become, transforms his followers into a cult that ultimately abandons him.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s the long (the very long) and short of it, for which Townsend has now been quoted as saying, “Our new production of <em>Tommy</em> will be a reinvention aimed directly at today.” It’s not an unusual remark for anyone involved in a property’s return, and surely the composer-lyricist (a few others made minor contributions) is correct about what the above-mentioned creative team accomplishes.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He may also have a point about the younger audiences that McAnuff and he hope to attract. It could be said, for instance, that Tommy’s communication difficulties reflect today’s newer generations with their isolating cell-phone reliance &#8212; as well as it presents parents attempting to get through to their constantly distracted children.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There may be another quite different way to read <em>Tommy</em>.  It could be taken &#8212; at least in part &#8212; as a parable about the 1945 World War II end, which, one of Nigrini’s projections informs, is when, on his father’s return, Tommy loses his ability to see and hear. (The Who’s Townsend was born in 1945, Daltrey and John Entwistle in 1944, Keith Moon in 1946.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A persuasive case could be made that Tommy represents a post-war world that has been forever changed, a world that never figures out quite how to live with the aftermath of something often called “The Good War.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, there is a curious gesture deaf and blind Tommy makes when, arms usually held limply at his side, he lifts them &#8212; or they’re lifted for him &#8212; into what echoes a Heil sign. It’s difficult not to read that as somehow meaningful. The move doesn’t eventually follow through &#8212; as many of the loose plot points don’t exactly &#8212; but it’s worth considering.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As surely suggested above, it’s not only the set, lighting, sound design, and projections that factor into so ideal a <em>Tommy</em>. There’s McAnuff’s flawless direction and Lorin Latarro’s choreography, which seems to be founded on a series of aggressive movements. It’s a marvel of brilliant action when “Pinball Wizard” ends the first act on a production high note. Especially, there’s Rick Fox’s conducting a hot rock band.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ali Louis Bourzgui is a lighted stick of dynamite as Tommy, and, at the performance I saw, Cecilia Ann Popp as Tommy Age 4 and Reese Levine as Tommy Age 10 were wonders of blank silence. Alison Luff as Mrs. Walker and Adam Jacobs as Captain Walker embody parental determination. John Ambrosino fiddles around nastily as licentious Uncle Ernie. Christina Sajous makes a devilish dervish of an Acid Queen. Bobby Conte has a good time as Cousin Kevin. Indeed, the entire cast works at full-throttle energy.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s just say for a moment that McAnuff and crew on-stage and backstage have morphed into pinball wizards themselves. As such, they’re hitting record-breaking numbers on the flashing and whistling revival machine they’re playing.</span></p>\n<p><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">The Who&#8217;s Tommy </b><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened March 28, 2023, at the Nederlander Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Circus sagas so easily lend themselves to bathos: “<em>Ridi, pagliaccio</em>” and all that. Director Jessica Stone’s stage rendition of <em>Water for Elephants </em>– adapted by book writer Rick Elice from the best-selling novel (2006) and film (2011) – captures all the drama, but it’s clean-cut and concise, propulsive with passion and action. Unlike some other literary adaptations in the works or already on the boards, this production stands on its own merits as theatre. You could walk in with no prior knowledge, no expectations, and be transported.</p>\n<p>Elice gets right down to business. We do get a framing device (as per the novel), set in vaguely modern times. AWOL from his retirement home, codger Jacob Jankowski (Gregg Edelman, dry and bemused), stays too long at the fair and gets to chatting with the one-tent circus proprietor (Paul Alexander Nolan, nice in this guise).</p>\n<p>Quickly, the two fall headlong into a Depression Era flashback, the heart of the drama. The youthful embodiment of Jacob (Broadway newcomer Grant Gustin, unshowily stellar) hops a train when his home life and professional prospects abruptly implode. The composer/lyricist team – the seven-member PigPen Theatre Co. – gives Jacob a haunting song as he heads out on his own: “That patch of earth, the person you were / those people you loved / they’re gone, move on.”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/03/21/water-for-elephants-heavy-lifting-for-a-musical/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The itinerant circus crew that Jacob falls in with, led by a hulking foreman/enforcer (Wade McCollum), are less than welcoming: it’s their custom to “red-light” interlopers – toss them from the moving train. Jacob survives thanks to the intercession of circus-lifer Camel, played by Stan Brown, who’s touching and full voiced in his Broadway debut at 61. If the performers’ CVs might seem a trifle irrelevant, they’re not: This is a tight, supportive company which fills the stage with awe-inspiring feats just like Montreal’s 7 Doigts collective. (Shana Carroll, the co-founder of that company, is responsible for the circus design of <i>Water for Elephants </i>and brought along four of the acrobatic ensemble members.)</p>\n<p>Presto-chango: A full-blown circus campground springs to life as magically as a children’s pop-up book. The “spike men” pound tent posts in a synchronized circle; an acrobat plummets scarily head-first down a pole (kudos to scenic designer Takeshi Kata and to Jesse Robb, who shares choreography credit with Carroll).</p>\n<p>As an untested interloper, Jacob finds himself alternately welcomed and bullied by the ringmaster/owner, August (Paul Alexander Nolan, playing the flip side of the friendly contemporary version). Commanding the allegiance if not the admiration of his crew, August has a not-so-secret sadistic streak, as evidenced when he subjects the new kid to a gotcha initiation involving a famished lion.</p>\n<p>Surviving all odds and despite his lack of professional experience, Jacob finds himself appointed company veterinarian. He’s captivated by the entire menagerie and also, disastrously, by the ringmaster’s star equestrian spouse, Marlena (Isabelle McCalla, who projects a mesmerizing mix of gentleness and grit).</p>\n<p>The puppetry style (credited to Ray Wetmore &amp; JR Goodman of More Good Productions and Camille Labarre) tends to be more allusive than literal, but wow, does it work! In a scene involving an injured horse, for instance, we’re basically seeing only two halves, but they conjure the whole. While McCalla exquisitely croons – in a pindrop pianissimo – the haunting song “Easy” to the heavy head nestled in her lap, silk aerialist Antoine Boissereau, embodying the steed’s wispy tail, spirals skyward.</p>\n<p>Rosie, the salvaged elephant who’ll have to keep the foundering company from being sold for parts, is far more substantial, especially given handler Caroline Kane’s telegraphed facial expressions.</p>\n<p>It is a circus, after all: everyone pitches in. Myriad other actors have their shining moments: e.g., Sara Gettelfinger as the Eve-Arden-look-and-sound-alike “cooch tent” housemother, and Joe De Paul as a sour, asocial clown.</p>\n<p>The cruel and mercurial August, reigning over the entire community, occupies a force field all his own. Marlena’s steady hand can only get her so far in trying to tame his free-floating animus. Eventually Jacob, her fellow empath, will be forced to take a stand, which means that Gustin has a tricky characterological tightrope to maneuver. Playing the beta-male, he must appear unprepossessing enough to provide an appealing contrast to a brute, while conveying sufficient charisma and mastery to carry off a leading role on a Broadway stage.</p>\n<p>Gustin treads that line adroitly. He’s in excellent company.</p>\n<p><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Water for Elephants </b><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened March 21, 2024, at the Imperial Theatre.

Photo credit: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>There’s a lot to take in at the new musical based on Sara Gruen’s best-selling novel (which has already inspired a 2011 film). The show features a melodramatic storyline set amidst a Depression-era traveling circus, puppetry, and numerous circus acts including aerial work, juggling, acrobatics, knife throwing, and even a clown routine. It would be nice to report that all of these elements have blended together to create a magical musical theater experience, but <em>Water for</em> <em>Elephants</em> feels more clunky than transporting. There are many things about it to enjoy, but it falls far short of being the greatest show on earth.</p>\n<p>The story is told from the perspective of Mr. Jankowski (the ever likeable Gregg Edelman), an elderly man who enjoys a respite from his assisted living facility to visit a nearby traveling circus. There he encounters the circus owner (Paul Alexander Nolan) and one of the performers (Isabelle McCalla) and impresses them with his knowledge of the business and particularly the animals. Cue the evening-long flashback as the genial oldster regales the two with his past experiences.</p>\n<p>Yes, it’s a framing device, something that seems to be used more and more frequently these days. To be fair to book writer Rick Elice (<em>The Addams Family</em>, <em>The Cher Show</em>), the same technique was employed in the original novel. But it’s getting to the point where you’re afraid to talk to an elderly person these days for fear of getting trapped in a Broadway musical. Just walk across the street to <em>The Notebook</em>, where you’ll see another <em>alte cocker</em> relive past traumas while fending off pesky nurses. Or <em>A</em> <em>Beautiful Noise,</em> in which the present-day Neil Diamond (played by Mark Jacoby) relates the story of his life to his shrink? Or the recently departed <em>Harmony</em>, in which Chip Zien played…well, you get the idea.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/03/21/water-for-elephants-a-thrilling-throwback-to-the-heyday-of-the-big-top/\"><em>Read Sandy MacDonald’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>It might have worked if the elderly Mr. Jankowski had the courtesy to make a quick exit so we could settle in to watch the story of his hunky younger incarnation, Jacob (Grant Gustin, of the CW’s <em>The Flash</em>.) But no, he hangs out onstage throughout much of the evening, observing the action, making acerbic comments, and occasionally injecting himself into the proceedings. It makes an already overstuffed musical feel even more so.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the story is set in the 1930s, when Jacob hops on a passing train and falls in with a ragtag traveling circus grandiosely named the “Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.” Having almost graduated from veterinary school, he knows plenty about animals, so he’s able to give expert advice to Marlena (McCalla), one of the star performers, about her ailing horse. Impressed, the owner and ringmaster, August (Nolan), who’s married to Marlena, gives Jacob a job.</p>\n<p>Cue the romantic triangle, as the decent, gentle Jacob cuts quite a contrast with the hard-driving August, who thinks little of lashing out at the animals, or his wife, when things go wrong. The relationship between Jacob and Marlena develops even further with the arrival of Rosie, a previously abused pachyderm that August hopes will become the star attraction and revive the circus’ flagging fortunes. Jacob turns out to have a remarkable way with Rosie, especially when he discovers that she understands commands only when they’re delivered in Polish. (Hence the musical number “Zostań.”)</p>\n<p>It’s not much of a storyline, with barely defined characters and a central love relationship that never develops any real chemistry. To keep us distracted, the show features genuine circus performers performing many routines accompanying the dramatics. But only rarely do they have any real theatrical power, as opposed to simply being the sort of aerial stunts and acrobatics on far better display in a Cirque du Soleil show. A notable exception occurs with the number “Easy,” in which Marlena gently tends to an ailing horse represented by Antoine Boissereau, beautifully performing an aerial silk routine. It’s a gorgeous, transporting moment illustrating what the show could have been if done with more artistry.</p>\n<p>As it is, it’s reasonably entertaining, thanks to the lively production staged by Jessica Stone (<em>Kimberly Akimbo</em>), whose best moments comes with some striking stage tableaux depicting a big top stampede. But the musical feels much longer than its two hours and forty minutes, thanks to the draggy book and underwhelming score by Pigpen Theatre Co. that feels more folksy than theatrical, with few songs making much of an impact (the lyrics are particularly bothersome). As the other circus employees, Stan Brown, Joe De Paul (a real-life circus clown) and Wade McCollum struggle with their underwritten roles, with only Sara Gettelfinger creating sparks despite her character existing mainly to look on worryingly at Marlena and Jacob’s increasing closeness.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t help that although Gustin is an appealing, handsome leading man, he’s so overshadowed by Nolan in the charisma department that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. And while McCalla sings beautifully, she too is undercut by the schematic storyline.</p>\n<p>Of course, the real stars are the circus performers and the animal puppets, with Rosie teasingly suggested by shadows and various body parts until she’s fully unveiled at the end of the first act. She fittingly receives the biggest entrance applause, even if she won’t erase anyone’s memories of <em>The Lion</em> <em>King </em>or <em>Life of Pi</em> or <em>War Horse</em> (the bar for puppetry has been raised considerably). But she does have eyelashes to die for.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Water for Elephants </b>opened March 21, 2024, at the Imperial Theatre.

Photo: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A harmful and potentially fatal pathogen is discovered, and its eradication involves essentially shuttering an entire city for two to three years—destroying small businesses and crippling the local economy. Where have we heard this before?</p>\n<p>Director Sam Gold and adapter Amy Herzog (of this season&#8217;s <em>Mary Jane</em>) don&#8217;t have to work hard to make <em>An Enemy of the People</em>, just opened at Broadway’s Circle in the Square, feel fresh and immediate. Even if you don’t see the parallels to the pandemic—Dr. Thomas Stockmann (Jeremy Strong, fresh from four seasons on HBO’s <em>King Lear</em>–esque drama <em>Succession</em>), wearing eyeglasses not unlike Anthony Fauci’s, is vilified by a group of science-denying, head-in-the-sand blowhards—it’s impossible to watch a play about contaminated water without thinking of Flint, Michigan. Quietly switching the city’s water source to the Flint River in 2014 (a money-saving move) had devastating effects—everything from headaches, hair loss, and rashes to Legionnaires’ disease, lead poisoning, and even death; learning disabilities, depression, and other side effects are still being discovered, and to this day the EPA tells Flint residents to filter their water.</p>\n<p>As long as there are greedy, short-sighted people in the world, it will never be a bad time for Ibsen’s man-against-the-world drama. In this production—set, per usual, in late-19th-century Norway—the world is led by Thomas’ brother, Peter Stockmann (<em>The Sopranos</em>’ Michael Imperioli, appealing but not too appealing), a power-mad, top-hat-wearing politico whose self-importance is matched only by his cunning.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/03/18/an-enemy-of-the-people-ibsens-classic-trivialized-with-gimmickry-and-ice-cubes/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>For better or worse, the siblings are unofficial partners on the town’s star attraction and biggest moneymaker, the Baths. And when Thomas confirms a nagging suspicion—that those “wonderful, miraculous, much-praised Baths” are “utterly contaminated”—he naturally expects his brother’s support. “The source is poisoned, man! It’s poisoned! We’re going to have an epidemic on our hands!” Thomas pleads. But Peter won’t hear it: “That’s just speculation—or maybe even wishful thinking!”</p>\n<p>At first Thomas has a few people behind him: Hovstad (Caleb Eberhardt), the firebrand editor of <em>The People’s Messenger</em>, who’s eager to print Thomas’ damning scientific discovery; Billing (Matthew August Jeffers), who works at the <em>Messenger</em>; and Aslaksen (Thomas Jay Ryan, wonderfully slippery), a famously “moderate” tradesman, head of the Property Owners Association, and temperance society member (“I know a lot of people,” he humblebrags). But then Peter oh-so-helpfully explains the “major” monetary “sacrifice” that the community will be making to repair the water system. If the taxpayers are footing the bill, reasons Aslaksen, “well that changes everything.”</p>\n<p>So the only person in Thomas’ corner is his daughter, Petra (Victoria Pedretti), a teacher who after a long day at school tends to her (offstage) brother, serves supper and drinks to her father’s friends, and puts up with some pathetic attempts at flirting. Hovstad suggests she work for the <em>Messenger</em>. “You could cover women’s issues, the progress women are making in our town, in the workforce and—” suggests Billing. “What progress?” she dryly asks.</p>\n<p>Ibsen purists might be wondering, what about Thomas’ wife, Katherine? In this new version by Herzog, who also adapted last season’s <em>A Doll’s House</em>, her role has been eliminated, and most of her lines—greeting and chatting with friends such as Captain Horster (Alan Trong), for instance—have been assigned to Petra. Katherine did do a lot of finger-wagging and questioning her husband, but he never paid her any mind anyway…so no great loss.</p>\n<p>Herzog&#8217;s cracking adaptation runs just a little over two hours, with no official interval—only a 10-minute pause where you can go onstage and grab a (free) bracing shot of aquavit. All the milling around also enables Gold to smoothly transition into the Act 4–opening speech-turned-attack in which Thomas tries to speak about his discovery, Peter and Aslaksen attempt to silence him, and angry citizens eventually beat Thomas to a pulp. Perhaps “our society is built on a heap of lies” was what riled them up. Or maybe it was the bit about the “incredible stupidity of the authorities.”</p>\n<p>The night I attended, during that scene, as has now been widely reported, three separate climate-change protesters popped up within the audience, their unifying cry being “no theater on a dead planet.” Part of the show, or actual protest? (We eventually realized it was <em>not</em> part of the show.) Their mid–mob scene timing was impeccable, and thankfully, didn’t destroy the mood. Strong—a seasoned stage actor whose credits include David Ives’ <em>New Jerusalem</em>, Theresa Rebeck’s <em>Our House</em>, and, most memorably, Amy Herzog’s <em>The Great God Pan</em>, in which he played a journalist delving into dark childhood memories—didn’t break character for a moment; after all, Thomas, a scientist himself, probably would be curious about the science behind it all.</p>\n<p><strong><em>An Enemy of the People</em></strong><strong> opened March 18, 2024, at Circle in the Square and runs through June 23.

Photo: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Considering that a certain former U.S. president has made its title into a veritable catchphrase, Henrik Ibsen’s 1882 play <em>An Enemy</em> <em>of the People</em> seems more relevant than ever. Not to mention the Covid epidemic in which its theme of public safety vs. economic considerations found an eerie modern-day parallel. So why, one might ask, has director Sam Gold and adapter Amy Herzog felt such an intense need to muck with it for this Broadway revival starring two major cable television stars, Jeremy Strong of <em>Succession </em>and Michael Imperioli of <em>The</em> <em>Sopranos</em>?</p>\n<p>The answer is that Gold has never encountered a classic drama he didn’t think he couldn&#8217;t improve. If you’ve endured his disastrous Broadway productions of <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>King Lear</em>, and <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>, you know what I’m talking about. In this case, he seems to be saying, “Come for a timeless Ibsen play, stay for an interactive comedy! And hey, free drinks!”</p>\n<p>The melodramatic plot — about a doctor in a coastal Norwegian town who finds himself increasingly besieged after he attempts to warn the citizens about the toxic effects of the water in the spa on which it financially relies — has been borrowed countless times, perhaps most popularly in Peter Benchley’s <em>Jaws</em>. It has also been adapted frequently, most notably by Arthur Miller, and it’s not inappropriate to alter it for modern sensibilities. In order for its protagonist Dr. Thomas Stockmann (Strong) to be sympathetic to a modern-day audience, for instance, it’s probably best to downplay his enthusiasm for eugenics.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/03/18/an-enemy-of-the-people-ibsens-cautionary-tale-as-timely-as-ever-142-years-on/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>But this rendition relies on the sort of gimmickry that makes it seem as if the play has to be dumbed-down in order to be palatable. This is most evident beginning with a “pause” in the action midway through, in which a bar is wheeled onto the stage and we’re invited to party with the cast members and indulge in a shot of Linie (a Norwegian liqueur that tastes like mouthwash) as the song “Take On Me” blares over the loudspeakers. (The 1985 song is by A-ha, a Norwegian band. Get it?). After the merriment concludes, certain audience members are invited to remain onstage, looking highly enthusiastic as the townspeople condemn Stockmann for warning them of the health dangers threatening them. We’re also treated to several musical interludes during the scene changes, which doesn’t quite compensate for nearly a third of the play being lopped off.</p>\n<p>This adaptation by Amy Herzog (<em>Mary Jane,</em> <em>4000 Miles</em>) not surprisingly leans heavily toward jarring modern-day vernacular despite the period costumes, as when Stockman’s rich father-in-law (the wonderful David Patrick Kelly, who seems to be turning more and more into a leprechaun with every stage appearance) complains, “I thought she was messing with me at first!” She’s also taken the liberty of removing the character of Stockmann’s wife, rendering him a widower. (Presumably, the poor woman drank the water at the spa.)</p>\n<p>The production’s main strength, and commercial raison d’etre, is its two leads, with the white-hot Strong predictably excellent, if perhaps slightly bland, as Stockmann. He effectively mines the character’s dignity and self-effacement, if not the volcanic intensity that Ian McKellen conveyed so brilliantly years ago in a National Theatre production directed by Trevor Nunn that was as epic as this one is miniscule. And a subdued Imperioli is very effective as Peter Stockmann, the mayor and head of the baths, who responds to his brother’s dire warnings about the contaminated water not with gratitude but hostility, advising that if the findings become public, the town will face devastating consequences and so will Thomas.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, with the exception of the always reliable Thomas Jay Ryan who brings sly humor to his portrayal of the self-serving printer Aslaksen, the rest of the mostly miscast ensemble fail to do justice to their roles, falling short of even such minimal requirements as making their dialogue legible in one of the most intimate houses on Broadway.</p>\n<p>In this rendition of the play, when Stockmann vainly attempts to warn the citizens of the water’s danger at the town meeting they attack him by throwing bucketloads of ice cubes on him. In the next scene, it’s left to poor Jeremy Strong to painstakingly assemble the cubes into a neat pile. The actor’s cleaning up serves as a metaphor for a production so messy and ill-conceived it makes you wonder how the play has endured for nearly 150 years.</p>\n<p><strong><b>An Enemy of the People March 18, 2024, at Circle in the Square and runs through June 23.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The spring parade of Broadway musicals is at the gate, seeking to curry huzzahs and premium ticket sales, with entrants lined up like helium balloons along Central Park West on the night before Thanksgiving. The first of this seven-week sprint to the finish (i.e., the Tony Award nomination deadline on April 25) is a professionally assembled emotion-tugger called <em>The Notebook</em>, derived from the popular 1996 novel by Nicholas Sparks and further popularized by a 2004 film version.</p>\n<p>This is one of those musicals that some viewers will love vociferously while others, inevitably, espouse a decidedly contradictory view. There is enough quality entertainment on hand, especially from the performers, to provide viewers with a thoroughly watchable two-and-a-half hours. In normal Broadway seasons, when full-scale original musicals can be counted on a hand’s worth of fingers, these attributes might be enough to place <em>The Notebook</em> in the Tony winner’s circle, or at least in contention. But based on the 2023-24 musicals which have opened thus far and those which have already been seen in pre-Broadway mountings, one might predict that <em>The Notebook</em> will fall far above the worst but not in league with the best.</p>\n<p>The notebook in question is a book within a book, if you will. Allie is suffering from dementia. A kindly elderly “friend,” who anyone with story sense will immediately realize is actually husband Noah, reads a story to her; not from a tattered paperback or late-model Kindle but from a leather-bound notebook. Soon enough, we also realize that what Noah is reading is not some popular novel like Sparks’ <em>The Notebook</em> or Erich Segal’s earlier and not dissimilar <em>Love Story</em>. Rather, this notebook tells the tale of the enduring romance between Allie and Noah, with which he hopes to engage her vanished memory.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t, alas, quite work.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/03/14/the-notebook-a-musical-romance-made-for-fans-to-love/\"><em>Read Roma Torre’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>How to tell a story which spans 50 years, with the characters growing 50 years older (and/or younger) while the actual actors hardly age at all? Bookwriter Bekah Brunstetter (<em>The Cake</em>) and composer-lyricist Ingrid Michaelson (with numerous recording credits)—both making their Broadway and musical theatre debuts—have split each character into three. Directors Michael Greif and Schele Williams have seen fit to play many scenes with all of ’em standing on stage in color-coded costumes: Allie in shades of blue and white, Noah in denim with brown shirts or sweaters. The directors even have the actors hold their hands or simultaneously scratch their necks in the same manner at the same moment (as in the production photographs accompanying this review).</p>\n<p>Not so subtle, but under the circumstances necessarily so. In olden times, these roles would have been cast by actors who might—with the help of costumer and wigmaker—look more or less alike. (This goes back, at least, to Shakespeare’s mistaken-identity siblings in <em>Twelfth Night</em> and long-lost twins in <em>The</em> <em>Comedy of Errors</em>.) Nowadays, we are happy to see directors cast the best performers available for the parts. Here, though, the use of six actors in these two tripartite leading roles seems contrived, and to at least some audience members might be confusing.</p>\n<p>Nobody is likely to complain about the presence of the great Maryann Plunkett in the role of what they call Older Allie. Plunkett’s years in Richard Nelson’s Rhinebeck plays have brought the actor deserved acclaim, although she has been a most winning performer since turning up 40 years ago as star replacement in the original productions of <em>Agnes of God</em> and <em>Sunday in the Park with George</em>. (For a treat, stop in your tracks and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=jnaY4mYpHa0&amp;ab_channel=KatieLawrence\">watch the YouTube video</a> of Plunkett “Doin’ The Lambeth Walk,” and winning the 1987 Best Actress Tony, in <em>Me and My Girl</em>. End of digression.) Given the <em>Notebook</em> performances of Younger Allie (Jordan Tyson) and Middle Allie (Joy Woods), they are quite welcome as well.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20535\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20535\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20535\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trio-TheNotebook_R2-385-F.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trio-TheNotebook_R2-385-F.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trio-TheNotebook_R2-385-F.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trio-TheNotebook_R2-385-F.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trio-TheNotebook_R2-385-F.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trio-TheNotebook_R2-385-F.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-20535\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Maryann Plunkett, Joy Woods, and Jordan Tyson in The Notebook. Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The men in question range from strong (John Cardoza, of <em>Jagged Little Pill</em>, as Younger Noah) to good (Ryan Vazquez, a Hamilton replacement in <em>Hamilton</em>, as Middle Noah) to mild (Dorian Harewood, as Older Noah). Sharing top honors with Plunkett are Woods, who sings up a storm (as she did this winter as the femme fatale in <em>I Can Get It for You Wholesale</em>); and the always excellent Andréa Burns, in subsidiary roles as the head nurse and the mother of all those Allies. Also standing out and adding refreshing humor to the proceedings is Carson Stewart as Younger Noah’s friend and Older Noah’s physical therapist.</p>\n<p>Greif, whose resume includes such epochal entertainments as <em>Rent</em> and <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em>, here works with co-director Schelle Williams, whose production of <em>The Wiz</em> is loading in over at the Marquis. The choreography is by Katie Spelman. Set designers David Zinn and Brett J. Banakis provide one of those all-purpose unit sets featuring an upper bridge; if memory serves, this is not dissimilar in look to Greif’s <em>Next to Normal</em> and <em>If/Then</em>. Mixed with innovative design plus well-coordinated contributions from designers Ben Stanton (lights) and Lucy Mackinnon (projections), though, this physical production works far better than those of the earlier musicals. Paloma Young, one of today’s most inventive costume designers, provides those color-coded clothes.</p>\n<p>The musical treatment is distinctive as well. Not so much the quality of the writing; the composer’s workable music is contrasted by sometimes tortured lyrics. (The refrain of the opening number rhymes, or tries to rhyme, “time, time, time” with “mine, mine, mine.” Repeatedly.) The orchestrations for ten players by John Clancy and Carmel Dean are heavy on strings and guitar strings, accented by only one reed (no brass) and with a luxuriant harp washing over the Schoenfeld. A most happy and fitting scheme for this moody memory musical, with lovely results from music director Geoffrey Ko and his players.</p>\n<p><em>The Notebook</em> arrives having scored a success at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater, and it does seem likely to generate significant enthusiasm here and in what are sure to be numerous regional and local productions across the country and abroad. But with <em>Hell’s Kitchen</em>, <em>Suffs</em>, <em>Water for Elephants</em>, <em>The Outsiders</em>, <em>Cabaret</em>, <em>Lempicka, The Great Gatsby</em> and more lapping at the gate, or at least the ticket wicket, this three-generation Kleenex-clutching weepie might get lost in the awards season rush.</p>\n<p><strong>The Notebook opened March 14, 2023, at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><br />\nIt was only a matter of time before a stage adaptation of <i>The Notebook</i> came to fruition. Based on Nicholas Sparks’ best selling novel, the popular 2004 film starring Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling is a romantic (if rather schmaltzy) stunner. There is naturally a built-in audience for this musical, clamoring to know if it’s as good as the movie and how does it compare? And for those new to the tear-jerker story of Allie and Noah from opposite sides of the tracks, does it still resonate at all? The answer to that last question is most certainly yes, it does resonate.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I think you’d have to hail from another planet not to feel something for these appealing characters. By the resounding sniffles heard throughout the audience, it most certainly succeeded on that front. And yet, despite some lovely songs and excellent performances, the musical is missing some keynotes. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Unlike the book and film which starts in the 1940’s surrounding World War II, the musical begins in the ’60’s during the Vietnam era. Another difference: the film has two sets of romantic leads depicting Allie and Noah in their youth and old age while the musical has three sets of leads &#8211;“Younger”, “Middle” and “Older”.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Both versions span some 60 years as we first meet the young lovers at age 17 and 19. The musical’s set in a coastal Mid-Atlantic town. (The book and film place the action in the South). Allie is spending the summer with her wealthy family in their vacation home before heading off to college. Noah, way down on the social strata, works at a lumberyard. Sparks fly as they fall deeply for one another but Allie’s parents don’t approve and force the couple apart. </span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/03/14/the-notebook-just-another-love-story-with-kleenex/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The storyline jumps back and forth between the early days and the present <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>when the protagonists are elderly residents in a nursing home. Older Allie now has dementia and can’t remember anything about her life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>Older Noah, hoping to bring her mind back, reads to her from the notebook in which she had earlier written the story of their great love. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The production is directed by Michael Greif and Schele Williams. Together with choreographer Katie Spelman, they inventively arrange the characters in various configurations, reflecting through song and movement the many facets of their relationship. At it’s best, the staging has a mesmerizing effect, echoing the subtle push and pull of lapping waves on the river that the lovers find so inviting. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>directors went with color-blind casting. Each of the three couples is mixed race. That’s a bit of a quandary here only because the story takes place at a time when the region was still plagued by segregation and it requires some suspension of disbelief. But given the superlative performances from this cast, it’s ultimately not a lasting concern. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Younger Allie and Younger Noah (Jordan Tyson and John Cardoza) make a spunky pair. With charming innocence, they sing divinely; and even though their condensed courtship defies reality, their mutual chemistry is awfully convincing. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the Middle pair, Joy Woods and Ryan Vasquez are equally affecting. Their duets are touching; and Woods’ powerful second act solo &#8212; “My Days” &#8212;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>proves why she’s destined to be a major Broadway star. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Best of all, the veterans, Maryann Plunkett and Dorian Harewood, are sublime together.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Harewood’s portrayal of Older Noah as a no-nonsense gentleman who knows his days are numbered is extremely moving. His enduring love for Allie shines through with every word spoken and note sung. He’s funny too, earning well-deserved laughs each time he resists being humored. I don’t know if Plunkett’s performance as a woman in the late stages of Alzheimer’s is all that medically accurate but she invests so much humanity in the role, it doesn’t matter. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>We’re with her every step of the way. When the fog briefly clears and she plaintively sings “I Know” alongside Harewood, it’s something to cherish, one of those all-time unforgettable moments in the theater. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ingrid Michaelson’s music and lyrics express the gamut of emotions beautifully.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>Her opening song, “Time” featuring the cast singing in counterpoint effectively establishes the show’s message of hope and endurance. This is not a score to be hummed. The melodies are not exactly memorable, but each song offers a lyrically soulful extension of the characters’ yearnings and passion. Her group harmonies are especially impressive. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Less impressive is the physical production which doesn’t quite capture the sharp class and social divide that initially separates the two young lovers. Scenic designers David Zinn and Brett J. Banakis’ blandly generic balconied sets fail to illustrate any distinction in the characters’ social standing. And even more bewildering, aside from a downstage trench of water, there’s no sense of the coastal region’s natural beauty which draws the lovers together with an abiding sense of home. Only in a climactic scene featuring a drenching rainstorm do we get a taste of the elements. But it’s too little too late.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>On the page and screen <i>The Notebook </i>bursts with color. The stage paints it in dull shades of grey.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>Kudos to Ben Stanton’s creative lighting which helps to fill in the scenic gaps. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In taking on the tough job of adapting the work for the musical, Bekah Brunstetter’s book sticks to the main plot points but there are holes in the storytelling that interrupt the delicate reverie. She does inject welcome humor and adds a physical therapist character, (warmly played by Carson Stewart) who helps to advance exposition. But she also misses pivotal opportunities to play up the drama. It’s most notably lacking in the way that the action abruptly skips ten years and we suddenly find Middle Allie engaged to another man. We’re deprived of seeing Younger Allie’s anguished reaction to being forced apart from Noah. And later when they’re finally reunited, the climactic moment is inexplicably lackluster. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There is absolutely nothing I can say here that could alter the emotional impact of <i>The Notebook</i> on its devoted fans. It’s a classic boy-meets-girl tale with a heartbreaking twist. You might even say it’s the best of the genre.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And yet, on the big stage, this richly layered romance feels short-changed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>Even with all that first class talent, <i>The Notebook </i>could have done more to earn the love.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The Notebook opened March 14, 2023, at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Did he or didn’t he?</p>\n<p>If you’ve seen John Patrick Shanley’s masterwork <em>Doubt</em>—the Roundabout Theatre Co.’s current Broadway revival, the off-Broadway premiere in 2004, the Tony-winning Broadway production in 2005, the Shanley-directed movie in 2008, or any incarnation in between—you’ve asked yourself this question at the end.</p>\n<p>Did Father Flynn (here played by Liev Schreiber) make, in the words of Sister Aloysius (a resolute Amy Ryan), “advances” on 12-year-old Donald Muller?</p>\n<p>If you have the answer, I’d like to hear it. Shanley has never come out on one side or the other. (Clever, clever man.) I’ve been trying to figure it out for the past 20 years. Though my answer is usually yes.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/03/07/doubt-john-patrick-shanleys-prize-winning-play-in-a-blessed-revival/\"><em style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆ <em style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>My fellow audience members, however, seemed to have made up their minds right from the start, giving Schreiber a hearty round of entrance applause. Yes, he’s a Tony winner (<em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em>) and a multiple Emmy and Golden Globe nominee, and of course that’s what Broadway audiences do for stars. (And does anyone remember his performance as a Boston Globe editor who helped expose a massive Catholic Church sex abuse scandal in the Oscar-winning Best Picture <em>Spotlight</em>?) But it feels like those theatergoers have taken Father Flynn’s side even before he starts his sermon, which centers on faith, despair, direction, and doubt. “Doubt,” he warns us, “can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty.”</p>\n<p>That’s a lot for Sister Aloysius, a school principal in 1964, to go up against. She’s conservative to a fault, dismissing everything from art class (“Waste of time”) to children using ballpoint pens. “Ballpoints make them press down, and when they press down, they write like monkeys,” she reasons. And don’t get her started on “Frosty the Snowman,” which “espouses a pagan believe in music” and “should be banned from the airwaves.” She thinks teachers should make their students “uncomfortable”: “The heart is warm, but your wits must be cold,” she tells the young Sister James (a winning Zoe Kazan), warning her to be suspicious of incidents like nosebleeds. And she is not at all charmed by Father Flynn, who wears his nails long, takes (three!) sugars in his tea, and uses, you guessed it, a ballpoint pen.</p>\n<p>He wants to take the kids for ice cream, organize a camping trip for the boys—in other words, connect more with the local community. “We should be friendlier. The children and the parents should see us as members of their family rather than emissaries from Rome,” Father Flynn explains.</p>\n<p>Sounds like the notions of an upstart young priest, eager to make his mark in the parish. And the hopelessly old-fashioned, and presumably older, Sister Aloysius sees his ideas as not only disruptive but also destructive. In the script, Shanley describes Flynn as being in his late 30s, and the Sister as in her 50s or 60.</p>\n<p>Yet Schreiber and Ryan are more or less the same age, putting Ryan’s character at a greater disadvantage. Remember, the crowd is already in the priest’s corner. (It&#8217;s worth noting that Roundabout vet Ryan was a replacement Tyne Daly, who&#8217;d been announced and advertised as Aloysius but withdrew, owing to illness, just as previews started.) So Aloysius doesn’t even have the benefit of experience when she accuses Flynn. Even the boy’s mother, Mrs. Muller (Quincy Tyler Bernstine, making the most of a single scene), isn’t convinced of the priest’s guilt.</p>\n<p>But Aloysius believes he’s guilty. And that’s all that matters. As Father Flynn explains to the impressionable Sister James, who believes he’s innocent: “The most innocent actions can appear sinister to the poisoned mind.” This production might not be overflowing with tension, but Shanley’s text rings truer than ever. He packs more into 90 minutes than most playwrights do into 150. (This season’s revival of his <em>Danny and the Deep Blue Sea</em> and premiere of his <em>Brooklyn Laundry</em> are proof.) And while he may not provide any answers, he’s trusting enough that we’ll figure it out for ourselves.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Doubt</em> opened March 7, 2024, at the Todd Haimes Theatre, and runs through April 21.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s hear it for John Patrick Shanley’s <em>Doubt: A Parable</em>, now in revival and once again serving as a powerful theatrical debate about religious certainty and uncertainty. Shanley confronts the audience with an argument that at its conclusion uncompromisingly questions belief as absolute.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He begins the attack with the very first line of his 2004 drama, for which he received both the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award. During Mass, Father Flynn (Liev Schreiber in priest’s green and gold vestments), kicks off a sermon by asking gathered parishioners the seemingly mild query, “What do you do when you’re not sure?”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Father Flynn follows with a provocative parable of his own, the scene on David Rockwell’s smart set shifts to the office of Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Amy Ryan), the mother superior at St. Nicholas, a Catholic church and school in the Bronx. She’s interrupted by a visit from Sister James (Zoe Kazan), young and at momentary loose ends.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/03/07/doubt-the-debate-rages-on/\"><em style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆ <em style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an ensuing discussion about the progress of one or two students, Sister Aloysius establishes herself as the unchallenged authority on anything concerning the school and, most importantly, anything to do with how religion is taught and honored on the premises.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She is so assertive about her comprehensive convictions that she has no hesitation about advising Sister James, who has a special interest in history, that when teaching impressionable students, it’s not helpful to favor one academic subject over another. The comment is visibly discouraging to Sister James and instantly illustrates Sister Aloysius’ manipulations of those over whom she rules. Indeed, she quickly decides something is surely amiss on hearing from Sister James that Father Flynn has been giving special attention to (never seen) Donald Muller, St. Nicholas’ only Black student.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, when she learns that young Muller, an altar boy, has had a private rectory meeting at Father Flynn’s request and that, as Sister James reluctantly reports, the boy had alcohol on his breath when he returned to class, she presumes the worst, this despite Father Flynn’s offering an explanation which, it could be said, comes across as an entirely credible explanation from an honest man.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ensuing conflict is Shanley’s clever tactic in a play during which Sister Aloysius is simultaneously the embodiment of certainty and a completely believable figure, while Father Flynn is simultaneously the embodiment of intelligent uncertainty as well as a completely believable figure.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It does need to be said that with <em>Doubt: A Parable</em>, Shanley isn’t interested in presenting the sides of his debate equally. He’s intent on delving into Catholicism in a manner which impressed as pertinent twenty years ago and remains so today. Simply by assigning the inflexible Sister Aloysius certainty and having the consistently reasonable Father Flynn insist more than once that the Mother Superior stands for a dated approach, Shanley implies he’s unalteringly behind doubt as a significant element of religious assessment.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, it may be that Father Flynn’s goodness in opposition to Sister Aloysius’ inflexibility is a dramaturgical drawback. Shanley’s Father Flynn is a character about whom he could have allowed doubt: Is Father Flynn guilty as suspected in his feeling for Donald Muller, feelings which might extend so far as (never-mentioned) molestation? Might Shanley have written it so that Sister Aloysius – who is right in so many of her steadfast declarations – could easily seem right about the Donald Muller situation?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer is that he could have but hasn’t. As this production portrays Father Flynn, whatever he does he’s consistently likable and believable. Shanley, when interviewed, has indicated he wants audiences unsure about Father Flynn, but if so, that’s not what’s presented here. He’s so convincing that eventually Sister James, having awakened to life’s harsher realities during the action, is ultimately adamant in her belief about him. And observers are more than likely to take her word for it.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To give added balance to his work, Shanley also might have disclosed more back story about his focal characters. Why has Sister Aloysius chosen a nun’s life? Does she commit herself to work exclusively because at some time in the past, life lived otherwise was too oppressive? The most Shanley allows Father Flynn, also the school basketball coach, is a single ambiguous hint that he’s homosexual.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout though, Shanley’s plotting is inventive. Determined to confirm her distrust of Father Flynn further, Sister Aloysius organizes a meeting with Donald’s mother, Mrs. Muller (Quincy Tyler Bernstine). But trying to gain the parent as an ally, she encounters a woman worried about her son and pleased to know that in Father Flynn he has a protector getting him through to graduation and public high school advancement.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assuring the revival&#8217;s quality is director Scott Ellis, who elicits top-flight ensemble performances from the cast. Ryan wears Mother Superior’s certainty as if it were an impenetrable suit of armor. (She only recently replaced Tyne Daly.) Schreiber is the good priest throughout, delivering Father Fynn’s sermons and thorough religious maturity in an impeccable Bronx accent.

Photo by Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Days of Wine and Roses, </em>in both its original 1958 teleplay and famous 1962 movie versions, is about battling addiction. By contrast, the musicalization that has just opened at Studio 54 is about the <em>appeal of</em> addiction: the ways in which people are drawn into the orbit of controlled substances (alcohol in this case) and why they stay put thereafter. Within that not-so-small distinction lie many of the strengths of this bold reinterpretation, as well as a justification for revisiting the familiar material in the present national moment.</p>\n<p>Anyone familiar with <em>Mad Men </em>will immediately recognize the musical&#8217;s three-martini-lunch, sexist milieu of 1950’s Manhattan, featuring Joe Clay, the up-and-coming P.R. man played by Jack Lemmon in ’62 and Brian d’Arcy James today. His bosses clearly think of public relations as fostering intimate relations, and a regimen of procuring female companionship for clients sends him into paroxysms of self-disgust. As if that weren’t enough impetus for late-night benders, he was orphaned in a train crash not long ago, and librettist Craig Lucas assigns him a recent troubled stint in the Korean War (current expert opinion has it that military personnel PTSD is highly correlated with addiction).</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that Joe should be drawn to the deepest thinker in the steno pool, fetching Kirsten Arnesen (Lee Remick on film; Kelli O’Hara now). She’s a voracious poetry reader and knowledge seeker who’s never so much as tasted a beer. When Joe introduces her to chocolatey Brandy Alexanders, it’s unclear whether it’s just “the thing to do” or because he secretly craves a romantic drinking buddy. Unfortunately, her strict Norwegian upbringing has masked a need to act out and seek fun-fun-fun, or “the human desire to penetrate the unknown” as she calls it. Brandy Alexander gives way to Johnnie Walker, and soon the codependent Clays are caught up in a deadly spiral that will leave Joe demoted and then fired, and Kirsten rootless and resentful.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/01/28/days-of-wine-and-roses-musical-on-alcoholic-sorrows-shakes-and-stirs/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The movie details Joe’s efforts to get clean, a process radically reduced here. We don’t see the D.T.’s that put him in a straitjacket, nor do we accompany him to any A.A. meetings. Indeed, the phrase “A.A.” is never mentioned, though we can sense his working out the 12 Steps with the aid of sponsor Jim (David Jennings in a strong performance, despite being given some of JP Miller’s creakiest platitudes to speak). Joe’s gaining sobriety seems rather abrupt here, and he becomes considerably less compelling (as he did in the movie) once the focus turns to Kirsten’s adamant resistance to taking restorative action.</p>\n<p>These changes suggest that Lucas and composer-lyricist Adam Guettel want, more than anything else, to explore why the Joes and Kirstens of the world get hooked and stay hooked in the first place.</p>\n<p>Guettel is unsurpassed in granting musical expression to extravagant emotion, as we know from “Floyd Collins” and “The Light in the Piazza.” Here the rhythms of ’50s jazz duke it out with exquisitely climbing, soaring notes to convey the chaotic, bipolar play of ideas and images when one becomes infused with booze. And in O’Hara and d’Arcy James – who among the cast are assigned virtually all the singing – he has two of our finest musical theater talents at the peak of their powers, pulling out all the stops.</p>\n<p>In “Evanesce,” the newlyweds croon, scat, belt, and dance a celebratory soft-shoe, even as their lyrics – “I’m leaning out the window / I’m running with a knife / I’m riding on an arrow / I’m running for my life” – allude to the danger they’re courting. Later, a lonely, bibulous Kirsten engages in a duet with her Hoover vacuum leaving the living room worse off as she answers the musical question “Are You Blue”: “Hell no! Not me! / I’m a bright and shiny top / And I live on booze and bebop.” But soon enough, she is describing to Lila a place called “Underdeath…. My girl, your mommy goes there every day.” When a newly-sober Joe urges her to join him, she hits him with both barrels: “You convert / You devil, you betray me / You told me we were in this forever / You con man!”</p>\n<p>This is tough stuff, though the stars make it seem as easy as breathing – or, I guess, as easy as downing multiple shots in a heartbeat. Guettel has never been one to send audiences out humming his melodies, and here he is most interested in sending his stars up and down the scale. Still, when he wants to write a show song rather than an art song he’s more than capable. “First Breath,” in which a temporarily on-the-wagon Kirsten seeks succor from her stern papa (Byron Jennings, excellent), could easily become a cabaret standard.</p>\n<p>Director Michael Greif gets assured performances from principals and ensemble alike, and the design team maintains a sense of time, place and cinematic fluidity, particularly through Lizzie Clachan’s sleek signage and platforms, and Ben Stanton’s expressionistic lighting effects piercing the dark like the knives Joe and Kirsten are all too eager to wield on each other. Choreographers Sergio Trujillo (<em>Ain’t Too Proud</em>) and Karla Puno Garcia don&#8217;t have a lot to do, but good for them if they contributed to the production&#8217;s elegant ease.</p>\n<p>Understanding the roots of dependency starts by acknowledging that people do drugs – drink booze, take opiates, smoke, shoot up – because it feels better doing them than not doing them. So it is for Joe and Kirsten Clay, and by not shying away from the good vibrations that controlled substances promise, this new <em>Days of Wine and Roses</em> is a small step in the right direction toward making a difference in America’s current addiction crisis. Which is not to say that very many opioid addicts are likely to find their way to a Lucas/Guettel musical; but those who make public policy, or who simply look down their noses at “those people in the red states,” very well may. Developing sympathy for, and taking steps to help, the growing numbers of those struggling with and dying of addiction begins by recognizing that some of “those people” are no further away than the house or apartment next door.</p>\n<p><strong>Days of Wine and Roses opened January 28, 2024, at Studio 54 and runs through April 28.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe Clay (Brian d’Arcy James), a 1950s-60s corporate pr guy whose duties include what looks like pimping, and Kirsten Arnesen (Kelli O’Hara), an executive secretary, meet not quite cute at a company party. Drink in hand, he works his way around her even though she claims she doesn’t like the taste of alcohol. She does admit to a yen for chocolate, which cues him to order a Brandy Alexander. She sips the cocktail. She deems it “good.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s all it takes for them to develop a long-term romance. They marry, become parents and set off on a descent into alcoholism that threatens not only their lives but their daughter’s and Pop Arnesen’s greenhouse business, which is almost destroyed during a disastrous bender Joe goes on.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The all but unrelentingly somber tale &#8212; right down to a hardly hopeful fadeout &#8212; started as a 1958 JP Miller Playhouse 90 teleplay starring Cliff Robertson and Piper Laurie. It became a 1962 film starring Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick. Now it’s an Adam Guettel-Craig Lucas musical seen earlier this season at the Atlantic in an intimate, somewhat chamber musical version. (Lizzie Clachan is the set designer.) It’s moved to Broadway’s not quite so intimate Studio 54, which in its previous incarnation saw plenty of liquor consumed.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/01/28/days-of-wine-and-roses-demon-rum-is-a-suave-seducer/\"><em>Read Bob Verini’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result is a tough-minded, heart-pounding work that bookwriter Lucas extracted skillfully from Miller’s original script (some of the major scenes appear close to unedited) and to which Guettel inserted a score intricately fusing classical touches with jazz. First gratitude for this <em>Days of Wine and Roses</em> reshuffle goes, however, to leading lady O’Hara, who worked with d’Arcy James 22 years back in the short-run <em>Sweet Smell of Success</em>. When that one closed, she decided she’d like them working together again one day, and saw <em>Days of Wine and Roses</em> as an ideal opportunity.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She got that right. Joe and Kirsten are spectacularly demanding roles. Robertson, Laurie, Lemmon, and Remick registered possibly their best performances in the previous iterations. O’Hara and d’Arcy James, expertly directed by Michael Greif, reach those levels memorably.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk about running the acting gamut A-to-Z-and-back! Watch and listen to O’Hara in early sequences, intelligent, charming. Watch her in Dede Ayite’s astute costumes become increasingly dependent and careless as Kirsten decides she enjoys matching Joe shot for shot. Watch her when Kirsten retreats to a motel room where she wants only to guzzle and entreats Joe, sober thanks to Alcoholics Anonymous support, to join her. Watch her futile last attempt to return home, still hopelessly dependent on the sauce, still insisting she can’t face life without it.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch d’Arcy James as goodtime press guy Clay (is his surname a symbol of his malleability?) celebrating every quaff. That’s until he realizes how far down the slurping slippery slope he’s taken Kirsten and him as well as daughter Lila (the wise, endearing Tabitha Lawing) and Pop Arnesen (Byron Jennings, grizzled, stymied). His major transcendent moments are those plundering his father-in-law’s greenhouse in desperate search for a bottle he’s hidden there.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great plus supplied this <em>Days of Wine and Roses</em> is the singing. O’Hara with her operatic soprano (at the Met this season in <em>The Hours</em>) lends ear-dazzling gleam to everything she’d handed, such as “Are You Blue.” Surely, she suspected what chances she’d be granted after earning boffo reviews in the 2006 Guettel-Lucas <em>Light in the Piazza</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D&#8217;Arcy James owns his strong baritone and uses it to advantage in his recitative-y “Magic Time” opener and later in the scorching “Forgiveness,” another showstopper. Both d’Arcy James and O’Hara deliver Guettel’s best item, “As the Water Loves the Stone” with intensity. That’s not too long after their ebullient “Evanesce,” which choreographers Sergio Trujillo and Karla Puno Garcia nicely enhance.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guettel’s notable contribution warrants further discussion. It once was the belief that Broadway scores were there to ignite sheet music and record sales, nail radio play, gain entry into the Great American Songbook. Those days have pretty much passed. (When was the last time a Broadway tune hit the Top 40? Is there still a Top 40?) Guettel is one of the newer standard bearers, out strictly to tailor the score to fit the material without one ear fixed on step-outs. This score is, in the best sense, unique.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guettel has said his response to the grim subject matter stems from problems he’s faced. The evidence here seems to reflect as much. Compare this one to his very different <em>Light in the Piazza</em> numbers. Those are easily more melodic, pointedly resonant of the Italian locales. Here he regularly, if not completely, hews to quick outbursts, taut arias, the blunt expressions of two distressed alkies. There are no group numbers, despite an intermittently appearing six-member supporting cast, including David Jennings as Joe’s sincere AA sponsor.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One strength of the 90-minute intermissionless piece is its refusal to offer any easy explanation of addiction’s origins, on the assumption that explanations don’t carry much meaning when the alcoholic’s throes are what need to be immediately addressed. When Kirsten and Joe first spend time together at a waterfront, she tells him that she prefers to watch the water farther out. The water immediately below her, she insists, is too dirty. That’s all the rationale needed to set the parameters for this bold, unflinching musical gaze at drinking to cruel excess.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Days of Wine and Roses opened January 28, 2024, at Studio 54 and runs through April 28.

Photo credit: Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It was probably wishful thinking to have hoped that <em>Prayer for the French Republic</em> would have felt less relevant since its premiere nearly two years ago. Joshua Harmon’s ambitious play takes place in dual time frames, 1944-1946 and 2016-2017, and deals with such subjects as anti-Semitism, the election of Donald Trump, and failed election (thankfully) of Marie Le Pen in France. Now we are facing a dramatic rise in anti-Semitism worldwide, the ascendency of the far right in France and other European countries, and the very possible re-election of Trump to the presidency. So don’t head to the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre looking for a pick-me-up.</p>\n<p>What you’ll get instead is a superb drama that only seems to have gained in power and intensity with this Broadway transfer featuring many cast members from the original Manhattan Theatre Club off-Broadway production.</p>\n<p>The play revolves around the French Salomon family, one of whose members, Patrick (Anthony Edwards, <em>ER</em>), also serves as a wry narrator. He introduces us to his extended clan, including his psychotherapist sister Marcelle (Betsy Aidem), her husband Charles (Nael Nacer), and their twentysomething children Elodie (Francis Benhamou) and Daniel (Aria Shahghasemi). The family has lived in the country for generations, the owners of once nearly two dozen piano stores that have been reduced to only one in Paris, manned by Pierre (Richard Masur), Marcelle and Patrick’s elderly father.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/01/09/prayer-for-the-french-republic-judaism-takes-centerstage-in-joshua-harmons-engrossing-drama/\"><em>Read Roma Torre’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The Salomons, who are hosting a visit from Molly (Molly Ransom), a naïve, young American cousin, have become frighteningly aware of the rising anti-Semitism in their country. In the opening scene, Daniel, who has become increasingly religious, has just been brutally beaten by hooligans who know he’s Jewish because of the yarmulke he’s taken to constantly wearing. His terrified parents react differently, with Marcelle insisting on calling the police and Charles becoming so terrified that he insists that the family pick up roots and move to Israel.</p>\n<p>Their anxieties are mirrored by the plight of Marcelle’s grandparents Irma (Nancy Robinette) and Adolphe (Daniel Oreskes), seen living in the same Parisian apartment decades earlier after having somehow been spared by the Nazis. Their son Lucien (Ari Brand) and grandson Pierre (Ethan Haberfield) were not so lucky and were sent to a concentration camp (Pierre is the younger version of the character we see later). Miraculously, they manage to survive and return to the apartment to live, although not without suffering great loss.</p>\n<p>Harmon, author of the much more comic <em>Bad Jews</em>, juggles these time-shifting narrative balls with skill, aided greatly by David Cromer’s expertly fluid staging that makes frequent use of the revolving turntable employed in Takeshi Kata’s realistic set. Even more impressive, however, is the playwright’s ability to blend deeply moving domestic drama with incisive debates about social and political issues. There is much speechifying in this three-hour play, perhaps too much for some viewers, with the most glaring example being a scene late in the evening in which the characters attempt to understand the reason for the anti-Semitism that goes back centuries. But <em>Prayer for the French Republic</em> earns its didacticism thanks to its well-drawn characterizations, beautifully written dialogue, and powerful situations, not to mention generous doses of welcome humor. It’s the rare sort of play that gives you a lump in your throat one minute and provides a belly laugh the next.</p>\n<p>The many intellectual debates are often as character-revealing as they are polemical, as when Elodie explains her strongly held positions about Israel and America to Molly in what becomes a ranting monologue as the verbally outclassed visitor can barely get a word in edgewise. Patrick’s emotional distance from his sister becomes vividly illustrated by his vehement disdain for her embrace of Jewish rituals, including the Passover Seder, that he repeatedly refers to as “bullshit.”</p>\n<p>There are refreshingly lighter moments as well, including the sweetly amusing mutual flirtation between Daniel and Molly, whose youthful innocence is conveyed by her constant rhapsodizing about the deliciousness of Parisian croissants. The scene in which she swoons as he shirtlessly serenades her with a Bob Dylan song while unimpressively playing guitar wouldn’t be out of place in a CW series yet works perfectly here.</p>\n<p>The performances by the ensemble, both veterans and newcomers, are exemplary, with Aidem perhaps the standout as the mother desperately trying to hold everything together in the face of eternal forces. Only Edwards seems a bit out of place, and not only because of his celebrity relative to the rest of the cast. But his performance may sharpen as the run goes on.</p>\n<p>Arriving shortly on the heels of the similarly bracing <em>Appropriate</em>, <em>Prayer for the French Republic</em> proves that straight plays can still pack a wallop on Broadway even without big stars to entice the tourists. Of course, it’s no coincidence that both dramas are being presented by non-profit theaters.</p>\n<p><strong>Prayer for the French Republic opened January 9, 2024, at Samuel J.

Photo: Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><br />\nAs the world remains horrified by the terrorist attacks in Israel and the subsequent devastation of Gaza amid the suffering of Palestinians there, Joshua Harmon’s immensely compelling <i>Prayer For the French Republic </i>arrives on Broadway, placing a sharp focus on what it is to be Jewish, past and present. And while the play predates current events, it delves into the many complex facets of Judaism &#8211; from the tragic history of religious persecutions to the political divisions pro and con that dominate headlines today. But to be clear, this is not a didactic exercise. Harmon, with the assist of a stellar production, manages to provoke thought in the most dramatically engaging way. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The story concerns five generations of the Parisian Salomon family whom we first meet in 2016 and later through flashbacks in 1944-46. It begins with the arrival of Molly, a 20 year old American student who’s studying abroad to improve her French. (They speak English but we’re meant to believe they’re conversing in French.) She’s meeting her distant cousin Marcelle for the first time. The family connection goes back to their great grandparents who survived the holocaust but were separated during the war. Some Salomons stayed in France while others came to America. The American contingent strayed from their Jewish roots while the French Salomons had very mixed attitudes about their faith.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2024/01/09/prayer-for-the-french-republic-give-thanks-for-this-powerful-drama/\"><em style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★★ <em style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marcelle and her brother Patrick were raised without much religion but when Marcelle married Charles Benhamou, a Sephardic Jew, she and their family became more observant. Marcelle’s 26 year old son, Daniel embraced his Jewishness while his older sister, Elodie, struggling with manic depression, is mostly argumentative. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Harmon’s depiction of the family dynamic resonates brilliantly. Their interactions, both loving and combative, have a stunning ring of truth. </span><span class=\"s1\">We first see it when Daniel enters, bloodied and bruised from an anti-semitic hate crime.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Marcelle’s over-reaction is what you’d expect from a shocked mother. She insists that Daniel conceal his yarmulke when he goes out in public. Daniel and his father’s reactions are more measured and they start to think the political climate in Paris (following the <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> incident) is not safe for Jews and maybe it’s time for a move to Israel. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On Takeshi Kata’s neatly designed turntable set, the action soon shifts to 1944 where we see an elderly couple sitting at a kitchen table. They are Marcelle’s great grandparents, Irma and Adolphe Salomon, who’ve managed to avoid capture in Nazi-occupied France while keeping the family piano business running. They are fretting over the fate of their children and grandchildren who were separated during the war. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The contemporary scenes of the Salomon/Benhamou clan are dominated by discussions, often heated, about the current state of affairs in the Jewish community. It culminates in a lengthy Act II monologue featuring Elodie’s motor-mouth rant on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and public perceptions about Judaism. It’s a tour de force for the actress, Frances Benhamou, whose last name is coincidentally the same as her character. It only seems to confirm that she was born to this role. Her prickly takes and snobbish condescension toward what she regards as uninformed Americans like Molly are delivered to perfection.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">   </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In between family scenes, Marcelle’s brother Patrick serves as narrator in the play, expounding on Jewish history while filling in narrative holes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>He is close to his sister but highly cynical about her adherence to Jewish traditions. He has little interest in religion and it creates a rift between them. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Back to Irma and Adolphe, it’s 1945 now. The war has ended and their son Lucien and teenage grandson Pierre (touchingly portrayed by Ari Brand and Ethan Haberfield) have returned from a concentration camp, shell-shocked. Other family members who were with them, perished. It’s a fraught reunion as they struggle to regain some semblance of normalcy from their pre-war lives. Later we find out that Pierre ends up taking over the family’s piano business and marries a Catholic woman. A clear indication that he felt his Jewishness was not worth preserving in his children, Marcelle and Patrick. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The production is directed with great heart and welcome humor by David Cromer. It makes for powerful theater that’s as entertaining as it is enlightening. And it’s all terrifically enhanced by a sublime ensemble performing with absolute authenticity. The four women in the cast retained their roles from the Off-Broadway production, and for good reason. In addition to Frances Benhamou, Molly Ranson as Molly, declaring herself to be Jewish by extraction, comes off stereotypically naive at first but later holds her own when sparring with cousin Elodie. Nancy Robinette is the embodiment of maternal goodness as Irma. Her final scene is a touching prayer from the grave. And Betsy Aidem, at the play&#8217;s focal point as Marcelle, is just wonderful, running the gamut of motherhood &#8211; protective, overbearing, loving and vulnerable. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The male performers are equally impressive. Anthony Edwards has the difficult role as both omniscient narrator and the pragmatic Patrick, and he nails both. Nael Nacer plays Charles with quiet strength and dignity; the veterans, Daniel Oreskes as Adolphe and Richard Masur as elderly Pierre are simply outstanding in their understated simplicity. And the young Aria Shahghasemi exudes strong presence as the “susceptible” Daniel. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While there is much to applaud, the play is not without flaws. Molly’s romantic relationship with “cousin” Daniel feels somewhat forced. The three hour running time with two intermissions could be trimmed and it stretches credulity that Molly could be so fluently conversant in French after spending such a relatively short time in the country.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">   </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Criticisms aside, <i>Prayer For The French Republic</i> is a must see for anyone who’s interested in deepening their understanding of the Jewish experience through the ages. At play’s end, Elodie asks her 86 year old grandfather Pierre “Why do they hate us?” And not surprisingly, she supplies her own answers, firing off a litany of reasons so often cited throughout history. Pierre has no real answer for her but when it comes down to choosing between faith, country or family, he offers the wisdom of an old Jewish man who survived against all odds.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If there’s an overriding theme in the play it would be this: The Jews who survive know when to leave. Charles quotes a mantra that his family, fleeing persecution in Algeria, often recites: “It’s the suitcase or the coffin.” Sadly, as the Benhamous contemplate a more secure life in Israel, recent events prove there is no safe harbor for Jews (or anyone) fearing violence from religious persecution. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Prayer for the French Republic opened January 9, 2024, at Samuel J.

Photo credit: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>There have been dysfunctional family dramas as long as there have been plays. (After all, what would you call <em>Medea</em>?) But playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins definitely ups the ante in <em>Appropriate</em>, his searing 2013 play only now receiving its belated Broadway premiere in a galvanizing staging by Lila Neugebauer. Featuring a stellar cast headed by Sarah Paulson, Corey Stoll, and, making her stage debut, Elle Fanning, this Second Stage Theater production about a family with enough skeletons in its closet to fill a dozen catacombs makes an already powerful play even more powerful. It’s the standout of the Broadway season thus far.</p>\n<p>The play, set in the summer of 2011, concerns the extended members of the Lafayette clan, who have returned to the now-decrepit, former plantation home of their patriarch who has recently died. During their planning of an impending estate sale, they come across a truly disturbing artifact — a book of old photographs showing the dead bodies of lynched African-Americans. The ensuing repercussions threaten to tear the family dynamics apart.</p>\n<p>Not that they were strong to begin with. Eldest daughter Toni (Paulson), who cared for their father in his last days, is full of anger toward everyone except her teenage son Rhys (Graham Campbell), for whom she displays an almost disturbing affection. Her brother Bo, short for &#8220;Beauregard&#8221; (Corey Stoll), who arrives from New York with his wife Rachel (Natalie Gold, <em>Succession</em>) and their children Cassidy (Alyssa Emily Marvin) and Ainsley (Lincoln Cohen and Everett Sobers, alternating), is most interested in monetizing the huge amount of detritus left in the home. Both are surprised by the appearance of their long-estranged younger brother Frank (Michael Esper), who now calls himself Franz, and his much younger, bohemian girlfriend River (Fanning).</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/12/18/appropriate-southern-discomfort-and-sibling-rivalry-at-its-juiciest/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Tensions arise in the play’s opening minutes and barely let up for a second, with decades worth of resentments and recriminations flaring up with white-hot intensity, audibly mirrored by the deafening sounds of cicadas buzzing from outside the house’s peeling walls. Jacobs-Jenkins has clearly immersed himself in the family dramas of O’Neill, Williams, Hellman, Letts and virtually every other playwright who’s trafficked in the genre, making <em>Appropriate</em> feel at times like either a parody or pastiche. But he also brings much originality to the mix, including the disturbing racial themes that make this work by a Black playwright featuring exclusively Caucasian characters feel particularly daring.</p>\n<p>Incest, pedophilia, masturbation, racism, anti-Semitism, and virtually every other scandalous activity you can think of are all part of the play’s equation, and yet it somehow never feels exaggerated. This is due to the playwright’s ability to create both memorable, three-dimensional characters and the sort of smart, crackling dialogue that brings them fully to life. There’s also tremendous theatricality at work here, including a stage image late in the play that is horrifying in its hilarity and hilarious in its horror, and a coda in which the spiritual decay of the family is allegorically illustrated in vivid scenic terms.</p>\n<p>I saw the play in its original New York production and was impressed by it. But I don’t remember that version having the sheer visceral impact of this one, which benefits tremendously from the superb production elements courtesy of Dede Ayite (costumes), Jane Cox (lighting), Bray Poor and Will Pickens (sound, including those chilling cicadas) and the scenic design collective known as dots, the latter of whom have devised an ultra-realistic set that seems to be growing mold before your eyes. Director Neugebauer has elicited brilliant performances from Paulson, Stoll and Gold, who turn angry tirades into comic arias; Esper, who at one point brilliantly delivers a monologue that is heartbreaking in its pathos, and Fanning, scoring sly comic points as the hippy-dippy River (even if she is a bit vocally underpowered, as often happens with screen actors making their stage debuts). The younger performers are pitch-perfect as well.</p>\n<p>The evening begins with a projection detailing the various definitions of the word that gives the play its title. Whether you take it to be a verb, or a noun, or both, probably says as much about you as it does the play.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Appropriate</em> opened Dec. 18, 2023, at the Hayes Theater; transferred to the Belasco on March 25, 2024; and runs through June 30.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Is the title ap-PRO-pri-ate—as in, suitable, proper, correct, acceptable? Or ap-pro-pri-ATE, as in, to steal, seize, take without authorization?</p>\n<p>Playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins isn’t about to tell you. As you take your seat at the Hayes Theater, the multiple definitions of <em>Appropriate</em> are projected onto a scrim, ensuring that the title (and concept behind the title) stays top of mind throughout the high-octane two-hour, 45-minute drama, a knock-down, drag-out bout in which three siblings—Toni (Sarah Paulson, deliciously vicious), Bo (Corey Stoll), and Frank (Michael Esper)—snipe, claw, and sometimes literally punch each other into submission.</p>\n<p>Also seated ringside for the prizefight: Toni’s son, Rhys (Graham Campbell), recently kicked out of high school for dealing drugs; Bo’s wife, Rachael (<em>Succession</em>’s Natalie Gold), or “Bo’s Jew wife,” as her just-deceased father-in-law called her; their kids, Cassidy (Alyssa Emily Marvin), who, she repeatedly insists, is “almost an adult,” and Ainsley (Lincoln Cohen or Everett Sobers, alternating), who’s absolutely not an adult; and Frank’s fiancée River (Elle Fanning, best known for Hulu’s costume drama <em>The Great&#8230;</em>, in a smashing stage debut), a bead-and-macramé-wearing hippie who attempts to bring the family together by cooking quinoaffles for breakfast.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/12/18/appropriate-check-your-expectations-at-the-door-for-this-brilliantly-subversive-family-drama/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, tension is high and tempers are flaring in the wake of the death of patriarch Ray; Toni, Bo &amp; Co. have gathered to clear out the family home, which looks like something out of <em>Hoarders: The Plantation Edition</em>. (The magnificent Southern Gothic–style mansion, impressively grand yet showing subtle signs of fading and fracture, is designed by Santiago Orjuela-Laverde, Andrew Moerdyk, and Kimie Nishikawa, aka dots.) We quickly learn everyone’s place in the pecking order: Toni, the eldest, is the bully; she helped raise her brothers after their mother died. Bo, the middle child, is the fixer, perhaps because he’s a married father of two. Arriving uninvited and unannounced, Frank, the youngest, is the screw-up, who spent years of his life, and loads of the family money, drinking and getting high.</p>\n<p>So what is the appropriate response when 8-year-old Ainsley innocently stumbles on a tattered album full of photographs of lynchings—or, as Cassidy calls them, “antique dead people photos”? (“I don’t want to be, like…an asshole,” Cassidy confesses to River, admitting that she’s not as upset as she knows she ought to be.) Is it Appropriate to call your sister-in-law a cunt—three times, to her face? Is it Appropriate if said sister-in-law called you a kike? And is it Appropriate to try to sell the aforementioned lynching photos if it means making hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of dollars?</p>\n<p>If Jacobs-Jenkins has the answers (and one suspects he does), he’s not sharing them. He’s savvy—and gutsy—enough to let his audience decide. In a way, <em>Appropriate</em> is his most traditional play, a deliberate homage to such playwrights as Tennessee Williams, Eugene O’Neill, and Tracy Letts, who create the best, most completely unhinged characters. Since the play’s 2014 off-Broadway premiere at Signature Theatre, we’ve seen, among other works, his daring deconstructive Dion Boucicault riff <em>An Octoroon</em>, the modern-day morality play <em>Everybody</em>, and the post-pandemic millennial <em>Big Chill</em>–esque <em>The Comeuppance</em>. Yet it took an epic dysfunctional-family drama in order for Jacobs-Jenkins to finally find his way to Broadway. Seems appropriate, no?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Appropriate</em> opened Dec. 18, 2023, at the Hayes Theater; transferred to the Belasco on March 25, 2024; and runs through June 30.

Photo: Curtis Brown</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For every high-school grad who recalls senior prom as a triumphal rite of passage, there are probably several dozen who survive slightly traumatized. So why subject a group of socially challenged, neurodivergent teens to the ordeal? In <em>How to Dance in Ohio </em>– both the new musical and Alexandra Shiva’s 2015 documentary, which inspired it – the instigating therapist, Dr. Amigo (onstage, an earnest Caesar Samoya), offers a rationale: he sees it as “a classic rite … an opportunity to push ourselves beyond our ordinary routines.” Later, he describes it to an inquiring blogger as “a trial run for real life.” Really?</p>\n<p>The dance is rechristened, rather proprietarily, the “Amigo Spring Formal,” as if the downgrade in rubric might lessen the pressure. Either way, onscreen and onstage, the tenor of the whole endeavor suggests that Dr. Amigo may have some unresolved issues of his own – that, in fact, the dance is not so much a learning experience as an exercise in ego gratification. Where the film skirts the issue, adaptor/lyricist Rebekah Greer Melocik ultimately accords Amigo a satisfying comeuppance.</p>\n<p>So if you spend the entire first act fulminating that the requisite trimmings – invitations (brokered and prodded by Amigo), formalwear, crowning of the “king and queen” – amount to young-adult-cruelty, fret not. Or rather, go right ahead, because late in the game Melocik will drop the documentary’s warm and fuzzy aura for some catch-up accountability.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/12/10/how-to-dance-in-ohio-talented-cast-overcomes-earnest-but-ordinary-material/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the young performers who make up the seven-member core – all of whom self-identify as autistic – do their best to make <em>us,</em> the audience, comfortable. In a prefatory group speech, one performer notes the availability of “cool-down spaces.” All but the most easily triggered playgoer will want to hang in, though, to hear the melodies – buoyant to poignant – that composer Jacob Yandura has set to the text, portions of which have been lifted verbatim from the film.</p>\n<p>Gradually, we get to know the young individuals (their likes, dislikes, preoccupations) – but only to the extent that each character allows. The most tightly wound participant is therapy newbie Marideth (Madison Kopec), who prefers to do her relating with a book or screen. “I don’t like that question” is her response to one innocent attempt at conversation. The character’s gradual unfolding is a marvel to observe. Kopec delivers two hymns prompted by Marideth’s obsessions – “Unlikely Animals” (Australian wildlife) and “Drift” (as in Continental) – with extraordinary poignancy.</p>\n<p>As non-binary Mel, a budding herpetologist who serves as de facto guru for the bunch, Imani Russell conveys a laid-back, ageless wisdom. They help Jessica (Ashley Wool) sort out issues with her best friend, Caroline (Amelia Fei). If Wool and Fei play rather young for their characters’ chronological age, there’s good reason: the girls have been cosseted by their understandably protective moms (Haven Burton and Darlesia Cearcy). The quartet’s de rigueur gown-shopping expedition – during which the moms go a bit gaga, finally getting some vicarious kicks – come across equal parts amusing and sad.</p>\n<p>Two of the teen characters are comparatively underdeveloped: Tommy (Conor Tague), who has designs on his younger brother’s tricked-out truck, and Remy (Desmond Luis Edwards), a gender-undeclared devotee of cosplay. Also on hand (and a bit superfluous) is Amigo’s daughter, Ashley (Cristina Sastre), who’s home recovering from a dance injury and debating whether to drop out of Juilliard. The role seems to have been inserted in the script in order to suggest that “high-performing” offspring also have the right to choose their own path.</p>\n<p>Whether deeply or peripherally entwined, all seven aspiring prom-goers warrant the stage time they’re accorded. Still, one mystery remains. Fear of public speaking – of which stage fright is a heightened variant – is said to be the most common phobia among humans (surpassing death, spiders, and heights). At the very onset of the show, the characters confess to being flummoxed by the challenge of small talk. How is it, then, that the self-professedly autistic actors showcased here manage to take so brilliantly to the stage?</p>\n<p>With courage and dedication, clearly. It&#8217;s an all but unfathomable leap, and they do not hold back. The eleven-o’clock number goes to Liam Pearce as Drew, a mechanically minded savant. Spilling over with confidence and elan, Pearce seems born to the spotlight. His summation song, “Building Momentum,” brings down the house. He connects all right, big-time.</p>\n<p><strong><b>How to Dance in Ohio </b>opened December 10, 2023, at the Belasco Theatre.

Photo: Curtis Brown</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>How to Dance in Ohio</em>, at the Belasco, has several good things going for it. Seven, as a matter of fact. The show begins with a personable septet, of assorted shapes and sizes, stepping downstage in a line. “There’s this saying,” a smiling fellow tells us. “If you’ve met one autistic person, you’ve met one autistic person. You are now meeting seven autistic people.”</p>\n<p>Yes, <em>How to Dance in Ohio</em>—a musical about seven members of a “social skills therapy group for autistic young adults”—is cast authentically; which is to say, as a <em>Playbill</em> insert tells us, that if an actor is “playing an autistic character, they identify as autistic as well.” Right from the start, when they run onstage before the house lights are even out, we discover this is a likably disarming bunch.</p>\n<p>But good intentions alone, alas, do not a compelling musical make. The intentions are good, the core performances are good (and in some cases better than that), and the audience is likely to sit there rooting for the success of the characters in their quest to attend a prom-like dance in Ohio. On the other side of the ledger, though, is a score that is little more than functional (with exceptions as hereinafter noted), and a book that devolves into flimsy musical comedy style. The central performers earn our admiration, and the benefit of any doubts we might have; but <em>How to Dance in Ohio</em> offers only moderate entertainment, and moderate entertainment is unlikely to prove strong enough to attract sufficient audiences to get through the long cold winter.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/12/10/how-to-dance-in-ohio-exuberance-triumphs-over-social-unease/\"><em>Read Sandy MacDonald’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>This is yet another one of those musicals suffering from what you might call the “<em>Chorus Line</em> effect.” A group of assorted characters work to achieve a common goal in the course of which each reveals their inner problem, in song. Drew (Liam Pearce) has been accepted at the University of Michigan, but is apprehensive about leaving small-town Ohio. Marideth (Madison Kopec) explores the world through books and on the computer, but is afraid to leave her house. Tommy (Conor Tague) is nervous about getting his driver’s license. For comedy relief, I suppose, the authors have him successfully pass his driving test and immediately crash his brother’s truck—which I suggest is not all that funny.</p>\n<p>Remy (Desmond Luis Edwards) is trying to work up the courage to launch a cosplay channel about vintage clothing (i.e. “’90s grunge”). Mel (Imani Russell) has been promoted to chief of the reptile department at Paws and Claws, but panics when asked to answer the phone. Caroline (Amelia Fei, in polka-dot stockings) has what appears to be an imaginary boyfriend, who dumps her; while Columbus State Community College freshman Jessica (Ashley Wool) has trouble taking the public bus to campus.</p>\n<p>What we get from bookwriter Rebekah Greer Melocik, composer Jacob Yandura, and director Sammi Cannold, is seven characters standing in a line across the front of the stage as they sing solos about their individual struggles. Yes, this format worked in <em>A Chorus Line</em>; but here the material is uncompelling despite energetic and talented performers. What’s even more damaging are the other characters who surround them, led by Dr. Amigo (Caesar Samayoa), who is divorced and conflicted and sometimes seems like he should be the patient rather than the doctor; and his daughter Ashley (Cristina Sastre), a Juilliard student home from New York nursing a leg injury who drops out so she can stay with daddy and sing a big solo and seems to have a budding relationship with patient Mel and if this sentence runs on clumsily, so does the plot. At one point there’s a line stating it’s all “like some boring romantic cliché,” and I won’t argue with that. There are also assorted parents (one married couple, the others all seemingly divorced or widowed) who are concerned about their kids and play scenes when called for.</p>\n<p>All of which overlooks the strengths of the production. Hidden like gems among an otherwise pedestrian score are three effective songs that successfully illustrate the characters involved rather than just tell us what we need to know. In “Unlikely Animals,” Marideth—who dreams about travel—has a song about Australia, where it is “normal” for young kangaroos to hide in their parents pouches, and where young koalas “much prefer to be alone.” Drew, the budding electrical engineer, sings about “Waves and Wires” so rousingly that his song serves as the first-act curtain. Later, in the so-called 11 o’clock number spot, Drew’s bravura “Building Momentum” finally, if briefly, brings the show alive.</p>\n<p>These last two are sung by Pearce, the standout find of the evening. Tall and lanky, the fellow sings and dances and acts with commanding ease. He appears to be a natural Evan Hansen or Will Parker, and let’s hope he gets further opportunities. Kopec, in her Australia song, also makes an impressive showing. The rest are generally likable, although singing honors go to Darlesia Cearcy (who made a lasting impression in <em>Shuffle Along</em> and the Broadway revival of <em>Ragtime</em>) and Haven Burton, as mothers of the girls who find prom dresses at Macy’s. These two have little to do across the evening, but they ratchet up vocal excitement in their memory duet, “Getting Ready for the Dance.”</p>\n<p>The production is very much in earnest; given the roster of 70 or so producers listed above the title in the program, raising the millions necessary was no simple task. Despite those millions, the show looks skimpy. (Robert Brill designed the sets, Sarafina Bush the costumes, and Bradley King the lights.) Best production work comes from the music department, with Lily Ling leading a band of nine in Broadway-caliber orchestrations by Bruce Coughlin.</p>\n<p>Audience members are likely to leave the Belasco with an exhilarating lift in their step, and that’s all to the good. But such enthusiasm will come from the talent of the performers and the worthiness of the message, rather than from the actual songs, story, or production of <em>How to Dance in Ohio</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>How to Dance in Ohio</em> opened Dec. 10, 2023, at the Belasco Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Blood-thirsty bunnies, farting Frenchmen, knights who say “Ni!,” and the clickety-clack of coconuts: It can mean only one thing. Bring out your dead—and your not-yet-dead—Monty Python fans! <em>Spamalot</em>—the 2005 Tony-winning Best Musical “lovingly ripped off” (as the tagline sayeth) from the 1975 low-budget British movie—is back on Broadway, and it’s as wonderfully silly as ever.</p>\n<p>After slaying in a short run last May at the Kennedy Center, the revival—directed and choreographed by Josh Rhodes, whose most recent NYC work includes the Encores! productions of <em>Dear World</em> and <em>Mack &amp; Mabel</em>—rode its (invisible) horse up I-95 from Washington, D.C., with most of its company in tow: Tony winner James Monroe Iglehart (<em>Aladdin</em>) as King Arthur, Michael Urie (<em>Grand Horizons</em>, <em>Torch Song</em>) as the scaredy-cat Sir Robin, Nik Walker as the dashing Sir Dennis Galahad, and Leslie Rodriguez Kritzer as the all-powerful Lady of the Lake. The multitalented—and apparently rubber-limbed—Ethan Slater (Broadway’s erstwhile SpongeBob SquarePants) joins the cast as, among others, the tweedy Historian, the unkillable Not Dead Fred, and an extremely annoying mime (is there any other kind?); <em>SNL</em> alum Taran Killam plays Sir Lancelot, the “knight who really loves the nightlife,” as well as, most notably, the French Taunter (“You are English bed-wedding types!” he sneers at Arthur &amp; Co.) through Jan. 7, 2024, after which Alex Brightman assumes the role; and Christopher Fitzgerald (<em>Young Frankenstein</em>, <em>Waitress</em>) is Arthur’s steadfast sidekick Patsy, the part created so memorably by the late Michael McGrath.</p>\n<p>In general, this is the <em>Spamalot</em> you remember—right down to the logo; it’s just a little…slimmed down. (Paul Tate dePoo III’s projections are doing a <em>lot</em> of heavy lifting.) Appropriately, there’s even an Ozempic joke. Among the other small tweaks: One of Eric Idle’s lyrics has been updated for the social media age: “We’re going off to war/ We’ll have girlfriends by the shore/ We’ll make TikToks of the gore.” The knights who say “Ni” eventually become the knights who say—something something “Angela Bassett did the thing.” Last Saturday, the scene-stealing Kritzer, in her Liza-inspired lounge act bit during “Knights of the Round Table,” even managed to drop a Travis Kelce/Taylor Swift reference. One suspects that Kritzer, a natural comic who can wring a laugh from a simple key change—e.g., in the purposely lengthy power-ballad parody “The Song That Goes Like This”—gets some leeway to improvise, especially in her Act 2 showstopper, “Diva’s Lament” (aka “Whatever Happened to My Part?”).</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/11/16/spamalot-spamalot-trumpeting-the-return-of-a-raunchy-musical-comedy-for-the-ages/\"><em>Read Sandy MacDonald’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Speaking of Act 2 showstoppers: There are a few—starting with the crowd-pleaser “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,” the British music-hall ditty made famous in <em>Monty Python’s Life of Brian</em>. And perhaps most memorably, there’s “You Won’t Succeed on Broadway,” Sir Robin’s patter song explaining what every good Broadway musical needs: “There simply must be, Arthur, trust me/ Simply must be Jews.” It’s a massive production number incorporating a <em>Fiddler on the Roof</em> parody, a Streisand impersonator, and Michael Urie on a chair doing his best “Mein Herr,” and yes, it lands differently in November 2023. (There’s also, alas, a sound issue, which seems to be a St. James Theatre problem; the singers were getting drowned out during <em>Into the Woods</em> as well.) You can feel the audience asking themselves, Is it okay to laugh? Is the song offensive? For that matter, is it any more or less offensive than the disco-tastic number “His Name Is Lancelot,” which is basically one big gay stereotype wrapped in Lycra?</p>\n<p>No judgment here. But if you don’t chuckle over the lyric “There’s a very small percentile/ Who enjoys a dancing gentile,” I promise—I will judge you.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Spamalot </em>opened Nov. 16, 2023, at the St. James Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Age – a hiatus of 14 years, some of them plague-ridden – has not withered <em>Spamalot</em>’s inspired looniness. If you saw the Broadway production the first time around (2005-2009), of course you’re going to go back. Who would pass up a chance to relive Eric Idle’s hilariously dark spoof of the Middle Ages, especially as recast with a whole new set of comedic aces? All of the replacements, smartly marshaled by director/choreographer Josh Rhodes for last spring’s Kennedy Center revival, seem to be having the time of their lives.</p>\n<p>James Monroe Iglehart brings a robust bonhomie to the role of King Arthur, that benighted idealist: it’s fun to track the actor twinkling with sheer delight. Christopher Fitzgerald shines steadily as Arthur’s faithful lackey Patsy, who’s charged with clopping coconut halves to simulate hoofbeats, among other vital tasks. Summoning pools of long-standing pain, Fitzgerald achieves peak poignancy with just his luminous blue eyes (effective lighting throughout by Cory Pattak) as Arthur melodramatically intones the lament, “I’m All Alone.” “I’m here, you twat,” Patsy finally objects.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/11/16/spamalot-lightheaded-lighthearted-fun/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Much of the humor is scatalogical, seemingly mined from the mentality of a nine-year-old boy. In one of his three guises (most cast members shoulder multiple roles), Michael Urie excels as a flighty recruit who enlists with qualms: “Oh, there’s fighting, is there?… It’s not just dressing up.” Sir Robin’s bowels prove inadequate to the task, prompting much scurrying offstage.</p>\n<p>And then, of course, there’s the barrage of flatulence that the “French Taunter” palace guard rains down on the Arthurian pilgrims. Subbing for Alex Brightman (who was part of the Kennedy Center cast and will resume the role January 7), <em>SNL </em>alum Taran Killam is terrific in four guises. His primary character is Sir Lancelot, whose romantic inclinations veer off-course after he responds to a desperate SOS from a lonely royal shut-in (Ethan Slater, ubiquitous in seven cameo roles and sweetly touching in this one).</p>\n<p>Surpassing this motherlode of talent is Leslie Rodriguez Kritzer, resplendent as The Lady of the Lake, a part seemingly custom-tailored to showcase her talent. Sara Ramirez shone, too, way back when, but Kritzer ratchets it up a notch – as when she and Galahad (Nik Walker) tackle the ever-ascending modulations of “The Song That Goes Like This,” which includes the promise “I’ll sing it in your face / while we both embrace.” Kritzer is fierce! Just wait for the “Diva’s Lament” in Act II, when the Lady grows impatient with her lack of stage time. You’ll relish every second – and thank yourself for revisiting this silly romp — as Kritzer tears a hole in the ceiling with her supersonic melismas.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Spamalot </b>opened November 16, 2023, at the St. James Theatre.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was a time when reviewers excited about an opening would resort to the “Run, don’t walk…” plug. You don’t hear it much nowadays. Nonetheless, I’m reviving it for <em>Harmony</em>, the superb new musical for which Barry Manilow wrote the tunes and Bruce Sussman wrote the lyrics and book.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be advised not even to run but to race to this tale of a six-man Berlin singing group that was founded in 1927, became an international sensation by the early 1930s, and disbanded when Hitler decided that the three Jewish members must no longer appear on stage but were better off leaving the country, as they were able to do.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sounds like a grim story, and it is. But not completely so, as the title suggests and as its authors hope in an implied message that remains as cogent today, when antisemitism in on the rise domestically and globally. Whether that wished-for goal is attainable or not, Manilow, Sussman and crew are ebulliently pushing for harmony musically and societally.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/11/13/harmony-superb-singing-marks-barry-manilows-long-delayed-broadway-debut-as-composer/\">[<em>Read Sandy MacDonald’s </em>★★★★☆  <em>review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sussman and Manilow, having worked on<em> Harmony </em>for about 30 years — their efforts praiseworthily apparent — have decided that the Comedian Harmony facts, known in every German household then, are best recalled by the last one surviving. His nickname was Rabbi (Chip Zien), and he’s lived in the States for decades.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the title tune is delivered at a flashy opening by Bobby (Sean Bell), Young Rabbi (Danny Kornfeld), Harry (Zal Owen), Erich (Eric Peters), Chopin (Blake Roman), and Lesh (Steven Telsey), Rabbi takes over. He begins with the jovial birth of the group, details some early rejections, and quickly gets to their mounting fame, instigated by, of all people, Richard Strauss (Zien again), who recommends them for a renown-making café engagement.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All but immediately they begin a successful touring, recording, and movie-making career — even supporting Josephine Baker (Allison Semmes) in the 1934 Ziegfeld Follies. Their achievements would be endlessly thrilling were they not occurring at the same time as the National Socialists were gaining control, resulting in Adolf Hitler’s seizing absolute authority as Führer. (<em>Harmony</em> can be seen and heard as a microcosmic metaphor for Nazism taking charge of on both German and Austrian.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the personal level, Young Rabbi meets and marries Mary (Sierra Boggess), a Gentile who converts to Judaism at that uncertain time. Chopin, a Gentile, meets, and marries unstoppable political activist Ruth (Julie Benko) but doesn’t convert, a situation that increasingly threatens their union.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As disturbing scenes pile on exhilarating scenes, Rabbi outlines the Harmonists responding to the encroaching terror. He chronicles their growing concern that the Jewish members could be targets. Act One ends at Carnegie Hall, where a triumphant evening includes news that NBC would like to sign the group. The volatile question raised is whether they should remain stateside or return to their imperiled homeland.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They receive a backstage visit from Albert Einstein (Zien again), who suggests that staying where they are is the safest prospect. (He pointedly says — as if speaking to today’s audience — “The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil but by those who watch them and do nothing.”) They debate the pros and cons of Einstein’s observations, with, ironically, Young Rabbi casting the final vote to go home.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Act Two recounts the eventual plundering of Europe and the inevitable Comedian Harmonists demise in Munich on November 5, 1935. Other hardships take place, among others, Ruth’s quitting her marriage and eventually disappearing into the ravenous Nazi maw. (Incidentally, a program note specifies of the musical that “Some license has been taken with regard to chronology and locale.” Another liberty: pianist Chopin didn’t sing, although he does here.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout Manilow and Sussman place their songs with the authority of generals planning a campaign. There’s a first-act comedy number that establishes the “Comedian” half of their name. Wearing shirts and boxer shorts, they sing with gleeful innuendo, “How Can I Serve You. Madame?” By contrast, in Act Two for a gig in Denmark’s Tivoli Park, they intone a satirical and deliberately provocative “Come to the Fatherland.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s not a clinker in the score, which John O’Neill skillfully conducts. There’s even more than one love song. (Who writes those anymore?) Pay attention to “Every Single Day,” which Kornfeld delivers with passionate clarity. Rarely in recent years have so many sustained high notes from so many cast members made their way over the footlights.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Significantly, the high-level <em>Harmony</em> reaches in the writing is matched by Beowolf Borritt’s swank set, Lina Cho and Ricky Lurie’s costumes, Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer’s lighting, Dan Moses Schreier’s sound, Batwin + Robin Productions’ media design, and Tom Wilson’s hair and wig design.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director-choreographer Warren Carlyle is a signal hero, maximizing every second, ever note, every meaningful gesture, every syllable spoken and sung – all cast members mentioned above outstanding at it all. So is Andrew O’Shanick as the frosty Ubersturmführer.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It must be said that the actual Comedian Harmonists amassed a multi-hit song list. Why, it’s fair to ask, have they been discarded in favor of the Manilow-Sussman numbers? The explanation is likely that the original sextet polished a tone that might be considered excessively sweet today. Their work is available on YouTube and will prove instantly appealing for some music lovers. Try to resist “Veronika, der lenz ist da.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A final word: Following a long, celebrated Broadway and off-Broadway career, Zien conquers in a leading-man role. Its range — the many doubling opportunities — includes a soul-searching 11 o’clock “Rabbi’s Turn.” Wrenching confused feelings from deep within, Zien nails it. Sustained bravos for him and the entire memorable enterprise.</span></p>\n<p><strong><b>Harmony </b>opened November 13, 2023, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</p>\n<p>You would think that a recording superstar on the level of Barry Manilow (85 million records sold) might enjoy a bit of a step up when attempting to get a show mounted on Broadway. You’d be wrong: From its conception some 30 years ago, <em>Harmony </em>hit every conceivable bump in the road, starting with a few fizzling out-of-town tryouts and a Covid delay before National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene succeeded in introducing it – to considerable acclaim – at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in the spring of 2022.</p>\n<p>Certain elements remain: Beowulf Boritt’s simple but snazzy black-patent-leather-like box of a set and Warren Carlyle’s snappy direction and choreography continue to contribute plenty of sizzle. If a few clunker lines from longtime collaborator Bruce Sussman’s book and lyrics have managed to survive the transfer, the damage is minimal – perhaps because the storylines are so broadly limned to begin with.</p>\n<p>In contrast to forebears such as <em>Cabaret, </em>this musical treatment – based loosely on a real sextet, the Comedian Harmonists, who toured the Continent and made it as far as Carnegie Hall – tends toward Holocaust Lite. The allusions to the antisemitic crackdowns escalating during the group’s early forays in Germany, 1927-35, skew schematic and glancing. The script presumes foreknowledge on the part of the adult audience. As for young theatergoers unschooled as yet in the horrors of the era (echoing down to this day), they’ll probably emerge with questions; nightmares, however, are unlikely.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/11/13/harmony-a-harmonious-new-musical-about-discordant-1930s-germany/\">[<em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>The focus is on a makeshift sextet of dedicated crooners who band together, hoping to make a go of it amid Berlin’s booming cabaret scene. A few members are Jewish – as is the narrator figure, nicknamed “Rabbi,” played in youth by Danny Kornfeld and as a haimish alter kaker by Broadway veteran Chip Zien (who has dialed down the schmaltz – and built up his vocal stamina – considerably since the off-Broadway production). The young Rabbi forfeits his calling when he happens to fall in love with Mary, a shiksa seamstress performed rather blandly by Sierra Boggess (though to be fair it’s a one-dimensional role).</p>\n<p>The other five singers portraying Harmonists deserve individual kudos: there’s not a less-than-stellar singer in the bunch. The ragtag newbies demonstrate their chops during their very first (fictional) gig, when they arrive at the club to find that their tuxes have been swiped. The resulting improv, involving pants-less hijinks accompanied by serving platters of all shapes and sizes, is outright hilarious.</p>\n<p>The mood soon darkens with some broadly sketched, pro forma protest scenes, where we at least get to meet the singing pianist’s beloved, Ruth, a Jewish socialist agitator. Julie Benko makes the most of this underwritten role. Her half of the second-act duet “Where You Go,” sung in bitter contrast to Mary’s sunny version, is a knockout.</p>\n<p>Intermission is prefaced by a presumptive cliffhanger, in the form of a debate set backstage in Carnegie Hall: Hearing that Hitler has seized the reins in Germany, should the band continue pursuing success in the U.S. or head back home? The reason for their ambivalence is unclear, though pivotal. Are they worried about stepping off the fast track to fame, or do they genuinely think they can effect change by returning? Once repatriated, they mount a clever protest pastiche in Copenhagen, vividly settling the question of motivation.</p>\n<p>Flaws and all, and despite its rocky road to Broadway, <em>Harmony</em> is ultimately a rewarding experience, a feisty/funny survivor which remains tragically timely.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Harmony </b>opened November 13, 2023, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Sorry</em>—the 89-year-old board game of cards and chance—is intended for two to four players, age 6 and up. But in Theresa Rebeck’s new Broadway comedy <em>I Need That</em>, all it takes is one: the irascible Sam, played by the inimitable 78-year-old dynamo Danny DeVito.</p>\n<p>He’s alone, in the dark, and he’s playing all the colors—red, blue, green, and yellow—moving the plastic pawns around the board, and gleefully trash-talking the other (invisible) players.</p>\n<p>“Eight. Screw you, eight. I can’t do anything with an eight.… Red. Oh yeah red! Sorry! You see that, yellow! Fuck you. Sooooorrrrry.… Blue, I got nothing to say.… Yellow. SORRY. SORRY.… This isn’t about what’s fair, it’s about winning. Winning. I’M LOSING.”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/11/02/i-need-that-a-play-about-hoarding-not-cluttered-by-nuance/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>It’s a—I hesitate to use such an overused term, but here it is—tour-de-force scene, which allows DeVito to flex his ample comic muscles as well as to plumb his character’s dramatic depths. (One suspects Rebeck tailored the monologue for her star’s talents.) At that moment, Sam is playing a losing game. He’s in his living room, which is packed with enough stuff to fill seven living rooms, and he needs to clean up his act—fast. A nosy neighbor surreptitiously snapped photos through the window and filed a complaint.</p>\n<p>Where to even begin? Piles of decades-old magazines; stacks of hardcover books; a leaning tower of luggage; pillows and cushions; crates, baskets, and boxes filled with memorabilia such as a 67-year-old bottlecap and a bag of chips from days as a kid working bingo night at Our Lady of Mount Carmel. “I’d come home smelling like a chimney. Everybody smoked like two to three packs a night. The place was like a giant diseased lung,” he remembers fondly. “It was a wild time.” (Also in the bingo box: an engagement ring left behind by one of the bingo ladies. Sam saw no need to hand it over to the priest. “He’s going to put it in the collection plate. Because the Pope needs another ring.” But he kept it, to this day.) Somewhere under there is a sofa, weighed down by blankets and a closet’s worth of clothes. Most of us would call it junk, but as Sam is quick to note, “Everything here is worth something.” It’s a lifetime of memories.</p>\n<p>“You can’t just throw out everything. You have to figure out what you want to keep, and what you can let go. It’s like Sophie’s Choice,” Sam tells his daughter, Amelia (Lucy DeVito, playing opposite her real-life father). She does not appreciate the comparison. “This is not like SOPHIE’S CHOICE! This is like: The fire department is coming and they’re going to condemn the place and tell the health department to throw you out if you don’t do something.” Sam’s friend, Foster (Ray Anthony Thomas), tries looking on the bright side: “It’s not like that show,” he offers, referring to <em>Hoarders</em>. And it’s not. The house is clean; it’s just cluttered to the max.</p>\n<p>Directed by Moritz von Stuelpnagel—who helmed Rebeck’s 2018 backstage drama <em>Bernhardt/Hamlet</em>, also at the Roundabout—<em>I Need That</em> runs only 100 intermission-free minutes, but somehow feels padded. Perhaps in an effort to avoid turning the play into <em>The Danny DeVito Show</em>, Rebeck gives Foster and Amelia a few crises and obstacles, most of which feel contrived. Foster going to Cleveland to live right near his son and grandkids, however, does make sense, and it gives rise to Sam’s brilliant one-liner: “Ohio is the source of all disappointment and grief in America.” (If that had been on a T-shirt in the lobby, I would have bought three of them.) There’s so much substance on stage, literally—Alexander Dodge’s set is a brilliant testament to the pure emotional power of material goods; less so in the script. Sorry!</p>\n<p><strong><em>I Need That</em> opened Nov. 2, 2023, at the American Airlines Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Sure, there are actors so good you would pay to see them read the phone book. But how many are there that you would pay to watch them play a board game? Off hand, I can think of only one: Danny DeVito, who turns a solo game of Sorry into the comic highlight of Theresa Rebeck’s new play <em>I Need That</em>, now receiving its world premiere on Broadway courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company.</p>\n<p>If you don’t know what the play is about beforehand, you’ll figure it out as the soon as the curtain goes up on Alexander Dodge’s awe-inspiring set that must have required him to empty out every thrift shop and Housing Works in town. It depicts the living room of a suburban home…well, at least we think it’s a living room, since every square inch is covered in tchotchkes, bric-a-brac, paraphernalia, and what can only charitably be described as junk. This is indeed the tale of a hoarder, Sam (DeVito), and the desperate efforts of his daughter Amelia (Lucy DeVito, the actor’s real-life offspring) to get him to change his ways, especially since his neighbor’s protests might result in his losing his home.</p>\n<p>Sam finds endless ways to justify his condition, claiming that he’s simply “organizing” and that nearly everything in sight, including a sixty-seven years old bottle cap, is valuable. His best friend Foster (Ray Anthony Thomas), who stops by periodically with day-old croissants, largely indulges Sam’s compulsion, and for good reason; he periodically steals various items to sell in pawn shops or on eBay when Sam isn’t looking.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/11/02/i-need-that-danny-devitos-got-the-goods/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Amelia also drops by often, urging her father to clear out his possession and bringing packing supplies with her in the unlikely event he finally agrees. We eventually learn that Sam has been living alone since the death of his wife, who suffered from dementia, and that holding on to everything is his way of keeping her memory alive.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that’s about the only psychological insight to be gleaned from the play, which otherwise leans heavily on sitcom-style one-liners — “It’s like Sophie’s Choice,” Sam cries about having to decide what to keep and what to throw out — and physical shtick revolving around Sam’s hoarding disorder. The latter include Sam waving a TV antenna around like a crazed conductor to receive a signal on his vintage television and falling off a ladder while trying to reach for something high. Noel Coward, it’s not.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, DeVito is such a skilled performer that he makes the play watchable from beginning to end despite its frequent slow spots. The actor, last seen on Broadway in his Tony-nominated turn in the revival of Arthur Miller’s <em>The Price </em>at the same theater, brings the expert chops honed to perfection on such television shows as <em>Taxi</em> and <em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> to his performance, making every line reading and sputtering reaction hilarious. And as previously mentioned, he turns a lengthy scene in which he angrily plays Sorry by himself into a comedic tour de force.</p>\n<p>Thomas gives excellent support as the best friend whose impending move to Cleveland (the way DeVito exclaims “Ohio?” with such derision is worth the price of admission alone) provides some not very compelling drama. And Lucy DeVito proves endearing as the daughter with a secret of her own. While her tendency to shriek her lines proves irritating, the obvious warm chemistry she displays onstage with her dad provides some amelioration.</p>\n<p>And then, of course, there’s that virtuoso set design, which delivers a fun reveal late in the play. If the show’s producers don’t know what to do with it when the run concludes, they could hold one hell of a garage sale.</p>\n<p><strong><b>I Need That </b>opened November 2, 2023, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through December 23, 2023.

Photo: Todd Cerveris Photography</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Red flag: If a man proposes by saying “I thoroughly admire you and—er—respect you,” he might not be The One. Then again, you can’t blame the immensely practical George Pillatt (Gene Gillette) for going after Kate Rolling (Sara Haider), a fellow shopkeeper with an eye for style and a brain for business. He sees their potential union as a merger, or, as Elizabeth Baker titled her play, a <em>Partnership</em>. “We two hold the pick of the trade here. We do very well separate, no doubt. Together we could top the lot,” Pillatt says of the prospect of combining their respective Brighton clothing boutiques—his larger and more moneyed, hers smaller but up-and-coming—into one booming business.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/10/19/partnership-a-play-for-our-time\"><em>[Read Roma Torre’s </em>★★★★☆<em> here.]</em></a></p>\n<p>“How many proposals is that this month between us, Kate?” asks her associate Maisie Glow (a ripping Olivia Gilliatt). Four. And that’s before Pillatt pops the question. Replies Kate: “I’m beginning to realize we’re eligible young women.”</p>\n<p>The love and business affairs—or, rather, the business and love affairs—of eligible young women provide plenty of fodder for Baker’s topical 1917 comedy, which just opened at Theatre Row courtesy of excavation specialists Mint Theater (the company also produced Baker’s <em>Chains</em> in 2022). A husband, it turns out, is not priority for these smart, well-dressed women. They daydream of a larger storefront, more square footage, and a bigger workroom.</p>\n<p>In other words, it’s a smart business move for Kate to accept Pillatt’s proposal. The trouble starts when she meets—and becomes weirdly fascinated with—her fiancé-to-be’s friend Lawrence Fawcett (Joshua Echebiri), an extremely awkward gent who has no interest whatsoever in shopkeeping. His family ran a rather lucrative corset business, but he’s passionate about something far less profitable: dyes—orange in particular. “Do you mean then only to do work that you like?” Kate asks. (It echoes a line from <em>Chains</em>: “You don’t mean to suggest, I hope, that we ought to like our work, do you?”)</p>\n<p>Directed by Jackson Grace Gay, this <em>Partnership</em> simply doesn’t meet the Mint’s usual high standards. (And I’m not talking about the blatantly obvious stick-on mustache. Although…) It boils down to a glaring lack of chemistry between Haider and Echebiri. And Echebiri’s Fawcett never seems excited by anything, not even his supposedly prized springtime miles-long walks and hillside excursions. (He’s the only character in the play who believes in work-life balance.) So when Kate starts cutting work, forgetting appointments, and prioritizing pleasure over business—taking a mid-morning boat trip instead of doing a fitting with the uppity but influential Lady Smith-Carr-Smith (Christiane Noll, looking splendid in Kindall Almond’s over-the-top frocks)—we can’t help but wonder <em>why</em>? What does she see in him that makes it worth risking her reputation as a businesswoman? “If I choose to lose my clients that is my affair,” Kate shrugs. Maisie is incredulous, and she’s not the only one. Snap out of it, girl!</p>\n<p>And Kate seems to completely miss this beige flag: Fawcett refers to her shop as her “little show.” As if businesswoman is simply a part she&#8217;s playing, and her entire enterprise is a lark. That doesn’t bode well for a partnership in any sense of the word.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Partnership</em></strong><strong> opened Oct. 19, 2023, at Theatre Row and runs through Nov. 12.

The Musical! Photo: Matt Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s been said “dying is easy, comedy is hard”.  Well, anyone who’s seen <em>Gutenberg! The Musical</em> might challenge that little showbiz maxim because Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells—the entire cast of this hilarious two-hander—are making the comedy seem downright effortless. The two stars, appearing together on Broadway for the first time since their Tony nominated turns in the original company of <em>The Book of Mormon</em>, are simply divine delivering a master class in musical comedy and likely setting a land/speed record for laughs per minute.</p>\n<p>One big disclaimer, if you’re hoping to learn anything about Johannes Gutenberg, the famed German inventor of the printing press who provided the world with the very first printed bible, you would be sorely mistaken here. The show is a goof on biographical musicals in which everything is made up.</p>\n<p>Gad and Rannells play Bud and Doug, longtime friends with questionable talents who love musical theater. In search of their big break, they decide to write a show about a famous person and they settle on Gutenberg.  But because Google doesn’t provide much information, they fill in the blanks with their own storyline.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/10/12/gutenberg-the-musical-a-meta-musical-satire-that-doesnt-deserve-exclamation-points/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>In their telling, Gutenberg is the pride of Schlimmer. (Actually, there is no such place. It’s a German word that means “more unpleasant.”) No one else in the town is literate and Gutenberg reasons that’s because they have nothing to read. So he decides to convert his wine press into a printing press and give them the bible. His comely assistant, named Helvetica (I’m not making this up) is secretly in love with him.  And there’s an evil monk who hates God and plots to destroy the printing press to keep the villagers ignorant about the bible. That’s basically it. A story about as cliched and hackneyed as they come.</p>\n<p>It takes something really good to pull off something so bad. Happily, the entire creative team was up to the task. Scott Brown and Anthony King conceived the show more than a decade ago. Envisioning a farcically, misguided version of themselves, they wrote <em>Gutenberg</em> as a musical satire, sending up all the Broadway tropes we’ve come to know and love.  There is a prologue, an act one finale featuring a song “that every tween girl struggles to sing in the shower”, an 11 o’clock number, an unrelated “charm song”, even a dance break;  and as Doug and Bud are quick to point out, “every important musical must tackle at least one serious issue.” So they seize on anti-semitism, saying “history tells us Germans don’t like Jews.”</p>\n<p>Brown and King, who co-wrote the music in addition to the book and lyrics, deserve much of the credit for turning what could be a complete disaster in lesser hands into a finely tuned comedy that’s perpetually clever. The songs, if not exactly hummable, flesh out the plot quite nicely.</p>\n<p>In the show, cash-strapped Bud and Doug have just enough money to rent out a Broadway theater and stage a barebones backers audition in the hopes of enticing a producer to come on board.  There’s no budget for sets, costumes or even actors. And so all the roles are performed by the two starry-eyed writers, To distinguish between the dozens of parts, they they wear caps with the characters’ names boldly marked on the brims. They include “Drunk 1” and “Drunk 2”. “Woman” and “Another Woman”. The list goes on and on.  More than a hundred in all. Just keeping track of each of them is a feat in itself.</p>\n<p>While the production seems effortless, it’s clear that there was a lot of hard work that went into its staging. And for that, a huge tip of the cap to director Alex Timbers who’s proven himself the go-to guy for antic musical comedy. Fresh from <em>Here Lies Love</em>, <em>Moulin Rouge</em>, and <em>Beetlejuice</em>, he paces the action brilliantly, juicing up the physical comedy while giving the actors the freedom to put their own stamp on the roles.</p>\n<p>It’s a tribute to the collaborative process in this production that, as silly as it all is, Bud and Doug come off rather sweetly. They may be incredibly naive but we end up rooting for them in the end. Gad and Rannells aren’t going for easy laughs. The show works because they’re projecting a goofy earnestness that is entirely relatable. Anyone who’s harbored an unlikely dream might see themselves in these two knuckleheads. There’s even a sing-along with the verse “We eat dreams”.</p>\n<p>Amid all the laughs, I kept thinking about <em>The Play That Goes Wrong</em>, another inspired comedy that features bumbling amateurs trying to stage a professional show. What separates the two works is the spark of humanity that permeates <em>Gutenberg</em>. It’s easy to think of Gad and Rannells as a modern day Abbott and Costello.  They have the comic timing and synergy down to a science but they also have a unique quality that transcends mere comedy. There’s really no word for it, but it makes<em> Gutenberg</em> the theatrical equivalent of an irresistible page-turner.</p>\n<p><strong>Gutenberg!

The Musical! Photo credit: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Befitting its overenthusiastic title, <em>Gutenberg! The Musical!</em> has always benefited from a certain plucky “Let’s put on a show!” quality. Originally seen in 2005 as a 45-minute act at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre and the New York Musical Theatre Festival and performed by its authors Scott Brown and Anthony King (who have since gone on to collaborate on <em>Beetlejuice</em>), the show had a cheeky insider’s irreverence toward musical theater that shone through when it received an Off-Broadway production the following year starring the formidable comic talents Christopher Fitzgerald and Jeremy Shamos.</p>\n<p>Many years later, the show has now arrived on Broadway, where its thin charms and relentless meta-humor don’t prove quite as accessible in the large James Earl Jones Theatre with its commensurately extravagant ticket prices. Since the show is not widely known despite its many regional theater productions, the main selling point is its stars Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells, reuniting after their breakout turns in <em>The</em> <em>Book of Mormon</em> and seemingly aspiring to become the next hot Broadway comedy team after Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.</p>\n<p>How much you’ll enjoy the results will depend greatly on your tolerance for very silly jokes and your fondness for the two stars. The pair appear to be having a fine old time onstage, displaying the sort of chemistry that seems the result of their well-meshed comedic styles and warm rapport. They work beautifully together, garnering laughs not only from the wittier dialogue and bits of business but also from their jovial presences.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/10/12/gutenberg-the-musical-revisionist-history-of-the-hysterical-kind/\"><em>Read Roma Torre’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The show’s concept is that their characters, Bud (Gad) and Doug (Rannells), are aspiring Broadway musical creators from Nutley, NJ (the town seems to have been chosen for its name, but Piscataway might have been funnier) who have rented the theater “on the weird side of 7<sup>th</sup> Ave” to audition their new musical for a bunch of Broadway producers who are supposedly in the audience. Said musical is about Johan Gutenberg, the 15<sup>th</sup>-century inventor of the printing press using movable type. Since details of his life are “scant,” Bud and Doug have taken an approach of historical fiction, which they define as “fiction…that’s true.”</p>\n<p>Donning a wide variety of caps emblazoned with the names of different characters, they proceed to act out the musical on the mostly bare stage, accompanied by three onstage musicians and playing all of the parts, including a romantic interest named Helvetica (like the font) and a satanic monk. Bud and Doug, who support themselves by working in a nursing home while pursuing their musical theater career — they inform us their previous efforts included <em>Stephen King! The Musical!</em> and a prequel to <em>Phantom of the Opera</em> — prove the sort of endlessly enthusiastic, if not particularly talented, creators who will be instantly recognizable to anyone who’s sat through a musical workshop.</p>\n<p>The problem is that the show they’ve supposedly devised is not particularly funny, with the relatively esoteric subject matter not exactly lending itself to riotous satire – even Mel Brooks would have trouble coming up with more than a few throwaway gags about Gutenberg. Thus, the real fun comes from the show’s spoofing of musical theater conventions and Broadway itself. But even those jokes don’t have the same impact considering the profusion of similarly themed efforts, such as <em>[title of show]</em>, that have followed in its wake. And the original songs, while featuring some mildly amusing lyrics, are instantly forgettable.</p>\n<p>Humor being of course subjective, there were gales of laughter throughout the performances, so audiences are clearly getting a kick out of the whole thing. Much of the writing is undeniably clever, and there are some fun surprises, including an elaborate set reveal that seems awfully expensive for a single laugh, albeit a big one. And Gad and Rannells are at the top of their game, elevating the proceedings considerably with their expert physical shtick and comic delivery. Still, it’s hard not to wish that the show was once again housed in a more intimate venue and that it ran 90 minutes instead of a bloated two hours including intermission.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Gutenberg!

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Last winter’s production of <em>Merrily We Roll Along</em>, which was a rapid-fire sold-out hit when presented downtown at New York Theatre Workshop, has now taken over the historic Hudson on West 44th. The show plays even better in this traditional, three-level playbox. In fact, this first Broadway revival of the 1981 Stephen Sondheim-George Furth musical might be the finest Broadway revival of any Sondheim musical thus far (and I’ve seen ’em all, since Richard Rodgers revived <em>West Side Story </em>in 1968). Certainly, it would win in the “most improved” category. This production makes <em>Merrily</em>, finally, look like a top-drawer musical with no apologies necessary.</p>\n<p>The production is substantially the same as it was downtown, the cast intact save for the two lads alternating in the role of Franklin Shepard’s son. Headlining the enterprise, in what is clearly not the central role, is Daniel Radcliffe. The onetime Harry Potter has been trodding the boards frequently since when?—<em>Equus</em>, in 2007?—with a good deal of success both in the artistic and ticket-selling realms. With age (he’s now 34), he has developed into a top-level character man. To watch him “bzzz” and “drrrrring” and “mutter mutter mutter” his way through that musical comedy workout Sondheim called “Franklin Shepard, Inc.” is to watch an expert at work. Radcliffe slays the house, of course; you can only wonder how many of his legion of fans, having eagerly scooped up hard-to-find tickets, will sit there thinking: “Oh, <em>now</em> I understand why they say nothing compares to a real, live Broadway musical!” Or something of the sort.</p>\n<p>Lindsay Mendez—as Mary, the leading lady who will never, ever get her man—also remains better-than-wonderful in the role. “Not a Day Goes By,” she sings, watching her “Old Friend” Franklin look through her in search of that elusive something he is fated to never, ever find. Behind Mendez’s wide smile is a wall of pain. The character, the material, and in this case the performer make your heart just want to break.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/10/10/merrily-we-roll-along-feel-the-flow-hear-whats-happening/\">[<em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>If Mendez and Radcliffe were already perfect downtown—or perhaps even on the first day in the rehearsal room—Jonathan Groff’s Franklin Shepard has taken a different path. To say the role is difficult is an understatement; like Robert (a.k.a. Bobby baby) in the Sondheim-Furth <em>Company</em>, Franklin is trapped. He stands in the precise center of a crowd that his character dominates, unable to break through his walled-off personality to relate to anyone, imploring somebody—anybody—to “make me aware of being alive.” Groff brought an intriguing element to his performance last winter, not shying away from displaying a Franklin who was cold, cruel, and unlikable. He has now found a way to add a core of desperate sadness and a sense of loss, which makes him the most effective Franklin of the half-dozen I’ve seen.</p>\n<p>As before, Reg Rogers offers clutch support as producer Joe Josephson, bringing measures of comedy and pathos to the proceedings. He is one of those actors who can speak volumes by simply standing silent, slumped on the side of the stage. Katie Rose Clarke comes in relatively late in the reverse-chronologic proceedings as Franklin’s first wife, Beth. Faced with that late entrance, the already-established competitive excellence of Mendez and Radcliffe, and the not-easy chore of launching almost immediately into a brief and brutal divorce scene capped by an exquisite Sondheim ballad without the opportunity of establishing her character, Clarke manages to quickly hold her own. The other major player, Krystal Joy Brown as Gussie, is saddled with the one role that the authors—struggling to fix the show through numerous rewrites—never quite solved. Brown does manage to break through, especially in the later scenes (which are, in the writing, actually the earlier scenes). Her performance is on a level with the others, even if her material is not.</p>\n<p>Maria Friedman—a prime Sondheim interpreter who starred in West End productions of <em>Sunday in the Park with George</em>, <em>Merrily We Roll Along</em>, and <em>Passion</em>—initially directed this production in 2012 at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London. Friedman’s producer-sister Sonia, along with David Balbani of the Menier, moved it to the West End the following year, and they lead the team that a decade later brought it—with a new, American cast—to NYTW and now Broadway. Choreographer Tim Jackson and scenic/costume designer Soutra Gilmour remain on hand, joined by lighting designer Amith Chandrashaker, sound designer Kai Harada, and hair/wig designer Cookie Jordan. All make key contributions to the whole.</p>\n<p>The music, meanwhile, sounds even better at the Hudson, by virtue of the addition of a string quartet supplementing the group. (The designer places the band in a windowed upper area of the set; we see them play the overture and the curtain calls, but they otherwise disappear behind blackout blinds.) The 13-piece orchestra—half the players held over from NYTW—is now led by Joel Fram, who performed the same chore on the 2021 <em>Company</em>. If today’s Broadway musicals must have drastically cut-down orchestras, it is all-the-more-critical that the surgeon in question understands the score and the music. It is an understatement to say that Jonathan Tunick knows how to orchestrate a Sondheim musical; but he also knows how to cut his existing work in half without losing the orchestral colors and flavors of the original (except for that virtuosic tuba part included in the 1981 version).</p>\n<p>All told, it’s a hit, to borrow a title phrase from one of Sondheim most artful &#8220;concerted&#8221; numbers; a palpable hit, to borrow a phrase the Master borrowed from the Bard. Forget about the troubled history of Sondheim and Hal Prince’s most ignominious miscue; here and now, <em>Merrily</em> is a five-star hit, and no doubt about it. The show plays like wildfire, ignited from that first blast of overture from that band. It’s a win-win, or perhaps a win-win-win-win. A win for <em>Merrily</em>, yes; a win for Radcliffe, Mendez, and Groff; and a win mostly for Maria Friedman, who created this production with significant success back in 2012 and—in three or four steps along the way—has continued to add layers of sheen so that it no longer plays like an excellent production of a troubled musical but an excellent show all around. It’s a win for Furth, too, who is often overlooked for his script to <em>Merrily</em> (and <em>Company</em> as well) but whose contributions the composer always insistently cited.</p>\n<p>Mostly it’s a win for Sondheim, who at this point in time has encountered so many such wins that if he were here, he would likely nod in sincere appreciation as he rushed in from London (where his newest revue, <em>Old Friends</em>, opened last week at the Gielgud) and bolted downtown (where his newest musical, <em>Here We Are</em>, opens next week at the Shed). All of which is well and good; but here and now <em>we</em> are at the Hudson, and <em>Merrily We Roll Along</em> is finally and inarguably revealed to be a wonderfully thrilling Broadway hit.</p>\n<p><strong>Merrily We Roll Along opened October 10, 2023, at the Hudson Theatre and runs through March 24, 2024.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>How to explain the emotional pull of <em>Merrily We Roll Along</em>, Stephen Sondheim’s beloved, broken, backward-moving 1981 musical? If you’ve bought a ticket to the brilliant Broadway revival—just opened at Broadway’s Hudson Theatre after a nine-week winter run at New York Theatre Workshop off-Broadway—you know: You can feel the audience collectively lean in after the first few brassy bars of the overture (oh, that overture!).</p>\n<p>It’s a show that gives us permission to look back and wonder, as the lyric goes, “How did you get to be here?” Or, to quote another lyric in the prologue, “How can you get so far off the track?”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/10/10/now-you-know-or-how-to-make-merrily-roll-along/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>In director Maria Friedman’s production, it’s Broadway composer–turned–Hollywood producer Franklin Shepard (Jonathan Groff) who’s looking back: He walks onstage alone, clutching a tattered script. Well, how <em>did</em> he get to be here? Suddenly, <em>Merrily</em>’s reverse-chronological structure—following tight-knit trio Frank, novelist-turned-critic Mary (Lindsay Mendez), and lyricist-turned-playwright Charley (Daniel Radcliffe) through various highs and lows both personal and professional—seems less like a gimmick and more like a necessity. Actually, Kaufman and Hart deserve credit (or blame) for the finish-to-start structure; their 1934 play <em>Merrily We Roll Along</em> served as Sondheim and librettist George Furth’s source. And now, you can thank Friedman—whose association with the show dates back to a 1992 U.K. production, where she played Mary—for finally making some sense of it.</p>\n<p>The three friends are at their most unsympathetic when we first meet them. In 1976, Frank is hosting an A-list party—“I just figured out what the ‘A’ stands for,” Mary quips—at his sterile Bel-Air home in honor of his latest movie. He’s a sunglass-wearing, Champagne-swilling Hollywood cliché in full midlife-crisis mode, cheating on his actress wife, Gussie (Krystal Joy Brown), with the much-younger actress Meg (Talia Simone Robinson). Mary is drunk and bitter, as evidenced in her toast: “To Franklin Shepard, the producer. The man who has everything. And fat, drunk and finished, I would rather be me any day.” And our first encounter with Charley—“that driven little runt,” spits Gussie—is an infamous 1973 TV interview, where he eviscerates Frank live on-air in the tongue-twisting patter song “Franklin Shepard, Inc.” A phony, an alcoholic, and a nervous wreck—not necessarily people you want to cheer on.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Friedman has found three actors whose charm and genuine connection overrides their characters’ most unpalatable qualities. And since the NYTW production, their performances have only deepened. Groff (<em>Spring Awakening</em>, <em>Hamilton</em>) is perfection as the successful but hollow composer-turned-corporation Frank. Radcliffe’s “Franklin Shepard, Inc.” is an absolute marvel (don’t be surprised to see a standing ovation after that high-speed train of a song), and his unassuming delivery of “Good Thing Going” is a surprise emotional bombshell. Post–<em>Harry Potter</em>, Radcliffe has racked up an impressive list of stage credits ranging from <em>How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</em> to <em>The Cripple of Inishmaan</em>, and he impresses more in each appearance. And as the pal that holds the trio together, Mendez’s performance is a delicious cocktail of cynicism and hopefulness. What’s most impressive: When they sing the anthem “Old Friends,” they actually look like old friends.</p>\n<p>If you can, see this revival with an old friend—perhaps one who’s never experienced the many joys of <em>Merrily</em> or heard its innumerable hummable songs. Yes, <em>hummable</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Merrily We Roll Along</em> opened Oct. 10, 2023, at the Hudson Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If you saw <em>Merry Wives</em>, Jocelyn Bioh’s modern-day spin on <em>The Merry Wives of Windsor</em>, at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park in 2021, you might remember a scene with Madam Page in a Harlem hair-braiding salon. Perhaps Bioh (<em>School Girls; Or, the African Mean Girls Play</em>) was giving us a hint of things to come with the joyous <em>Jaja’s African Hair Braiding</em>: an entire play set in just such a Harlem salon, dedicated to, as she says in her program note, the “heroes, craftswomen, and artists with beautiful, gifted and skilled hands” whom she has known throughout her life.</p>\n<p>Whether braider or customer, Black American or of West African descent, every female character who steps foot in the salon in Bioh&#8217;s latest, now at the Samuel J. Friedman, is formidable and well-drawn, even if she speaks only a few lines. There’s Marie (Dominique Thorne), Jaja’s daughter, charged with opening, closing, and keeping everything humming; this morning, a 90-plus-degree summer day in 2019 on 125th Street, she is having one of those sleep-through-the-alarm, no-hot-water, insufficient-fare-MetroCard, slow-ass A-train NYC kind of mornings—we’ve all been there—all while lugging a week’s worth of new hair. Plus, she’s dealing with the shop’s crotchety through-wall air conditioner. Miriam (Brittany Adebumola) is there waiting, and kindly presents her with a bagel. “I saw CNN doctor say that if you want to lose weight, you have to not have too many ‘carbs,’” says Miriam, shrugging off Marie’s “you look amazing” (which, BTW, she does).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/10/03/jajas-african-hair-braiding-harlem-braids-maybe-not-tight-enough/\">[<em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★☆☆<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>Next to arrive are Aminata (Nana Mensah) and Bea (Zenzi Williams), and we begin to realize that the braiders are like their own little family. (“Put on that music station,” Aminata says to Marie. “You know? With the song that I like by that one guy?” Insists Bea: “If you play it, we’ll know it.”) They don’t mind pulling one over on each other: Bea dumps a new customer, Jennifer (Rachel Christopher), onto an unsuspecting Miriam, because “Long micro braids? She is going to be in here all day.” In fact, she is. The morning-to-night process allows the seemingly shy Miriam to open up about her divorce and her daughter back in Sierra Leone. “Everyone think I’m quiet,” says Miriam. “I’m not like average African woman, eh. No more time for quiet. I want to be loud, yeah?”</p>\n<p>The ladies also <em>love</em> to gossip, especially about Jaja’s impending marriage to a white man named Steven; Bea likens her wedding dress to “a bag of, eh, eh, what are those things—marshmallows.” And don’t get Bea started on her coworker Ndidi (Maechi Aharanwa); she accuses Ndidi of stealing everything from customers to her breakfast order. Throughout the day, we see customers come and go, most memorably: Vanessa (“Ugh, what is that smell? And why is this seat warm?!), who whines about everything before mercifully falling asleep, and Radia, a well-heeled former classmate of Marie’s (“I like never come to Harlem, but I really need to. It’s so cute up here”), both played by Lakisha May; and Chrissy, who wants superlong blonde Beyoncé braids for her birthday (“Okay ladies now let’s get in formation!”), played by Kalyne Coleman.</p>\n<p>Eventually Jaja (Somi Kakoma) arrives, in full wedding regalia, looking nothing like a marshmallow—the spectacular costumes are by Dede Ayite, who also designed Bioh’s <em>Merry Wives</em>. “I’m telling you ladies. This is it. This is the life that God planned for me, you know?” Finally, she’s going to “get all of this nonsense immigration stuff out of the way.” (Jaja and Marie are from Senegal.) Notably, Marie is not going to the courthouse to see her mom become “Mrs. Jaja Jacobson.” She doesn’t like her soon-to-be-stepfather.</p>\n<p><em>Jaja’s</em> does have four male characters—the friendly neighborhood sock, jewelry, and DVD sellers, plus Aminata’s ne’er-do-well husband, all played by Michael Oloyede—but let’s be honest: It’s really about the women. And their hair, which is almost a character in itself. Those in the know won’t be surprised to learn that Nikiya Mathis is the hair and wig designer (there’s no one better). At the 2022 Obie Awards, where she was honored for sustained achievement in her field, Mathis spoke of “the laying-on of hands in hair.” Bioh’s play is a celebration of that.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Jaja’s African Hair Braiding</em> opened Oct. 3, 2023, at the Friedman Theatre and runs through Nov. 19.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whenever you hear about a bevy of women letting their hair down, you know you’re happily in for wisecracks, sarcasm, hair-pulling or wig-snagging, revelations, impromptu dance moves, and who-knows-what-else — all of it aimed at jarring laughs and the occasional tear.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In <em>Jaja’s African Hair Braiding</em>, playwright Jocelyn Bioh (the marvelous <em>Nollywood Dreams</em> among previous works) isn’t just talking about women letting their hair down, she’s talking about putting their hair up and down in all sorts of tightly braided and corn-rowed ways.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone thinking that the play might be considered the Black equivalent to Robert Harling’s <em>Steel Magnolias</em> has got something there. Here, it’s 9 o’clock and just off 125th Street in Harlem on a hot 2019 July morning. Marie (Dominique Thorne) is opening Jaja’s African Hair Braiding salon for the day. (David Zinn’s set is lusciously gaudy.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/10/03/jajas-african-hair-braiding-tressed-to-impress/\">[<em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marie, a recent class valedictorian, runs the shop on a daily basis because mom Jaja, originally from Senegal, isn’t always on hand and not immediately at this session. Bea (Zenzi Williams), originally from Ghana, Aminata (Nana Mensah) from Senegal, and Miriam (Brittany Adebumola) from Sierra Leone are quickly on the pulsating premises. So is more recent braider Ndidi (Maechi Aharanwa) from Nigeria, who immediately fires off the first of the attention-grabbing <em>Jaja’s African Hair Braiding</em> confrontations.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer Michelle (Kalyne Coleman) arrives for her appointment thinking it’s Bea’s day off. She’s in the process of leaving Bea for Ndidi. She’s dismayed, however, to find Bea at her chair and flying off the handle at her as well as verbally attacking Ndidi, who’s unaware of the previous Bea-Michelle history. Michelle explains that recently Bea has taken too long for her braiding and then not getting it done well enough. That’s in Michelle’s now-abashed estimation.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A couple chairs away, Miriam, who’s still thinking about returning to Sierra Leone, is adding micro braids for journalist Jennifer (Rachel Christopher), who shows up in the morning and, while the intricate operation is underway, remains in her seat for close to 10 hours. This leaves her plenty of time to get Miriam’s romantic history, that story being the most comprehensive one revealed during Bioh’s 90-minute jaunt. (By the way, braiding details — the time and pain involved — will surely not be news to many women in the audience but may be fresh and eye-opening for men.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aminata’s tale is presented more in-person when womanizing partner James (Michael Oloyede) barrels in to work his sly way around her. Just before he exits, he feigns remembering he needs to borrow money. It’s quickly handed over, and another close look at their troubled relationship concludes.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so, the long day sashays by. As it does. Bioh drops enlightening news about ubiquitous and truly exalted Harlem braiding sites. Stores are apparently far from permanent (no pun intended), some perhaps lasting no longing than the time a standard braiding lasts, some of them burning down. (In a program note, the playwright explains that since she was 4, she’s been a customer and has seen it all.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As she cleverly fills audiences in on the checkered reality of Harlem businesses, braiding salons among them, she keeps the chatty exchanges coming and, for the most part, engrossing. Salesmen, all played by Oloyede, hawking things like socks and jewelry come through the door.  Customers, all played with a range of attitudes by either Coleman or Lakisha May, head through the door and out again. One visitor, who’s made the significant move downtown, gushes that she enjoys coming to Harlem because, “It’s so cute.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But — and here’s a potent but — from start almost to finish Bioh doesn’t dig too deeply beneath the surface of her tale. It’s almost as if she’s simply combing the included incidents out as Bea and Ndidi spend time combing the bunches of extension hair they’ll be using.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, Bioh realizes this and late in the proceedings goes about correcting the dramaturgical lapse — or hoping to correct it. She introduces the titular Jaja (Somi Kakoma) from Senegal and talking about it as resplendent in a white gown. (The ubiquitous and always reliable Dede Ayite is the costumer.) Jaja is exhilarated about her impending marriage to a white American, a knot-tying that will at last confer citizenship on her, ending longtime worries about ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) incursions.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And here’s a big spoiler: Jaja speaks too soon. Bioh contrives a heart-stopping development that threatens not only Jaja but daughter Marie. She contrives it but awkwardly. As she rapidly heads into ending the play, she leaves things on — forgive this — ice. And this leaves <em>Jaja’s African Hair Braiding</em> as insufficiently dramatic, though never less than amusing, as acted by the 10-member cast and directed by Whitney White, who apparently knows exactly what has a braiding outfit buzzing any and every day.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The play does give a reviewer a chance to nod strongly at a creative team member too often overlooked: the hair and wig designer. That individual is indisputably crucial here. Check out, especially, what eye-catchers crown Bea, Aminata, and Ndidi. Awesome work, Nikiya Mathis.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Jaja&#8217;s African Hair Braiding opened October 3, 2023, at Samuel J. Friedman Theatre and runs through November 19.

Photo: Jenny Anderson</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A couple weeks ago, while plugging his book <em>The Masters</em>, <em>Rolling Stone</em> founder Jann Wenner gave an interview to <em>The New York Times</em> explaining that the people he interviewed—Bono, Bob Dylan, Jerry Garcia, Mick Jagger, John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, and Pete Townshend—were “philosophers of rock.” As for female artists—glaringly absent from the book: “Insofar as the women,” he said, “just none of them were articulate enough on this intellectual level.” (He has since issued an apology.)</p>\n<p>If he’s lucky, someone will do him a favor and take him to Circle in the Square to see Melissa Etheridge’s <em>My Window</em>. Then he can hear the smoky-voiced—and extremely articulate—singer-guitarist rip through songs such as the seductive “Like the Way I Do”; the R&amp;B-soaked “Bring Me Some Water,” her first single; and the Grammy-winning anthem that gives the show its title, “Come to My Window.” Loneliness, longing, heartbreak, passion—if she’s not a philosopher of rock, then who is?</p>\n<p>If you’re a diehard fan, you’ll likely know most everything about Etheridge’s background—growing up gay in Kansas, her high-profile relationships, her children, her struggle with breast cancer. But here she really takes us back to the beginning—to the day of her actual birth: The doctor was at lunch, so the nurses held her mom’s legs closed (!) until he returned. Etheridge came out black and blue. As a child, she got “music fever” from watching <em>The Archies</em>—the Archie Comics-inspired animated show starring Archie, Jughead, Reggie, Betty, and Veronica and, of course, their band—on Saturday mornings (remember their Monkees-style pop hit “Sugar Sugar”?), and begged, begged, begged for guitar lessons. She grew up playing in Leavenworth prisons and the local Knights of Columbus (at the Parents Without Partners dance, she sang “Stand by Your Man”); her dad shuttled her to every gig. She still has the macramé guitar strap he made for her decades ago. “Isn’t it great?” she asks, proudly showing it off.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/09/28/melissa-etheridge-my-window-the-rock-n-roll-icon-tells-all-sells-all/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The first act, which runs from birth right up until she’s playing clubs in L.A. and lands her first record contract, is undeniably tighter than the second, moving swiftly through the decades and cities with the help of The Roadie (Kate Owens), a character charged with playing everything from Etheridge’s sullen 4-year-old sister to a Peruvian shaman. But Act 2 goes down a bumpier road, and moves in fits and starts: breakups; her father’s death from cancer; an extended cannabis-induced hallucination that ends with, of all things, the realization that “Cats are from the star system Sirius! They are here to observe us!” (okay, that’s kind of brilliant); her diagnosis of stage 3 breast cancer, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation; her journey with plant-based medicines and psychedelics; love and marriage to the woman she’s with now; and the drug-related death of her son, which began with a snowboarding accident and an opioid prescription, and ended with addiction and fear. It’s no wonder Etheridge cuts the lights before telling that story.</p>\n<p>The best reason to see Etheridge on Broadway is the intimacy factor. Even if you manage to catch her in a smaller venue on the road—say, Nashville’s historic Ryman Auditorium—you’re still talking about a couple thousand seats. Compare that with Circle in the Square’s 726. You’ll never be closer to hear her sing her standards “I Want to Come Over” and “I’m the Only One,” or her spectacular cover of “Piece of My Heart,” which you might remember from a 2005 Grammy Awards tribute to Janis Joplin. Etheridge isn’t necessarily known for her covers, but you can find a bunch on EtheridgeTV on YouTube, where she jams on multiple instruments in a groovy low-lit room papered with posters and album covers. Don’t miss Cyndi Lauper’s “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,” U2’s “The One,” and Tina Turner’s “The Best.”</p>\n<p>You can also take home a small souvenir: A pre-show announcement gives you explicit permission to photograph and/or film—and presumably Instagram—the encore, “Come to My Window.” But please, don’t break out your cellphone and start recording the opening number. There’s always someone who has to ruin it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Melissa Etheridge: My Window</em> opened Sept. 23, 2023, at Circle in the Square and runs through Nov. 19.

Photo: Jenny Anderson</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Towards the first-act end of <em>Melissa Etheridge: My Window</em>, the woman whom Island Records founder Chris Blackwell called the “new face of rock ‘n’ roll” in 1988 reprises one of only two songs she didn’t write. It’s “On Broadway,” which was top 40 charted by the Drifters and written by Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil, Mike Stoller and Jerry Leiber. It contains the lyric, “They say that I won’t last too long on Broadway.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, no? Etheridge gives the impression she includes the hot number because, a fan of Broadway musicals since childhood, she’s ready to disprove the tune’s sentiment. And does she! She’s going to last long there. Not necessarily for the obvious reason(s) but for one that may surprise her longtime and vociferous followers.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the singer-songwriter <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span> born May 29, 1961 <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span> arrives, she enters a set that Bruce Rodgers has given the look of a glittering concert stage. She’s wearing a rhinestone-encrusted outfit, for which costumer Andrea Lauer supplies various eye-popping jackets.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/09/28/melissa-etheridge-my-window-this-is-m-e/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo&#8217;s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The immediate impression is that Etheridge is at that Broadway pinnacle to give the audience the Etheridge concert of their life and hers. Which is pretty much expected by those who’ve sworn by her, many for at least the last 35 years. And which she does deliver in her gutsy voice while playing with expert confidence several guitars, one piano (she reports that she taught herself to play the funky instrument), and drums. Undoubtedly, she had to take a while to decide which 15 songs of hers to include as well as “On Broadway” and “Piece of My Heart.” She may be the best Janis Joplin impersonator there is.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As anyone familiar with Etheridge knows, she’s gay. She’s never been quiet about it. Quite the opposite. As a result, she has attracted a large lesbian audience. As expected, those are the crowds she’ll immediately attract <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span> and please for their money’s worth and more. They’ve supported her before, and she gives them every reason to be thrilled again, Broadway or no Broadway.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, as it happens, and what may come as a surprise for the Etheridge devoted, this appearance is not only the concert it appears at first to be. It’s something more and perhaps something even more to be cherished. This goes for spectators <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span> this reviewer among them <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span> familiar with some of her material but hasn’t been a diehard advocate. What Etheridge offers during the two-and-a-half hours, as grittily and silkily directed by Amy Tinkham, is her life story, co-written with wife Linda Wallem Etheridge.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is most indelible about the musical autobiography is the absolute honesty with which it’s told. Etheridge gives the impression that she leaves nothing out, no matter how negatively it might reflect on her. She starts by recalling that she was four when she knew she had to be a musician and importuned her parents for a guitar. She discusses those parents – a mother who let her know lesbian friends weren’t welcome in the house and a father who accepted her sexual identity despite his not understanding it.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She’s open about her numerous affairs, whether she was in a relationship or wasn’t. She talks about the sons she shared with one woman from whom she eventually became estranged. She talks about drugs and cancer. She fills in the many places she played while trying to rub two nickels together and the often gumption, often finesse with which she landed gigs. She brings up her Grammys, one of which is displayed by a Roadie (Kate Owens, who never speaks but winningly serves in many other capacities, such as carrying on and off the many guitars used).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truly, Etheridge seems to get to it all, which a reviewer with limited space can’t. One especially bright memory she mentions is visiting a man of the cloth at a time when she was concerned about choosing a gay life. Assuming he’d advise her to change her ways, she was startled when he said he believed that “God would never create a love that was wrong.” How good of her to pass along that piece of contemporary wisdom.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Etheridge spins her homegrown Leavenworth, Kansas tale between including adored items like “Meet Me in the Back,” “I Want to Come Over,” “I’m the Only One,” and “Come to my Window,” she showers new illuminating personal light. (Abigail Rosen-Holmes is the actual lighting designer, Olivia Sebesky the busy projections director.) That’s to say, she adds new autobiographical depth to her catalog.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her songs are revealed to be the equivalent of her talking. She may not be scrupulous about rhyme, which crops up when convenient, but she never ceases to write from who she is. Every thought is true to that. Audience members, most particularly those not foremost among her devotees, are likely to leave with an enhanced respect for her – and gratitude for her lyrics – for instance, a lyric as trenchant and indisputable as this: “There’s no truth in shame.” She got that right.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Melissa Etheridge: My Window opened September 28, 2023, at the Circle in the Square Theatre and runs through November 19.

Photo: Marc J. Franklin</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Toll the bell, Old Broadway. Times are changin’, gone are the days, and hallelujah! <em>Purlie Victorious</em>, the play fashioned by Ossie Davis as a spellbinding vehicle for himself and his wife, Ruby Dee, is back on Broadway after a mere 62 years.</p>\n<p>Leslie Odom Jr. has stepped onto the pulpit occupied by Davis when the play was produced for the first (and only) time back in 1961. The Tony Award-winning actor from <em>Hamilton</em> joins forces with the deservedly red-hot director Kenny Leon to give new life to this wickedly satiric tale termed, in the publicity and advertising, “a Non-Confederate Romp Through the Cotton Patch.”</p>\n<p><em>Purlie Victorious</em>, per the stage directions, takes place in “the recent past”—which was timely in 1961 and might be just as timely today. Purlie Victorious Judson (Odom) has returned to the family cabin in Cotchipee County, Georgia, having 20 years earlier fled from the plantation owner’s vicious bull-whip. Ol’ Cap’n Stonewall Jackson Cotchipee (Jay O. Sanders) is not actually a plantation owner surrounded by faithful retainers (that is, slaves); he just <em>thinks</em> he is. Purlie’s subservient brother Gitlow (Billy Eugene Jones) supports the notion, eagerly picking bales of cotton and soothing Ol’ Cap’n with antebellum spirituals.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/09/27/purlie-victorious-a-revival-that-lives-up-to-its-title/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ </a><em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/09/27/purlie-victorious-a-revival-that-lives-up-to-its-title/\">review here</a>.</em>]</p>\n<p>The prodigal Purlie returns bringing along Lutiebelle Gussie Mae Jenkins (Kara Young), a backcountry kitchen girl from Dothan, Alabama. The plan: to trick Ol’ Cap’n into returning a misappropriated $500 to enable Purlie to buy back Big Bethel, the local church, and once and forever toll the bell of liberty. Purlie is ably supported in the battle by Aunt Missy (Heather Alicia Simms), Gitlow’s long-suffering but all-knowing wife; and young Charlie Cotchipee (Noah Robbins), a stringbean of a lad who—to the disgust of Ol’ Cap’n—has a head filled with “integrationary ideas.” (This relatively minor role, back in 1961, launched the career of Alan Alda. Alda’s name is on this production&#8217;s <em>Playbill</em> title page as one of the play’s numerous producers, a designation shared with LaTanya Richardson Jackson, Samuel L. Jackson, and Phylicia Rashad, as well as Odom and Leon.)</p>\n<p>In the end, the day of deliverance is at hand with Ol’ Cap’n safely and most definitely dead. “Let there be no merriment in these buryments,” preaches Purlie. But there is merriment aplenty.</p>\n<p>The production is all that Davis, who died in 2005 at the age of 87, might have desired. Performed on an ingeniously functional set by Derek McLane, the original three acts have been distilled into one, performed in a breezy hundred minutes with nothing lost; the results play better without the need for all those old-fashioned non-automated scene changes. Emilio Sosa brings just the right touch to the costumes, as usual; note how Purlie’s best (and only) suit appears to be new but frayed along the backside. Lighting designer Adam Honoré makes the scene transitions memorable, while atmospheric musical accompaniment comes from composer Guy Davis, whose work honors his mother and father.</p>\n<p>As playgoers might expect, Odom has all that silver-tongued preaching down cold. One of the chief delights of the production comes from the performance of Young as Lutiebelle. Those who saw her in Lynn Nottage’s <em>Clyde’s</em> likely realized that she is a star to be, while Martyna Majok’s <em>Cost of Living</em> demonstrated that she’s a fine and intelligent actor as well. Here, she weaves a thorough spell, eyes wide in wonderment at the new world outside “Miss Emmylou’s kitchen” while succumbing to waves of weak-kneed infatuation toward her savior, “Reb’n Purlie.” She has over two seasons given three distinctive performances, each of them excellent, in three very different plays in very different styles. Kara Young, remember that name.</p>\n<p>Sanders, who has spent so much time sitting around the kitchen table as the hapless husband/brother/father in Richard Nelson’s various <em>Apple Family</em> and <em>Rhinebeck Panoroma</em> plays, gets a chance to play overbroad comedy as the bigoted and lustful Ol’ Cap’n. He bites into the role, and practically into the other actors, with villainous joy. Simms as Missy, Vanessa Bell Calloway as Ol’ Cap’n’s housekeeper and cook Idella, and the rest are all up to their deliciously wry chores.</p>\n<p>Most critical to the success of the evening, perhaps, is the work of director Leon. He honors Davis’s every intention, both written and unwritten in the script. And, more than that, he appears to be channeling what the author would want the play to stand for after the intervening 60-odd years, and how the wise activist Davis would address what is happening in the country right now. “Something is rotten in the cotton,” indeed.</p>\n<p>Historical note: the late Broadway stage manager Charlie Blackwell told me that Davis started writing <em>Purlie Victorious</em> in his upstairs dressing room at the Imperial Theatre in 1958, when they were doing the long-running Lena Horne-Harold Arlen musical, <em>Jamaica</em>. In 1959, Ruby Dee created the role of Ruth Younger—opposite Sidney Poitier and Claudia McNeil—in Lorraine Hansberry’s <em>A Raisin in the </em>Sun, the first Broadway play written by a black woman; the fifth, by my count, written by a black playwright; and the first to achieve commercial success.</p>\n<p>When Poitier left the <em>Raisin </em>cast to resume his active motion picture career, Davis took over the role. The play was coproduced by Philip Rose, a first-time producer who quickly agreed to produce <em>Purlie Victorious</em>, which was just as unlikely a prospect for success. (Unlike the present revival, the 1961 production was produced, backed, and directed by liberal-to-leftist white men.) The play struggled to find an audience from the start; Rose, believing that the play <em>must</em> be seen, kept it running at a loss for more than seven months and closing with a significant deficit. Even this did not defeat him; in 1970, he produced a musical version, <em>Purlie</em>, co-authored by Davis. Featuring dynamic, Tony-winning performances by both Cleavon Little and Melba Moore, this achieved a wider popularity, though without achieving commercial success.</p>\n<p>The original production of <em>Purlie Victorious</em> (with Davis, Dee, Alda, and other original cast members) was preserved in an obscure 1963 motion picture version, originally released under the title <em>Gone Are the Days!</em> This exists on video and can presumably be located; that said, the current performances of Odom and Young, along with the enlightening work of Leon, make this production at the Music Box well worth a visit.</p>\n<p>All of which takes us back to Purlie’s, and Ossie’s, final words:</p>\n<p><em>May the Constitution of the United States go with you; the Declaration of Independence stand by you; the Bill of Rights protect you; and the State Commission Against Discrimination keep the eyes of the law upon you, henceforth, now and forever. Amen.</em></p>\n<p>Amen is right.</p>\n<p><strong>Purlie Victorious: A Non-Confederate Romp Through the Cotton Patch opened September 27, 2023, at the Music Box Theatre and runs through February 4, 2024.

Photo credit: Marc J. Franklin</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Satire doesn’t always age particularly well. Fortunately, the new production of Ossie Davis’ 1961 play <em>Purlie Victorious</em> has sidestepped any issues about its being dated for two reasons, one good and one bad. The good is that director Kenny Leon has provided such a breakneck, well-staged rendition, superbly performed by its terrific ensemble, that the fun never lags. The bad is that the issues depicted in the play have lost little of their resonance even in these supposedly “post-racial” times. For evidence of the latter, simply look to the hysterical reaction from the audience to one character swinging a metal folding chair in menacing fashion (look up the meme online).</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that the production entirely succeeds in its wildly farcical depiction of a traveling preacher, the elegantly named Purlie Victorious Judson (Leslie Odom Jr.), who attempts to claim a $500 inheritance by duplicitous means in order to fund his dream of starting his own church. The humor leaps from broad to wildly over-the-top to mixed results, with not all of the gags landing. And some may have trouble with the “white savior” trope with which the proceedings are resolved, although it’s here employed so charmingly that it’s hard to resist.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/09/27/purlie-victorious-wickedly-funny-politically-provocative-antebellum-satire/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Set in “the recent past” in “the cotton plantation country of the Old South,” the play concerns Purlie’s return to his Georgia hometown with his loyal disciple Lutiebelle (Kara Young) in tow. Purlie intends for Lutiebelle to impersonate his late cousin to claim an inheritance due her from ’Ol Cap’n Cotchipee (Jay O. Sanders), the white racist owner of a plantation where Purlie’s brother Gitlow (Billy Eugene Jones) still works. Needless to say, many wacky complications ensue, especially when Cotchipee hands the money over to Lutiebelle and then demands her immediate arrest when she forgetfully signs her real name on the receipt.</p>\n<p>Director Leon, who seems wary of audience reaction to the play since he prefaces the evening with a taped introduction advising us to “lean into it,” keeps the production going at such a frenetic pace that the plot absurdities are easily overlooked. Sometimes, it’s <em>too</em> frenetic, with the performers, employing thick regional dialects, delivering their lines at such a rapid-fire pace that many of them are easily missed. But overall, it seems a sound approach, delivering the three-act play in an intermissionless 100 minutes that doesn’t give the audience time to catch its breath or mind the fact that they’re not watching a revival of the 1970 musical version <em>Purlie</em> instead.</p>\n<p>In the roles originally played by Davis and his wife Ruby Dee (which they repeated, along with most of the original cast, in the little-seen 1963 film adaptation <em>Gone Are the Days!</em>), Odom and Young are terrific. Odom, employing his natural charisma and gravitas, proves thoroughly convincing as a preacher who could easily spellbound his congregation. But it’s Young who proves the true revelation — not of her talent, which was obvious with her Tony nominated performances in <em>Cost of Living</em> and <em>Clyde’s</em>, but rather her comedy skills. Young goes for broke in the role, seeming almost like a marionette being manipulated by a maniacal puppeteer in her wildly physical performance that is matched only by her hilarious vocal intonations. She makes her innocent character so inherently adorable that she wins our hearts while stealing the production right out from under her co-star.</p>\n<p>But everyone in the ensemble shines, with the standouts including Billy Eugene Jones, garnering big laughs as Gitlow; Jay O. Sanders, bellowing hilariously as Ol’ Capn’, Noah Robbins, lovable as Ol’ Capn’s son Charlie, who doesn’t share his father’s racist views; and Vanessa Bell Calloway, endearing as Idella, who treats Charlie as if he was her very own.</p>\n<p>Derek McLane’s deceptively simple, wood-paneled set design proves versatile enough to convey several locales, beginning with an essentially bare stage to which the actors bring out various pieces of furniture, while Emilio Sosa’s homespun costumes perfectly suit the antebellum period.</p>\n<p><strong>Purlie Victorious: A Non-Confederate Romp Through the Cotton Patch opened September 27, 2023, at the Music Box Theatre and runs through February 4, 2024.

Photo credit: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Antonio Diaz, who performs under the stage name El Mago Pop, is one of the world’s most popular magicians. And he really, really, wants you to know it. The marquee of the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, where he’s currently performing his first Broadway engagement, features a laudatory quote from <em>Forbes</em> magazine — not one attesting to the magician’s brilliance or the spectacular qualities of his show, but rather “Highest-Grossing European Illusionist.” It&#8217;s hard to know who&#8217;s responsible for putting it there, his publicist or his accountant.</p>\n<p>The boastfulness of this Spanish illusionist doesn’t stop there. Magicians are not generally known for their modesty or bashfulness, but Diaz takes it to another level. Probably about 15 minutes of his roughly 70-minute performance — standard for a Vegas showroom, but awfully short for Broadway — is taken up with cheesy biographical videos attesting to his massive popularity and featuring his private plane with his name emblazoned on the side.</p>\n<p>We learn that he owns his own theater in Barcelona and that he’s just acquired a theater in Branson, Missouri that will be his U.S. base (joining the ranks of such esteemed international performers as Yakov Smirnov). The show’s <em>Playbill</em> includes a one-page description of his exploits, as well as another full-page bio which repeats much of the information. Yes, for all his international popularity Diaz is still largely unknown in America, despite some hit Netflix specials. But this feels less like an introduction than meeting a blind date who shows up with an entourage in tow.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/08/20/el-mago-pop-illusionist-antonio-diaz-has-the-magic-touch/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Diaz is 37-years-old, but seems much younger, coming across like an overgrown adolescent happily performing for his fellow middle-school students. His verbal patter, which can sometimes be hard to understand because of his ultra-fast delivery, heavy accent, and thin, reedy voice, bursts with pride and enthusiasm for the magic he’s showing you.</p>\n<p>His illusions lean toward the David Copperfield style, with large props and spectacular effects. He also does some close-up magic, such as card tricks that he performs in the aisles and that are shown in close-up on a large video screen. His sleight-of-hand capabilities are certainly impressive, as is his skill at juggling playing cards. (If you don’t think that’s difficult, try it.)</p>\n<p>He performs mind-reading tricks as well, similar in style to Israeli magician Asi Wind in his current hit off-Broadway show except with much more bombast. Some of Diaz’s illusions are extremely old-school, such as tearing up paper and reassembling it, but he gives it a neat theatrical touch by pretending to be in a film being shown in reverse.</p>\n<p>His heart, though, is in the large-scale illusions, including one in which he suddenly makes a helicopter appear onstage (someone should have told him that <em>Miss Saigon</em> beat him to the punch decades ago). He does some impressive aerial work with wires, flying around the stage as if auditioning for the next <em>Peter Pan</em> revival (he’s certainly got the boyish charm for it). But his principal trick, one which he performs in several variations, is to have one or more people, including himself, appear one moment in a large transparent cube and then suddenly reappear in another one across the stage. It’s a spectacular illusion, but one that wears thin with repetition.</p>\n<p>He performs with six extremely thin, agile assistants and, if my suspicions are correct, enough plants in the audience to fill an arboretum. The show features the sort of lavish video and projection effects suitable for Vegas, or in his case, Branson, and a suitably pseudo-hip soundtrack featuring the likes of Morrissey, Bowie, and Coldplay.</p>\n<p>Lacking the sort of self-conscious irony endemic to so many contemporary magic shows, <em>El Mago Pop</em> provides a reasonably entertaining magical diversion, especially for younger audiences who will best respond to Diaz’s boundless enthusiasm. More jaded viewers may come to resent the overblown and self-aggrandizing aspects of the production, which concludes a showering of so much confetti that you’ll probably be spending the next few hours removing the damn stuff from your clothing.</p>\n<p><strong>El Mago Pop opened August 20, 2023, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre and runs through August 27.

Photo: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s no illusion. Spain’s Antonio Díaz, who bills himself as an illusionist, has materialized at Broadway’s Ethel Barrymore Theatre under his other identifying moniker and the production’s title, <em>El Mago Pop</em>. After amassing a reputation as “the highest grossing European illusionist in the world and perennially Spain’s highest grossing performer across all art forms,” he’s on hand locally for just two weeks.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he’s already established himself stateside in Branson, Missouri with his Branson Magic Theater and with a pair of widely viewed Netflix shows (<em>Magic for Humans</em>, <em>La Gran Ilusión</em>), his Manhattan stay conforms to the decades-old illusion that as brief as a Great White Way residence might be, it guarantees that any individual or production succeeding in the exalted, yet limited acreage can now be considered a validated international commodity.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, the question instantly becomes: How successful is 37-year-old Antonio Díaz, who describes himself as a life-long David Copperfield devotee? The short answer is: He’s very successful. The longer answer is that, doing any number of card tricks (more about them later), his long suit is a boyish charm combined with an ostensible love for the illusions he creates. He also shows off a quick ad-lib wit, even more admirable in a fellow who says he’s only recently become comfortable speaking English.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/08/20/el-mago-pop-european-vegas-style-magic-on-broadway/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Illusions are often joked about as accomplished through a combination of smoke and mirrors. During the maybe 80, maybe 85 minutes Díaz works his sleight of hand, there isn’t much, if any, smoke, but it’s a good bet that at least a few mirrors are involved. Perhaps, perhaps not they come into play when, in his biggest illusion, he reveals from seemingly nowhere a sizable helicopter. (Yes, musical lovers, a helicopter usually appears in <em>Miss Saigon</em> outings, but that one clearly whirrs in from behind the proscenium.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truth to tell, Díaz’s illusions panoply isn’t what could be dubbed breathtakingly original. Maybe figuring out how each one is accomplished remains elusive, mysterious, but many of them, no matter how varied, have been presented before. For instance, two transparent containers arrive. Someone is placed in one, another in the other. Curtains are raised, then lowered, and, presto chango!, the someones are reversed. Then, the curtains again raised and lowered, the individuals are back where they started. Ooh, ahhh!</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Díaz, personable as he is, often likes to work small, which means he devotes his attention to vanishing and returning watches. At a different turn, he deals with an audience member’s driver’s license. Going on about not wanting to devote time to card tricks as too much of a cliché, he nevertheless devotes plenty of time to them.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At one point, he leaves the stage – something he does regularly – to stand by someone in an aisle seat and, after shuffling a deck like a Las Vegas poker maven, turns over one eye-popping card after another to, of course, the audience’s unmitigated astonishment. It’s a been-there-seen-that stunt that never fails.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Díaz is the unrivaled star of his burgeoning global enterprise, he hardly works alone. Throughout, he does things like toss a ball into the audience and has whoever catches it join him on stage.  No one at the performance I attended, young or young-at-heart, reacted with anything less that outright delight.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two sort-of-volunteers towards the end were blind-folded before being stood on one platform, then obscured by those ubiquitous black curtains, then showing up on an adjacent platform, then, the curtains raised and lowered, discovered back where they started. (The blindfolding requirement is probably explained by their being kept from observing the smoke and/or mirrors involved.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audience participants are, however, only a tiny fraction of the contingent supporting main attraction Díaz. Billed along with him are Carla Capellas, Jaume Gómez, Silvia Arocha, Paula Costa, Darwin Álvarez, and Lidia Checa, all of whom are likely sworn to secrecy about how the illusions are created. None of them accorded program bios, they’re not only incorporated in the illusions but are also busy running up and down aisles assisting whatever needs to be assisted.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another ultra-active staff member is a camera man. He’s constantly videoing Díaz during the intimate sequences so’s they can be projected on a lowered wide screen. Which brings up the many other industrious illusionists like director Mag Lari, who keeps things moving along jauntily. Graphic and video designer Pep Marti all but constantly fills the upstage screen with hot visuals, augmented by lighting designer Dani Bartomeu and sound designer Jordi Mateo. (The flames leaping on some of those projections may account for the smoke viewed.) Díaz and Justin Díaz are responsible for the apocalyptic music aimed at juicing up the excitement.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of aides on hand is nowhere disclosed about an extravagant entertainment that’s anything but a money-gobbling illusion. It’s all right out there. For a two-week run it could be that even a likely sell-out won’t cover the financing. This  goes toward further cementing Díaz’s name as the actual sought-after pay-off.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s got to be true of all, if not most, audience members that they don’t stop asking themselves and each other, “How does he do it?” Maybe every kind of way, but here’s one possible hint. Some of the surprises may be attained through the use of a soft blue light that permeates the auditorium for one astonishing illusion having to do with jellybean bottles. Lovely.</span></p>\n<p><strong>El Mago Pop opened August 20, 2023, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre and runs through August 27.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>How did you spend your summer vacation?</p>\n<p>Ian Shaw, as a four-year-old back in the summer of ’74, headed across the Atlantic to Martha’s Vineyard. His dad—the not-so-cuddly curmudgeon movie star Robert Shaw—was filming what turned out to be Steven Speilberg’s first blockbuster, <em>Jaws</em>. One of ten progeny of the hard-living and heavy-drinking Brit actor, it is unknown just how much time the lad spent observing dad and associates struggling with the recalcitrant mechanical shark (nicknamed “Bruce”). What is clear is that Ian has over the decades absorbed numerous tales of <em>Jaws </em>lore, to the point where he and collaborator Joseph Nixon have devised a three-men-on-a-boat entertainment called, pointedly and quite literally, <em>The Shark Is Broken</em>.</p>\n<p>A study not of movie-making but of sitting around waiting during the endless delays of movie-making, the play takes the act of watching celebrities acting badly offscreen (though <em>acting</em> epically heroically when the cameras rolled) to extremes. The participants are the mercurial elder Shaw, the most bankable of the three courtesy of prior starring roles in <em>The Sting</em> and <em>The Taking of Pelham One Two Three</em>; the relatively intellectual—or is it pedantic?—Roy Scheider, who had already made his mark in <em>The French Connection</em>; and the excessively neurotic, up-and-coming newcomer Richard Dreyfuss. The names have <em>not</em> been changed to protect the innocent. That said, countless actors have aspired, without success, to attain this level of celebrity.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/08/10/the-shark-is-broken-jaws-stars-square-off-for-fun-and-fishticuffs/\"><em>Read Bob Verini’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The younger Mr. Shaw, who is now older than his father was when he died in 1978 at the age of 51, has stepped into his father’s deck shoes. He is joined by actors Colin Donnell (partner to Sutton Foster in both <em>Anything Goes</em> and <em>Violet</em>), who has the mannerisms of the late Scheider down pat, and Alex Brightman (of <em>School of Rock</em> and <em>Beetlejuice</em>), who limns a supremely sharp sketch of an impossibly but believably annoying Dreyfuss. The two American actors, by now quite familiar for their Broadway musical appearances, offer exceptionally diverting caricatures.</p>\n<p>Director Guy Masterson’s production is deceptively simple, featuring just those three men on the boat. Or a partial, cutaway boat, placed in front of a curved cyclorama of endless ocean and sky, looking like a low-budget facsimile of the real thing (which, indeed, belies Dreyfuss’s kvetching that they should have just shot the film in a tank on the Universal lot). Designer Duncan Henderson, lighting designer Jon Clark, and video designer Nina Dunn have done a witty job of it, including an artfully flimsy-looking strip of “ocean” video lapping at the stage left bottom corner of the boat. Composer/sound designer Adam Cork is sure to throw in a bit of that instantly iconic deep-sea throbbing.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the actors wait day after day on the boat for the director, the crew, and the shark to get on with it. As the tongue-in-cheek authors have Scheider explain to Dreyfuss: “It’s not the time it takes to take the take that takes the time. It’s the time it takes between the takes that takes the time to take the take.”</p>\n<p>For those who’ve never seen <em>Jaws</em>, or are unfamiliar with the Shaw-Scheider-Dreyfuss trio—well, I suppose the proceedings might leave you at sea.</p>\n<p>At one point late in the proceedings, Brightman launches into a wickedly offhanded capsule impression of Scheider and Shaw; or is he doing <em>Donnell</em> as Scheider and <em>Shaw</em> as Shaw? Or is he mimicking <em>Dreyfuss</em> aping Scheider and Shaw; or maybe laying low Dreyfuss, Scheider, Shaw, Donnell, Ian Shaw, and <em>himself</em>?</p>\n<p>Whatever he’s doing, its mighty funny. As is the whole 95 minutes of three men—no, three actors with a broken mechanical shark—on a boat. All laughter, with no threat of a shark attack. ’Cause the shark is broken.</p>\n<p><strong>The Shark Is Broken opened August 10, 2023, at the John Golden Theatre and runs through November 19.

Photo by Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>From the moment you enter the John Golden Theater, <em>The Shark Is Broken </em>plunges you back to the summer of 1974, even if you weren’t alive at the time. A decrepit fishing boat, paint peeling and laden with junk, fills the stage against a video of the bobbing ocean projected on the giant cyclorama. And as the strains of The Rubettes (“Sugar Baby Love”) and Paper Lace (“The Night Chicago Died”) fill the playhouse, you realize with a huge smile that yes, that’s the Orca – that’s the vessel that sea dog Peter Quint sailed out of Amity Island armed with harpoons and hate. And this .…this is <em>Jaws.</em></p>\n<p>But of course it’s not <em>Jaws. </em>As they used to say about <em>Beatlemania, </em>it&#8217;s “an incredible simulation” that purports to take us behind the scenes of Steven Spielberg’s famously delayed, rewritten, and over-budget potboiler that, improbably, became an instant megahit.</p>\n<p>Events at the Martha’s Vineyard location are absurdly subject to the vagaries of star “Bruce,” the non-functional and phony-looking mechanical maneater of the play&#8217;s title. Stuck on the sidelines <em>No Exit </em>fashion, the human topliners kill their wait time in games, teasing, and gossip. They share apprehensions and confidences. And, oh yes, they drink their asses off, such that tempers constantly threaten to come to blows and often do. All in a day’s Hollywood work.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/08/10/the-shark-is-broken-the-greatest-fish-story-never-told/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>It’s all very “in,” with airy references to “Steven” and “Gottlieb” (co-screenwriter Carl) and assorted musings about the acting trade. But none of it would matter if we resisted accepting Ian Shaw, Alex Brightman, and Colin Donnell as, respectively, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, and Roy Scheider.</p>\n<p>Happily, they all succeed in spades. Young Shaw, who with Joseph Nixon co-wrote the play for premieres in Brighton and the Edinburgh Fringe, is (as widely publicized) his carousing, melancholy dad to the life. The lurching walk, the gravelly growl, the sinister grin, the hands that look like they could tear a co-star in two, elicit gasps throughout, and all of that astonishment is earned.</p>\n<p>No less amazing is Brightman’s evocation of Dreyfuss at his most angsty: bearded and bespectacled, cursed with restless-leg syndrome that bespeaks restless-actor syndrome. He prowls the deck fueled by resentment and ego, alternately boasting of his career prospects and paralyzed by fear of failure. Brightman’s impressive past work in <em>School of Rock</em> and <em>Beetlejuice</em> did not, I confess, prepare me for the poignancy of this performance. Meanwhile, Donnell has fewer quirks to work with as the bookish Scheider, but succeeds in conveying the actor’s quiet strength and wry common sense.</p>\n<p>Further praise ought to begin with director Guy Masterson’s deft modulations of rhythm to mimic the boredom of moviemaking without boredom’s infecting those of us watching it. The Orca&#8217;s amusing authenticity is the work of Duncan Henderson, while Nina Dunn created the varied projections of the Atlantic that can actually make you feel a little seasick from time to time. Jon Clark’s lighting design, and Adam Cork’s sound and original music (almost-but-not-quite John Williams’s unforgettable theme) also make notable contributions to the passage of time and mood.</p>\n<p>A through-line involves each man’s knotty father issues, given extra weight because we know our co-author was one of nine (eventually 10) kids of the man he’s portraying. Still more seriousness comes out of Quint&#8217;s speech about surviving the U.S.S. <em style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Indianapolis</em> tragedy, unquestionably the film&#8217;s human high point. On the lighter side, Shaw and Nixon take advantage of plenty of 20/20 hindsight, as when Shaw gloomily predicts their epic will be a turkey, or when Scheider comments on Richard Nixon’s Watergate woes to predict “There will never be a more immoral president than Tricky Dicky.” (Knowing laughter both times.)</p>\n<p>In the end, though, the comfort that <em>The Shark Is Broken </em>brings, and it truly is a most enjoyable 95 minutes, stems from the canny way in which it channels <em>Jaws</em> itself. The play’s version of Robert Shaw, when you come right down to it, <em>is</em> Peter Quint, the grizzled veteran baiting and blasting the young whippersnapper whom you can call Dreyfuss or Matt Hooper, it’s all the same. Meanwhile bemused, decent Roy “Chief Brody” Scheider attempts to make peace between mercurial shipmates as he decides on the next fateful phase of his career.</p>\n<p>Watching <em>The Shark Is Broken</em>, then, is not unlike diving into a boatload of outtakes from a beloved classic. If you’re anything like me, you eat it up like it’s popcorn.</p>\n<p><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">The Shark Is Broken </b><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">opened August 10, 2023, at the John Golden Theatre and runs through November 19.

Photo: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em><br />\nBack to the Future</em>, the latest blockbuster motion picture to be transferred to the stage, is most happily ensconced at the Winter Garden. Now and forever, or at least presumably through the end of the decade.</p>\n<p>Funny, thrill-filled, and overflowing with song and dance—although the former is more loud than melodic, the latter more busy than beat-worthy—<em>Back to the Future</em> is sure to draw an enthusiastically eager audience from the myriad throngs schooled in the 1985 film. Many of whom know the jokes by heart, wait expectantly for the favorite sight gags, and will sit agape at the theatrical special effects. Bookwriter Bob Gale, who wrote the screenplay; director John Rando, of <em>Urinetown</em> and the recent <em>On the Town</em>; and most crucially actors Roger Bart (a veteran scene stealer) and Casey Likes (a newly minted scene stealer)—all of them seem to know precisely what to do. They do it, offering a reasonably close facsimile of the original film experience.</p>\n<p>For those who grew up in the pre-DVD/cable/streaming world and thus might not have <em>Back to the Future</em> (and sequels <em>Back to the Future II</em> and <em>Back to the Future III</em>) engrained in memory, the time is 1985. Marty McFly (Likes) is a 17-year old slacker, doomed to repeat the lackluster life of his dead-end parents: mother Lorraine (Liana Hunt), who perennially clutches a liter of cheap vodka, and chronically unassertive father George (Hugh Coles), who flinches and cowers at the every move of local bully Biff Tannen (Nathaniel Hackman).</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/08/03/back-to-the-future-a-sensory-assault-with-songs/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em> ★★☆☆☆ </a><em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/08/03/back-to-the-future-a-sensory-assault-with-songs/\">review here</a>.</em>]</p>\n<p>Marty’s only confidant seems to be the local mad professor, old Doc Brown (Bart), whose time-travel invention sends Marty back to 1955. To the date in 1955, specifically, when his parents first kissed in their small-town USA village of Hill Valley, California. Which gives Marty the chance to not exactly change history, but to fix up a detail or two before returning back to—well, back to the future of 1985.</p>\n<p>Doc Brown’s masterpiece is a souped-up DeLorean outfitted with a magical “flux capacitator.” This was an ultra-luxe sports car built by a fellow named John DeLorean, which came to market in 1981 and flopped spectacularly in 1983. Thus, the inclusion of a DeLorean was a topical joke at the time, although it turns out to have immortalized the irretrievably bankrupt DeLorean brand.</p>\n<p>The new musical import from London is built around the spectacle of that flying DeLorean; or at least, I imagine the show would be just another mediocre effort <em>without</em> the spectacular flying machine. The prop car, built by a company called Twins FX, turbocharges the audience at least four times, and deserves the waves of applause it garners.</p>\n<p>Which leads us, inevitably, to items of lesser importance like book, music, lyrics, et al. Gale, who wrote the screenplay with Robert Zemeckis (director of the original film and one of numerous coproducers of the musical), has done a respectable job of adapting it to the stage. All the film highlights seem to be here, which is to the good. As for the score by Alan Silvestri (composer of the film) and Glen Ballard (composer/lyricist of that excessively bland <em>Ghost</em> musical that visited the Lunt in 2012), let’s just say that it gets by; this is one of those shows with the music so brutally amplified as to make the words often impossible to comprehend. Why is it, though, that when Bart starts singing his first number, “It Works,” we can suddenly understand every crisply precise word? Perhaps because the lyrics to this song sit well on the music; the orchestrators let the singer handle the melody; and Bart is mighty good.</p>\n<p>Several scenes later, Coles—as Marty’s ineffectual father transformed into the teenager he was in 1955—has a ditty which goes “My myopia is my Utopia and I’m hopin’ ya feel it too.” While this would not turn the late and revered Sheldon Harnick green with envy, it suggests that at least one of the songwriters does have a musical comedy point of view.</p>\n<p>After another lull of small-town teenage machinations, the proceedings are suddenly jolted from auto-pilot by an honest-to-goodness musical comedy production number. Not only tuneful and melodic, but with actual words that fit the awkwardness of the situation. The teenaged Lorraine, who in this science fiction romp is Marty’s mother 13 years before he’s born, is unwittingly flirting with the time-travelling Marty, a.k.a. Calvin Klein (don’t ask, but it’s one of the film’s wisest jokes). She stops dead in her tracks when she suddenly realizes that, well, there’s “Something About That Boy.” She is joined by the other girls, and then by everyone, the number building—like a Broadway showstopper ought to—to such high velocity that they drop the act curtain on a frenzied ensemble and an almost equally energized audience.</p>\n<p>The intermission gives the cast time to regroup, as well as the producers time to sell a full line of <em>Back to the Future</em> merchandise. Marketing tip: You will sell far more t-shirts and hats and posters and paraphernalia if you send the ticketbuyers out at halftime all revved up. Me, I took the time to thumb through the <em>Playbill</em> bios in search of the the credits of the designer, only to first land on the extensive bio of the “Ticketing and Revenue Director.” So much for “Who’s Who in the Cast.”</p>\n<p>From “Something About That Boy” on, <em>Back to the Future</em> is more or less as joyful and funny as the creators intended—which is something we can’t quite say for most of the first act. But we’re putting the horse before the cart, or the flux capacitor before the lithium boost that sends that flying DeLorean soaring not only back to the future but out over the heads of the folks in the front of the house. Can’t you just hear the shill of the marketers hawking “premium seats”?</p>\n<p>The flying car isn’t the show’s only asset, not when you’ve got Bart and Likes clowning for your own personal pleasure. Bart has done it before, again and again, in <em>You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown</em>, <em>The Producers</em>, and <em>Young Frankenstein</em>. Here he holds the audience captive as if his workshop tools include a cone of hilarity. (Is he surreptitiously channeling forgotten comedian Red Skelton, pursing his lips over a recessed chin and offering tell-tale cross-eyed takes?)</p>\n<p>As for the 21-year-old Likes, <em>Back to the Future</em> is a case of getting what you deserve: a starring role in a new Broadway musical hit. Quickly, too. He was the only compelling reason to see last November’s <em>Almost Famous</em>. Everything about his performance screamed, “Give this kid his break!” Now he has it, and he manages to drive the <em>Back to the Future</em> musical in much the same way that young Michael J. Fox did the film back in 1985.</p>\n<p>As if two outlandish star comedy performances are not enough, British import Cole—as Marty’s father, George McFly—runs a close third. The fellow vibrates in place as if he has kinetic rubber bands for limbs, anchored to the ground by invisible gravity boots. Otherwise, highest praise goes to designer Tim Hatley (most recently here with <em>Life of Pi</em>), lighting designers Tim Lutkin and Hugh Vanstone, video designer Finn Ross, and illusion designer Chris Fisher. Along with lead producer Colin Ingram, who paid for it all.</p>\n<p>So what if certain element of the well-made musical comedy are conspicuously lacking in <em>Back to the Future</em>? When the DeLorean takes off, revs up, and flies through the Winter Garden with soaring sound and neon-streaked side walls, the producers—and the audience—get what they paid for.</p>\n<p><strong>Back to the Future opened August 3, 2023, at the Winter Garden Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For years, theater fans have been lamenting the &#8220;Disneyfication&#8221; of Broadway, but that term isn&#8217;t quite fair to Disney. In truth, a whole cabal of studios and abetting producers enabled the trend in blockbuster movies being converted into flashy musical spectacles. Sometimes the latter can be fun and even stylish, if you can look and listen past the generally unsurprising storylines and usually lackluster original scores.</p>\n<p>Then there are shows like <em>Back to the Future: The Musical</em>, whose title is something of a misnomer: This adaptation of the Universal Pictures/Amblin Entertainment hit about a teenager who finds himself bounced back from 1985 to 1955 is less a musical than a two-and-a-half-hour theme park ride with songs, offering as much sensory overload as an afternoon at Magic Kingdom.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the warnings that can accompany splashily high-tech productions, to pregnant women and theatergoers prone to migraines and seizures, should have been emblazoned on the playbill cover in this case. Strobe lights and other visual shenanigans, from Finn Ross&#8217;s dizzying video design to a flying car, are just the beginning; for me, the auditory assaults leveled by sound designer Gareth Owen (in conjunction with musical supervisor Nick Finlow and music director Ted Arthur, I assume) hit the hardest. Before the first act was even half over, I had crafted makeshift earplugs out of tissue paper, a trick I typically reserve for the loudest rock concerts.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/08/03/back-to-the-future-back-to-musical-comedy-with-plutonium-packed-thrills/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★☆ </a><em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/08/03/back-to-the-future-back-to-musical-comedy-with-plutonium-packed-thrills/\">review here</a>.</em>]</p>\n<p>But perhaps that&#8217;s the vibe this <em>Back to the Future</em>&#8216;s creators, among them original co-screenwriter Bob Gale, were going for. The film showcased two songs by Huey Lewis and the News—hardly headbangers, to be fair—including the chart-topping &#8220;The Power of Love&#8221;; both tunes are featured in the stage incarnation, along with early rock classics &#8220;Johnny B. Goode&#8221; and &#8220;Earth Angel,&#8221; which were also included on the soundtrack.</p>\n<p>Excerpts from Alan Silvestri&#8217;s film score are inserted into the action, and Silvestri and pop veteran Glen Ballard—best known by rock and Broadway fans for his contributions to Alanis Morissette&#8217;s <em>Jagged Little Pill</em>, the album and musical (though he also co-wrote the score for <em>Ghost: The Musical</em> and has songs featured in <em>MJ The Musical</em>)—have crafted a bunch of turbo-charged tunes that are memorable mostly for the affable banality of their lyrics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now the walls just keep closing in/And I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll ever win,” sings our hero, Marty McFly, played by an agreeable Casey Likes, who made his Broadway bow last year in a similar role—yearning teenager thrust into extraordinary adventure—in another musical adaptation of a hit film, <em>Almost Famous</em>. Marty&#8217;s mom, whom he will awkwardly encounter as a nubile beauty in the &#8217;50s, is portrayed by a winsome Liana Hunt, who gets to croon, in the same song, &#8220;You look around/And you start to see/That you&#8217;re living out your fantasy/It starts to feel like destiny/Like it&#8217;s meant to be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hugh Coles steals a scene or two as Marty&#8217;s dad, an über-nerd who has his own solo number, with the following chorus: &#8220;My myopia/Is my utopia/And I&#8217;m hoping you’re feeling it/See how I&#8217;m dealing with it/I&#8217;m hoping you’re feeling it too.&#8221; Who says they don’t write &#8217;em like they used to?</p>\n<p>The role of Doc Brown, the freaky scientist whose experiments accidentally hurl Marty back in time, is played by Roger Bart, whose considerable comedic gifts enhanced the 1999 revival of <em>You&#8217;re A Good Man, Charlie Brown</em> and the original production of <em>The Producers</em>, among other shows. Here Bart is pretty much relegated to reproducing the kind of shtick that got Christopher Lloyd, who was Doc to Michael J. Fox&#8217;s Marty on screen, laughs, with director John Rando gamely milking each exchange.</p>\n<p>At the preview of <em>Back to the Future</em> I attended, in fact, audience members reserved their greatest enthusiasm for references to the film and special effects, though not necessarily in that order. Towards the end, a character called Uncle Huey materializes, a nod to Lewis&#8217;s cameo in the movie—which is readily available on streaming outlets, for a tiny fraction of the cost of a Broadway ticket. A day pass to Six Flags Great Adventure might also prove a better bargain.</p>\n<p><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Back to the Future </b><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">opened August 3, 2023, at the Winter Garden Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If you see <em>The Cottage</em>, Sandy Rustin’s breezy 1920s-set summer sex romp at the Hayes Theater, be sure to get a good look at the curtain. At first glance, it seems like a painterly rendition of a serene English countryside scene, with a picturesque cottage framed by throngs of wildflowers. But between the blossoms and butterflies you’ll find a pair of humping squirrels, as well as a couple of deer caught in the act. And don’t miss the bra hanging over a tree branch. If that’s what’s happening outside, what the devil is happening inside?</p>\n<p>For starters, adultery. But the well-behaved, aren’t-we-civilized kind of adultery. One may be cheating on one’s wife with one’s sister-in-law—as Beau (<em>Will &amp; Grace</em> star Eric McCormack) is doing to his wife, Marjorie (<em>POTUS</em> and <em>Tootsie</em>’s Lilli Cooper), with Sylvia (Laura Bell Bundy)—but that’s no reason to be rude. “Would you care for a cup of tea?” Beau offers Marjorie, who’s arrived at the love nest unannounced. Naturally Marjorie accepts. She even compliments Sylvia’s negligée…as does Sylvia’s husband, Clarke (<em>SNL</em>’s Alex Moffatt), after he stops to admire his brother’s Chinese silk robe. (“I didn’t see any robes like that when I was in China,” Clarke comments. “Well, next time you go I’ll give you the name of the tailor,” Beau replies.) It’s all extremely polite and refined—even when Clarke and Marjorie declare that they’re in love, they’ve been sneaking away for seven years, and that Clarke is the father of Marjorie’s soon-to-be-born baby. At that point, everyone chucks the tea and switches to scotch.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/07/24/the-cottage-a-new-sex-farce-that-already-feels-dated/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ </a><em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/07/24/the-cottage-a-new-sex-farce-that-already-feels-dated/\">review here</a>.</em>]</p>\n<p>And we haven’t even met Dierdre (Dana Steingold), Beau’s lover; she’s just divorced her husband, Richard (Nehal Joshi), and he might be unstable and homicidal and on the next train. “Ooh, what a lovely robe!” she coos. Since we’re doling out compliments, it <em>is</em> a lovely robe, and Bundy is wearing a beautiful negligee. Also, the apple-green openwork dress she wears in anticipation of their mass murders is stunning. Pity that Cooper is saddled with such an unflattering wig and dowdy dress. (Pregnancy <em>can</em> be glamorous, people. Have we learned nothing from Rihanna?) As for the cottage itself, Paul Tate dePoo III has designed a handsomely appointed den of iniquity, full of rich brocades, satins, and velvets. Plus: It’s full of hiding places for cigarettes and lighters—one of the play’s running gags. The flip-top wooden bannisters on the staircase—smokes on one side, lighter on the other—are especially clever. The mini statue of David, with the cigs in the base and a removable tiny penis lighter, might be the best smoke spot; credit the crafty Rustin for that one (it&#8217;s detailed in the script).</p>\n<p><em>The Cottage</em> is at its best when at its lightest. A few philosophical tangents—Dierdre and Sylvia discussing “varying degrees” of love, Beau and Marjorie debating the merits of marriage (Beau: “In my opinion, faithfulness is an entirely separate matter from marriage”)—drag down the otherwise snap-crackle pace that director Jason Alexander (of TV’s <em>Seinfeld</em>) has established. And the intermission takes a bit of air out of the proceedings.</p>\n<p>McCormack—who’s got kind of an Errol Flynn thing happening—proves the perfect dashing, slightly dastardly leading man. And Bundy couldn’t be better as Sylvia. (Omigod you guys—has it really been 15 years since her last Broadway appearance, as Elle Woods in <em>Legally Blonde</em>?) At first, Sylvia might appear to be just the mistress (with Beau), or just the wife (with Clark), or just the spurned lover (again, with Beau); but in the end she turns out to be the smartest one in the room. “Perhaps you don’t need a man,” she muses. She’s talking to Dierdre, and naturally everyone on stage gasps <em>very theatrically</em>. But perhaps Sylvia is right.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Cottage</em></strong><strong> opened July 24, 2023, at the Hayes Theater and runs through Oct. 29.

Photo credit: Joan Marcus.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Listen, I enjoy the plays of Noel Coward as much as the next Anglophile. Who could fail to appreciate the rapier wit, the keen insight into human behavior, and the sheer silliness of such great comedies as <em>Private Lives</em>, <em>Present Laughter</em>, and <em>Blithe Spirit</em>, among others. But never once while watching a production of a classic Coward play have I thought that it would be more fun to watch a pastiche, however well executed.</p>\n<p>That, unfortunately, is what we now have in the form of <em>The Cottage</em>, a play by Sandy Rustin that has been kicking around for more than a decade (it was presented at the Queens Theater in the Park in 2014). For some reason, a gaggle of producers have decided that this wholly artificial sex farce, one that would have seemed dated in the 1950s, now merits a Broadway run. At least they had the good sense to recruit a talented director, Jason Alexander, and a first-rate cast to give the farcical proceedings an expertly orchestrated, slick comic sheen.</p>\n<p>Taking place in a country home in an English village in 1923 (Paul Tate dePoo III’s gorgeous set design seems designed for Instagram), the play concerns the adulterous goings-on amongst a group of British upper-crust types, including well-heeled barrister Beau (<em>Will and Grace</em>’s Eric McCormack) and Sylvia (Laura Bell Bundy, making a much too belated Broadway return fifteen years after <em>Legally Blonde</em>). The pair are enjoying their once-a-year assignation at the cottage when Sylvia tells her lover that she has sent a telegram to both his wife Marjorie (Lilli Cooper, <em>Tootsie</em>) and her husband Clarke (<em>SNL</em>’s Alex Moffat, making a terrific Broadway debut), who happens to be Beau’s brother, informing them of the affair.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/07/24/the-cottage-a-midsummer-nights-frolic/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆ </a><em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/07/24/the-cottage-a-midsummer-nights-frolic/\">review here</a>.</em>]</p>\n<p>Not long afterward, both the heavily pregnant Marjorie and Clarke show up at the cottage to confront their errant spouses, with some predictable and some not-so-predictable wacky complications ensuing. Arriving later are Dierde (Dana Steingold), Beau’s <em>other</em> lover, and Richard (Nehal Joshi), who turns out to be…well, no spoilers here.</p>\n<p>The plot, not surprisingly, turns out to be wholly subordinate to the profusion of one-liners (delivered in the sort of over-the-top British accents letting us know not to take anything seriously) and often delicious sight gags, many of the latter revolving around a series of hidden cigarettes and lighters strewn throughout the cottage. There are so many hilarious visual jokes revolving around silly objects (McCormack carrying a stuffed porcupine made me laugh out loud) that the prop master should be billed above the title.</p>\n<p>To be fair<em>, The Cottage</em> is funny, often very funny. Under Alexander’s razor-sharp direction (having worked with Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David for so many years, he knows what he’s doing), the ensemble performs with the superb comic timing and delivery of seasoned vaudevillians. Moffat excels at outrageous physical shtick, Steingold does a great drunk act, McCormack executes pitch-perfect slow burns, Bundy gets laughs with practically everything she says and does, and so on. The humor is often far from sophisticated, with one of the highlights being an extended fart joke that would make Mel Brooks blanch and that you certainly wouldn’t encounter in a Noel Coward play.</p>\n<p>But the humor is so devoid of reality that the laughs become increasingly strained. The plot twists have little impact since we’re so little invested in the characters or situations, and with its two-hour running time the evening has the feel of an elongated Carol Burnett Show sketch (Harvey Korman and Burnett would have made a great Beau and Sylvia, with Tim Conway as Clarke and Vicki Lawrence as the pregnant Marjorie. But it would have been 8-10 minutes, tops). It’s hard to see exactly who <em>The Cottage</em> is <em>for</em>, since even a first-class Coward revival would have a tough go of it on Broadway without major star power. It’s a play whose ideal audiences have by now passed on to become blithe spirits themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>The Cottage opened July 24, 2023, at the Helen Hayes Theatre and runs through October 29.

Photo: Billy Bustamante, Matthew Murphy, and Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>There’s a moment in <em>Here Lies Love</em>—the David Byrne–Fatboy Slim disco musical chronicling the rise and fall of famed Filipina former first lady Imelda Marcos—when you inevitably find yourself dancing right along with the infamous politician. You might be jumping up and down; you might just be swaying your shoulders or tapping your toes. But at some point, you realize that <em>dammit!</em> You’ve fallen under her spell.</p>\n<p>“Talk a bit, a little dance, Champagne on ice,” sings Imelda (played by Arielle Jacobs with just the right blend of style, sophistication, and edge) solicitously. “An hour or two—relationship— We’re friends for life!” This is how she charmed and captivated not only the public but also world leaders such as Mao Zedong, aka Chairman Mao, and President Ronald Reagan—a strategic alliance, as he helped her, her husband, and their entourage flee the Philippines in 1986 after the People Power Revolution.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/07/20/here-lies-love-innovatively-immersive-musical-retains-disco-sheen-mostly/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em><em> </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here</em><em>.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Don’t be alarmed when you start to sympathize with the so-called Muse of Manila. That’s the genius of <em>Here Lies Love</em>, which premiered in a much more intimate production at the Public Theater in 2013. The Alex Timbers-directed extravaganza—and who knows extravaganzas better than Timbers, a Tony winner for the deliriously over-the-top <em>Moulin Rouge</em>—is meant to mesmerize at every turn, from the minute you enter the radically reworked Broadway Theatre, which now recalls a ready-to-rave industrial-style multilevel movable nightclub thanks to David Korins’ massive redesign. Peter Nigrini’s psychedelic projections, which frequently morph into historical photos of Imelda, surround you on all sides.</p>\n<p>So yes, when young Imelda, “a simple country girl who has a dream,” walks out in her sweet Swiss dot white dress, she easily wins our hearts in the beautifully melodic title song. “No clothes, no bed, no jewelry/ Sometimes I had no shoes,” she sings, and that’s the only reference the musical makes to shoes. (Byrne notes that most of the lyrics come from original sources.) We meet her super-charismatic onetime sweetheart—peep the photobooth pics on the digital screens!—and future political foe Ninoy Aquino (scene-stealer Conrad Ricamora, who made a splash in the last summer’s gay romcom <em>Fire Island</em>) in the bouncy “Child of the Philippines.” His ooh-ooh backup singers wear buttoned-up white shirts, black ties, and dark black glasses, just like Aquino—a wonderful touch by costume designer Clint Ramos, also one of the lead producers. Even future despot Ferdinand Marcos (Jose Llana, like Ricamora, reprising his Public Theater role)—who weds Imelda after an 11-day whirlwind romance—makes a good first impression. He’s savvy enough to know he needs her to win his bid for the presidency; he refers to the two of them as “the king and the queen of hearts” in the anthem-style song “A Perfect Hand.”</p>\n<p>But <em>Here Lies Love</em> is no snow job: By no means does it celebrate Imelda’s excess, which came at the expense of the public; immediately following “Dancing Together,” which takes us to one of her favorite former haunts, Studio 54—lamé and sequins and feathers, oh my!—Aquino steps up to slam “the parties and extravagance,” and rallies the crowd to “rise up.” Eventually, he’s imprisoned for seven years; after a period of exile in America, he returns to his home country and is shot at the airport. His funeral procession, the stirring “Just Ask the Flowers,” is led by his mother, Aurora (Filipina superstar, and <em>HLL</em> producer, Lea Salonga, in the role through Aug. 13). Imelda’s response—which she begins while Aurora is frozen, her thumb and index finger forming an L, meaning <em>laban</em>, or fight—couldn’t be more self-indulgent: “Why Don’t You Love Me?,” is sung <em>Evita</em>-style, on a balcony, while wearing a stunning white terno (one of her signature butterfly-sleeved gowns).</p>\n<p>The show is absolutely an indictment of the autocratic Marcos administration—which, during nearly a decade of martial law, silenced the free press, dissolved Congress and the supreme court, and incarcerated 70,000, tortured 35,000, and killed 3,200. It’s also a cautionary tale: Her son, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., is the current president of the Philippines. When DJ Moses Villarama makes that announcement, you can hear the crowd collectively sigh.</p>\n<p>A note about seating: You have a choice of standing on the dance floor, which means you’ll be moving around throughout the 90-minute show; sitting alongside or just above the floor; or sitting in traditional theater-style mezzanine seats. If you really want to immerse yourself in Imelda’s world, go for the floor. You might find yourself shaking hands with the candidates on the campaign trail, joining in a line dance, or even holding up your own <em>laban</em> sign.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Here Lies Love</em> opened July 20, 2023, at the Broadway Theatre: Tickets and information: <em><a href=\"https://herelieslovebroadway.com/\">herelieslovebroadway.com</a></em></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Billy Bustamante, Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Several questions confront those of us who, precisely ten years ago, were held spellbound by the David Byrne-Fatboy Slim musical <em>Here Lies Love</em> at the Public Theater. Does the experience remain irrepressibly vibrant? Does the writing retain its provocatively gripping power? Does the kinetic jolt of the staging, conceived for an intimate ballroom-like space, dissipate when the cast is redirected to play to the folks in the upper reaches of one of Broadway’s largest houses?</p>\n<p>The answers to these questions are… yes, kind of.</p>\n<p>The vast array of inventive vibrancy is still there to be seen and felt. But while the 2013 <em>Here Lies Love </em>sent you bursting onto Astor Place eager to spread the word and plot a return visit, the level of excitement of those now experiencing the show for the first time, at the Broadway Theatre, is less predictable.</p>\n<p>If we must wager a guess, it would be that those watching from the stage floor will experience the thrill of the original conception. As for those sitting outside the action, in what remains of the Broadway Theatre’s vast auditorium? Let’s just say that they might feel not only removed from the stage, but removed from the euphoric <em>Here Lies Love</em> experience as well.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/07/20/here-lies-love-its-a-vibe/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The authors weave a tale of politics, power, and corruption, which is admittedly not all that new if you know your Shakespeare or, even <em>Evita</em>. Imelda, a poor girl from the slums, captures the eye of up-and-coming politician Ferdinand Marcos; marries him; becomes a world celebrity while her husband oppresses the people; and doesn’t live happily ever after. This is, in some ways, a direct variation of <em>Evita</em>, with the names changed and Buenos Aires displaced by Manila. That said, <em>Here Lies Love</em> is more vibrantly told; the creators of <em>Evita</em> worked within the traditions of the Broadway/West End musical of 50 years ago, while Byrne and Slim seem to have made their own rules and set the metronome to a very much contemporary beat.</p>\n<p>The authors were most fortunate in the selection of their director and overall artistic overseer. Alex Timbers came to prominence with the 2010 <em>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</em>, which translated poorly in its Broadway transfer; and the 2011 <em>Peter and the Starcatcher</em>, which managed to retain its magic upon its uptown move. Timbers also directed the musical juggernaut <em>Moulin Rouge!</em>, but that came five years after the original <em>Here Lies Love</em> opened in 2013.</p>\n<p>The stage magic here comes not only from Timbers but from his production team. The director, choreographer Annie-B Parson, and scenic designer David Korins have placed their show within a compact rectangular space. The original concept was for the audience to watch not from traditional rows of traditional theater seats, but while standing within the action. The actors bustle through, with well-trained jump-suited technicians shuttling both cast and patrons from the path of danger (i.e., moving platforms and scenery) as if the whole place were an airport runway decked with boughs of disco balls. When the Marcos government is toppled in the People Power Revolution, you might well feel the crush of the crowd while helicopters hover above.</p>\n<p>Uptown, Timbers’ design team has been given free reign and full budget. The lighting by Justin Townsend, the projections by Peter Nigrini, and the sound by M.L. Dogg and Cody Spencer do not simply enhance the show: they <em>are</em> the show. As for costume designer Clint Ramos, his altogether splendid costumes from downtown seem to have been recreated with unlimited funds, with results which are even more fancifully delectable.</p>\n<p>If only everything were so easy. Following the extended limited engagement in 2013, the Public management attempted to transfer the show to a larger space where it could work both artistically and commercially. Unable to find such a venue, they instead remounted <em>Here Lies Love</em> as a commercial production in the original space at the Public. The limited seating capacity—or, rather, standing capacity—could not begin to support the costs.</p>\n<p>In the interim, a new team of producers—I count 59 names and producing entities above the title, in understandably small print—formed to bring this Must-See-Musical back to town. They have done so by replacing the main floor at the Broadway with a replica of the Public Theater playing space, complete with the two rows of seats overlooking the dance floor from the sidelines. But the actual seating area at the Broadway—23rows, encompassing the house’s existing front and rear mezzanines—is very much <em>not</em> part of the action. The staging has been adjusted so that sections of the show are played towards the mezz, instead of inward to those lucky folk on the stage floor; and several platforms have been added to the upper reaches, where dancers occasionally dance in an attempt to bring at least some of the action to the people.</p>\n<p>But <em>Here Lies Love</em> is conceived around the notion of immersive audience involvement. How that applies to the 500 seats up there is hard to say, but it is likely not what Byrne and Slim and Timbers had in mind.</p>\n<p>(Historical note: this is at least the third time that the Broadway—which opened as a vast, first-run movie house—has been torn apart to fit a non-traditional staging. The first two, <em>Dude</em> in 1972 and <em>Candide</em> in 1974, did not work out so well.)</p>\n<p>High among the joys of the evening is the work of the highly talented, ever-present, and perpetually propelled cast. The piece—like <em>Evita</em>—is devised around three principal roles, and there are three dynamic players on view. Jose Llana has been giving standout performances since he first appeared in 1996 as a teen-aged Lun Tha in the Donna Murphy <em>King and I</em>; among the numerous highlights of his career were Chip Tolentino, the candy-selling contestant in <em>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</em>, and a replacement stint as the King in the 2015 Lincoln Center <em>King and I</em>. As convincing as his Marcos was ten years ago at the Public, Llana’s performance is now even more compelling. Conrad Ricamora—who followed <em>Here Lies Love</em> by playing Lun Tha in that Lincoln Center <em>King and I</em>—also brings added resonance to his performance as political contender Ninoy Aquino.</p>\n<p>Raising the roof of the Broadway, in the brief role of Aquino’s grieving mother, is Lea Salonga—who regularly raised said roof back during the first year of the Broadway run of <em>Miss Saigon</em>. Salonga, the eighth-named of those five dozen producers, has stepped in for what has been announced as the first month of the run, through August 13. To say that her performance of “Just Ask the Flowers” is the high point of the evening is to inadvertently address the weak spot of this production.</p>\n<p>Ruthie Ann Miles, a veritable newcomer back in 2013, gave one of the most memorable performances of the decade when she portrayed Imelda in the original production of <em>Here Lies Love</em>. The fact that we are highlighting Llana and Ricamora, and even Lea Salonga, points to the lack of dynamism of the present Imelda. Arielle Jacobs, a replacement in the Broadway companies of <em>Aladdin</em> and <em>Wicked</em>, is fine in the central role in <em>Here Lies Love</em>. But fine, alas, is not always enough. Watching Salonga up there setting fire to the place within the first refrain of her one song, we could only wonder what she could do if she were standing in Imelda’s shoes. If you know what I mean.</p>\n<p>The original <em>Here Lies Love</em> was one of those brilliantly unconventional non-Broadway musicals which—like <em>Fun Home</em>, <em>Hamilton</em>, and <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> before it—numerous viewers found far better, and infinitely more exciting, than the Tony-eligible Broadway musicals of their respective seasons. <em>Fun Home</em>, <em>Hamilton</em>, and <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> retained and even expanded their power once they worked their way to Broadway, each of them playing a significant part in changing the trajectory of the Broadway musical (and no, I’m not overstating this).</p>\n<p><em>Here Lies Love</em> remains an impressive and effective experience; but uptown on Broadway, at the over-sized Broadway, the bloom is off the rose of Tacloban (to borrow the title of Imelda’s opening number). Regretfully, we conclude that the uptown edition—as of the official opening—is not yet quite so powerful as what enthralled us, three times, down on Astor Place.</p>\n<p><strong>Here Lies Love opened July 20, 2023, at the Broadway Theatre.

Photo credit: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As a general rule, I would advise someone whose birth name is David Yosef Shimon ben Elazar Reuven HaLevi and who studied at a yeshiva to probably avoid attending a meeting of white nationalists. It just doesn’t seem like the best idea.</p>\n<p>That is, unless his current name is Alex Edelman, he’s a comedian, and he’s looking for new material. Then I would say go for it, especially if the result is a solo show as consistently uproarious as <em>Just for Us</em>, which has just landed on Broadway after several previous engagements in smaller NYC theaters and in such cities as London, Edinburgh, Melbourne, Boston, and Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>Edelman’s unlikely adventure was inspired by his receiving numerous anti-Semitic tweets. Intrigued, he signed up anonymously for the sort of Twitter list that eventually included an invitation for a meeting of white supremacists to be held in Queens. Which, he properly points out, is rather ironic considering that the borough is the most diverse neighborhood in America.</p>\n<p>His recounting of the experience forms the springboard for the 75-minute show which touches on themes relating to identity, particularly of the Jewish variety. And Edelman, raised by Orthodox Jewish parents and whose brother competed for Israel in the Olympics, is as Jewish as it gets. He makes Jackie Mason seem like someone who would have put mayonnaise on his pastrami. He’s well aware of his specific appeal, describing his fan base as people on the Upper West Side.</p>\n<p><em>Just for Us</em> proves extremely well crafted, as one hopes it would be after being performed on and off for nearly five years. He begins the evening with an anecdote about how Koko the Gorilla related sadness upon hearing of the death of Robin Williams after having met the comedian only once. If you’re wondering how that connects with the rest of the piece, Edelman provides the answer toward the end of the show, followed by the sort of mic-drop capper that brings it to a triumphant conclusion.</p>\n<p>The comedian cannily interweaves his story about his attending the meeting — where he flirted with a young female attendee (“You never know,” he observes, later managing to turn the bland phrase into the most hysterical of punchlines) and met an elderly woman working on a massive, 12,000-piece jigsaw puzzle (that detail also figures in later on) — with humorous observations about his Jewish upbringing in Boston, Massachusetts. “I come from a racist part of Boston…called Boston,” he informs us.</p>\n<p>This leads to hilarious riffs about, among other things, his athlete brother, who competes in the winter sliding sport skeleton (“It’s just gravity,” Edelman scoffs) and a childhood event in which his parents generously held a Christmas celebration for a Christian family friend grieving over a recent loss. He points out that there’s no comparison between Christmas and Hanukkah, saying the latter is “the diet coke to Christian’s black tar heroin.”</p>\n<p>How much of Edelman’s account of attending the white supremacists meeting incognito is truthful or made up for comedic purposes can’t be known, of course. But it <em>feels</em> true enough, with the spindly Edelman, who resembles a cross between Pete Davidson and a young Jerry Lewis, looking physically vulnerable enough to make the proceedings almost suspenseful. Along the way, he manages to throw in many astute observations about the nature of hatred and prejudice along with punchlines which arrive with a rapid-fire pace. Relentlessly prowling the stage as if hyped up on Red Bull, his delivery may prove a bit too manic for some, but you wouldn’t know it from the steady stream of belly laughs erupting from the audience.</p>\n<p>Expertly staged by the late Adam Brace — whose many other credits include Liz Kingsman’s <em>One Woman</em> <em>Show</em>, which just opened to raves at Off-Broadway’s Greenwich House Theater – <em>Just for Us</em> proves to be far more than just an evening of extremely funny jokes. It’s a comic musing about bigotry that feels more relevant than ever at a time when something as innocuous as tiki torches has taken on a very sinister meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>Just for Us opened June 26, 2023, at the Hudson Theatre and runs through August 19.

Photo credit: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the first time in more than four decades, there are no shows with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber currently playing on Broadway. There are, however, no less than three current musicals featuring the songs of Britney Spears, including <em>Moulin Rouge</em>, <em>&amp; Juliet</em>, and now <em>Once Upon a One More Time</em>, the score of which consists entirely of numbers originally recorded by the pop star.</p>\n<p>Consider it the “Toxic Invasion.”</p>\n<p>I’ll leave it to the theater historians and pundits to debate the ramifications of this turn of events in Broadway musical theater. My job, such as it is, is to report on how well the show’s creators succeed in fulfilling their artistic aspirations. Of course, that’s assuming they have any. Based on the fact that it distributes free glowing bracelets to every audience member to wave in the air for the inevitable megamix during the curtain call, they’re not exactly straining for Sondheim-level depth.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/06/22/once-upon-a-one-more-time-betty-friedan-would-plotz/\"><em>Read Sandy MacDonald’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Rather, they simply want their target audience to have a good time; not, as the characters in <em>Seinfeld</em> used to sheepishly say, that there’s anything wrong with that. The problem is that this latest revisionist exhumation of fairy tales arrives shortly after such superior examples of the burgeoning genre as the recent revival of <em>Into the Woods</em> and <em>&amp; Juliet</em> (not a fairy tale, I know, but it <em>feels </em>like one) and such far worse examples as <em>Bad Cinderella</em>. It’s beginning to seem as if Broadway is less a destination for the tired businessman than the tired tyke who didn’t get in their nap. Not that they’d be able to sleep through this show if they tried, since the volume is pumped up to the sort of deafening levels you’d expect at, well, a Britney Spears concert.</p>\n<p>That the main plot element of Jon Hartmere’s book is Cinderella asserting her self-identity after being introduced to Betty Friedan’s <em>The Feminist Mystique</em> by her “O.F.G.,” or Original Fairy Godmother (a very funny Brooke Dillman), gives you an idea of how weird it is. (I’d love the see the Venn diagram detailing the intersection between Spears and Friedan fans.) Before Cinderella (Briga Heelan) has the chance to share Friedan’s ideas with her fellow fairy tale characters Snow White (Aisha Jackson), Rapunzel (Gabrielle Beckford), Sleeping Beauty (Ashley Chiu), the Little Mermaid (Lauren Zakrin), Princess Pea (Morgan Whitley), the book is seized by her wicked Stepmother (Jennifer Simard, uproarious).</p>\n<p>Needless to say, Cinderella is less inclined to appreciate the romantic overtures of Prince Charming (Justin Guarini), especially when she finds out he’s also been wooing Sleeping Beauty (which amusingly provides the cue for him to sing “Oops! I Did It Again.”) Meanwhile, Prince Erudite (Ryan Steele) finds himself swooning over Clumsy (a charming Nathan Levy) despite his diminutive height, in a cute subplot that elicits happy “Ooohs” from the audience when the couple finally kisses. “Who is that short drink of water whistling while he works?” the inaccurately named Erudite asks when he first spots Clumsy.</p>\n<p>The proceedings, which thanks to the sterile, projection-heavy scenic design looks like they take place less in an enchanted kingdom than an understocked Apple Store, are presided over by a very cranky Narrator (Adam Godley, whose last Broadway appearance was in the rather different <em>The Lehman Trilogy</em>).</p>\n<p>To say more about the storyline would only serve to distinguish it. But it does provide the opportunity for a plethora of gags — some funny, many not — including, for some reason, lots of jokes referencing the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush. (I mean, “Gowanus” is funnier, and “Dumbo” seems more appropriate). And, of course, it features more than twenty songs associated with Spears, ranging from hits (“Baby One More Time,” “Womanizer,” “Lucky,” “Circus”) to deep cuts that nearly everyone in the audience seemed to recognize, many of them with tweaked lyrics to make them fit better into the narrative. The musical highlight was Simard’s pull-out-the-stops rendition of “Toxic” in the second act, which was both powerfully sung and utterly in keeping with the character of the Stepmother.</p>\n<p>Heelan, a veteran television performer (<em>Great News</em>, <em>B Positive</em>) making her Broadway debut, is a charming if vocally underpowered Cinderella, especially compared to Jackson’s take-no-prisoners Snow White. Justin Guarini proves hilarious as Prince Charming, not only landing every joke but also singing and dancing with dazzling virtuosity. For one number, he even proves himself a semi-capable magician. Zakrin is endearing as the Little Mermaid, but she benefits greatly from the fact that her character doesn’t speak. But much like Carolee Carmello did in <em>Bad Cinderella</em>, Simard steals the show with her hilarious turn as the Stepmother, demonstrating that theater actresses should forget aspiring to play Lady Macbeth and instead brush up on their Brothers Grimm.</p>\n<p>Married directing team Keone and Mari Madrid, making their Broadway debut, don’t handle the book scenes as well as the musical numbers, for which they also provided the incredibly energetic choreography that would put most Super Bowl halftime shows to shame. It’s all a bit much, frankly, but then again, it’s not like anyone was expecting waltzes.</p>\n<p>Oh, and just in case you were wondering, the producers of <em>Once Upon a One More Time</em> take pains to assure us in the press release that the musical was “fully authorized by Britney Spears post-conservatorship.” Which is probably the last thing we need to worry about when it comes to Britney Spears.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Once Upon a One More Time </b>opened June 22, 2023, at the Marquis Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Let me state my biases upfront: I’m the wrong generation – if the ostensibly intended gender – for <em>Once Upon a One More Time,</em> an unimaginative mishmash/send-up of classic fairy tales. These rejiggered, centuries-old chestnuts, paired to a playlist drawn from Britney Spears’s oeuvre over the past quarter-century (conveniently cleared from stewardship), do not inspire in me the urge to start singing along – a reluctance not universally shared.</p>\n<p>I’m all for the show’s thumpingly heavy-handed message: That girls can aspire to a life which extends beyond the “happily ever after” of marriage to the Prince. But do you personally know any girls so benighted that they actually need to get this news flash? If they’re young enough to buy into the age-old fantasy scripts, there’s little harm in letting them innocently, vaguely dream along for a spell. Meanwhile, you might want to shield them from this show’s single-entendre lyrics and sexualized – if eye-catchingly angular and energetic – dance routines. (Choreographers Keone &amp; Mari Madrid, who created the off-off-Broadway charmer <em>Beyond Babel </em>pre-pandemic, deserve all due credit, as do the seemingly indefatigable members of the corps.)</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s tough to envision the show’s target audience: Millennials and Gen Zers looking to relive the lyrics and moves of their formative years? Closer in genre to a Vegas floor show, this jerry-built jukebox musical seems custom-designed to entertain a massive bachelorette party. It even promises physical stimulation, at least for those in the premium seats. The reverb at the orchestra level is set so high, you’ll get a good preview of what it feels like when the medics descend on you, shouting “Clear!”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/06/22/once-upon-a-one-more-time-what-youre-tired-of-fairy-tale-musicals/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The story line sketched out in John Hartmere’s book is skimpy and abecedarian. A tiny girl (who had better be equipped with earplugs, or I’m calling Child Protective Services) asks for a story, and a narrator – Adam Godley, late of <em>The Lehman Trilogy</em> (his mere presence lends the show a touch of class) – leaps into dictatorial director mode. He summons an assortment of young female storybook figures on standby, all eager to compete for star billing: “Show me how you want it to be … Pick me Baby one more time.” You get the gist.</p>\n<p>Segue to “Backstage Story Land,” where a half-dozen heroines-in-waiting hang out <em>en d</em><em>éshabillé</em>, hoping to be selected. When Cinderella (Broadway first-timer Briga Heelan, skilled but rather bland) gets the summons, the action heats up for a while. Channeling Tom Jones, the seemingly age-proof Justin Guarini is hilarious as the preening Prince. A bit of a dust-up ensues, though, when the covey of female contenders realize that their dream mate is – at a minimum – six-timing them all. Oops, indeed.</p>\n<p>As Cinderella’s bestie, Snow White, Aisha Jackson gets to soar vocally – from a raspy howl to a silky glissando – even though the audience’s rabid screams are guaranteed to drown out her money notes. Jennifer Simard, a power singer who excels at snarky, is grievously underutilized as Cinderella’s stepmother, and her progeny are given virtually nothing – no identifying quirks or vices – to play with. The script for Act 1 yields some witticisms and surprise turns, but the second half languishes, neglected.</p>\n<p>Where does Betty Friedan come into this collection of fractured fairytales, you might wonder? Belaboredly, when “The Notorious O.F.G.” – Old Fairy Godmother, played with Jane Withers goofiness by Brooke Dillman – introduces the maidens-in-waiting to <em>The Feminist Mystique</em>.</p>\n<p>Friedan’s magnum opus is not the easiest gateway tract, but no matter: it’s only cited as a shorthand signifier. What Friedan in the supposed flesh is doing in this jukebox musical is the real puzzler. Let’s hope that her estate is being duly recompensed for the use of her personage, because her message has been perverted here into mere tokenism. If you really want to honor Friedan’s legacy, consider sitting this one out and contributing instead to one of the causes she fiercely espoused, such as the ever-elusive Equal Rights Amendment promising bodily autonomy – a basic that Spears herself no doubt holds dear.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Once Upon a One More Time </b>opened June 22, 2023, at the Marquis Theatre.

Photo credit: MurphyMade</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Early on in <em>Grey House</em>, a couple find themselves in an isolated, run-down cabin in the woods after getting into a car accident that results in the man’s foot being badly injured. Looking around the cluttered environs, the man says forebodingly, “I’ve seen this movie before.”</p>\n<p>“What happens?” the woman asks.</p>\n<p>“We don’t make it,” he replies.</p>\n<p>The line gets the expected laughs, but it’s definitely not accurate. I won’t reveal whether or not the couple actually manages to survive in this new thriller by Levi Holloway, but what transpires is definitely not like anything you’ve seen before. Whether or not that’s a good thing is a topic likely to be highly debated by theatergoers, many of whom can be seen emerging from the Lyceum Theatre with baffled looks on their faces. The new Broadway season has just begun, and it’s hard to imagine any future show proving more divisive.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/06/01/grey-house-goose-bumpy-thrills-chills-galore-plus-some-gore/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★☆☆ </a><em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/06/01/grey-house-goose-bumpy-thrills-chills-galore-plus-some-gore/\">review here</a>.</em>]</p>\n<p>A first-rate cast and creative team have been assembled for the play which premiered at Chicago’s A Red Orchid Theatre in 2019. Director Joe Mantello’s production features contributions from scenic designer Scott Pask, costume designer Rudy Monce, lighting designer Natasha Katz and sound designer Tom Gibbons, all working at the top of their game. And the sterling ensemble includes Laurie Metcalf, Tatiana Maslany (who missed critics’ performances after being sidelined with Covid), Paul Sparks, and Sophia Anne Caruso. It’s hard to avoid the feeling, however, that the play, which depends highly on a tightly controlled, ominous atmosphere, might have been more impactful when presented in the Chicago theater’s much smaller space.</p>\n<p>The story takes place in 1977 and begins with Henry (Sparks) and Max (understudy Claire Karpen, filling in for Maslany, out with Covid) arriving late on a wintry night at the cabin which at first seems abandoned. It turns out, however, that there are quite a few residents: the middle-aged matriarch, Raleigh (Metcalf), and a group of children of varying ages including the eldest Marlow (Caruso), the deaf Bernie (Millicent Simmonds), Squirrel (Colby Kipnes), A1656 (Alyssa Emily Marven), and a young unnamed boy (Eamon Patrick O’Connell). The no-nonsense Raleigh takes the couple’s arrival in stride, welcoming them as guests and tending to Henry’s broken ankle. A blizzard is raging outside, and calling for help isn’t an option since the only phone apparently had its cord chewed through by a squirrel.</p>\n<p>Things, needless to say, get stranger from there with a series of increasingly bizarre events occurring over the play’s intermissionless 100 minutes that resists easy explanation, including a provocative truth or lies game played by Max and the children. To describe much of what goes on in detail would spoil the surprises, but let’s just say that plenty of different interpretations as to what’s actually going on will be bandied about. By the end, not long after the appearance of a character identified in the program only as “The Ancient” (Cyndi Coyne), some answers are provided. But even then, there’s plenty of ambiguity to the proceedings.</p>\n<p>That, in and of itself, wouldn’t be a bad thing. People are still debating the meanings of <em>Waiting for</em> <em>Godot</em>, and it doesn’t seem to have hurt that work’s reputation any. The bigger problem is that the purposeful vagueness on display here proves more frustrating than intriguing for much of the play’s running time, with too many scenes petering out and lacking the follow-through necessary to sustain the narrative momentum. As if to compensate, the production throws in a few genuine jump scares and graphically gory moments, but <em>Grey House</em> is more unsettling than scary, not so much a thriller as surreal horror. The playwright seems intent on crafting a mythology but hasn’t provided the sufficient thematic texture to make it fully resonate.</p>\n<p>That said, the play is definitely something original, no small selling point when it comes to Broadway. And it provides the welcome opportunity for Laurie Metcalf to return to the stage, even if she’s playing a supporting character not all that far removed from her Aunt Jackie in <em>The Connors</em>. While it’s disappointing that she’s appearing in this and not the tragically short-lived revival of <em>Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf</em>, she nonetheless does a lot with a relatively one-note part, garnering uneasy laughs with her brusque manner and acerbic line readings. Sparks and Karpen, the latter ably filling in for Maslany and displaying no signs of tentativeness, handle their roles well, and the younger performers are expertly unnerving as the children who are not quite what they seem. Although after <em>Beetlejuice</em> and this, the talented Caruso might want to find a nice ingenue role for her next Broadway assignment.</p>\n<p>The creepiness factor is definitely ramped up to 11 thanks to Mantello’s expertly calibrated staging and the terrific production designs, with Gibbons’ frequently shocking sound effects keeping us constantly on edge. Best to see <em>Grey House</em> with a group of friends, not only to have someone to clutch during the scary parts but also with whom to have a spirited conversation afterwards.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Grey House </b>opened June 1, 2023, at the Lyceum Theatre.

Photo: MurphyMade, 2023</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know the suspicious situation and have over your playgoing, moviegoing years. Their automobile runs into trouble on the road in the night, and they’re forced to look for help at the nearest house where they see a welcoming window.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, here it is again in Levi Holloway’s <em>Grey House</em>, directed by Joe Mantello, who’s also relying on Natasha Katz’s scary lighting and Tom Gibbons’ frightful sound and music to amplify the thrills, chills, frills, spills, and, sure as shootin’, the threatening kills.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This 1977 time the damnably irresistible hokum involves married couple Henry (Paul Sparks) and Max (understudy Claire Karpen at the preview I attended, in for Tatiana Maslany). On the way to see to her deceased father’s holdings with Max driving, they lose their way. Trying to avoid a deer, they crash. (Would there be a play if they hadn’t?)</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/06/01/grey-house-bleak-doesnt-begin-to-describe-it/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ </a><em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/06/01/grey-house-bleak-doesnt-begin-to-describe-it/\">review here</a>.</em>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily or maybe not so, they’re already on the grey house property, the ground floor interior of which audience captives have already seen. It isn’t, as Scott Pask’s cabin design has it, overwhelmingly grey but is definitely country-Gothic eerie.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve even already witnessed weird goings-on by a clutch of four young girls – Marlow (Sophia Anne Caruso), deaf Bernie (Millicent Simmonds), Squirrel (Colby Kipnes), “A1656” (Alyssa Emily Marvin) – and one very young boy (Eamon Patrick O’Connell), whom they call Mr. Man. Asleep on a couch is the older Raleigh (Laurie Metcalf, back on stage after too long an absence.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, we’ve already watched this passel of children behave oddly. They’ve excitedly performed a drilled routine to Mountain Man’s “Stella,” which begins with the hint-hint lyric, “It’s a call coming from your house.” Already, we’ve had it strongly suggested that when whoever was in the unseen crash (no matter what the movie or play) knocks or pounds on the door, he, she or they are in for a bumpy ride.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not that on Max and Henry entering what is now an empty room, they immediately sense danger. Okay, Henry does prompt an audience-wide laugh when he says, “I’ve seen this movie” and then, cheerfully, “We don’t make it.”  That gets spectators prepared for the subsequent goose bumps. And sure, Holloway inserts several other goose-bumpy hint-hint remarks.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the girls, the boy, and Raleigh slowly make themselves known, however, they are helpful, quickly splintering the broken ankle Henry has sustained and offering him one of the many brews in identical containers filling the refrigerator that AI656 identifies as – okay another hint-hint – “the  nectar of dead men.” So’s not to let the moment slip by only vaguely noted, she joins the other girls repeating “the nectar of dead men.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’ll be enough of the hints. There are many, and any more will start enlarging into spoilers. Of course, there’s no call to risk spoiling what in time Holloway eventually frames as a ghost story. Don’t be surprised – er, no – do be surprised should you happen to get an early glimpse of such a supernatural creature.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truth is, Holloway isn’t just having fun with a ghost story. He’s after something far more dire, something far more indicting of (all right, here’s a potential spoiler) man’s inhumanity not only to men and women but to children. His vision is so dark that it might cast shadows on the enjoyment of patrons present just for the fun of such ghastly, ghostly baubles. (Am I wrong, or is Judith Ivey’s 1999 <em>Voices in the Dark</em> appearance – this cabin is in the Adirondacks – the last time Broadway faced similar menace?)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s no news that Metcalf in a long grey wig is an ace as the sometime controlling, sometimes sullen, continually uncategorizable Raleigh, who is and isn’t the children’s mother. Sparks, another reliable vet, handles Henry’s mounting ambivalences with increasingly frightening aplomb. Possibly more surprising in their precocious roles as children of mystery are Caruso, Simmonds, Kipnes, Marvin, O’Connell, and Cyndi Coyne in a brief appearance as a character called The Ancient. Understudy Karpen is entirely convincing as a women understandably confused about her strange surroundings.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chief among them is the intense, stern-eyed Caruso, playing the organizing Marlow. As an inflexible, tyrannical adolescent thriving on nastiness, Caruso realizes she’s been handed the opportunity to steal scenes and does so without any sign of false humility. Cheers to her.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may be that the challenging intricacies of Holloway’s plot – of what unappealingly unfolds in the final few moments – will result in some head-scratching and “Huh, what?” mouthings from those exiting the hushed auditorium. Spectators who get Holloway’s full intentions, who follow his incriminating sentiments about the nectar of dead men origins will not only declare themselves scarily entertained but will continue considering the charges he has incorporated about man’s cruelty throughout the ages. </span></p>\n<p><strong><b>Grey House </b>opened June 1, 2023, at the Lyceum Theatre.

Photo: Paul Kolnik</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Anna Uzele, as a post-WWII radio singer, starts the Kander &amp; Ebb near-classic “But the World Goes ’Round,” moves down front as scenery and castmates disappear, and commandingly steps into focus as she launches into the bridge. The arranger adds a bar or two: “There’s still gonna be a summer, a winter, a spring… and a fall…” The swingin’ band modulates up a step, the strings sneak in, and Uzele knocks it out of the proverbial ballpark, enveloped most fittingly in a seven-beamed spotlight stream, as audience cheers blast the rafters.</p>\n<p>But “But the World Goes ’Round” doesn’t come along until a full 2 hours and 20 minutes into <em>New York, New York</em>, the not-quite-new, not-quite-Kander &amp; Ebb musical at the St. James. The show catches fire for the final half-hour, culminating in a coup de théâtre leading into a smashing rendition of the title song every bit as exciting as you’d find in a prime nitery. Although in a prime nitery, the proprietors wouldn’t make you wait hours and hours to get to the good stuff.</p>\n<p>“Ya got trouble,” as some other songsmith once wrote. Not in River City, Iowa, but in <em>New York, New York</em>. The show is “inspired by” the 1977 Martin Scorsese film that collapsed in what was said to have been a cocaine haze, leaving behind a title song that went on to a finer life as an anthemic paean to that magical place where little town blues melt away. We’ve seen numberless Broadway musicals based on hit movies; but a Broadway musical based on a Hollywood flop? The film did have those two aforementioned songs, which represent Kander &amp; Ebb at their best, and the show carries what they used to call “a million-dollar title.” But a million dollars only takes you so far, nowadays.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/26/new-york-new-york-the-new-musical-cant-quite-make-it-here/\"><em>Read Roma Torre’s </em>★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The tale is all too familiar, about a broken-down musician (ex-De Niro, now the charmingly assured Colton Ryan of <em>Girl from the North Country</em>) and an ambitious singer (ex-Minnelli, now Uzele of <em>Six</em>) who meet, marry, part, and get together in the final frame to rekindle their flame. Director/choreographer Susan Stroman (<em>The Producers</em>) has conceived her latest musical as something of a celebration of the city. Dance is everywhere, from the office-workers and tourists on the street to the construction workers tap-tap-tapping on the girders of some skyscraper. That particular scene is pulled from an iconic Depression-era photo of steel workers (“Lunch atop a Skyscraper” they call it); it is masterfully staged and performed, complete with an effective scenic transition. Set designer Beowulf Boritt has a field day moving us through the city, on what might well be a million-dollar set.</p>\n<p>But what is this Depression image doing in this postwar musical? If anything is consistent in the evening, it’s the lack of tone. We are always, yes, in New York, New York (with a stop in Hoboken); and the book by David Thompson and Sharon Washington clearly places us in the years just after World War II. But some of the scenes, and some of the characters, and some of the songs seem placed in the Depression or elsewhere. And for what it’s worth—or <em>not</em> worth—the authors see fit to open their grand new musical celebration with the line, and I quote in full, “Holy shit!”</p>\n<p>That said, there is plenty of first-rate musical making in <em>New York, New York</em>. Stroman gives us some of the most exciting choreography on Broadway just now; there is too much of it, though, and a good deal distracts from (or covers for the faults of) what used to be called plot. The design elements are strong, led by Boritt’s shifting views of New York. Donna Zakowska’s costumes are mostly excellent, although the couture—like the show—seems to shift from postwar to prewar. Some delicious work from Zakowska, along with hair and wig designer Sabana Majeed and whoever did the hats, is mixed in with the more generic rest. Lighting designer Ken Billington, who goes back to <em>Chicago</em> and the original <em>Sweeney Todd</em>, deserves a star of his own for his above-referenced work in the “World Goes ’Round” number.</p>\n<p>Let us move to the music. The 96-year-old John Kander is a legend, the most revered veteran of Broadway’s yesterdays now that Sondheim has made his exit. The score is what some other old-time songwriter called “a thing of threads and patches, of ballads, songs and snatches.” Early on, you indeed hear some snatches—themes, not full songs—and you find your ears perking up: that’s <em>real</em> music, from someone who knows how to write a soaring melody! When did we last hear that, outside of revivals, in a Broadway theatre?</p>\n<p>The sound of Kander, yes; and it’s most welcome. These particular songs, though, are randomly placed into the narrative whether they serve well or no. Some are new, revised or pulled from the trunk; half are authentic Kander &amp; Ebb, most presumably written long before Fred’s death in 2004. Lin-Manuel Miranda, who frequently salutes Kander for generously opening career doors for him, is credited for additional lyrics. On first hearing, “One Minor Chord” (lyric by Kander) stands out among the previously unheard songs, along with “My Own Music” (lyric by Miranda) and “Better Than Before” (an Ebb lyric revised by Miranda). We look forward to hearing them again.</p>\n<p>The music department, led by music supervisor and arranger Sam Davis, is superb. Kander is, and always has been, an intelligent and entertaining composer; Davis and his co-orchestrator Daryl Waters keenly seize on every musical accent, punctuating the score in a keenly professional manner that is becoming infrequent in our orchestra pits. Alvin Hough Jr. leads a band of 19, and they swing when given the opportunity. Like in the last half hour of the show.</p>\n<p>But we stray from the issue at hand. <em>New York, New York</em> starts very much like the Bernstein-Comden-Green musical <em>On the Town</em>, with that other “New York, New York” song about how it’s a helluva town. Both shows open with extended musical sequences spanning mid-1940s New York, amid visions of Grand Central and the Brooklyn Bridge. But the authors of <em>On the Town</em> wisely concentrated on the escapades of their three main characters. Thompson, Washington, and Stroman roam from plot to plot, place to place, milieu to milieu to the extent that we can’t—or don’t care to—follow what passes for a story.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_18136\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18136\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18136\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/New-York-New-York-steel-Cast-By-Paul-Kolnik.jpg?resize=1200%2C664&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"664\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/New-York-New-York-steel-Cast-By-Paul-Kolnik.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/New-York-New-York-steel-Cast-By-Paul-Kolnik.jpg?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/New-York-New-York-steel-Cast-By-Paul-Kolnik.jpg?resize=1024%2C567&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/New-York-New-York-steel-Cast-By-Paul-Kolnik.jpg?resize=768%2C425&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-18136\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The cast of New York, New York. Photo: Paul Kolnik</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Along with the clearly delineated De Niro and Minnelli characters, we get a melting pot of a half dozen story strands; each—cynics might note—features characters of different ethnicities. There is the Irish hero’s Italian best friend, Tommy (Clyde Alves), who at various spots seems to court and eventually win a nameless dancer who is unidentified in the show or in the program. The diminutive Cuban exile Mateo Diaz (the highly entertaining Angel Sigala) walks around literally carrying bongo drums, and has a battered mother (Janet Dacal) and abusive father (also unidentified in the program). Jesse Webb (John Clay III) is a talented trumpeter who can only find work in the kitchen. They are contrasted by Gordon Kendrick (Ben Davis), an upper-class Broadway producer-type who has a goatee and thus, musical comedy shorthand decrees, is the bad guy.</p>\n<p>And then there’s Alec Mann (Oliver Prose), a fiddler from Poland wearing brown knickers and ugly shoes to show that he’s poor and worthy, who stands in the street playing a song from the 1981 musical <em>Woman of the Year</em>. We don’t get the lyric here, but it’s an especially strong Kander melody formerly called “Sometimes a Day Goes By.” Alec hooks up, in an adoptive son sort of way, with a landlady grieving for her lost-in-action son who in former life was a violin virtuoso—the landlady, not the lost son—but who now rubs her hands so frenetically that we suppose she’s got the arthritis don’t ya know. Even so, young Alec—who appears to be just yesterday off the boat—somehow managed to hear the landlady back in the days when she was headlining at Carnegie Hall before her hands went bad. (Anything can happen in New York.) This tenement landlady is named Madame Veltri; the excellent performance is so understatedly appealing that it was a surprise to decipher, at intermission, that this was the accomplished but rarely understated powerhouse known as Emily Skinner (inevitably remembered for <em>Side Show</em>).</p>\n<p>At several points during the numerous street scenes we notice an elderly drudge who sings while she mops. Late in the second act, while singing and mopping, she is suddenly whisked to the Metropolitan, begowned, and singing <em>Traviata</em>. She just as quickly disappears, unidentified in the show or in the program. The performer is good, whoever she may be. But if the authors don’t care enough to identify these characters, how are <em>we</em> to care about them? And what do these multifarious strands have to do with Jimmy Doyle (the piano player) and Francine Evans (the singer)? Too many characters, too many atmospheric incidentals, too little actual <em>plot</em>.</p>\n<p>An all-purpose actor named Jim Borstelmann—you might recognize him from other Stroman musicals—goes similarly unidentified in the cast list but the authors give him ten or so small cameos through the evening. This allows him to garner laugh after laugh after laugh. Sometimes as a news peddler, sometimes laboring beneath the worst toupee in town, sometimes just wincing as he crosses the stage or opens the evening with that “holy shit”—Borstelmann makes a stronger impression than many of the others. It almost seems like the authors spent their energy sitting around thinking up more and more bits for Borstelmann, rather than fleshing out the actual characters. His impersonation of a zonked bass player beneath a sad porkpie hat is one of the most well-etched character delights on stage.</p>\n<p>And then the band, finally, plays “New York, New York.” It’s just that kind of show.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: inherit;\">New York, New York opened April 26, 2023, at the St. James Theatre.

Photo: Paul Kolnik</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Of all the new musicals scheduled to open this Broadway season, <em>New York, New York </em>had the most potential, at least on paper. The creative pedigree alone put it at the top of our must-see list: music and lyrics by the great John Kander &amp; Fred Ebb, direction and choreography by Susan Stroman, additional lyrics by none other than Lin-Manuel Miranda, and it was inspired by the Martin Scorsese film featuring Liza Minnelli singing that stirring title anthem “New York, New York.” How could it possibly go wrong, you might ask. Well, let’s just call it a case of too many legends stirring the pot.</p>\n<p>The publicity material calls it “a glittering love letter to the greatest city in the world.” That may be what they’re going for; but love letters, no matter how glittering, don’t make for good musicals. And if that’s truly the aim, a better venue might have been Radio City Music Hall where less discerning tourists go for over-produced razzle dazzle.</p>\n<p>Of course, given such a stellar team, <em>New York, New York</em> does have its moments but they’re too few and far between to justify the over-produced razzle dazzle taking up more than two and a half hours on the St. James stage.</p>\n<p>[<em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em>]</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for anything resembling the cinematic love story starring Liza Minnelli and Robert DeNiro as an up and coming singer and a struggling musician, you’re mostly out of luck. And I would attribute that to the book writers, David Thompson and Sharon Washington. They moved the timeline up a year from the movie’s V-J Day to 1946. Not sure why that is but they also threw in a bunch of subplots and extraneous characters that basically detract from the two stars. Their names remain the same, Jimmy Doyle and Francine Evans; only in this version, Francine is African American. It’s a good choice but the writers glossed over the challenging dynamic that a mixed race couple would have faced in the 1940’s. And it struck me as a missed opportunity for some genuine dramatic heft.</p>\n<p>There’s a general sense that the entire show was crafted by committee with every voice given equal weight. The result is a sort of throw-it-all-out-there-and-see-what-sticks approach in which the stage is cluttered with fragmented sketches. Instead of a few compelling storylines, we get a lot of cliched vignettes featuring a large ethnically diverse cast with dreams of making it in the big city.</p>\n<p>Among the disparate stories…a gay Cuban bongo player and his mother are tormented by his abusive father. It’s 1946, so you know there’s got to be a war-related tragedy. Someone’s not coming home. Several of the plots involve black musicians and singers desperate for a break. There’s even a bizarre tangent featuring a peripheral maid character who gets a whole scene out of the blue appearing as an opera singer. She has a magnificent voice but it just slows the narrative.</p>\n<p>Susan Stroman’s direction is uncharacteristically sloppy, leaning heavily on her choreographic skills where she always shines. The opening number is a busy hodgepodge that looks pretty enough but does little to introduce the story. And almost all of the scene changes are staged with dance sequences depicting city life: pickpockets, street artists, straphangers, mob hits, you name it. A little of that would have gone a long way but after awhile it just serves to stop the momentum. And how to explain the body of a murdered gangster who suddenly stands up and exits in full view stage left?</p>\n<p>One of the highlights in the production is a dance number Stroman ingeniously conceived atop a steel girder at a construction site. There isn’t much reason for it but it’s nevertheless a thrill. And special mention to Clyde Alves whose gymnastics and energetic dancing make him a standout.</p>\n<p>As for the rest of the performances, it’s a mixed bag. Angel Sigala is making a smashing Broadway debut as the young Cuban bongo player. Another Broadway rookie, Oliver Prose, delivers sweetly as an aspiring Polish violinist. And John Clay III as a trumpet playing vet is equally impressive. Emily Skinner, with 10 Broadway shows under her belt, is wasted in an underwritten stock role here. Even her costume, a suffocatingly stiff suit, conspires to hem in her enormous talents.</p>\n<p>The two leads, Colton Ryan and Anna Uzele are plenty talented themselves, but they’re undermined by the crowded book which deprives them of proper character development. They’re stuck in a barebones boy-meets-girl scenario that doesn’t allow for any real emotional investment. And neither displays the requisite star power to overcome the show’s numerous flaws.</p>\n<p>They do sing nicely and what may be the show’s singular salvation is the goosebump inducing finale, when the orchestra rises from the pit and Uzele joins them downstage in a knockout rendition of that ubiquitous title song.</p>\n<p>Uzele also does a splendid job with “But the World Goes ’Round.” Those are the two best numbers in the show which is essentially a jukebox musical of Kander &amp; Ebb’s songbook. Not all the songs fit and many just feel forced. The songwriters certainly deserve their due but they are not all that well served in this overstuffed production.</p>\n<p>A lot of money was spent on the show and it’s mostly displayed in the elaborate scenic designs by Beowulf Boritt, who also devised the projections with Christopher Ash. Anchored by floor to ceiling tenement fire escapes moving this way and that, It all looks spectacular for the most part but as they say, people don’t come for the sets.</p>\n<p>It’s going to be hard avoiding unfavorable comparisons to such other works as <em>On The Town </em>and <em>A Star Is Born</em>. And I wish I had better news to spread here. There’s a line near the end of the show in which a character says “Don’t bet against New York.” Unfortunately, I can’t say the same thing about its musical namesake.</p>\n<p><strong>New York, New York opened April 26, 2023, at the St. James Theatre.

Photo: Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Relationships need not last long to have a profound impact: some prove pivotal. In his new two-hander, <em>Summer, 1976, </em>David Auburn limns a flash-point friendship formed in the torpid summer of the title year. Jessica Hecht plays Alice, a laid-back midwestern faculty wife who befriends her antithesis: Diana (Laura Linney), a teaching artist who’s her seeming superior in every arena, from aesthetic to intellectual – or so Diana would have Alice believe.</p>\n<p>If their names recall a restaurant and a realm, it’s perhaps no accident. Their relationship, captured primarily one long kaleidoscopic flashback, is a study in cultural contrasts and the resulting disjunct in power dynamics. Alice is sweet, dithery, vague, but well meaning – a Edward Koren cartoon brought to life – whereas Diana is brittle and driven, intent on projecting a put-together, stylish persona. (Linda Cho’s all-purpose costume choice spans the decades: Diana in sleek, timeless black, Alice adrift in a blowsy Indian-print dress.)</p>\n<p>Each woman is the mother of a young girl. Diana, reminiscing, has the gall to note that at first she found Alice’s daughter (“Holly!” she sneers) repugnant, from her drippy nose to her very name (Diana recommends allergy shots; the name, not surprisingly, sticks). The two women initially bond over a shared joint while the girls play in Alice’s yard: Alice offers and Diana avidly accepts, if only to advertise that she’s hip. That performative bent is a tell: When, even in the hazy recesses of the 1970s, was dope-smoking a competitive sport? And even then, wouldn’t one mother abstain, in the interest of keeping an eye on the children?</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/25/summer-1976-a-fuzzy-memory-play/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ </a><em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/25/summer-1976-a-fuzzy-memory-play/\">review here</a>.</em>]</p>\n<p>In Diana’s case, ego comes first at all costs. Convinced that she has fashioned an impeccable life as a single mother by choice (she brags about keeping the unsuspecting impregnator, a “deeply not-bright glassblower,” in the dark), Diana – who admits to having “family money” – decides to take Alice on as a makeover project. Never mind that Alice is fairly content as is. Not only is her economist husband up for tenure, he has initiated a barter system that is pure ’70s – a childcare cooperative ensuring that impecunious faculty need not blow money on babysitters.</p>\n<p>So taken with each other are Diana and Alice, however, they become a gratis co-op of two. So far, so cozy. But Auburn has odd twists up his sleeve, characterological MacGuffins that lead the viewer down various intriguing suppositional paths.</p>\n<p>With her signature languid diction (which does not translate easily to the Midwest), Hecht’s delivery can sometimes wear, but watch her closely. Her micro-reactions are mercurial and deep. Alice appears to have a native intelligence that Diana lacks. Meanwhile, Linney keeps Diana’s mean-girl vibe in check just enough so that she’s not overtly off-putting. Diana will charm you, as she does Alice. It’s easy to see how an unsophisticated admirer might sign on as an acolyte.</p>\n<p>With these antipodes, Auburn has seemingly come up with a way to represent the puzzling bifurcation in women’s objectives over the past half-century: glamour at all costs vs. industry, endurance, and actual power and progress.</p>\n<p>In the case of these unlikely friends, do we see a comeuppance coming? If so, it’s subtle, a mere postscript. While it might be gratifying to observe a relentless poseuse cut down to size, Auburn blunts the blow, having already strewn the path with ambiguous omens. Diana’s efforts to maintain a façade are bound to come at a cost.</p>\n<p>The production itself is flawless: A seemingly plain box of a set by John Lee Beatty transforms, via the lighting magic of Japhy Weideman, into a twilight patio, a museum cafe, and more, while Jill BC Du Boff&#8217;s sound design lends the illusion of intimacy. Director Daniel Sullivan deftly delineates every interaction – subdued to explosive.</p>\n<p><strong>Summer, 1976 opened April 25, 2023, at Samuel J. Friedman Theatre and runs through June 18.

Photo credit: Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Summer, 1976</em>, being given its world premiere on Broadway by Manhattan Theatre Club, is a memory play about two women recalling the origins of their friendship decades earlier. As beautifully played by stage veterans Laura Linney and Jessica Hecht, Diana and Alice are both well-drawn, interesting characters whose significant differences in personality and viewpoints don’t prevent them from forming a close bond.</p>\n<p>It’s too bad, then, that playwright David Auburn didn’t introduce them to each other.</p>\n<p>This new drama from the author of <em>Proof </em>is the latest in a seemingly endless series of plays in which the story is told, not shown. Rather than dramatizing the events onstage, the characters, often sitting at opposite ends of a long table as if attending a board meeting, mainly tell their story via alternating monologues. It makes you wonder why theater has so often seemed to become a platform for bedtime stories for adults. Yes, as the recent <em>Prima Facie</em> proved, the narrative style can be effective. But that play benefited from a powerful storyline and a truly dynamic lead performance from Jodie Comer.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/25/summer-1976-an-odd-couple-of-midwestern-moms/\"><em>Read Sandy MacDonald’s </em> ★★★★☆ </a><em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/25/summer-1976-an-odd-couple-of-midwestern-moms/\">review here</a>.</em>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Summer, 1976</em> the two women meet, as Diana informs us at the beginning, through their children. Both are the parents of five-year-old daughters and participate in a “babysitting co-op” organized by Alice’s husband, a university professor. Alice is a stay-at-home mom — “She was essentially living like a 1950s housewife,” Diana sardonically comments — while single mother Diana, who became pregnant via a one-night stand, teaches at the university as well.</p>\n<p>The play’s sharp writing, as well as Linda Cho’s character-defining costumes, effectively delineates the sharp contrasts between Diana, an aesthete with “family money” who casually throws around words like “jejune” and decries her friend’s penchant for “depressingly middlebrow” novels like James Clavell’s <em>Shogun</em> and Robin Cook’s <em>Coma</em>, and Alice, a financially struggling bohemian type who makes homemade frozen popsicles from juice to save money, self-confidently calls out Diana on her snobbishness, and doesn’t mind too much when her friend “bogarts” the marijuana joint she offered.</p>\n<p>Auburn throws in some mildly dramatic plot elements, such as the two women’s attraction to the hunky graduate student spending the summer painting Alice’s house and late revelations about Diana’s actual teaching status and Alice’s marriage. But really, not very much of interest occurs over the course of the story, which plays out like a series of anecdotes related to friends over a few glasses of wine. Except without the liquid lubrication, it comes across as fairly dry.</p>\n<p>More problematically, the play features a couple of narrative fake-outs, one definitely more convincing than the other, that frustratingly prove more interesting than the actual story. And several times Linney assumes the role of Alice’s unseen husband, although since she doesn’t alter her voice or mannerisms it becomes unnecessarily confusing.</p>\n<p>The play nonetheless proves affecting, thanks to its sensitive insights about the vagaries of friendships and the way they can evolve, or not, with the passage of time and the impact of external forces. Under the uncluttered direction of Daniel Sullivan, the two actresses deliver sterling performances, displaying an authentic-seeming chemistry and making the closeness between their very different characters fully believable. You come away from <em>Summer, 1976</em> feeling like you wish you’d been able to spend more time with Diana and Alice, and that they’d been able to spend more time with each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Summer, 1976 opened April 25, 2023, at Samuel J.
