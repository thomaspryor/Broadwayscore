Photo: Julieta Cervantes.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>At just over 90 minutes, Taylor Mac&#8217;s first Broadway play, <em>Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus</em>, is roughly one-fifteenth the length <em>of A 24-Decade History of Popular Music</em>, the brilliant, epic performance piece that made him a Pulitzer Prize finalist a couple of years ago. But <em>Gary</em> is just as difficult, in the best sense, to sum up neatly: a raucous comedy whose subject is tragedy—not the titular Shakespeare play, which is merely its starting point, but our enduring capacity for destruction, which Mac engages with gloriously raunchy humor and blazing intuition, and an aching tenderness that sneaks up on you and wraps itself around your heart.</p>\n<p>The terrain demands a deft guide and expert players, and Mac has both in director George C. Wolfe and his cast, composed of Nathan Lane, Kristine Nielsen (replacing Andrea Martin, who sustained an injury during rehearsals) and Julie White, all in top form as minor figures from the original <em>Titus</em> who come into their own, and then some, after surviving that play&#8217;s notorious wreckage.</p>\n<p>The wreckage itself has a prominent role in <em>Gary</em>; the curtain opens to reveal as resplendently and hilariously gory a set as you&#8217;re likely to have seen on a Broadway stage, with what appear to be hundreds of stuffed, rouge-stained corpses scattered about. Scenic designer Santo Loquasto (another invaluable veteran, along with costumer Ann Roth) has a bunch heaped around a tall wooden centerpiece surrounded by the gold-plated ruins of a Roman palace&#8217;s, the emperor Titus&#8217;s, banquet hall. A staircase snakes through this pile of bodies—still clothed, in contrast to others stacked around them—which the actors will sift and climb through, at points popping up like daisies sprouting from dry soil.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/21/gary-a-sequel-to-titus-andronicus-cleaning-up-and-moving-on-after-disaster/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The corpses also become objects of play, particularly for Lane&#8217;s Gary, a lowly clown who has been promoted, after the death of too many servants, to the role of maid. His new boss is Nielsen&#8217;s Janice, a battle-hardened vet—&#8221;Ya think this is me first massacre?&#8221; she shouts—who sets about showing him how to rid the dead of any remaining flatulence, as well as blood and feces. Scatological humor plays a key role from early on, with Lane and Nielsen, both speaking in broad cockney accents, pressing fake tummies and other body parts to produce a symphony of fart noises. Lane wears a horn strapped to his midsection, providing more sonic punctuation as Gary&#8217;s initial unease fades a bit and he begins to have fun with his insentient subjects, even developing a crush on one of them.</p>\n<p>But Gary has higher aspirations, and not just because the task of draining bodily fluids through tubes doesn&#8217;t strike him as a dream job. The clown&#8217;s goal is nothing less than to save the world, by being further promoted to the role of fool—a voice of wit and wisdom, rather than an object of derision—and thus allowed to enlighten what&#8217;s left of the court. Gary speaks loftily of the &#8220;beauty of a coup&#8221; that would deliver them from chaos and despair and social injustice, rather than requiring them to clean up, in every sense, after the privileged. &#8220;All you&#8217;ve done is make it seem pleasant for the people making the mess,&#8221; he chides Janice, who retorts, &#8220;I understand. Ya had some near deaths. It changed your lives. And now ya think ya can change other people&#8217;s as well. But it don&#8217;t work that way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gary&#8217;s aspirational idealism and Janice&#8217;s pragmatic cynicism complement each other in the absurd but somehow not unfamiliar world Mac has crafted here, with language that&#8217;s both masterful in expressing character and exquisite in its wit and beauty. The first lines are spoken in rhymed verse by Carol, the midwife drolly played by White, a woman rather higher in social station than Gary or Janice, though still saddled with serving the more fortunate. Gary is later mocked by Janice when he does the same, as the play juggles ribald satire—there&#8217;s even a bawdy musical number, in which various male corpses suddenly spring to life, along with distinguishing body parts—with profoundly moving reflection.</p>\n<p>Gary and Janice are given stirring monologues, enabling Lane and Nielsen showcases for the astonishing range that has sometimes been overshadowed (though less so in Lane&#8217;s case, recently) by their comedic prowess. The actress, who assumes a deeper voice and more muscular presence than she has in some previous roles as Janice asserts her authority and frustration, settles into a beautiful, and rhyming, tribute to Titus&#8217;s daughter Lavinia, an especially undeserving victim of the slaughter and a symbol of the unfair burden heaped on one gender in particular. &#8220;I <em>would</em> like to see a line of <em>living</em> women kicking all in one direction, symbolizing a revolt, and taking over the world,&#8221; Janice declares later, nodding back to the all-male production number. (Notably, she keeps the bodies of women and children covered, out of respect and because she can&#8217;t bear to look at them.)</p>\n<p>The superficially daffy Carol, whom Janice characterizes as &#8220;smart enough to accept the world but clean her plate,&#8221; though also &#8220;damaged,&#8221; agonizes over the fate of another small character in the original <em>Titus</em>: a black baby, the product of an affair between the Goth queen Tamora and Aaron, a Moor. Though marked for murder in Shakespeare&#8217;s play, the infant comes to personify hope in Mac&#8217;s, informing a benediction that cuts through the squalor, as sharp and pure as a ray of sunlight.</p>\n<p><em>Gary</em>, too, is a welcome sign of new life, the work of a truly sui generis talent who, if we&#8217;re lucky, will be blessing Broadway—as a performer, too, hopefully—for years to come.</p>\n<p><strong>Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus opened April 21, 2019, at the Booth Theatre and runs through June 16.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things have gone terribly wrong in this country, but at least we don’t have ballrooms full of corpses (yet).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s more than you can say for the ancient Rome inhabited by Gary, Janice, and Carol, the players in Taylor Mac’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which opened tonight at the Booth Theatre in all its bloody, flatulent, funny, and unexpectedly optimistic splendor.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Titus Andronicus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is Shakespeare’s most gruesome, and perhaps oddest, tragedy. A Roman tale of revenge, betrayal, rape, dismemberment, and infanticidal, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeney</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-style cannibalism-by-pie, it includes no fewer than 14 deaths, all of them grisly. Mac’s sequel picks up after Shakespeare final, gruesome banquet, and it focuses on three bit players from the Bard’s play, a clown promoted to maid, a maid, and a midwife. It’s their job to get things back in order.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/21/gary-a-sequel-to-titus-andronicus-bloody-brilliant/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show opens with Carol, the midwife, popping out through the act curtain and addressing the audience. She’s sets up this sequel, a thing that, she says, “hides inside an ending.” She’s also prodigiously spouting blood and played by the inimitable Julie White, so we have a pretty good idea that what we’re in for will be both viscera-soaked and quite funny. Then Gary, walks on with a mop, a bucket, and a Restoration-comedy tower of hair. Yes, this will be funny.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, with great fanfare, the curtain rises. On more bodies than you can imagine. In a play featuring three comic dynamos—Kristine Nielsen rounds out the </span>cast as Janice, an old hand at Roman housekeeping—and a script by the quicksilver Mr. Mac, Santo Loquasto’s scenic design might be the standout performer. It is outrageous, disgusting, opulent, and hilarious. In the wake of the murderous rampage, there are dead Romans everywhere, and, we’re told by Nielsen’s Janice, she has moved them for storage and processing into a ballroom. (“Ya think this is my first massacre,” she asks Gary, dismissively. “Ya think I sat around idle on the Ides of March?)</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loquasto has built puppet corpses, what look like burlap sacks shaped like humans. They’re dressed in togas, codpieces, various Roman garb. Their penises are all quite noticeably visible, flopping to and fro. They’re blood-stained, and they’re stacked to the ceiling of the grand ballroom that surrounds them. There’s a Rube Goldberg apparatus above them, a covered area to the side where the women and children are stored more discreetly, and a gurney with various medieval-looking apparatus for processing the bodies. It’s both shocking and delightful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In front of that heap (and occasionally atop it), Gary and Janice go about their business. Gary comes from a line of clowns, but he’s seized the opportunity to become a maid as a chance to move up in the world. Janice is resigned to her station in life, and wants to do it well. Gary’s real goal is to become a fool, to use his comedy not just to entertain but to speak truths to power. He gets increasingly caught up in that idea, and decides he wants to stage what he calls a Fooling, which will be an artistic coup, if not a military one. (“I just invented a genre,” he proclaims. “You’re welcome.”)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mac’s script is hilarious, and director George C. Wolfe has assembled for his cast three of the stage’s great comic performers. Lane is in his daffily insiprational mode, and the gifted Nielsen is a mugging, bug-eyed worker bee, channeling Marty Feldman. White is, as ever, droll and deadpan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there’s profundity hidden inside this high comedy. Gary’s performance, his insistence that it’s the only way to move forward, is ultimately the serious point of this very funny show: That the only way to survive horrors is to turn them into art, that comedy must come from tragedy. A few weeks ago, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New York Times Magazine</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> profiled Mac, and he explained that the play is very much a response to a series of tragedies, including the election and his mother’s death. “We are living in a revenge tragedy that’s trying to be a comedy that isn’t succeeding,” he told his interlocutor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gary</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, his characters succeed. Gary pulls off his Fooling. White’s midwife, Carol, who appears halfway through Gary&#8217;s machinations, still alive among the mound of bodies, finds and saves the baby that she believes she’d left to die back in the original play. (Why had she done that? It’s complicated.) Life goes on. One hopes that’s as true offstage as on.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Gary, A Sequel to Titus Andronicus, opened April 21, 2019, at the Booth Theatre and runs through June 16.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the universe is infinite, as we believe that it is, and if we believe in random chance, as we do, then it holds that someplace else out there in this infinite universe, there are other planets much like Earth, on which there are other people much like our own. This is what Laurie Metcalf tells us, perhaps as Laurie Metcalf and perhaps as Hillary Clinton, after she ambles on stage at the start of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hillary and Clinton</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, in which she stars as the titular pantsuit enthusiast, calmly switches on some overhead lights, and finds a hand mic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On such an imaginary Earth-like planet, she continues, there could be a person named Hillary. But Metcalf/Clinton does not invite us to imagine that this Hillary-like person on an Earth-like country is now president; such a desperately appealing alternative reality is not, alas, with playwright Lucas Hnath has in mind. Rather, we are to imagine that this Hillary-like person is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">campaigning</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the presidency. In 2008. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s when the hulking, angled, bright-white set—if James Turrell had made it, you’d wait patiently to climb aboard, and you’d be required to put booties over your shoes—slides downstage, and Metcalf, now definitely Hillary, steps onto it. We’re in a New Hampshire hotel room, and Hillary is losing the primary to an upstart named Barack Obama. She pulls on a patterned Patagonia fleece, the kind suitable to long walks in the Westchester woods. And then she calls Bill, and asks him to come north.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/18/hillary-and-clinton-peering-inside-the-private-lives-of-a-power-couple/\"><em>Read Michael Sommers’ </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s when it’s clear: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hillary and Clinton</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an intriguing, fulfilling sketch of a fantasy that opened tonight at the Golden Theatre, is not </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The West Wing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a counterfactual of a competent, kind, White House to comfort us amid its opposite. It is instead </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M*A*S*H</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, looking back at an earlier war, to help us understand our current quagmire. The situation is real, or realish: the three characters arguing are Hillary, Bill, and Hillary’s campaign strategist, Mark Penn, and Hillary really did barely eke out a win. But the interactions are imagined: It’s the hard look we all wish we take at the Clintons’ marriage behind closed doors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re going to watch scenes from a marriage, you could do worse to have the combatants portrayed by Metcalf and her Bill, John Lithgow. The two actors, like the two Clintons, are big, controlling people with big, commanding presences. Neither attempts an impersonation (as Hnath’s scripts instructs them not to). Your focus, therefore, moves from what they look like to what they’re saying. What we’re watching is the world’s most competently performed therapeutic role-play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the therapy, as Hnath has ably constructed it, isn’t for the Clintons; it is for us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, nothing really happens during </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hillary and Clinton</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Hill and Bill stand in a hotel room, sometimes they sit, and they occasionally hug and occasionally fight. Sometimes, campaign strategist Mark (an equally forceful Zak Orth) argues with them. Eventually, Barack Obama appears (in the less convincing form of Peter Francis James), and he plays hard ball. Instead, for 90 minutes or so, it’s simply an imagination of what life must be like for this unusual couple.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bill is hangdog when he needs to be, and manipulative. He craves Hillary’s attention and affirmation. Hillary never lets him forget Monica, because how could she. Hillary is exhausted and beleaguered. She’s jealous of Bill’s easy ability to connect with a crowd, and sad about the shit she’s has to endure. “When do I get this magnificent version of Bill that everyone else seems to get except for me,” she asks. “ I would very much love to spend some time with him and to get the chance to feel the way all of those other people get to feel.” She considers the merits of divorce, and knows it would be good for her, but she also knows she could never do it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mostly, though, she allows Hnath to articulate an observation that makes perfect sense, that is perhaps Hillary’s tragedy: What if everything she had to do to get through being Bill’s wife, the control and the discipline and, yes, the repression needed to persevere through the women and blue dress the impeachment and, yes, the vast right-wing conspiracy — and don’t tell me, on Bob Barr Day, that there’s no such thing — what if all of those things that allowed her to reach a point where she was a serious contender for the presidency, what if they are the things that made her unrelatable, perhaps unlikeable, insufficiently humanized to win?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is perhaps not the world’s most original observation. But portrayed within the bounds of this relationship, by these fine actors on this crucible of a set and under Joe Mantello’s expertly controlled direction, it is deeply provocative. (The pitch-perfect costumes—for a while, Bill appears for no good reason in those joggers’ short short you’ll never quite forget from 1992—are by Rita Ryack, and the striking set and lights are by Chloe Lamford and Hugh Vanstone.)</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hillary and Clinton</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, unlike its subjects, is arguably inconsequential. It’s a slim, impressionistic portrait. But it’s just enough. With this production, these actors, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this marriage</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a little bit is a lot.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hillary and Clinton opened April 18, 2019, at the Golden Theatre and runs through June 23.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A smart entertainment, <em>Hillary and Clinton</em> offers an inside look at the dynamics of a power couple—an extremely powerful couple—who can’t live with each other and yet who can’t live without each other.</p>\n<p>Think of it as <em>Private Lives</em> involving Public Figures.</p>\n<p>A remarkable performance by Laurie Metcalf and quite a sympathetic one by John Lithgow, two superb actors playing at the top of their exceptional games in the title roles, make this offbeat comedy a must-see for savvy viewers who cannot be bothered with the usual tourist crap on Broadway.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/18/hillary-and-clinton-couples-therapy-for-the-audience/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Cleverly composed by Lucas Hnath, <em>Hillary and Clinton</em> riffs on what Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bill Clinton could have said and might have done in a motel room in New Hampshire at the time of a presidential primary held a million years ago, back in 2008.</p>\n<p>All this, and Barack Obama, too, who drops in to suss out what those two smarties are up to.</p>\n<p>Intrigued? If not, then probably you should skip it: These 90-minute doings at the John Golden Theatre, where the production premiered on Thursday, will register as insubstantial to viewers who won’t play along with Hnath’s game.</p>\n<p>Hnath’s previous play, <em>A Doll’s House, Part 2</em>, required audiences to know something about Ibsen’s original in order to appreciate it. In <em>Hillary and Clinton</em>, Hnath provides some what-ifs and references to history, but otherwise expects the audience to complete a number of blanks regarding how the Clintons might deal with each other.</p>\n<p>Hnath inserts numerous pauses into the text as the characters contemplate each other or consider their own thoughts. These stretches of silence can be eloquent (or merely empty) depending upon what viewers read into them. In this way the play ventures beyond the merely fictional into fantasy.</p>\n<p>Casually clad in sweatpants, a turtleneck, and slippers, Metcalf walks out into designer Chloe Lamford’s elegantly abstract setting and begins talking in what is seemingly her own voice.</p>\n<p>Metcalf remarks upon the infinite nature of the universe, in which an infinite number of planet earths might exist, and notes how there might be one situated many light years away from here that is only slightly different from our own. On that distant planet Earth there is a notable woman named Hillary who is striving to become president of the United States. And she also happens to be married to a man named Bill, who once was the president.</p>\n<p>By now, Metcalf has assumed the character of this alternative Hillary, who is in anxious conversation with Mark, her campaign manager, about the impending primary election that she appears to be losing. Worse, the campaign coffers are nearly empty. Going against Mark’s urgent advice, Hillary summons Bill, her semi-estranged husband, to help her out. “My campaign is not a cure for your boredom,” she warns him.</p>\n<p>Identified only as Hillary and Bill in the program, they struggle to get over old hurts and betrayals. He’s lonely and feels like his best years are behind him. She expresses frustration at watching lesser individuals get ahead of her. Their personalities frequently are at odds.</p>\n<p>“People don’t like people who make them feel like shit,” he tells her.</p>\n<p>“How about if ‘people’ grow the fuck up?” she snaps back.</p>\n<p>There is even serious talk of divorce. Yet in spite of their significant differences, when an opponent named Barack arrives, Hillary and Bill smoothly mesh into perfect partnership to deal with his advances.</p>\n<p>Neither Metcalf nor Lithgow attempt to imitate the voices and manners of the actual Clintons. Yet in some magical alchemy as the play progresses, the actors eerily resemble them, especially Metcalf, whose sardonic Hillary evidently burns with a white-hot flame beneath a usually cool and guarded surface. The give-and-take ease of their performances is marvelous.</p>\n<p>Peter Francis James lends Barack a cheerful smile and a wary sense of confidence. Zak Orth depicts Mark with a dozen varying degrees of frustration.</p>\n<p>This relatively light, often amusing, and yet challenging play is smoothly staged by director Joe Mantello. The understated perfection of his production, which supports the play so subtly, is a tribute to Mantello’s unerring taste as well as to the excellence of the designers.</p>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Hillary and Clinton opened April 18, 2019, at the Golden Theatre and runs through June 23.

Photo: Matthew Murphy.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>First, a confession: Unlike many critics, I didn&#8217;t go bonkers for Rachel Chavkin’s staging of <em>Natasha, Pierre &amp; The Great Comet of 1812</em>—or the musical itself, for that matter. The production&#8217;s heavy-handed slamming of the fourth wall on and off-Broadway, with actors melodramatically darting among audience members (at Ars Nova and then Kazino) or facing them with the aid of onstage seating and runways reaching into the mezzanine (later, at the Imperial Theatre) did little to make Dave Malloy&#8217;s elusive melodies more compelling as songs blurred into recitative, or to endear me to characters who, for all the show&#8217;s hip cachet—not to mention its canonical source (Tolstoy&#8217;s <em>War and Peace</em>)—could seem surprisingly simplistic.</p>\n<p>I mention this not as a gratuitous gripe, but because Chavkin&#8217;s latest Broadway outing, <em>Hadestown</em>, is another work that&#8217;s mostly sung through, qualifying as more of a pop or folk opera (as it’s been described), or operetta, than a conventional musical. Once again, it arrives on Broadway after an acclaimed run downtown—and in this case, a whole string of incarnations prior to that. Composer/lyricist/librettist Anaïs Mitchell is a singer/songwriter whose critically praised albums include an earlier version of <em>Hadestown</em>, which started life as a community theater project more than a decade ago. It&#8217;s since been developed with Chavkin, with its most recent stagings in Edmonton, Canada and at London&#8217;s National Theatre.</p>\n<p>The <em>Hadestown</em> that just premiered at the Walter Kerr Theatre began ominously, for me, with the marvelous André De Shields, playing Hermes, the messenger god, introducing characters culled from Greek mythology and drama, including the Fates and a chorus. The performers took turns stepping forward as the onstage band—whose members would be introduced individually during the show— accompanied them on the blues-inflected opening number, &#8220;Road to Hell.&#8221; <em>This is not your grandparents&#8217; musical</em>, I imagined them all telling the audience. <em>We</em>’<em>re going to be dark and cool, and not insult your intelligence by making you suspend disbelief. </em></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/17/hadestown-red-hot-and-bluesy-score-fuels-a-trip-to-hell-and-back/\"><em>Read Michael Sommers’ </em>★★★★☆<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>But this time, I&#8217;m happy to say, my skepticism proved less warranted. For starters, Mitchell is a gifted tunesmith, and lyricist, who approaches musical theater with a clear, infectious sense of wonder. Her melodic savvy, if not entirely consistent over a run time of nearly two and a half hours with little spoken dialogue, is buttressed by an ear for piercing, haunting harmonies, abetted here by musical director and vocal arranger Liam Robinson.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Mitchell and, to her credit, Chavkin have mined a beautiful and theatrically resonant tale from their source material. If there are traces of the pretensions that marred <em>Natasha</em> in this heavily stylized production, the director and her lavishly talented design team remain in service to the story, which ties together the myths of Orpheus and Eurydice, respectively played by Reeve Carney and Eva Noblezada, and Hades and Persephone, played by Patrick Page and Amber Gray.</p>\n<p>Page, the elder statesman in this group, lays the dark foundation as king of the underworld, his basso voice dropping to gravelly depths as he surveys his captors and eyes potential recruits. In a moment that&#8217;s both chilling and a welcome flash of comic relief, his Hades tilts down a pair of sunglasses to check out Noblezada&#8217;s Eurydice, a ripe ragamuffin whose sweetly piquant vocals bring to mind Mitchell&#8217;s, but with less of a rootsy edge and more theater polish.</p>\n<p>Carney&#8217;s Orpheus is very much Page&#8217;s foil, singing in a keening tenor that reaches to a startlingly clear, pure falsetto when he is wooing Eurydice or, later, trying to persuade Hades to release her. In Mitchell&#8217;s version, Eurydice descends to the underworld not as the result of a poisonous snake bite, but of her own accord, after Hades appeals to her hunger and anguish as she wanders in a storm, while an oblivious Orpheus works on his music.</p>\n<p>Gray&#8217;s Persephone, meanwhile, prances and stumbles about in an alcoholic haze, her sexy but unsettling presence and exotic beauty suggesting a mythological Billie Holiday. She, DeShields and the trio of wonderful singers cast as the Fates (Jewelle Blackman, Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer and Kay Trinidad) ensure that <em>Hadestown</em> provides soulful entertainment, even when the show threatens to get mired in a Big Statement—the bombastic production number &#8220;Why We Build the Wall,&#8221; for instance, bound to inspire comparisons between Hades and another autocratic leader closer to home.</p>\n<p>David Neumann&#8217;s muscular but lyrical choreography and Rachel Hauck&#8217;s set design, which captures the dusky decadence and spiritual squalor of Hades&#8217;s realm, also deserve praise, as do Michael Krass&#8217;s costumes, which combine Brechtian austerity (the shades of grey worn by Hermes and the Fates, for example) with purposefully gaudy and exuberant flourishes, such as the fabulous green number Persephone models upon her entrance, and to welcome spring. If there is more darkness than light in <em>Hadestown</em>, there&#8217;s also a tender love story—two, in fact, one ending on a more hopeful note than you might expect—and songs and performances that will lift mortal spirits, from wherever they lurk.</p>\n<p><strong>Hadestown opened April 17, 2019, at the Walter Kerr Theatre and runs through September 1.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A new Broadway musical that takes audiences to hell and back, <em>Hadestown</em> looks and sounds terrific, and yet it lacks something vital. Drawn from a classical Greek legend, the musical somehow reminds me of a handsome ancient statue that is missing its head.</p>\n<p>True, the tuner that opened on Wednesday does not always make sense, nor is its text so faithful to the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice from which it is drawn. Fortunately, the show is brilliantly staged and designed, and there’s no denying the infernal red-hot charms of the jazzy, jumping, blues-streaked score created by songwriter Anaïs Mitchell.</p>\n<p>Evolving over a dozen years, <em>Hadestown</em> first gained attention as a concept album in 2010. Director Rachel Chavkin (of <em>Natasha, Pierre &amp; The Great Comet of 1812</em> repute) subsequently began developing this project with Mitchell, who also wrote the libretto and flavorful lyrics.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/17/hadestown-anais-mitchells-myths-and-hymns-from-way-downtown/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>A dozen more songs were crafted before the musical premiered at New York Theatre Workshop in 2016. Between then and its appearance now at the Walter Kerr Theatre, the show was performed in Canada and at the Royal National Theatre in London.</p>\n<p>The mostly sung-through saga of <em>Hadestown</em> transpires above and below the earth, which ace set designer Rachel Hauck imaginatively depicts. The upper world is a 1930s honky-tonk New Orleans, while a steampunk-style industrial hell glowers down below. A lively seven-member band, seated on risers flanking the action, blares out Mitchell’s rhythmical, often raucous music that propels the show along swiftly.</p>\n<p>Ancient deities and semi-mortals keep their Greek names and traits but otherwise are Americanized and duded up by designer Michael Krass in fanciful Depression era clothes.</p>\n<p>Narrating this “old tale from way back when” as Hermes is a hip-swiveling, finger-wagging Andre De Shields, shimmying away in his most vivacious manner. Eurydice (Eva Noblezada) is a runaway waif who succumbs to the boyish Orpheus (Reeve Carney), a guitar-strumming musician intent on completing a song that will make a barren world bloom again.</p>\n<p>Colliding with their romance is the troubled twosome of vernal queen Persephone (Amber Gray) and Hades (Patrick Page), the ruler of the underworld who forges his realm into a cross between a foundry and a sweatshop. With Orpheus preoccupied searching for the lost chord or something like for his unfinished song, Hades seduces Eurydice into hooking up with him down in Hadestown, which she shortly realizes is not the paradise she was promised.</p>\n<p>And so it’s up to Orpheus to journey below to rescue Eurydice. Can he possibly?</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s mythical musical features three Fates, raffish songbirds who play instruments and sweeten the score with their voices, and a hulking chorus of five workers who vigorously toil through David Neumann’s muscular choreography, which is often magnified by the set&#8217;s triple turntable and designer Bradley King’s extremely dramatic multi-colored lighting effects.</p>\n<p>The chorus of workers, the Fates, and these atmospherics powerfully merge for “Why We Build the Wall,” the show’s most memorable sequence. This is a rhythmic, dirge-like anthem led by Page, who accents Hades as a big ole Deep South Daddy type with a rumbling basso voice. Hades exhorts his followers into building a wall to keep them free of an enemy—“Because we have and they have not/Because they want what we have got”—although why people are fighting to get <em>into</em> Hell seems puzzling. This dark hymn to isolationism, by the way, was composed by Mitchell in 2010, long before Donald Trump was little more than a punchline.</p>\n<p>Performances, for the most part, are fine. As always, André De Shields is a crowd-pleaser. Amber Gray, who portrays Persephone as a wild party girl whenever she gets sprung from down below, is a saucy pleasure to watch. Patrick Page’s diabolical presence dominates the proceedings. Eve Noblezada gives Eurydice an earnest nature and clear, bright vocals.</p>\n<p>The weak link is Reeve Carney, whose lightweight Orpheus is underwritten and whose tenor at times wavers towards falsetto. There’s too little heat to the young couple’s relationship, which perhaps is why the musical lacks punch in spite of its rousing score. Such absence of emotional resonance, as well as lapses in character motivation in the storyline, are flaws partly masked by the striking stagecraft of Rachel Chavkin’s sterling production.</p>\n<p>While <em>Hadestown</em> scarcely shapes up into an essential Broadway destination, it is among the better attractions in what so far has been a lackluster season for musicals. Let’s hope that it doesn’t take another dozen years for the splendidly talented Anaïs Mitchell to deliver the score for her next musical.</p>\n<p><strong>Hadestown opened April 17, 2019, at the Walter Kerr Theatre and runs through September 1.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>There’s a gorgeous moment in <em>Burn This</em> between Keri Russell, Adam Driver, and a book of matches. Russell’s character, dancer-turned-choreographer Anna, is struggling to start a fire. Driver’s Pale, the volatile brother of Anna’s late roommate, leans in and strikes a match. And for a few brief blazing seconds, you can practically see sparks fly.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that heated moment happens in the final scene. Otherwise, Russell and Driver possess precious little chemistry in Michael Mayer’s tepid revival of Lanford Wilson’s 1987 play.</p>\n<p>When we first meet Anna, she’s grieving the loss of her roommate, dance partner, and friend Robbie, who died in a boating accident with his lover Dom. She’s assuaging her anger with vodka and complaints—railing against the tacky coffin (“There was this great baroque maroon-and-gold casket with these ormolu geegaws all over it”), the clueless family (“In about eight seconds I know they have no idea that Robbie’s gay”), and her miscasting as the grieving widow (“I’d have given fifty dollars for a veil”). Her boyfriend, moneyed screenwriter Burton (David Furr), is there to listen.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/16/burn-this-1987-dramatic-firecracker-no-longer-pops/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Her other roommate, ad exec Larry (Brandon Uranowitz, making the most of the clichéd gay sidekick role), is there to offer support and quips where necessary; he concurs on the tacky coffin: “It looked like a giant Spode soup tureen.” She’s tired. She’s hurting. So when Pale bursts in like a bat out of hell—ostensibly to retrieve his late brother’s belongings—it’s not terribly surprising that Anna quickly succumbs to his peculiar charms. And they are indeed peculiar. Pale on Anna, Larry, and Robbie’s loft apartment: “He lived in this joint? I mean no personal disparagement of the neighborhood in which you have your domicile, honey, but this street’s dying of crotch rot.… Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it’s supposed to be arty, I know. It’s quaint. Look at it—you should make automobile parts here. It’s a fuckin’ factory.”</p>\n<p>Driver—a recent Oscar nominee for Spike Lee’s <em>BlacKkKlansman</em>, and a megastar thanks to his role as Kylo Ren, née Ben Solo, in the <em>Star Wars</em> films—has always been a fine stage actor (highlights: 2009’s <em>The Retributionists</em> and 2012’s <em>Look Back in Anger</em>), but he’s a veritable force here. He makes the most of Pale’s cocaine-fueled quirkiness—pulling off his $245 “genuine lizard shoes” that are “fuckin’ killing” his foot, demanding to know why because “you’d think a lizard’s got to be supple, right?”—without taking it over the top. And he seems to have a genuine rapport with TV vet Russell (<em>Felicity</em>, <em>The Americans</em>), who’s perhaps too inhibited but considerably more at ease than she was 15 years ago in Neil LaBute’s <em>Fat Pig</em>. (Though she spends <em>way</em> too much time playing with her hair.)</p>\n<p>Despite what the promos for this revival would have you believe, the actors playing Pale and Anna don’t necessarily require house-on-fire chemistry. Wilson didn’t write a smoldering love story. He wrote a romantic comedy—and what they need is a burning <em>need</em> for each other. They both have massive holes in their lives thanks to Robbie’s death. They’re broken. (At one point, Anna even likens Pale to a bird with a broken wing.) Think Frankie and Johnny. Actually, it’s fitting that Terrence McNally wrote a program note for this production; the unlikely lovers in his <em>Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune</em>, which also premiered off-Broadway in 1987, are cut from the same cloth as Anna and Pale. This “love shit”—as Wilson once described the crux of <em>Burn This</em>—is tricky business.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Burn This</em> opened April 16, 2019, at the Hudson Theatre and runs through July 14.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Lanford Wilson’s <em>Burn This</em> caused a stir when it arrived on Broadway in the fall of 1987, buoyed by a Tony Award-winning performance by the leading lady and an electrifying one by the leading man. This combination was enough to secure a full year’s run, even though the play itself did not stand out in a season dominated by <em>M. Butterfly </em>and <em>Speed-the-Plow</em>.</p>\n<p>Thirty years later, a Broadway revival of the play was announced as the opening attraction of the newly restored Hudson Theatre on West 44th Street, with movie star Jake Gyllenhaal as the main attraction. Plans were ultimately scuttled and the project scrapped (with Gyllenhaal opening the Hudson in an altogether different production, <em>Sunday in the Park with George</em>).</p>\n<p>After two years, the revival has finally opened at the same theater but with a different star and different producers; the director behind the project, Michael Mayer (of <em>Spring Awakening</em>), remains. What is revealed is a facile but overdrawn comedy-drama which is highly entertaining much of the time, with too much of <em>that</em> time spent on wild theatrics and glib characters cracking wise.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/16/burn-this-keri-russell-and-adam-driver-lack-sizzle/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The setup is familiar to anyone accustomed to Hollywood: attractive woman (Keri Russell) with on-again/off-again good-guy suitor (David Furr) meets the altogether wrong man (Adam Driver) and, yes, you know what happens. They even have a contemporary (circa 1987) Thelma Ritter character, in this place not a housekeeper but a very-much gay roommate (Brandon Uranowitz) seemingly drawn explicitly for laughs.</p>\n<p>The curtain rises on deftly-paced dialogue with deeply humorous colors, despite funereal subject matter. This turns into a three-way, try-to-guess-the-connections light comedy until the door is more or less beaten in by a zombie from outer space. Or rather, a blue-collar Neanderthal jerk from New Jersey, who from his first roar and grumble is clearly gonna be the Guy who Gets the Girl. This turns out to be a fiery mismatched romance. The play is called <em>Burn This</em>, with fire references in the smoldering relationship and even the staging.</p>\n<p>The entrance of the character Pale—who turns out to be, if you follow this, the older brother of the girl’s deceased gay-dancer-soulmate and roommate to both the girl and the resident jokemeister—sets the play spinning, as it is clearly intended to do. But Mr. Driver, who is a stage and screen actor of some repute, is left—well, spinning. As he careens from brutish to tender to comic buffoon, you might well sit there wondering: what?</p>\n<p>At least, I did. Not having seen nor read <em>Burn This</em>, and not recalling the original casting, I thought: This play cannot convincingly work without an actor who can make sense of Pale, and where are you going to find someone who can do that? Which set me on the internet during intermission, where I found a satisfactory and thoroughly explanatory answer: the role was originated by, and seemingly written to order for, John Malkovich. Who at that time was an undeniably talented and undeniably eccentric actor destined for stardom. This arrived on screen the very next year, when he left <em>Burn This</em> after six months to star opposite Glenn Close in <em>Dangerous Liaisons</em>, and we have never seen him on Broadway since.</p>\n<p>Now, it is unprofitable and perhaps unfair to judge a new revival against a performance last seen three decades back. But when we consider that this role was created by Malkovich, it suddenly illuminates Driver’s all-but-impossible task. Malkovich had directed notable productions of Wilson&#8217;s <em>Balm in Gilead</em> at Steppenwolf in 1980 and 1984 (the latter of which, with Laurie Metcalf and Gary Sinise in the cast, transferred to a successful New York run), so the playwright was personally familiar with him when he wrote <em>Burn This</em>.</p>\n<p>With an actor like Malkovich blustering around the stage engaging in wild rage mixed with instant transitions into wild comedy and even unexpected tenderness, <em>Burn This</em> might well work; not so much dramatically, but as entertainment. What we get at the Hudson is a Pale who does not quite connect with his character, from scene to scene, and who therefore cannot be expected to have chemistry with his counterpart. Russell—best known for her long-running role on <em>The Americans</em>—acquits herself well in her Broadway debut, but can’t quite counterbalance her scene-companion’s histrionics as well as Joan Allen presumably did back in 1987.</p>\n<p>The cast is rounded out by Furr (a Tony nominee for the 2016 revival of <em>Noises Off</em>), who is charming enough as the rich screenwriter the girl can’t quite commit herself to; and Uranowitz, a bundle of ethnic energy who has brightened five shows in four seasons and does so once again, stereotype or no. Derek McLane gives us one of those sets—a sparsely furnished downtown loft—that you’d just like to move into on Monday. Clint Ramos takes every opportunity to make his costumes add to our enjoyment, while Natasha Katz provides her usual expert lighting.</p>\n<p>Mayer stages the play efficiently, under the circumstances. What the play needs, it seems, is the severe editing and trimming that you can’t easily accomplish with a revival of a play by a deceased playwright. One gets the sense, in numerous instances, of conversations prolonged to allow the author more jokes. Said jokes are often colorful, mind you; and frequently, in the hands of Mr. Uranowitz, sharp. But they are not helpful to the play.</p>\n<p>Wilson (1937-2011) created <em>Burn This</em> in collaboration with Marshall Mason, his longtime director and the co-founder of the Circle Rep producing organization, which originated the play. Their earlier collaboration, the 1980 Pulitzer-winner <em>Talley’s Folly</em>, was notable for its brevity; one of the two characters actually comes out at the beginning and <em>tells</em> us that the play will take 97 minutes, which it does. <em>Burn This</em>, at the Hudson, runs 2:30 and feels it.</p>\n<p><strong>Burn This opened April 16, 2019, at the Hudson Theatre and runs through July 14.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The original Broadway cast of Jez Butterworth’s <em>The Ferryman</em>, most of whom had played the piece together in London, was altogether superb. With a richly dense masterwork of this sort, the performers—in rehearsal, during the Royal Court premiere, in preparation for the West End transfer, and once again working together toward the Broadway opening in October—benefited from repeated access to the author and director. Which can’t be expected with replacement actors or future productions.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, dramatic classics of this caliber have enough built into the script to allow any subsequent group of actors—suitably cast and properly directed—to do equally well. Few of us saw the original author-supervised productions of <em>Death of a Salesman</em>, <em>Long Day’s Journey</em>, <em>Raisin in the Sun,</em> or <em>King Lear</em>. So there’s only so much to be said for the inherent advantage of seeing the original cast.</p>\n<p>All of which is to say that <em>The Ferryman</em>, now with American actors in 17 of the 22 roles, is every bit as powerful as it was when it opened on Broadway in October and in London in 2017. Give credit, foremost, to the playwright for creating such a towering edifice of a play. We needn’t once more praise the text, the author, or director Sam Mendes (along with his design team); said praise can be found virtually across the critical board.</p>\n<p>[<em>Read earlier reviews of The Ferryman <a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/10/21/the-ferryman-an-irish-masterwork-from-jez-butterworth/\">on Broadway</a></em> <em>and <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/london-aisle-review-ferry-over-troubled-waters_b_5a181715e4b0bf1467a84620\">in London</a></em>.]</p>\n<p>The central role of Quinn Carney is now undertaken by Brian d’Arcy James, who has always been a strong dramatic actor (<em>Time Stands Still</em>) despite his continued success in musical comedy (<em>Something Rotten!</em>). He is sternly compelling here, with that trademark scowl of his—underlined by those heavy eyebrows—bringing added expressiveness to key emotional moments. At other times, he aptly embodies an overtaxed father at the mercy of his adolescent daughters. Emily Bergl (<em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em>) takes on the role of the invalid wife, Mary. I have thus far seen three Quinns and three Marys, all of them excellent; but the struggle between husband and wife, as brought out in the last-act dissection of their estrangement, has never played so well for me. (“We said <em>two or three months</em>,” says Bergl, in a stabbing manner that explains it all.) And as she distractedly descends that long staircase, I had a brief flash of Mary Tyrone, intentional or not.</p>\n<p>Mark Lambert, who originated the loquacious Uncle Patrick, and Dearbhla Molloy who did the same for the ornery Aunt Patricia, were unmatchable, or so it seemed. Yet, two familiar New York character actors step into the roles and give performances every bit as vibrant while adding newly-found nuance. Fred Applegate has heretofore specialized in musical comedy (<em>Young Frankenstein</em>, <em>Sister Act</em>) to the extent that one might have expected him to fill Patrick with charismatic blarney and let it go at that. Instead, his digging into the character displays added relevance to the discussion of Charon, Virgil’s mythical ferryman on the River Styx, and enhances his stinging rebuke of the family priest upon discovering his duplicity.</p>\n<p>Ann McDonough, last seen to good effect as a biased school administrator in Joshua Harmon’s <em>Admissions</em>, also does more than replicate her predecessor’s vicious, Maggie Thatcher-bashing termagant. There is a physical vulnerability to McDonough—the way she gingerly crosses the kitchen, for example, so as to hide her painful infirmity from the others—that pays off when we learn of the events of the 1916 Easter Rebellion, which turned her irremediably bitter.</p>\n<p>Fionnula Flanagan, now in her final week, is giving an unforgettable and altogether brilliant performance as Aunt Maggie Faraway. (The estimable Blair Brown takes over the role on April 16.) Also on hand from the London and original Broadway casts is Charles Dale as Father Horrigan. Either he has gotten stronger or my increasing familiarity with the text has allowed me to pay more attention to the character. Dale embodies the conflicted priest, with his own moral dilemma amplified as he more clearly registers his complicit guilt.</p>\n<p>Also now featured is Shuler Hensley as Tom Kettle. I have in my prior visits mused—despite the program listings—that it might actually be Hensley up there on stage; he&#8217;s an actor who specializes in expressing an inner realty within hulking/menacing characters, previously winning an Olivier and a Tony in the process. (Could Butterworth have been thinking of Hensley when he devised the role?) In his hands, Tom Kettle appears to be a man of some sensitivity tortured by the awareness that he doesn’t have the verbal or emotional ability to ably communicate his thoughts. This makes his dinner-table speech, his late-night scene with Caitlin, and his final entrance with Oisin even more affecting than before.</p>\n<p>In fairness, let us note that two of the principals are not thus far as strong as their predecessors. Holley Fain can’t be expected to match Laura Donnelly, who not only created the role of Caitlin but more or less lived it in Belfast. (Her uncle was one of the 16 Irish Catholics who were “disappeared” during the Troubles. When Donnelly related her family history to Butterworth, her partner, he started to conceive this fictionalized account.) Fain, a relative newcomer, doesn’t yet display the authority to rule over the stage as Donnelly did. Ralph Brown is fine as the IRA leader Muldoon, but doesn’t have those smiles that chill you to the bone that his predecessor did.</p>\n<p>One of the complexities of <em>The Ferryman</em> is the mystery behind the disappearance and death of Quinn’s unseen brother Seamus. Butterworth carefully leaves this unspecified for the audience, just as it is for the extended Carney family. On a fourth viewing, one can glean that the author has carefully spelled this out in plain sight, albeit in a purposely oblique manner. Skip the following paragraph if you don’t want to know.</p>\n<p>The action takes place in August 1981, at the end of the 1981 Hunger Strike. Bobby Sands, the first of the victims, died on May 5, 1981. Piecing random threads together, we learn that: The “newsboy” was first spotted by Muldoon at the funeral; that they had their “wristwatch” meeting in early June; that the laundry van incident occurred four weeks before the date of the play; and that the event “in the boarded up house on the Palace Road,” which precipitates the play, occurred a week after the bombing—and thus, within weeks of the opening scene. All of which only supports the conclusion that every line and action of the play is carefully wrought by Butterworth, with nothing extraneous. Except maybe for that darlin’ Cleopatra.</p>\n<p><em>The Ferryman</em> is not to be missed. It is a great pleasure to discover that this production remains just as strong with the replacement cast of American actors. Yes, the play is every bit as good as they say; and yes, people interested in becoming lifelong theatergoers should seize this opportunity to see a future classic play in its original form before it closes on July 7. (Word to the wise: tickets are likely more available now than they will be after the play inevitable takes a clutch of Tony nominations on April 30.) And those who have thus far shied away in fear of three-plus hours of harsh accents can now rest easy. Although they most certainly <em>won’t</em> rest easy during the emotionally thrilling, edge-of-the-seat gripping, seriously funny and altogether heartwarming <em>Ferryman</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>The Ferryman opened October 21, 2018, at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre (with the replacement cast beginning February 19, 2019) and runs through July 7.

For this fan, though, Nunn tried too hard to illuminate what was already obvious: that the show, like all Rodgers and Hammerstein gems, recognized both the bitter and sweet in its subject matter—in this case, life in early-20th century farm territory grasping towards statehood—with a frankness that was well ahead of its time. (How many musicals can you think of that feature a porn-ogling, trigger-happy stalker as a principal character?)</p>\n<p>So it was with some trepidation that I approached the new, homegrown, more radically reimagined revival of <em>Oklahoma!</em> that just opened at Circle in the Square, again following another acclaimed staging—two, in fact, both of which I cravenly avoided.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong: I fully endorse the premise that great American musicals should be as open to new interpretations as any classic theater. But as anyone who&#8217;s sat through a clunky or pretentious take on, say, Shakespeare could tell you, not all innovation is created equal.</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m relieved to report that Broadway&#8217;s new <em>Oklahoma!</em> is not as joyless as its last was, this is, in truth, faint praise. As John Lahr wrote in his perceptive review of Nunn&#8217;s staging, in <em>The New </em><em>Yorker</em>, &#8220;American optimism has its root in abundance and in the vastness of the land that <em>Oklahoma!</em> celebrates. Britain, on the other hand, is an island the size of Utah. Its culture is one of scarcity; its preferred idiom is irony—a language of limits.&#8221; (The Brits do seem more accepting of bombast, as evidenced by Andrew Lloyd Webber&#8217;s career and the popularity of jukebox musicals abroad.)</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/07/oklahoma-it-may-not-be-necessary-to-21st-century-update-a-classic/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>For director Daniel Fish, who grew up in New Jersey, the issue would seem less cultural and more an overeager desire to dig deeper into characters who have become iconic to musical theater fans, and make their stories more widely accessible to contemporary audiences. Thus we get a Curly who, in Damon Daunno&#8217;s performance, could sooner be pictured fronting an indie band than roping cattle. An actor and musician who accompanies himself on guitar during several songs, Daunno can be endearing and even charming in Curly&#8217;s goofier moments, but he croons Rodgers&#8217;s ravishing melodies in a strained warble that suggests a lounge singer more than a leading man.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s notable that a few members of Fish&#8217;s pared-down company, which consists only of principals and a sprinkling of small roles, list little musical theater experience in their credits. James Davis and Will Brill, respectively cast as the dim-witted but lovable cowboy Will Parker and the lusty peddler Ali Hakim, are superb comedic actors, but if they have an affinity for the sense of heightened reality crucial to a form in which characters regularly burst into song and dance, Fish gives them no real showcase for it. In <em>Kansas City</em>, one of several production numbers stripped down to accommodate the lack of a full ensemble, Davis dances about Circle’s thrust stage with plenty of manic energy but little of the finesse required by Agnes de Mille&#8217;s groundbreaking original choreography, little of which is tapped here.</p>\n<p>Perhaps such touches are supposed to make <em>Oklahoma!&#8217;</em>s characters more relatable for those who eschew musicals as contrived. But in striving for realness, Fish can actually reduce the level of their appeal, or the degree to which they earn our empathy. The latter is especially true for the show&#8217;s darkest figure, the farmhand Jud, a troubled loner obsessed with Curly&#8217;s love interest, Laurey. Though Jud is sometimes played merely as a heavy, better productions have conveyed his own psychological suffering, and pronounced carnality. Here, in Patrick Vaill&#8217;s sulking, seething portrayal, he&#8217;s a walking mug shot, lifted straight from a news report of the latest shooting spree. (In one scene, projection designer Joshua Thorson casts Vaill&#8217;s twitching face larger than life on a screen looming at the back of the set.)</p>\n<p>The women generally fare better. I&#8217;ve certainly never seen a sexier Laurey than that of the radiant Rebecca Naomi Jones; pacing the stage in painted-on jeans, Jones underlines the headstrong independence that made her character a progressive ingénue back in the day. There is a purposefully deadened, affect-less quality to some of her lines, particularly those addressing Jud, who terrifies Laurey. But for the most part, Fish wisely chooses not to suppress the actress&#8217;s natural vivacity. This extends to Jones&#8217;s singing, in an earthy belt that gives way to soft, ethereal top notes; it&#8217;s not the pristinely virtuosic soprano we associate with Laurey, but here, the different approach is both credible and compelling.</p>\n<p>Mary Testa&#8217;s marvelously dry Aunt Eller is, likewise, distinctive while making perfect sense in context, a maternal figure whose wit and wisdom would clearly serve her, and her community, in any setting. As Laurey&#8217;s frisky pal Ado Annie, Ali Stroker injects a tangy country accent into her singing, accommodating the rootsy orchestrations by Daniel Kluger.</p>\n<p>Kluger is also among this <em>Oklahoma!</em>&#8216;s most valuable players, fashioning musical arrangements for only eight musicians (a few play two or three instruments) that capture the harmonic richness and poignance, if not the sweep, of Rodgers&#8217;s score. The vocal parts, too, are cannily handled, so that fewer than a dozen performers infuse numbers normally delivered by at least twice as many voices with heft and beauty. The modern dance sequence offered in lieu of the Dream Ballet, choreographed by John Heginbotham, is more of a mixed bag, with the charismatic dancer Gabrielle Hamilton hurling and writhing to distorted strains of electric guitar. At one point, Hamilton&#8217;s face is projected on screen as mercilessly as Vaill&#8217;s had been earlier, so that our noses are rubbed in both Laurey&#8217;s conflict and Jud&#8217;s derangement.</p>\n<p>These sequences are juxtaposed with fun gestures, from the rows of colored tinsel hanging over Laura Jellinek&#8217;s spare set—which also makes prominent, pointed use of gun racks—to the cups of chili and corn bread distributed onstage during intermission. Fun is not joy, though, and too often in this <em>Oklahoma!</em> I found myself missing the sense of magic and transcendence that comes from seeing life, with all its pleasure and pain, elevated by this particular art form.</p>\n<div>\n<div><strong><b>Oklahoma! </b>opened April 7, 2019, at Circle in the Square and runs through January 19, 2020.

Credit: Little Fang Photo</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The commercial for the newest <em>Oklahoma!</em> revival announces that the superb Oscar Hammerstein II-Richard Rodgers musical has been “rewritten for the 21st century,” which begs the musical question, “Does the classic truly need to be rewritten for the 21st century?</p>\n<p>I’m steadfastly inclined to say it doesn’t. Of course, it’s acceptable for liberties to be taken for any new treatment, which Daniel Fish, directing this one, has done. Much of it is fine and dandy. Moreover, there are any number of elements here that are just plain super as shaped for a version which appeared earlier this season at St. Ann’s, having originated in a 2015 Bard College tryout.</p>\n<p>At St. Ann’s the audience sat on opposite sides of the theater space, and now the audience wraps around the lozenge-shaped area that has a seven-person band—led by Nathan Koci, at one end and a mural showing flat Oklahoma territory at the other end, Set designer Laura Jellinek stations a few tables and wooden folding chairs on the playing area, lighted (sometimes an eerie green) by Scott Zielinski. The numerous rifles which hung on the wall opposite the farm-land mural at St. Ann&#8217;s, are now scattered across the side walls of the auditorium.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/07/oklahoma-back-on-the-farm-but-without-the-bright-golden-haze/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>It’s only fair play to first itemize the many pluses of this handled (not quite manhandled) <em>Oklahoma!</em> tale—taken from the Lynn Riggs’ play, <em>Green Grow the Lilacs</em>. The major dramatic suspense hangs on whether likable, fun-loving Curly McLain (Damon Daunno) or bad ‘un farm hand Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill) will take saucy and independent Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones) to the social that night—and whether or not they’ll ride in a surrey with fringe on top and whether or not complications will arise when they and other folks, like Laurey’s Aunt Eller (Mary Testa), gather round to auction off the young women’s picnic hampers.</p>\n<p>Daunno, who plays his guitar a good bit, and Jones sing out with gusto and swap insults not far from the level of Benedick and Beatrice in William Shakespeare’s <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em>. Testa has fun with Aunt Eller’s orneriness and adds to the evening&#8217;s singing (in a traditionally non-singing role). Special praise has to be aimed the way of Ali Stroker, who’s taken on the prairie-promiscuous Ado Annie. She bounds about with fervor in a wheel chair. It may be that her countrified version of “I Cain’t Say No” is the highest of the highlights on display. James Davis comes purty close with his sung and danced “Everything’s Up to Date in Kansas City.” Will Brill doesn’t lift his voice in song much, but he nails down the meddling peddler well enough, particularly on his “mind your own business” line.</p>\n<p>Speaking of countrified versions: The idea (idey, in this context, to rhyme with “Fridy”) behind this new <em>Oklahoma!</em> is that with statehood looking these homesteaders in the eye, a country-westernized Hammerstein-Rodgers isn’t a stretch. Fer sure, “The Farmer and the Cowboy” gladly lends itself, although composer Rodgers, who was a stickler when it came to hearing his scores exactly as he wrote them, may not have been pleased as punch with all the musical gumption going on. Hammerstein would likely have been more polite. Both would probably have missed the inimitable Robert Russell Bennett orchestrations.</p>\n<p>But okay. Another alteration deserving of a nod is Vaill’s ability to convey Jud’s sinister nature while simultaneously lending him some sympathy for not knowing how to express himself favorably to Laurey and everyone else. Fish enlarges the crafty Jud change by projecting on the tall back wall close-ups of Curly and Jud while they sing &#8220;Pore Jud Is Daid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are, however, a few additional shifts that don’t seem to add 21st-century moxie. Not too troubling is Curly’s entrance. In the original version, the first notes heard—and from off-stage—are Curly’s. He enters while singing, as Aunt Eller, who doesn’t see him, is churning butter. Losing the churning is no big deal—now Aunt Eller looks to be preparing the corn bread which will be served to the audience during intermission—but Curly’s being heard before seen is a loss. Maybe this is minor in 2019, since in 1943, when huge chorus opening numbers were the thing, Curly’s appearance was truly startling. Nevertheless, the entrance as written remains effective.</p>\n<p>Also the absence of the shivaree isn’t criminal. The shivaree? What’s that? A shivaree is (was?) a kind of cheerful-jeerful newly-wed razing. In bookwriter Hammerstein’s script, it takes place late in act two and is geared toward Laurey and Curly. It’s good fun but now it’s been dropped. A small shame, because it could be an amusing backward glance at 20th-century customs for 21st-century onlookers.</p>\n<p>More disturbing at one crucial juncture is John Heginbotham’s choreography. It may be news to some but hardly to all that the original—and ground-breaking—choreography was Agnes de Mille’s. Her great contribution was the dream ballet in which Laurey attempts to decide between Curly and Jud.</p>\n<p>It involved a sizable group of dancers, but now has been reduced to one (Gabrielle Hamilton), wearing a light-reflecting T-shirt that says, “Dream Baby Dream.” Although some of the de Mille movements are kept, the (very long) piece looks like nothing so much as a Vassar senior dance thesis.</p>\n<p>The irritatingly gratuitous 21st-century updating has to do with the fight in which Curly and Jud engage after the wedding. Hammerstein (and Riggs, presumably) call for Jud’s flashing a knife and the ugly ramifications. Fish thinks differently. He has Jud hand Curly a wedding-gift pistol. No further details on that are necessary at the moment, but if the outcome is sanguine, it’s only in the harshest way.</p>\n<p>If the genuinely shocking incident is meant to resonate with our jarring culture, let’s all hope that most of us won’t have to see whatever the 22nd-century update turns out to be. Instead, why don’t we all acknowledge that the 20th-century version is the one that will stand the test of time?</p>\n<p><strong><b>Oklahoma! </b>opened April 7, 2019, at Circle in the Square and runs through January 19, 2020.

Photo: Brigitte Lacombe</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Stick around for a couple of decades and you&#8217;ll get the chance to see any number of venerated actors of a certain age try to tackle the old beast that is <em>King Lear</em>. Since I began covering New York theater back in 2000, I&#8217;ve had the good fortune to witness Christopher Plummer, Frank Langella, John Lithgow and even Kevin Kline, as a spry 59-year-old, having a go at Shakespeare&#8217;s ravaged monarch.</p>\n<p>Like many fans, though, I was especially eager to catch the latest star to play Lear on Broadway, since it would mark only the second time I&#8217;d see her in live performance. Yes, you read that pronoun right: If you didn&#8217;t already know, Glenda Jackson, Commander of the British Empire, plays the title role in Sam Gold&#8217;s new production of the tragedy, revisiting the part that marked her triumphant return to the stage after a sabbatical of more than 20 years, during which Jackson served as a member of Parliament.</p>\n<p>That previous <em>King Lear</em> was staged at London&#8217;s Old Vic in 2016, under the direction of Deborah Warner, renowned for her innovative interpretations of classic works, including her collaborations with another great actress from across the pond, Ireland&#8217;s Fiona Shaw. Having missed that acclaimed staging, I can only speculate that Jackson was as magnificent as she is in this current incarnation—and as generous, for Gold’s <em>Lear </em>is as much a showcase for excellent ensemble acting as it is a star vehicle.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/04/king-lear-glenda-jackson-rants-raves-and-rules/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the leading lady, though, who arrives fresh off her Tony Award-winning turn as a geriatric survivor in last season&#8217;s stunning revival of Edward Albee&#8217;s <em>Three Tall Women</em>. Jackson&#8217;s Lear has something of that character&#8217;s imperious air, but otherwise couldn&#8217;t be more different. Even her physical presence seems completely changed; she&#8217;s all compact, shriveled intensity, albeit with traces of the regal elegance that must have distinguished this king in his prime. Making her entrance in a natty tuxedo, her hair slicked and side-parted so that a lock swings jauntily forward, Jackson suggests John Hurt in one of his more dapper guises—or even David Bowie, had he remained with us a bit longer.</p>\n<p>But gender is not really an issue in this <em>Lear</em>. Speaking her lines in a rich, rusty baritone that projects both masculine authority and the damage wrought by time—not to mention scheming offspring—Jackson delivers a devastating portrait of the king&#8217;s struggle to restore clarity and retain dignity as madness encroaches. She gets expert support from two other actresses cast in traditionally male roles: Jayne Houdyshell, bringing her sharp wit and wrenching poignance to the faithful Earl of Gloucester&#8217;s own struggle with a thankless child, and Ruth Wilson, who does supple double duty (as some scholars believe it was intended) as a palpably clear-eyed, pure-hearted Cordelia, Lear&#8217;s one honest daughter, and his Fool, whom Wilson endows with a cockney accent and a delightful physical buoyance.</p>\n<p>Cordelia&#8217;s nasty siblings provide more thrills and chills in the hands of Aisling O&#8217;Sullivan, cast as a cold-eyed Regan, and Elizabeth Marvel, as a sardonic, hot-to-trot Goneril, who has a moment of blunt carnality with the bastard (in the literal and figurative senses) son of Gloucester, Edmund—played by Pedro Pascal as a sociopathic showman, preening blithely as he regals the audiences with his sinister plans. Other standouts include the masterful John Douglas Thompson, a model of robust decency as the Earl of Kent, and the deaf actor Russell Harvard, who as Regan&#8217;s husband, the Duke of Cornwall, finds a primal urgency in sign language—which Gold uses extensively, having Michael Arden, as Cornwall&#8217;s aide, translate from spoken words, and accompany Harvard with speech.</p>\n<p>Other directorial touches can seem gratuitous, or mannered—notably the inclusion of a string quartet (playing original music by Philip Glass) that steps to the front occasionally, as if to remind us we&#8217;re observing regal folk, however base their behavior. Ann Roth&#8217;s vivid costume design offers more nuance, emphasizing character over specifics of time or place. Marvel and O&#8217;Sullivan are given fussy gowns and, later, more casual wear and accessories that exude narcissism—O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s Regan sports gold bangles, while Marvel&#8217;s Goneril emerges from her tryst clad in only a long, stretchy top—while Wilson&#8217;s Cordelia appears first in basic black, then dresses down in jeans.</p>\n<p>Jackson, of course, gets to go full-out disheveled, at one point romping about in what appears to be a particularly homely pajama set. For an actress who has always eschewed vanity, Lear has clearly provided a prize worth relishing—for her and for us.</p>\n<div><strong><b>King Lear </b>opened April 4, 2019, at the Cort Theatre and runs through June 9.

Photo: Brigitte Lacombe</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Any Shakespeare originalists worried whether a woman playing Lear—the playwright’s, and perhaps all of theater’s, ultimate father figure—will alter the structure of the epic drama can rest easy. In Sam Gold’s production, now at Broadway’s Cort Theatre, as soon as she enters, Glenda Jackson is every inch the king.</p>\n<p>It certainly helps that she’s outfitted in so-called men’s clothing (a very tailored Ann Roth–designed suit), but the costume almost doesn’t matter. When she speaks—“Give me the map there,” she orders, preparing to divvy up the kingdom between eldest daughter Goneril (Elizabeth Marvel), middle daughter Regan (Aisling O’Sullivan), and youngest daughter Cordelia (Ruth Wilson)—she radiates authority. She’s not a woman playing a man; she’s simply a royal. Also, she played the part in London a few years ago, so she’s darn well proved herself by now.</p>\n<p>If you’re there to see Jackson, you won’t be disappointed. Her performance is a study in detail: Notice her perfect posture in the opening court scene—every gesture measured, down to the finger. Then, near the end, as Lear starts to fade away, she’s slouched down and hunched over, not walking but shuffling; it’s the “crawl toward death” that Lear mentions when we first meet him. (Or, as Jackson says it, “cr-r-r-r-r-awl”—rolling the r with relish.)</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/04/king-lear-a-role-fit-for-a-commander/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The rest of Gold’s production lacks that kind of laser focus. The time period is murky; let’s just say it’s after the invention of duct tape, which features prominently in one scene. But there are definite allusions to a certain possibly certifiable current president. Gilded walls…a decorative lion statue…it’s very Trump Tower, no? And an often throwaway line by Gloucester (Tony winner Jayne Houdyshell), the play’s other deluded dad—“’Tis the times’ plague, when madmen lead the blind”—is delivered with a surprising heavy-handedness. Then there’s the onstage eveningwear-clad string quartet, which pops up at the most inopportune times, almost drowning out moments like the Lear-Goneril-Regan fight with Philip Glass music. (That’s the titanic outburst where he calls them “unnatural hags,” and vows revenge: “I will do such things—/ What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be/ The terrors of the earth.”) Also, the Edmund-Edgar-Gloucester subplot loses its oomph: As the illegitimate Edmund, Pedro Pascal doesn’t quite land the Bard’s big baseness-bastardy-base-base monologue, and, resultingly, never wins us over; as his brother, Edgar, Sean Carvajal seems to connect only when he’s speaking with Houdyshell as their father, Gloucester. As for the sons’ deadly duel—the use of guns robs that scene of any excitement.</p>\n<p>One very clever bit of casting: Wilson, fresh from her Golden Globe–winning stint on Showtime’s <em>The Affair</em>, appears as both The Fool and Cordelia—the only two characters willing to speak their minds to the king—and she couldn’t be better. Her Cordelia, who refuses to falsely flatter her father and is promptly disowned, is a model of restraint. And I’ve never seen a Lear and a Fool more connected.</p>\n<p>But the show’s secret weapon might be stage vet John Douglas Thompson, who plays the oft-underappreciated Kent. Incensed after Cordelia’s perceived betrayal, Lear banishes Kent; but good old Kent, sensing Lear might be starting to lose his marbles, disguises himself as a servant so he can stay in the king’s orbit. Whenever this <em>King Lear</em> lags, Thompson gives it a jolt with his mere presence. And his Act 2, Scene 2 attack on one of Goneril’s snotty servants—an insult-laden rant filled with some of Shakespeare’s sickest burns—is almost worth the price of admission. Go for Glenda, but stay to hear Thompson and his “eater of broken meats” speech.</p>\n<p><strong><em>King Lear</em></strong><strong> opened April 4, 2019, at the Cort Theatre and runs through June 9.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I have this fantasy that involves Heidi Schreck, a bunch of women, and MSNBC. It’s one of those innumerable indistinguishable partisan events we’re forced to endure in the endless run-up to a primary election. But here, it’s playwright and actress Schreck, not some cable-news talking head, who gets to ask the questions. Just imagine: Schreck—who, I’m convinced, knows the Constitution more intimately than any potential presidential candidate—getting in passionate discussions over amendments and clauses with Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, and Kirsten Gillibrand. And hey, let’s invite Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke, and Cory Booker to the party. (Sorry, Bernie, only Democrats allowed in my fantasy debate.) It would be brilliant.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, currently at Broadway’s Helen Hayes Theater, we have Schreck’s inventive, invigorating <em>What the Constitution Means to Me</em>, fresh from fall 2018 runs at off-Broadway’s New York Theatre Workshop and Greenwich House (she developed and debuted the show at Clubbed Thumb). This is what got me thinking about Schreck and Kamala and company.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/03/31/what-the-constitution-means-to-me-heidi-schreck-explains-it-all-for-you/\">[<em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>If the title sounds like a high school civics-class assignment, that’s the point. The year is 1989, and Schreck, a 15-year-old from Wenatchee, Wash., obsessed with theater, witchcraft, and Patrick Swayze (same, girl), is traveling the country giving speeches about the Constitution at American Legion halls. Not just for fun—for prize money, which paid for her entire college education. “Thank you,” she tells the applauding audience. “It was 30 years ago and it was a state school, but thank you.”</p>\n<p>But it was more than just a moneymaking scheme cooked up by her debate-coach mom. Schreck has a visible, and contagious, passion for the subject—and a gift for conveying it to the crowd. She uses words like “miraculous.” By the time she’s done you’ll be using them too.</p>\n<p>While it’s certainly not a lecture, the show is undoubtedly an education. If any of you knew what the Ninth Amendment was before seeing this, I applaud you. If any of you know any of the amendments off the top of your head—apart from the <em>really</em> big ones, you know, the First and Second (and maybe the 25th Amendment, since it’s mentioned so frequently these days)—again, bravo. But the Ninth? It reads: “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” Or, as Schreck explains, “Just because a certain right is not listed in the Constitution, it doesn’t mean you don’t have that right.” She breaks it down even further: “The fact is there was no possible way for the framers to put down every single right we have—the right to brush your teeth, sure you’ve got it, but how long do we want this document to be?” She calls it “the most magical and mysterious amendment of them all.”</p>\n<p>And just wait until she gets to the 14th Amendment: “The Fourteenth Amendment is like a giant, super-charged force field protecting all of your human rights,” she says, practically bursting with excitement. Here’s Section One, the first of five super-charged sections:</p>\n<blockquote><p>All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State in which they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here also is where the show begins to get personal. “It doesn’t say anything about <em>how</em> immigrants can become citizens,” Schreck notes. Her great-great grandma Theressa—who came over from Gengenbach, Germany, when her great-great grandfather ordered her from a catalog—died at age 36 in a mental hospital before becoming one, she adds. The “nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law” clause, she explains, is at the heart of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> (“Justice Harry Blackmun used the Ninth Amendment to find the right to privacy in the Fourteenth Amendment”); that’s when Schreck tells us about her own abortion. And she calls the last part, the equal protection line, “the most miraculous clause” in the whole Constitution.</p>\n<p>“It actually uses the word ‘person,’ not ‘citizen.’ Which means that if you are an undocumented immigrant, you must be given all the protections of Clause Three, the due process clause. You cannot be locked up without a fair trial. You cannot have anything—or anyone—seized from you.” Schreck pauses to take a deep breath. And I can’t help but think: Will someone send the orange abomination in the White House a copy of this amendment? Or, better yet, one of the pocket Constitutions that theatergoers receive toward the end of the show? It’s a lot like the one that Gold Star father Khizr Khan held up at the 2016 Democratic National Convention and offered to lend the then–Republican nominee.</p>\n<p>But she has more important stories to tell: Like that of Jessica Gonzales, whose three young daughters, Rebecca, Katheryn, and Leslie, were kidnapped and later murdered by their father; Gonzales had a restraining order against her husband, but the police refused to help—and the Supreme Court eventually ruled, in 2005’s <em>Castle Rock v. Gonzales</em>, that they weren’t obligated to do so. And there’s her Grandma Bette, a strong woman—she was a waitress, but her side hustle was log running—whose second husband beat her, his stepchildren (including Schreck’s mom), and his own children. “I actually know this story pretty well but I prefer to read it,” Schreck explains as she takes a stack of index cards from Mike Iveson, the actor who plays a Legionnaire/contest monitor (inspired by a real figure from Schreck’s speechifying days) then morphs into her onstage support system; she describes him as “positive male energy,” and he is, once he sheds the pins and ribbons and pointy hat and becomes himself.</p>\n<p>It would be enough if Schreck had made this simply her show—<em>her</em> memoir, her coming-of-age story, her take on the Constitution. But she dedicates the last section to debate with a high school student—Rosdley Ciprian and Thursday Williams alternate performances—much like her younger self. The topic: Should we abolish the U.S. Constitution? The night I attended, Schreck argued to get rid of it (“It is doing exactly what it was designed to do from the beginning, which is to protect the interests of a small number of rich, white men”) and Williams argued to keep it (“Just like us, this document is flawed. But just like us, it is also capable of getting better. And better. With every generation”). Each night, one audience member decides who won the debate. But no matter what, you get to keep your pocket Constitution.</p>\n<p>The first time I saw Schreck’s show was the weekend after the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. After watching his smug, self-satisfied face and histrionic outbursts replayed on TV and Twitter ad nauseam, <em>Constitution</em> was comforting and restorative; it was exactly what I needed. Now, it feels energizing and hopeful—and exactly what our country needs.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What the Constitution Means to Me</em></strong><strong> opened on March 31, 2019, at the Helen Hayes Theater and runs through August 24.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In <em>What the Constitution Means to Me</em>, at the Helen Hayes, a 15-year-old girl from small-town Wenatchee, Wash.—“The Apple Capital of the World,” they call it—stands on the podium of a rural American Legion hall and delivers her debate presentation: “Casting Spells: The Crucible of the Constitution.” And that’s it.</p>\n<p>Only that’s <em>not</em> it. This supposed 15-year-old is writer/actress/performance artist Heidi Schreck, 30 years later, reconstructing the speech she presented on the American Legion Oratory Contest circuit back in 1989. She was good at it, too, earning enough prize money to pay her way through college. (It was a state school, she wryly adds.) Good at it then, apparently, and wisely superb at it now.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/03/31/what-the-constitution-means-to-me-heidi-schreck-gets-political-and-personal/\">[<em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>Schreck-the-teenager—she explains that her younger self wears a yellow blazer, when it’s off we’re seeing present-day Heidi—presents her theme in a straightforward and knowing manner, even when she innocently delineates constitutional rights which we have seen destructively and gleefully trampled on of late. Standing onstage with only a sternly milquetoast moderator (Mike, played by Mike Iveson), Heidi demonstrates how she slayed opponents with a combination of knowledge, charm, humor and an ability to cater to the debate audiences, which consisted of American Legion members. Which is to say, old white men smoking cigars.</p>\n<p>This ability to be overly conciliatory to her so-called betters stems from a family history of abusive husbands and fathers. But that only emerges later, when the 1989 debate re-creation develops into a sharp and concise discussion of our constitutionally mandated rights to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of all three. Rights which are altogether noble, except they are open to interpretation and reinterpretation by what has historically been nine mostly white men.</p>\n<p>The first section of the play explains what the Constitution means, or perhaps should mean, to “us.” After which Heidi takes off the blazer, rolls up her sleeves, and examines what the Constitution means to <em>her</em> and, by extension, to her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. And her great-great grandmother Theressa, a German immigrant who was purchased by a Seattle logger out of a mail-order catalogue for $75 in 1879, and who died in the state mental hospital at 36 with a diagnosis of “melancholia.” Which Schreck has concluded refers to abuse, and worse.</p>\n<p>We then return to the debate format, in which Heidi (the character) meets her match. Another debater—this time a legitimate, New York City teenager—comes on in pitched-and-determined battle. Rosdely Ciprian and Thursday Williams alternate in this role; having seen the former during the play’s run last fall at New York Theatre Workshop and the latter at the Hayes, I can tell you that both are compelling and—if appearances are correct—headed towards careers in law, politics, or justice.</p>\n<p>The first part of the final “debate” is prepared; the second seemingly improvisatory. In fact, the final battle is explicitly written into the script. There are four alternate versions of this scene, depending on which girl is playing the role and which sides of the debate she and Heidi have been assigned by an audience volunteer. The dialogue has the ring of authenticity, having been developed and refined from actual debates between Schreck and the two girls (who have been performing the play for many months). What’s more, the script explicitly encourages the actors to improvise their arguments as they see fit, based in part on the level of audience interaction. And audience interaction is plentiful, which leads one to wonder just precisely how this play would go over in “abortion-free zones” like Schreck’s hometown of Wenatchee.</p>\n<p>The teenagers are up to the level of Schreck; so is Iveson, who eventually steps out of his VFW uniform and contributes his own experience. Director Oliver Butler, who appears to have worked closely with Schreck in developing the project, keeps things both moving and interesting. This commercial transfer of the play is billed as “The Clubbed Thumb, True Love Productions and New York Theatre Workshop production.”</p>\n<p>What is left unsaid is that this highly entertaining and involving play is not simply a testament to Heidi Schreck’s life-long personal relationship to the Constitution. Her expertise is not restricted to the subject matter at hand; she is clearly a talented dramatist who knows how to build a script and devise a play. Let us add that while Schreck’s performance is excellent, she has written a role that can stand very well on its own. <em>What the Constitution Means to Me</em> is well suited to be produced without the author on stage in regional, professional, and amateur theatres, and in the process will likely spread enlightenment across the land.</p>\n<p><strong>What the Constitution Means to Me opened March 31, 2019, at the Helen Hayes Theater and runs through August 24.

If this commercially driven sub-genre generally provides limited creative opportunities, it can at least be a vehicle for great showmanship, a virtue in which the legendary R&amp;B group remains unsurpassed.</p>\n<p>For <em>Ain&#8217;t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations</em>, director Des McAnuff—a veteran of jukebox and rock-infused fare, with credits stretching from the recent <em>Summer: The Donna Summer Musical</em> back to <em>The Who’s Tommy</em>—has recruited a cast of spectacularly talented singers and dancers to celebrate the Temps&#8217; prowess as dynamic, fluid performers, and their string of exuberantly soulful hits. The musical numbers in <em>Ain’t Too Proud</em>—charting such unforgettable singles as &#8220;My Girl,&#8221; &#8220;Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)&#8221; and &#8220;Papa Was A Rollin&#8217; Stone,&#8221; in addition to classics recorded by other Motown artists—offer more exhilarating entertainment than any delivered in this format since <em>Jersey Boys</em>, another McAnuff staging.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/03/21/aint-too-proud-a-ball-of-confusion/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the good news. The book is usually the trickiest element in a show like this, as the task of threading together a catalogue of familiar tunes can pose a challenge to even the most imaginative librettist. Pulitzer Prize finalist Dominique Morisseau was an intriguing choice for <em>Ain’t Too Proud</em>; like the Temptations, and Motown itself, she hails from Detroit, and has featured the Motor City prominently in a number of her probing plays, in which characters grapple with racism and socio-economic challenges.</p>\n<p>Such concerns would certainly seem relevant in tracing a group of young black men whose music crossed color lines, but who nonetheless faced the same struggles as other African-Americans, as well as the turbulence experienced throughout the country during their rise in the 1960s. At one point in the musical, the group gets shot at while traveling in the South; at another, news arrives of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.&#8217;s assassination, setting up a plaintive reading of &#8220;I Wish It Would Rain.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But Morisseau&#8217;s libretto—based on the book &#8220;The Temptations&#8221; by Otis Williams, founding member and sole survivor of the group’s original and classic incarnations—ends up resting heavily on platitudes, perhaps influenced too much by its source (which this reviewer hasn&#8217;t read, admittedly), or by demands to cater to nostalgia and sentimentality. The character of Otis, played by Derrick Baskin with a robust voice and easy charm, narrates the story, which traces tensions among the band members, particularly those in the &#8220;Classic Five&#8221; lineup, and with Motown founder Berry Gordy, slickly played by Jahi Kearse.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once the white audience thinks they know you, you can&#8217;t go switching on them,&#8221; Gordy lectures at one point. &#8220;You have to serve them music in a way that&#8217;s digestible.&#8221; In another scene, the Temps’ Paul Williams, sweetly played and gorgeously sung by James Harkness, laments to Otis, &#8220;Who knew you could be on top of the world and still feel beneath it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Other characters can flirt with unfortunate stereotypes, or seem underdeveloped. The Temptations&#8217; longtime manager Shelly Berger, who is white and Jewish, is portrayed as callously consumed with business, with Joshua Morgan fretting and glowering dutifully in the part. As Otis&#8217;s wife, Josephine, the supple-voiced Rashidra Scott is relegated to the stock role of long-suffering artist&#8217;s spouse, alternately pining for and scolding her husband while worrying for their young son.</p>\n<p>Of course, few fans will flock to <em>Ain’t Too Proud</em> expecting fully fleshed out portraits of women or other identity groups. The songs are the draw, and on that count the musical delivers potently and consistently. There is, in some of the singing, the kind of overzealousness that makes a case for the <em>American Idol</em>-ization of certain Broadway musicals. Ephraim Sykes, as Ruffin, indulges his own dazzling virtuosity with little restraint—and with no shortage of encouragement from the audience, who at the preview I attended predictably rewarded each melisma-laden howl and acrobatic dance trick with rapturous applause.</p>\n<p>As Eddie Kendricks, another member of the &#8220;Classic Five&#8221; lineup, Jeremy Pope—arriving fresh off his star turn in <em>Choir Boy</em>—better captures the discretion and sheer ease that also distinguished the group&#8217;s performances and recordings, wielding his fluttery tenor through &#8220;Just My Imagination&#8221; with a shimmering grace. Choreographer Sergio Trujillo, too, does an admirable job of channeling the Temptations&#8217; famously smooth moves, as well as their effortless buoyance, injecting enough flamboyant athleticism to keep the crowd happy.</p>\n<p>And the hits keep coming. A trio of singers playing the Supremes, bedazzling in fitted, sparkling gowns—costume designer Paul Tazewell also captures the sartorial elegance Gordy insisted on for his top male group—arrives to perform a medley, and later joins the Temps for the sumptuous supergroup pairing &#8220;I&#8217;m  Gonna Make You Love Me.&#8221; Nasia Thomas gamely tries to emulate Tammi Terrell&#8217;s inimitable, tangy soprano for the Terrell/Marvin Gaye gem &#8220;If I Could Build My Whole World Around You,&#8221; performed here as a duet with Ruffin, Terrell&#8217;s troubled beau.</p>\n<p>If none of the virtuosic performances in <em>Ain&#8217;t Too Proud</em> match the effortless sweetness and soulfulness of the original recordings, the abundance of talent and energy onstage is something to marvel at in its own right.</p>\n<div><strong><b>Ain&#8217;t Too Proud opened March 21, 2019, at the Imperial Theatre.

If you were, say, teaching a class on how to write a jukebox musical—and I’m sure somewhere, someone is doing just that—<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Jersey Boys</i> could compose the entire curriculum. And like it or not, the 2005 Four Seasons–themed Tony-winning Broadway hit opened the floodgates to a whole series of pop-star-driven biomusicals—none of which could match its success or, more important, quality. (Except perhaps <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\"><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/09/20/beautiful-some-kind-of-wonderful-show/\">Beautiful</a></i>, the Carole King musical, which lives up to its title.) Regrettably, that list of lesser jukebox shows now includes <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Ain’t Too Proud—The Life and Times of the Temptations</i>, which just opened at Broadway’s Imperial Theatre.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Jersey Boys</i> comparison might seem unfair, but <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Ain’t Too Proud</i> is practically begging for it. Both shows were masterminded by director Des McAnuff; they feature the military-style synchronized-step choreography of Sergio Trujillo (though his work here, incorporating the Temptations’ signature splits and microphone tosses, is definitely flashier); there’s the same blinding concert-style lighting by Tony winner Howell Binkley; and both stories are related by the singer characters themselves, speaking directly to the audience—here, our narrator is Temptations cofounder Otis Williams (Derrick Baskin), the sole remaining original group member. Heck, <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Jersey Boys</i> and <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">ATP</i> even both involve the unexpected offstage death of a group member’s child.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Of course, this isn’t the first time McAnuff and his team tried to recapture that old <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Jersey</i> magic. (See <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Summer</i>, last year’s ode to disco diva Donna Summer.) But <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">ATP</i> had four chances—out-of-town runs in Berkeley, Calif., Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and Toronto (curiously, not the Tempts’ hometown, Detroit)—to, as Otis says of famous, and famously ego-driven, lead singer David Ruffin (Ephraim Sykes), catch “lightning in a bottle.” Sadly, there are few sparks at the Imperial.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/03/21/aint-too-proud-the-life-and-times-of-the-temptations-with-hits-and-misses/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As anyone who’s ever watched an episode of <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Behind the Music</i> will tell you, offstage rock-star drama is the stuff of legend. It’s only natural to assume that the Temptations—there have been 24 Tempts between 1963 and today, and they still perform—would be as tempestuous as any other group. Even a story that focused only on the most famous ones, aka the Classic Five—Williams, Ruffin, high tenor Eddie Kendricks (the charismatic and cool Jeremy Pope, fresh off <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Choir Boy</i>), rumbly bass Melvin Franklin (Jawan M. Jackson), and smooth baritone Paul Williams (James Harkness)— surely would have provided plenty of Broadway biomusical fodder.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yet <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">ATP</i> possesses all the drama of a datebook; it’s a seemingly endless chronicle of entrances and exits, successes and flameouts, hirings and firings, and illnesses and deaths. A human-resources exec could have written a line like “David was getting addicted to the worst drug of all: the spotlight”—one of the many clunkers Baskin is saddled with. Bafflingly, top-notch playwright Dominique Morisseau, whose Motor City roots run deep—she was born and raised there, and penned the terrific <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Skeleton Crew</i>, <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Paradise Blue</i>, and <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Detroit ’67</i>, aka <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">The Detroit Project (A 3-Play Cycle)</i>—wrote the libretto; it is, however, “based on” the book <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">The Temptations</i> by Otis Williams (with Patricia Romanowski), so perhaps the inspirational-poster-ready line “Sometimes you let go of one dream to get to something bigger” came from Williams, who’s also credited as an executive producer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But everyone’s there for the music anyway. I know the woman in front of me, who was mouthing all the lyrics and doing her own intricate in-chair choreography, certainly was. You will hear all the Temptations songs you know and love: the mellow, melodic “My Girl”; the funky, soulful “Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone”; the wistful “Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me),” a showcase for Pope’s sweet falsetto; and many more. And you’ll hear about 10 more tunes from the “legendary”—that’s how it’s billed!—Motown catalog, including, strangely, the Isley Brothers’ “Shout” and three Supremes songs (one would have sufficed). Like the Tempts themselves, the guys take a bit of time to find their groove; their vocals aren’t super-tight (at least not on the night I attended) until more than halfway through Act 1—during their <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">American Bandstand</i> stint, when they sing “Ain’t Too Proud to Beg.” At least <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Ain’t Too Proud</i> provides a sufficient dose of musical nostalgia.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Ain’t Too Proud—The Life and Times of the Temptations</i> opened March 21, 2019, at the Imperial Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>First things first: Reports of <em>Kiss Me, Kate</em>’s reinvention have been greatly exaggerated. The very fine Roundabout Theatre revival that just opened at Studio 54 is essentially the <em>Kate</em> you know and love: backstage drama, a <em>Taming of the Shrew </em>show-within-a-show, ego-tastic actors/former lovers Lilli Vanessi and Fred Graham (played by Kelli O’Hara and Will Chase), and starstruck gangsters.</p>\n<p>Writer Amanda Green, credited with additional material, didn’t rip up any of Cole Porter’s delicious ditties or take a hacksaw to Sam and Bella Spewack’s quip-filled book. The potentially objectionable (but hilarious) lyric in “Brush Up Your Shakespeare”—“If she says your behavior is heinous/ Kick her right in the <em>Coriolanus</em>”—is still there.</p>\n<p>Green’s most obvious touch comes in the penultimate song “I Am Ashamed That Women Are So Simple,” now titled “I Am Ashamed That People Are So Simple.” Sung by Lilli as Katharine, the eponymous Shrew, it also eliminates the “bound to serve, love, and obey” line—words that may have been Shakespeare’s but have also been phased out of modern-day wedding vows.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/03/14/kiss-me-kate-true-to-cole-porter-and-shakespeare-in-their-fashion/\"><em>Read Michael Sommers’ </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>There are more small changes, and fans are surely debating them over martinis at Glass House Tavern at this very moment. (Which, after all, is the best way to discuss such matters.) What’s on stage at Studio 54 works—because how could it not, when you have a company headlined by O’Hara and Chase singing such Porter gems as “Another Op’nin’, Another Show,” “So in Love,” and “Wunderbar”? And when choreographer Warren Carlyle is doing things that Fred Astaire could do only with a camera and a rotating set? Carlyle and company also bring down the house with the off-to-the-races second-act ensemble number “Too Darn Hot,” led by James T. Lane, which starts as a steamy slow jam and escalates into a breathless dance-off that blends swing, Lindy Hop, jitterbug, tap, and even a Fosse homage.</p>\n<p>Though this revival is buoyed by a few canny supporting turns (most notably Stephanie Styles, making a smashing Broadway debut as the airy ingenue Lois Lane), any <em>Kiss Me, Kate</em> rises and falls on the pairing of its Lilli/Kate and Fred/Petruchio. It’s a thrill to see Chase, after years of replacing in hit shows and starring in a string of flops, finally get a meaty role he can make his own, and he’s every inch the Parma ham that the part demands, especially in the tongue-twisting “I’ve Come to Wive It Wealthily in Padua” and “Where Is the Life That Late I Led.” (I do, however, hold a soft spot for his performance in 2006’s underrated blink-and-you-missed-it Tom Kitt–Amanda Green musical <em>High Fidelity</em>.)</p>\n<p>There’s a reason Kelli O’Hara’s name comes up every time a classic musical revival is announced. (People are already clamoring for her to star opposite Hugh Jackman in the forthcoming <em>Music Man</em>.) She’s got that lush, made-for-the-Great-American-songbook voice that carried shows including <em>The Pajama Game</em> (2006), <em>South Pacific</em> (2008), and <em>The King and I</em> (2015), and she sounds glorious on the Porter standard “So in Love.” She’s a lower-key Lilli/Kate than you might expect—her delivery of “I Hate Men” is more resigned, sort of one big eye roll, than spiteful—but if she’d gone wildly over the top that wouldn’t have seemed genuine. A woman has to walk a very fine line in this role: She needs to be a shrew, as the play-within-a-play demands, but not <em>too</em> shrewish; she has to be smart, but not overtly calculating; she must be angry, but still lovable. Meanwhile, all that’s required for Fred/Petruchio is an abundance of charm. Some things never change.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Kiss Me, Kate</em> opened March 14, 2019, at Studio 54 and runs through June 30.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Roundabout Theatre Company and director Scott Ellis neatly deliver a dandy new Broadway production of <em>Kiss Me, Kate</em>.</p>\n<p>More spirited than exciting, this brisk revival of great American songwriter Cole Porter’s best-known musical comedy looks nice, sounds pretty, moves fleetly, and rarely ceases to beguile the eye and ear at Studio 54, where the revival opened on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Word along the gutter theatrical rumored that the Sam and Bella Spewack script and Porter’s lyrics had been altered considerably to succor today’s tender sensitivities over abusive or sexist excesses lurking within this 1948 backstage variation on Shakespeare’s battle-of-the-sexes tale. As it turns out, the revisions are few and relatively minor.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/03/14/kiss-me-kate-its-all-right-with-me/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Kelli O’Hara, appearing in fine, fiery form, co-stars with Will Chase as Lilli and Fred, a formerly married show-biz couple who are gingerly reteaming for a musical version of <em>The Taming of the Shrew </em>which is shaking down in Baltimore during a pre-Broadway tour. Temperamental Lilli and egocentric Fred clash onstage and off during the performance, just as Kate and Petruchio, their Shakespearean parallels, give each other hell on their bumpy road to a happy ending.</p>\n<p>Two hoodlums bent on collecting a debt get involved in their feuding, as do Bill and Lois, the show-within-the-show’s secondary performers and … why am I telling you all this? Most of you reading this are likely cognizant of the plot for <em>Kiss Me, Kate</em>, and appreciate its top shelf status as one of the finest ornaments from the Golden Age of the Broadway musical.</p>\n<p>Those of us who cherish memories of the musical’s elegant 1999 incarnation top-lined by the late, great Marin Mazzie and Brian Stokes Mitchell may find this latest revival to be a trifle, well, ordinary—as opposed to extraordinary—but it is still a very capable rendition of an enduring Broadway classic. This Roundabout production is likely to please anyone who craves a vintage musical comedy that is quick on its feet and melodious with evergreens such as “Always True to You in My Fashion” and “Wunderbar.”</p>\n<p>Looking lovely and lending luscious voice to “So in Love,” Kelli O’Hara satisfies as a glamorous diva who pulls no punches around Fred. Abetted by some witty staging, her “I Hate Men” is deliciously snarky. The sequence when Fred spanks Lilli (famously depicted in photos of the original show) has been eliminated in favor of them repeatedly kicking each other’s backsides.</p>\n<p>Fred is written as a producer-director-star in the Orson Welles manner, and although Will Chase deftly deploys a nice light baritone voice, his otherwise suave performance lacks the wacky grandeur that a Douglas Sills or a Brian d’Arcy James might bring to the role. Together, O’Hara and Chase may strike few sparks but their testy exchanges are enjoyably snappish.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in the secondary leads department: Stephanie Styles coyly affects a tinny soubrette voice as Lois that miraculously vanishes whenever she sings, which she does vivaciously. As her vis-à-vis Bill, a beaming Corbin Bleu is a cocky presence and a tireless (if rather heavy-footed) tap dancer. Adrienne Walker and James T. Lane as backstage personnel, and particularly John Pankow’s droll depiction of a pin-striped mug who gets struck by the stage, further brighten the proceedings.</p>\n<p>This <em>Kiss Me, Kate</em> is one of the best-looking attractions that Roundabout has produced in some time. David Rockwell frames the show in a swank proscenium within which he alternates dusky backstage areas and pretty, pastel, old-school settings for the musical-within-this-musical. Jeff Mahshie dresses the company in snazzy late ‘40s duds and jewel-hued Renaissance costumes.</p>\n<p>Ellis’ staging moves everything along swiftly even as Warren Carlyle’s lively choreography aptly kicks it up. A torrid “Too Darn Hot” combo of tapping, period dance steps, and hep-cat attitudes sharply performed by the ensemble and strikingly lighted by Donald Holder, all but stops the show. The pelvic thrusting of the gents during “Tom, Dick, or Harry” looks obvious but it nabs laughs. Musical director Paul Gemignani smoothly interweaves the strings and brasses of Larry Hochman’s orchestrations.</p>\n<p>Purists may not be thrilled by the politically correct changes to the lyrics of “I’ve Come to Wive It Wealthily in Padua,” &#8220;Bianca,&#8221; and especially of Shakespeare’s own words that Porter set to music as “I Am Ashamed That Women Are So Simple.” Here, “people” has been swapped for “women” and the cautionary sentiments broadened to embrace lovers rather than wives.</p>\n<p>Such alterations are scarcely harmful to the integrity of the work and the vast majority of audiences won’t know the difference anyway. Besides, they&#8217;ll be too busy enjoying the show to care.</p>\n<div><strong><b>Kiss Me, Kate </b>opened March 14, 2019, at Studio 54 and runs through June 30.

Photo: Maria Baranova</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Can a post-millennial sci-fi musical that made its way to Broadway on the strength of YouTube, Tumblr, and Spotify drown out the overwhelming cyber-buzz and make a name for itself in the musical-theater history books? The Joe Iconis–scored, Joe Tracz–scripted <em>Be More Chill</em> may already be beloved by a couple hundred million fans—if we’re going by the original cast album streaming count (admittedly a very inaccurate estimation)—but is the ultra-caffeinated show that just opened at the Lyceum Theatre as amazing as the blogs, GIFs, and memes would have you believe?</p>\n<p>If you ask the fans—some of whom you’ll spot in the audience wearing homages to their favorite characters, including the nerdy hero Jeremy (played by <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> alum Will Roland), his drama-club crush Christine (Stephanie Hsu), and his outcast-and-proud Pac-Man partner Michael (George Salazar)—the answer is an unqualified yes.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to see why they’re so enamored of the diaries-of-a-teenage-misfit story, which is based on a 2004 young adult novel by the late Ned Vizzini: To save himself from eternal geekdom, Jeremy ingests a $400 Japanese-made mind-controlling computerized pill called a Squip, which comes to life in fabulous fashion—think Keanu Reeves in <em>The Matrix</em> (played by Jason Tam)—and acts as the Cyrano to Jeremy’s Rostand.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/03/10/be-more-chill-desperately-and-delightfully-striving-to-be-cool-in-school/\"><em>Read Michael Sommers’ </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Jeremy is chatting up cool girl Brooke (Lauren Marcus), shopping for faux-retro fast fashion in Forever 21, and going to Halloween house parties where everyone wears inappropriately sexy costumes. (BTW, if they’re not selling <em>Be More Chill </em>merch around the corner at the F21 in Times Square, they’re missing a major marketing opportunity.) But before you can say <em>Little Shop of Horrors</em>, the Squip gets out of control, and it’s up to Jeremy—and a glug of 30-year-old Mountain Dew Red—to save the world. Or at least the world as he knows it: his suburban New Jersey high school.</p>\n<p>Iconis’ tunes, which have earned him a major online following, are character-driven and catchy, especially Christine’s quirkily sweet “I Love Play Rehearsal,” destined to become an anthem for high school actors everywhere; Jeremy and Michael’s “Two-Player Game,” an ode to vintage videogames and friendship (“Guys like us are cool in college”) that sounds like it was orchestrated in an arcade in the ’80s; the party-anxiety song “Michael in the Bathroom,” to which Salazar brings so much heart; and Jeremy’s six-minute throat-testing “Loser Geek Whatever,” which makes <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em>’s “Waving Through a Window” sound like a vocal warm-up.</p>\n<p>But a lot of Iconis’ songs, and Vizzini’s story, gets lost in the chaos at the Lyceum. Director Stephen Brackett, who staged the show last year off-Broadway and in its 2015 premiere at the Two River Theater in Red Bank, N.J., isn’t much for subtlety or soft moments. Roland, ideally cast in so many ways, is pushing too hard—vocally and otherwise. And the usually unimpeachable sound designer Ryan Rumery has turned everything up to 11.</p>\n<p>What I liked—actually, loved—about <em>Be More Chill</em> more than anything is its potential. The show can so easily be produced in a high school or college on a shoestring budget. It could be staged in a black box. The cast could shop their own closets for the costumes (no offense to Bobby Frederick Tilley II’s work here, which is a spot-on celebration of neon). The songs would sound just as good without all the amplification. Perhaps—no, definitely—even better.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Be More Chill</em></strong><strong> opened March 10, 2019, at the Lyceum Theatre, and runs through August 11.

Photo: Maria Baranova</figcaption></figure>\n<p>An exuberant new musical about a nerdy high school kid who becomes popular beyond his wildest dreams<em>, Be More Chill</em> is the cheerful flip side of <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em>.</p>\n<p>Opening on Sunday at the Lyceum Theatre, the show is a bright and boisterous entertainment populated by a delightful ensemble and driven by propulsive music and some frequently frenzied dancing. Neatly shaped along fairly traditional musical comedy lines by book writer Joe Tracz and songwriter Joe Iconis, <em>Be More Chill</em> delivers a cartoon tuner that’s as classic as <em>Faust</em> and twice as funny.</p>\n<p>Drawn from Ned Vizzini’s novel, the story is straightforward: Jeremy is sharply aware that he is totally uncool at his suburban New Jersey school. Then Jeremy learns about something called a squip. Described as “some top secret can’t even look it up on the internet” pill manufactured in Japan, it implants a super-computer in the brain that is programmed to help people to be, well, to be more chill.</p>\n<p>Although warned that this item is untested technology, Jeremy ingests it. Thus embedded, The Squip pops up on stage, unseen by the other characters, as a super-suave, silvery figure who resembles a young Keanu Reeves. Delivering electronic shocks to correct Jeremy’s posture and to fix his vision so that he can shed his glasses as well as overlook his nerdy buddy Michael, the omniscient Squip upgrades Jeremy into a smooth player with whom everybody soon wants to be besties.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/03/10/be-more-chill-a-sci-fi-musical-for-generation-z/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The musical’s second act, of course, leads to complications as The Squip motivates Jeremy into dubious behavior.</p>\n<p>Throw in a Halloween party that gets out of hand, a school play that mashes up <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> with zombies, and a cyborg plan for world domination, and you’ve got a clever new musical that honors several predecessors. As well as <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em>, the show invokes <em>Little Shop of Horrors</em>, in that a miraculous force grows evil; <em>Mean Girls</em>, in that cool kids shun others to rule their school; and in one frenetic number, there is a clever homage to 1960’s <em>Bye Bye Birdie</em> as youngsters today trade rumors exponentially during “The Smartphone Hour (Rich Set a Fire).”</p>\n<p>Breezy and broad as <em>Be More Chill</em> gets, it occasionally underscores the angst that adolescents feel. During one song, all of the characters echo the phrase, “I’m tired of being the person that everyone thinks I am,” which essentially is the show’s theme. Another number, “Michael in the Bathroom,” given a woeful/funny rendition by George Salazar, sorrowfully reflects being the loneliest soul at a party. Such touching moments offer graceful notes within Iconis’ hip and high-spirited score. Charlie Rosen&#8217;s orchestrations deck it out with some witty sci-fi flourishes, including the eerie warbling of a theremin.</p>\n<p>Sophisticated Broadway customers may be wearying of high school scenarios, but the only significant problem about <em>Be More Chill</em> is that it’s too much of a good thing: Clocking in at around 2:30, the show could easily be trimmed back by 20 minutes without sacrificing any vital material. Let’s note, too, that the sound design’s decibel level is cranked up so beyond loud that one fears the Lyceum’s 116 year-old plaster decor might crumble.  Anyone with sensitive ears should book seats towards the back of the house.</p>\n<p>If one’s hearing may be jeopardized, this production is well worth seeing. Stephen Brackett, the director, has put together an extremely energetic, extremely flashy attraction that visually embodies its youthful viewpoint. Beowulf Boritt’s shiny, minimalist setting of various frames coalesces with Alex Basco Koch’s nearly ceaselessly moving projections and Tyler Micoleau’s multi-hued lighting to create the somewhat ADD-inspired atmospherics. Likewise, choreographer Chase Brock’s often amusing dances tend towards hyperactive movement. These elements are especially effective in delivering the show’s climax, which invokes a madhouse video game.</p>\n<p>Sporting a wardrobe of colorful, ultra-trendy clothes designed by Bobby Frederick Tilley II, a dandy bunch of youthful looking performers is a pleasure to watch.</p>\n<p>Last seen on Broadway as Evan Hansen’s smartass ally, Will Roland nicely traces Jeremy’s arc as a loser desperate to become an insider to an insider desperate to get back to the way he was. Stephanie Hsu as an overly dramatic theater geek, Gerard Canonico as a school bully who goes bonkers, and Tiffany Mann as a gossip girl with awesome vocal powers, are standouts, along with George Salazar’s retro-minded Michael. And Jason Tam gives The Squip a coolly insinuating presence that makes this extraordinary personage easy to swallow.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Be More Chill opened March 10, 2019, at the Lyceum Theatre and runs through August 11.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When Lerner and Loewe’s <em>My Fair Lady</em> opened at the Beaumont last April, I opined that it was “absobloominlutely loverly.” It has been charming audiences these many months. Cast members come and go, inevitably; and the show, in these chilly January days, now has newcomers in four of the six main roles. Under normal circumstances, this might set an impeccably conceived production off kilter or more. But the folks at Lincoln Center Theater are not operating under normal circumstances. I found the production to be grand when it opened, albeit with a couple of minor qualms. Now, it is as if that delectable <em>My Fair Lady</em> has been boosted with vitamin shots. What kept us dancing all night, back then, now positively soars.</p>\n<p>The biggest boost comes from Ms. B-12 herself, Laura Benanti. Here is Eliza Doolittle, folks. While her predecessor gave a perfectly satisfactory performance, Benanti is Eliza down to her fingertips: flower girl dirt-soiled at the street-market opening, princess-grade perfect after the Cinderella-like transformation. She has long been celebrated along Broadway as a top-notch singer with an uncanny comedic touch (most recently in <em>She Loves Me</em>, <em>Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,</em> and <em>Gypsy</em>, not to mention her occasional sidesplitting small-screen cameos as a certain politician’s wife). Here, Benanti is the Eliza of one’s dreams, which makes the production all the more entrancing.</p>\n<p>One can see where we’re at from the start, even before the she starts dreaming about lots of choc’late. Sitting under the portico of the church at Covent Garden, Eliza jokes and japes about the toff who has been surreptitiously copying down her every word and treating her like a draggle-tailed guttersnipe. But when Professor Higgins explains to his scholarly peer Pickering that “it’s ‘Aooow’ and ‘Garn’ that keep her in her place, not her wretched clothes and dirty face,” Benanti’s Eliza is hit by an unexpected thunderbolt: <em>Could he be right</em>! She immediately recovers her equanimity and certainly doesn’t admit her momentary weakness, but that very early moment of unexpected truth drives this Eliza through the evening, and that’s something we haven’t seen before.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/01/27/my-fair-lady-a-loverly-and-fierce-new-eliza/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Needless to say, Benanti is enchanting as she sits on a workman’s crate and dreams of a warm room with an enormous chair and all those choc’lates, vengefully wrathful as she dispatches the tormentful professor to a handy firing squad, and proudly (and surprisingly) triumphant as she properly hits her aitches in the tale of “The Rain in Spain.” When Benanti almost immediately thereafter explodes into “I Could Have Danced All Night,” we are dancing—figuratively—right alongside.</p>\n<p>A second B-jolt comes from Danny Burstein, who has slipped into Alfred P. Doolittle’s leather dustman cap. His predecessor was a fine and celebrated musical comedy star, but seemed an uncomfortable fit in this low comedy/high wit role. Burstein is successful from the moment he makes his appearance; he doesn’t need to play drunk, lather on an accent, or act <em>anything</em>; we immediately accept him as the real thing. (If Benanti performs with relish—and she does, from curtain to curtain—Burstein offers relish with a dollop of Colman’s Mustard slathered on.) While Burstein handily triumphs with his two Music Hall production numbers (“With a Little Bit o’ Luck” and “Get Me to the Church on Time”), he simultaneously lifts the level of Shavian sophistication in his “undeserving poor” interview with Higgins. Let it also be noted that there seems to be a hint that Doolittle-of-Tottenham-Court and Tevye-of-Anatevka might well be not-so-distant cousins.</p>\n<p>What happens, you might ask, to Harry Hadden-Paton when his Wimpole Street domicile is invaded by expert Broadway pros? The actor—formerly of <em>Downton Abbey</em>, who made his Broadway debut as Higgins in what is apparently his first musical role—keeps up with them, step by step. I expect that his Higgins grew stronger as he became accustomed to the musical stage in the half-year since the opening; but it appears that the presence of Benanti and Burstein has sparked him altogether. He is now playing on nearly the same level as these prime musical comedy clowns. Allan Corduner, the Pickering of the occasion, is also caught up in the increased pitch and now displays exuberant flair.</p>\n<p>Adding to the high charm of the production is Rosemary Harris, dripping class and nobility even while looking sideways at her infuriatingly non-social son. Yes, Ms. Harris—a Tony winner who played Ophelia to Burton’s <em>Othello</em> and Desdemona to Albert Finney’s <em>Hamlet</em>, the latter being the premiere production of London’s National Theatre Company—is 91 in calendar years; which is to say, she was trodding the London boards while GBS was still bent over his typewriter. But every move and moment is carefully sculpted and perfectly executed. The wide expanse of the Beaumont stage—with those wings that go on and on and on—necessitates a significant amount of <em>walking</em> throughout. Don’t even suggest that Harris be offered a cane, wheelchair or strong chorister’s arm; she has it all under control, and appears to be having an altogether grand time (and itching for a couple of dance steps, please).</p>\n<p>An added fillip is provided by the fourth replacement, Christian Dante White. Freddy Eynsford-Hill is something of a blank among the explicitly realized characters of <em>My Fair Lady</em>. His main purpose is to stand, open-faced and naïvely lovestruck, on the street where Eliza lives until the music strikes up and he <em>sings</em> “On the Street Where You Live.” White does this—the acting and the singing—so well as to garner cheers. Those who have watched him since he appeared as one of Kander and Ebb’s <em>Scottsboro Boys</em> (and as one of the two trashy ladies who accuse the boys), and caught him last winter as a perfectly dandy Cornelius Hackl to Bernadette Peters’ Dolly, will be most pleased by his performance as this idle upper-cruster.</p>\n<p>Bartlett Sher’s staging and the exquisite production he assembled with his long-time design team of Michael Yeargan, Catherine Zuber, and Donald Holder remain in pristine condition; and the music from Ted Sperling’s pit sounds so good that we know we are at a hit from those first eight clarion notes of the overture. This is one of those rare cases when Broadway producers see fit to retain the original orchestrations (these among our most exquisite, by Russell Bennett and Phil Lang). This necessitates hiring an orchestra large enough to play them; and yes, it does pay off in audience enchantment, even if the audience is oblivious to the reason.</p>\n<p>So let’s not see this as a mere replacement cast. The Lincoln Center <em>My Fair Lady</em> is enhanced by the addition of Benanti, Burstein and the others, and the results are even more exquisite than before.</p>\n<p><strong>My Fair Lady opened April 19, 2018, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.

Photo: Joan Marcus.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Now and again, a classic musical presents such an ideal vehicle for a contemporary star that their union seems almost inevitable. Think of, in recent years, Patti LuPone in <i>Gypsy</i>, or Bette Midler in <i>Hello, Dolly!</i>, or Kelli O’Hara in pretty much anything.</p>\n<p>Laura Benanti, the latest performer to bless us with so dreamy a pairing, arrives in Lincoln Center Theater’s exquisite revival of <i>My Fair Lady</i>, ironically, as a replacement—for Lauren Ambrose, a gifted actress and (as many discovered for the first time) singer with relatively little experience in musical theater. If Ambrose’s turn as Eliza Dolittle was a revelation, Benanti’s is just as thrilling as an affirmation, not only of the assets her fans have long treasured—her elegance and sharp wit; her willingness to wax goofy, with the adroitness that only the smartest actors and comedians can manage; and of course, that glorious, silvery soprano—but of the most precocious ingenues’ ability to evolve, and continue to find new richness and depth in an assortment of characters.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if Benanti was not quite as obvious a choice for Eliza as, say, LuPone was for Momma Rose (in a production of <em>Gypsy</em> that co-starred Benanti, and earned both Tony Awards), that’s because <i>My Fair Lady</i>’s leading ladies have traditionally been younger. Julie Andrews was in her early 20s when she introduced the role, as was Melissa Errico when she was cast in the last Broadway revival, more than 25 years ago. (Let’s not address, for now, the thirtysomething Audrey Hepburn, whose casting in the film adaptation was a disservice for other reasons.)</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/01/27/my-fair-lady-benanti-and-burstein-enhance-the-enchantment-of-lerner-and-loewe-classic/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>But director Bartlett Sher, whose flair for finding fresh resonance in Golden Age musicals while honoring their tradition has made him our best current interpreter of the form, wanted from the start to focus more on class and gender as factors that separate the musical’s flower-girl heroine from Professor Henry Higgins, the phonetics expert who determines to make a proper lady of her by teaching her to speak like one. If Sher’s <i>My Fair Lady</i> has reaped deserved praise for speaking to our time—some of it from critics who have deemed other recent revivals regressive—his staging owes much of its power to its emphasis on the 63-year-old musical’s even older source material: <i>Pygmalion</i>, the work of a playwright who took a progressive stance on gender relations, and much else, long before today’s feminist advocates were twinkles in their parents’ eyes.</p>\n<p>Benanti serves Shaw’s original vision, and his wit, with as much zest as her predecessor—and, it must be said, more palpable joy. Where Ambrose’s Eliza, at least during the preview I caught, seemed to gain confidence (vocally, in particular) as the story progressed—cannily showing us the character’s own growing pains on her path to self-actualization—Benanti’s Eliza is more playful and feisty from the get-go, and wickedly funny, whether imagining herself conversing with the king in “Just You Wait” or introducing herself to the cream of British society, then spilling the beans on her low-born kin, at Ascot’s opening horse race. The toll of this Eliza’s journey is most keenly felt in her indignation and, eventually, fury in later scenes, when she reveals her frustration with being disrespected and objectified by Henry, in exchanges Benanti makes as biting as her comedic flourishes are hilarious.</p>\n<p>The performance is of a piece with others in the current company, those of both additional new cast members and Sher’s original players, who seem to enjoy these colleagues as much as the audience does. Harry Hadden-Paton’s Henry, superb in previews, seems invigorated by his new sparring partner; there’s a new spring in his missteps, a more muscular and relaxed comic punch in his pompous preening and childish fumbling, and more poignance as well. Allan Corduner’s Colonel Pickering also seems to dig into the more loosey-goosey moments with added relish.</p>\n<p>They could scarcely have better company than recruits such as Danny Burstein and Rosemary Harris, predictably marvelous stepping into the roles of Alfred P. Dolittle and Mrs. Higgins. Harris imbues the latter with an understated wryness that complements both Bennati&#8217;s and Hadden-Paton’s performances beautifully; Burstein brings exuberant showmanship to Eliza’s garrulous deadbeat dad, mining the character’s broad humor and the astute cleverness Henry spots in him. Another newcomer, Christian Dante White, is enormously endearing as Eliza’s rather less worldwise young suitor, Freddy Eynsford-Hill, combining a wide-eyed, goofy sweetness and a robust bari-tenor.</p>\n<p>The production retains the directorial and design elements that made it both ravishing and wise, with marching suffragettes and would-be cockney showgirls sustaining the expansive view that first brought Eliza to life. It is loverly indeed to have her back with us, in such splendid form.</p>\n<p><strong>My Fair Lady opened April 19, 2018, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. Re-reviewed: January, 2019.

Photo: Joan Marcus.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Let&#8217;s now pause in our overdue reckoning with misogyny to consider the many ways men brutalize each other. (We&#8217;ll save intra-female brutality for another time.) What better occasion to do so than a fresh revival of <em>True West</em>, Sam Shepard&#8217;s brilliant reimagining of the Cain and Abel saga, in which two brothers who couldn&#8217;t seem more different on the surface grapple, graphically, with the ties that bind them both as kin and as guys trying to carve out their own destinies in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>\n<p>If Shepard&#8217;s bracing dissection of American myths, from the idealized Western frontier to the dream of upward mobility, seemed penetrating when the play premiered in 1980, at San Francisco&#8217;s Magic Theatre, the play provides no shortage of insights today, when the perils of machismo gone unchecked are on display from sports bars to Silicon Valley to the White House. In Roundabout Theatre Company&#8217;s new production, directed wittily and unflinchingly by James Macdonald, our own fragile world never feels that far from the cozy home in suburban Southern California where siblings Austin and Lee—respectively played by Paul Dano and Ethan Hawke— square off.</p>\n<p>In <em>True West’</em>s 2000 Broadway premiere, these central roles were alternated, to wild acclaim, by a young Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly. Having missed those performances—and those of John Malkovich and Gary Sinise in a previous Steppenwolf Theatre Company production, also widely praised, that transferred to off-Broadway in the early &#8217;80s—I can only judge Hawke&#8217;s and Dano&#8217;s fairly, by their own merits, which are considerable.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/01/24/true-west-sam-shepards-brotherhood-of-man/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>In elder brother Lee, a drifter and thief, Hawke has found a vehicle for both his comedic facility (not always mined or guided adroitly, on stage or screen) and his capacity for menace. The character turns up at the house, his mother&#8217;s, to find Austin, a productive screenwriter with a prestigious education and a family of his own, keeping an eye on the place while Mom is on vacation. As Austin sits dutifully at his typewriter, trying to resist Lee&#8217;s attempts to distract and goad him, Dano is at first blush the mild-mannered, put-upon nerd, a model of forbearance, however prickly or glib at points.</p>\n<p>But as Lee steps up his torment, dangling old demons and reminding Austin that neither he nor the neighborhood is safe while his big brother is around, Austin&#8217;s cultivated reserve begins to fray. Dano&#8217;s sly, wry portrait underscores how this creative person and husband and father, who is working on a love story, harbors some of the egotism and vulpine ambition that writers and artists and computer geeks can share with more conventional alpha males, even while scorning them. Indeed, it&#8217;s a visit from a Hollywood producer interested in his work—played by an astutely unctuous Gary Wilmes—that sets in motion Austin&#8217;s inevitable fall off the rails.</p>\n<p>Liberated by booze, Austin becomes as destructive and needy and darkly funny an animal as his brother, his physical and verbal flailing bringing the two closer even as they lock horns, until they are one ill wind, blowing&#8230;Well, if you&#8217;ve never seen or read the play before, be prepared for adjustments to the set before Mom comes home, unexpectedly, in the form of Marylouise Burke, injecting a predictable and by that point welcome air of daffy detachment.</p>\n<p>The scenic designer, notably, is a woman (as are respective costume and lighting designers Kate Voyce and Jane Cox). Mimi Lien, whose past credits include <em>Natasha, Pierre &amp; The Great Comet of 1812</em> and Taylor Mac&#8217;s <em>A 24-Decade History of American Music</em>, has furnished this <em>True West</em> with a set that exudes, per the playwright&#8217;s instructions, domestic order and functionality. A mother&#8217;s love, too, is evident in the (initially) lush green plants that hang in Lien&#8217;s handsome, spacious alcove, and the canary-yellow kitchen, with its (at first) tidily stacked items reflecting years of care and discretion.</p>\n<p>But from the beginning of <em>True West</em>, as also indicated by Shepard, we hear the yapping of coyotes outside the house. &#8220;The sense of growing frenzy in the pack should be felt in the background,&#8221; the stage directions read; but here, as in any successful production of the play, the real beasts are always visible, and painfully familiar.</p>\n<p><strong><b>True West </b>opened January 24, 2019, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through March 17. Tickets and information: <a href=\"https://www.roundabouttheatre.org/get-tickets/2018-2019-season/true-west/\">roundabouttheatre.org</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Go West, said a newspaperman many years ago. But what is the West today? What is the modern frontier? What does it mean to be American, a brother, a man? What is freedom? And why would you need a full loaf of toasted white bread?</p>\n<p>Sam Shepard’s <em>True West</em>, which was a Pulitzer finalist in 1983 and opened tonight in its latest revival in a Roundabout production at the American Airlines, asks these questions, and many more. The play, about a pair of estranged brothers and their apparent role reversal under pressure, is as funny as it is serious, and this new staging, directed by James Macdonald, a specialist in heavy-hitters, is as entertaining as it is profound. This is not a revelatory new interpretation, but it’s a serious and successful look at a seminal modern work.</p>\n<p>The problem, if there is one, is that <em>True West</em>’s previous New York staging, at the Circle in the Square nine years ago, was in fact a revelation. I missed that production, but the reaction was rapturous. The play had made several prior off-Broadway appearances, but for its Main Stem debut director Matthew Warchus had his two leads alternate their roles. It wasn’t just a gimmick: The play is about a duality inside men and inside society. But the decision also achieved the frisson of a great gimmick, because his two actors were Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly. Ben Brantley was rapturous, especially about how the two men played the two brothers differently.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/01/24/true-west-shepards-raging-brothers-return/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Now our two leads are Ethan Hawke and Paul Dano. They are excellent. Hawke plays the dissolute, menacing brother Lee, unshaven and unkempt, who has returned from the desert to his mother’s suburban L.A. home, where he encounters the brother he hasn’t seen in five years. Dano is Austin, the well-educated, clean-cut brother in an Oxford shirt, a moderately successful screenwriter who is taking care of the house while mom is on vacation in Alaska. Hawke luxuriates in his role; his Lee is gloriously, self-indulgently unpleasant, and Hawke gives a looser performance than he often does. Dano is a pleasant fussbudget, a fine, nebbishy stage actor who nicely shades his character’s descent from suburban propriety.</p>\n<p>But you can’t imagine them switching the roles, as their predecessors did. You don’t feel like you’re seeing something unprecedented.</p>\n<p>What you are seeing, though, is a top-notch take on Shepard’s provocative script. The short version is that Austin begins as the good boy, on the cusp of selling a new script. Lee shows up, cons Austin’s producer into hiring him instead, and thus begins the downfall of one brother and the rise of the other. While in the first act Austin tries to get work done while Lee distracts and harasses him, in Act Two it’s Austin who’s struggling at the typewriter and Lee who, aided by alcohol, has returned to an annoying state of nature.</p>\n<p>They’re in California, where Horace Greeley wanted young men to find new lives, but now (or at least then, in the 1980s) that new life is found through a good deal with a studio. They’re both mixed up about their places in the world. Early on, Lee goes casing neighbors houses for a potential heist. He comments about one that it was “Like a paradise. &#8216;Kinda place that sorta kills ya inside…. Blond people movin&#8217; in and outta the rooms, talkin&#8217; to each other. Kinda place you sort of wish you grew up in, ya know?&#8221; (Catch that contradiction: A paradise that kills you inside, which you wish you’d grown up in.) Austin, on the other hand, who starts as a has-it-all everyman, first becomes determined to prove he can steal something, too — hence a hilarious dozen toasters, and hence all that toast — and then decides that he wants to disappear to the desert, too.</p>\n<p>Gary Wilmes is duly slimy as the movie producer who change in affection set the reversal in motion, and Marylouise Burke is delightfully sharp and sanguine as the mother who returns home to find her sons destroying her home and each other. The set by Mimi Lien, an anodyne SoCal split-level that is methodically destroyed, is a character of its own.</p>\n<p>But ultimately this is a production where the play, not the performances, is the thing. Shepard would have us believe that order and disorder, domestic man and wild one, are within all of us. Lee turns into Austin and Austin into Lee because they are the same, and this is what society does to us. It’s a very Shepardian worldview, if not necessarily that of anxious New Yorkers, and <em>True West</em> makes a strong case for it.</p>\n<p><strong><b>True West </b>opened January 24, 2019, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through March 17. Tickets and information: <a href=\"https://www.roundabouttheatre.org/get-tickets/2018-2019-season/true-west/\">roundabouttheatre.org</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Tarell Alvin McCraney’s <em>Choir Boy</em> is a knockout tale of music, homophobia, and racism told in rousing and entertaining manner. Manhattan Theatre Club, which first presented the play in a limited run at their smallest stage in the summer of 2013, has now finally moved it to Broadway—and it’s about time! <em>Choir Boy</em> was brave and stunning back then. With an expanded production, a strengthened script, and the return of three of the central actors, McCraney’s play is even more powerful now at the Friedman.</p>\n<p>That it should take five years to make the move is perhaps understandable, given the unconventional subject matter and a then-relatively unknown playwright. Since 2013, McCraney has won himself a screenwriting Oscar for <em>Moonlight</em>, which was based on an unfinished script he wrote while in college; has been anointed a MacArthur Foundation Fellow, which we’ve learned to no longer call a genius grant; and is presently chair of the Playwriting Department at Yale. Which is to say that the author not only deserves a Broadway opportunity; he <em>belongs</em> on Broadway, as a visit to <em>Choir Boy</em> makes abundantly clear.</p>\n<p>This is, yes, a play about the boys in the choir: High school students at the Charles R. Drew Prep School for Boys, which is known for its choir and makes substantial use of it for fundraising purposes. Pharus Young (Jeremy Pope) is clearly the lead talent; he is also unapologetically flamboyant, despite being a scholarship student at this religious school. Headmaster Marrow (Chuck Cooper) accepts Pharus for who he is, but clearly has long been counseling him to show restraint. Which is not in the boy’s nature.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/01/08/choir-boy-make-a-joyful-noise/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★ review here.</a>]</p>\n<p>Trouble comes when one of the choirboys, Bobby Marrow (J. Quinton Johnson), slings homophobic slurs while they are singing at a commencement ceremony. This is compounded by the circumstance that Bobby is one of the “legacy students” <em>and</em> nephew to the headmaster. As the play proceeds, there are other undercurrents of sexuality, which eventually boil over.</p>\n<p>Racial undertones overlap with the arrival of noted historian Mr. Pendleton (played, as it happens, by Austin Pendleton; the surname might be coincidental, or not). Putting the white septuagenarian in with the black boys has an obvious effect, with McCraney adding unanticipated depth by giving Pendleton a relevant Civil Rights pedigree.</p>\n<p>Spirituals, sung by the choir, are woven through the drama. These are not mere window dressing or entertainment interludes; the plot builds to a philosophical argument about the use of spirituals as signposts for escaping slaves. (I.e., does “Wade in the Water” advise fugitives fleeing along the Mississippi to wander offshore for the purposes of throwing off bloodhounds? Or is it, simply, a spiritual?)</p>\n<p>What is most significant about these spirituals is that they are so exceptionally performed by Pope (as Pharus) and his colleagues, including the bigoted Bobby. The rousing <em>a cappella</em> arrangements and musical direction by Jason Michael Webb literally stop the show, and when was the last time you saw a play with repeated musical showstoppers? What is crucial to the evening, and to McCraney’s purpose, is that the singing intermingles with sometimes difficult dramatic scenes, and serves to continually lift and engage the audience. The musical staging by Camille A. Brown (who is credited for “movement”) heightens the effect, and does indeed raise the temperature inside the Friedman.</p>\n<p>Pope is remarkable as the self-assured singer who refuses to back down. (One imagines that the play has autobiographical components, as did McCraney’s <em>Moonlight</em>.) This was a stunning performance back in 2013; it’s rather astounding that Pope is only now making his Broadway debut. In the interim, he has created a leading role in the new Temptations musical, <em>Ain’t Too Proud</em>, which is scheduled to begin previews at the Imperial ten days after <em>Choir Boy</em> closes.</p>\n<p>Joining Pope in the spotlight are the two Broadway veterans, Cooper and Pendleton. Tony-winner Cooper (from <em>Caroline, or Change</em> and <em>The Life,</em> among others) is giving what might be his finest performance as the strict headmaster who nevertheless recognizes that the fragile Pharus deserves special treatment. As for Pendleton, he too is at his best as the near-doddering white teacher dedicated to helping the students. Pendleton has been on Broadway for 55 years, since creating the role of the self-effacing tailor Motel Kamzoil in the original production of <em>Fiddler on the Roof</em>. He is also an accomplished director and acting teacher, and recipient of a special Drama Desk Award as “a Renaissance man of the American theatre”—all of which seems to enhance his performance.</p>\n<p>The actors playing the four featured boys offer fine support for Pope: John Clay III as the roommate AJ, who gives what might be the most sympathetic performance; Caleb Eberhardt as the conflicted David, who is in training for the ministry; Nicholas L. Ashe (repeating from the 2013 cast) as Junior, the henchman to the class bully who ultimately switches allegiance; and Johnson as Bobby, with a splendid portrayal of the villainous 17-year-old bigot who nevertheless is dedicated to singing bass in the choir.</p>\n<p>Trip Cullman (<em>Lobby Hero</em>, <em>Significant Other</em>) has recreated his superlative staging, with scenic/costume designer David Zinn providing a simple but extremely versatile unit set that allows freedom of movement. The set seems to be expanded here, with more width and depth than possible at City Center Stage II. Peter Kaczorowski, as ever, sensitively sculpts the piece with light.</p>\n<p>McCraney has done a certain amount of work on the play; the action takes place “last year,” which is quite different today than when the play was first produced. (While <em>Choir Boy</em> does not deal with politics, there are some clearly relevant new gibes which would not have occurred to the author or landed with the audience in 2013.) The cast has been expanded as well. While Pharus used to have four fellow choir boys, there are now eight—which is to say that the understudies are now onstage at key spots, amplifying the choral strength and filling in the larger playing area.</p>\n<p>One thing which is missing at the Friedman is “I Been in the Storm So Long,” which Cooper—arguably the strongest singer in either cast—delivered with rafter-rising intensity. One can understand why the rousing number was excised; there was little dramaturgical logic in having the Headmaster, who unlike the boys is <em>not</em> a singer, overshadow the choir. Perhaps McCraney and Cullman and MTC can reinstate it after the bows, which would no doubt send the already delighted customers floating out to 47th Street on a choral cloud.</p>\n<p><strong>Choir Boy opened January 8, 2019, at Samuel J.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">That joyful noise you hear arising from the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre is the mellifluous tenor of Jeremy Pope, the golden-voiced actor making his Broadway debut in Tarell Alvin McCraney’s tender coming-of-age drama <i>Choir Boy</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You might remember Pope from <i>Choir Boy</i>’s 2013 off-Broadway premiere at Manhattan Theatre Club’s City Center Stage II; thankfully, he’s returned—along with a few other original cast members, including amiable Tony-winner Chuck Cooper (as a no-nonsense headmaster) and a wonderfully rumpled Austin Pendleton (as a wonderfully rumpled professor named Mr. Pendleton)—to lead McCraney’s <i>Choir</i> once more.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When we first meet the magnetic Pope, as Pharus, the bright-eyed leader of the gospel choir at the Charles R. Drew Prep School for Boys, he’s entreating us to “Trust and Obey”—the school song. Behind him, a less-than-Christian fellow choir member is calling him ungodly names under a lyric about walking with the Lord in the light of His Word. Pharus’ concentration cracks, but his voice doesn’t break. “I’ve never missed a key of G since I was 3,” he says later.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/01/08/choir-boy-brave-new-voice-on-broadway/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">McCraney has endowed Pharus with a war chest full of wisecracks, an arsenal of verbal armor to guard against homophobic high school classmates and hypercritical educators. For instance, his quip to Headmaster Marrow (Cooper), whose nephew Bobby (J. Quinton Johnson) was kicked out of the choir: “Oh he was voted off the Island. We serve a democratic Lord in this house.” Or what he calls “locker room talk”—teasing his roommate, AJ (John Clay III), about the size of his, ahem, you know: “This something out the prehistoric times. Need to be tagged and released back to the wild.” (Which of course gets a larger-than-necessary laugh simply because of the phrase “locker room talk.”)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Not that Pharus doesn’t have depth: Those sassy, rapid-fire quips belie a profoundly wounded, insecure heart—like that of any teenager, gay, straight, or otherwise. (“Every time I turn around there is something that I have done or undone that has me called into question,” Pharus laments to the headmaster.) But as far as portraits of young gay men coming to terms with their sexuality, McCraney has dug deeper, and to greater effect: most recently with <i>Moonlight</i>, 2016’s Academy Award–winning Best Picture, based on his script <i>In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue</i> (he shared a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar with the film’s director, Barry Jenkins); and most notably with the <i>Marcus; or the Secret of Sweet</i>, the third play (after <i>The Brothers Size</i> and <i>In the Red and Brown Water</i>) in his bayou-set, mythology-laden <i>Brother/Sister Plays</i> trilogy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But oh—the songs! Ranging from the sepulchral spiritual “Motherless Child” to the Civil Rights–era folk anthem “Keep Your Eyes on the Prize” (which has been performed by artists as varied as Mavis Staples and Bruce Springsteen), the choral music is rich and rousing. And the choreography—kinetic, forceful movement by Camille A. Brown (<i>Once on This Island</i>)—positively electric. Praise be!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>Choir Boy</em> opened January 8, 2019 and runs through March 10 at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The not inconsiderable controversy that has surrounded the Broadway adaptation of Harper Lee’s <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> since it was authorized by the author shortly before her death in early 2016 has been convincingly resolved at the Shubert. Concerns about whether the script by Aaron Sorkin supports or subverts the novelist’s intentions are instantly allayed, with the audience held in rapt attention throughout. This stage <em>Mockingbird</em> is majestically triumphant.</p>\n<p>Words are necessarily changed, actions altered, and scenes refashioned for dramatic purpose, yes; but playwright Sorkin—with expert aid from director Bartlett Sher—serves Lee exceptionally well. The soul and conscience of the 1960 novel virtually leap across the footlights, in a manner every bit as strong as they did on the page and in the 1962 motion picture version. The Broadway <em>Mockingbird</em> will likely leave a throb in your heart and a well of tears in your eyes.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/12/13/to-kill-a-mockingbird-a-timeless-favorite-revered-and-reborn/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Sorkin and Sher begin their play on what turns out to be the precisely right note. A decrepit warehouse-like space is revealed, which is then almost magically (read: <em>theatrically</em>) transformed to each and all of the necessary locales in the fictional “tired old town” of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Depression-era summer of 1934. From the first, three children—young Scout, her brother, Jem, and their Penrod-like friend, Dill—take focus, serving as narrators offering a vibrant flashback to the serious events of the preceding months. The fragmented and impressionistic storytelling, built around “big scenes” that stand out in the three childrens’ collective memories, carefully capture the startling impact of Lee’s novel. This is enhanced by the manner in which Sorkin and Sher weave the children into some of the flashbacks as almost ghostly observers.</p>\n<p>A major part of this <em>Mockingbird</em>’s spell, right from the beginning, is a second conceit: These children are played, openly and unapologetically, by adult actors. There’s no reason to expect that Celia Keenan-Bolger (<em>Peter and the Starcatcher</em>, <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>), Will Pullen (<em>Sweat</em>), and Gideon Glick (<em>Significant Other</em>) should be so very good in the roles. As it turns out, their acting skills allow them to convincingly serve and sustain the play in a manner that three juvenile actors most likely could not. Keenan-Bolger, with a ferociously jutting jaw leading her body across the stage, has determination enough for any six-year-old; and Glick, his body gangly and concave, is a perfect embodiment of the irrepressibly awkward Dill (patterned after Lee’s childhood pal, who grew up to become Truman Capote).</p>\n<p>The centerpiece of any representation of Lee’s novel, of course, must be the actor playing Atticus Finch, the small-town lawyer who insists on seeing the best in everyone. Jeff Daniels—whose long career recently brought him back to Broadway with <em>Blackbird</em>—undertakes the role here, and he is remarkable. It’s not that he wipes out the memory of Gregory What’s-His-Name in the motion picture version; it’s simply that Daniels perfectly embodies Atticus Finch, and that’s that.</p>\n<p>LaTanya Richardson Jackson (<em>Raisin in the Sun</em>) adds moral gravity as the housekeeper, somewhat more so than Calpurnia does in the novel. In 1960 America, there were limits to how noble and well-spoken the novelist could have drawn the character. Standing out among the large cast are Gbenga Akinnagbe (in his Broadway debut) as Tom Robinson, the man on trial; Frederick Weller (<em>Mothers and Sons</em>), vibrantly evil as the repellent Bob Ewell; and Erin Wilhelmi (<em>The Crucible</em>) as the victimized Mayella. (Did the author borrow this oversexed, incestuous father-daughter duo from Erskine Caldwell’s <em>Tobacco Road</em>, a bestseller published when Lee was 6 and successfully adapted for both stage and screen by the time she was 15?) There are two excellent performances from members of the recent <em>Iceman Cometh</em> cast: Dakin Matthews as the judge who bends over backward to assure a fair trial; and Neal Huff as Link Deas, the town misfit who speaks the truth.</p>\n<p>Sher and associates have devised a physical production that augments the play’s aura of fragmented memory. Set designer Miriam Buether does this with high theatrical flair; all the relevant locales are clearly presented, but there seem to be few actual walls other than the jailhouse exterior. Buether, who provided the psychologically compelling scenery for last year’s <em>Three Tall Women</em>, is also currently on the boards with the astounding <em>The Jungle</em> at St. Ann’s Warehouse.</p>\n<p>Ann Roth, who has been providing exquisitely realized costumes for stage and screen since the days when giants like Neil Simon and Mike Nichols roamed the Rialto—<em>The Odd Couple</em>, in 1966, was Roth’s <em>eighteenth</em> Broadway show—works her usual magic here. Note the way Scout is dressed in drably colored tomboy garb but with a noticeably newer add-on collar emblazoned with bright red roses. Also consider what is presumably the only courtroom-worthy suit Atticus owns, with trousers that look that they haven’t been pressed since Herbert Hoover was voted out of office. Jennifer Tipton expertly sculpts the many playing areas with light, as she has been doing since the late 1960s. Scott Lehrer does his customarily effective job with the sound design.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that Sher has worked almost exclusively, and always successfully, with one set designer, one costume designer, and mostly two lighting designers; the team has done all 11 of Sher’s prior Broadway shows. <em>Mockingbird</em> has jolted him into new collaborations, with rewarding results all around.</p>\n<p>Sher has also commissioned an atmospheric incidental score from the estimable Adam Guettel of <em>Light in the Piazza</em>, played by an onstage organist (at the base of the stage left proscenium) and a guitarist (on stage right). Beneath the dress and wig of that schoolmarmish organist, incidentally, is Kimberley Grigsby, who has electrified musicals like <em>The Full Monty</em> and <em>Spring Awakening</em> from the conductor’s podium.</p>\n<p>The magic of <em>Mockingbird</em>, though, rests on the theatrical imagination of Sorkin, who burst into prominence in 1989 with <em>A Few Good Men</em> and has since ensconced himself in screen-and-TV-land with <em>The West Wing</em> and <em>The Social Network,</em> among many highlights. He demonstrates here what novelist Lee—who was famously protective of her work—presumably recognized when granting permission for his play. Stage adaptation is just that; not simply transplanting dialogue from page to stage, but refashioning the source material for the very different medium. (In this case, Sorkin uses humor as one of his effective tools.) A relevant comparison can be made with the current <em>Network</em>: the heart of the piece is well conveyed, thanks in part to a bravura performance by the leading man. But the rest of the venture is dramatically uncompelling, leaving us thinking we might as well just watch the movie.</p>\n<p>Lee publicly praised Horton Foote when he won an Oscar for his screen adaptation of <em>Mockingbird</em>. Contrary to the recent complaints and courtroom wrangling from the late novelist’s literary executor—a small-town lawyer with an apparently limited artistic imagination—one suspects the Harper Lee would be similarly thrilled by the magnificent manner in which Sorkin, Sher &amp; Co. have brought Atticus, Scout, Jem, Dill, Boo Radley, and the rest to the stage.</p>\n<p><strong>To Kill a Mockingbird opened December 13, 2018, at the Shubert Theatre. Tickets and information:   information: </strong><strong><a href=\"https://tokillamockingbirdbroadway.com/\">tokillamockingbirdbroadway.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#8220;All rise,&#8221; a character says early in Aaron Sorkin&#8217;s new stage adaptation of Harper Lee&#8217;s <em>To Kill A Mockingbird</em>. It’s an instruction common to the courtroom, where much of the play takes place. But as those two words are periodically repeated throughout this extraordinary production, they also become a sort of mantra, an appeal—as plain and direct as any being made on Broadway right now—to our better angels, or whatever it is that elevates minds and souls tested by troubled times or base instincts.</p>\n<p>Sorkin is most widely known as a screenwriter; in films such as <em>Steve Jobs</em>, <em>Moneyball </em>and <em>The Social Network</em> and TV&#8217;s &#8220;The West Wing&#8221; and &#8220;The Newsroom,&#8221; he has crafted verbal scores capturing with rat-a-tat panache the witty conviviality and brutality of the ambitious and privileged. Lee&#8217;s novel, one of the most cherished in American literature, presents him with an entirely different milieu: a small Alabama town in 1934, ravaged by the Great Depression, in which community takes precedence over individual aspiration.</p>\n<p>As anyone familiar with Lee&#8217;s story or the history of the Jim Crow South knows well, the sense of community here is not all-embracing. Not unlike our country today, Maycomb has seen many of its citizens—the men, especially—broken economically and spiritually, their pockets depleted and their pride wounded by not only the market crash but also the lingering fallout of the Civil War. It&#8217;s under these fraught circumstances that Tom Robinson, a black laborer, finds himself falsely accused of raping Mayella Ewell, the poor, white daughter of Bob Ewell, as virulent a racist as ever stalked the pages of a middle-school text. The impossible task of summoning angels to rescue Tom falls to middle-aged lawyer and widower Atticus Finch, a name that has become synonymous with nobility as Americans define it, by character rather than class.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/12/13/to-kill-a-mockingbird-harper-lees-classic-makes-magnificent-theater/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>In Lee&#8217;s book, and the beloved 1962 film adaptation, featuring a screenplay by Horton Foote, the story is relayed to us years later by Scout, Atticus’s daughter, who is turning six when events start unfolding. Sorkin retains the sense of devastated innocence augmented by an older, more worldwise perspective, but adds theatrical punch by having Scout’s older brother, Jem, and Dill, the child they befriend while he’s visiting the neighborhood—all played, under Bartlett Sher’s direction, by adult actors—accompany and embellish her narration, sometimes addressing the audience themselves.</p>\n<p>The device is typical of Sorkin&#8217;s work here: utterly respectful and faithful in spirit—lest anyone feared otherwise, after an attorney representing Lee&#8217;s estate sued the production over an early draft (leading to a counter-suit, then an out-of-court settlement)—while asking us to look forward, and inward, and around us, positing that multi-pronged challenge in the guise of vital, thrilling entertainment. Sher has proven a master of this approach in numerous revivals of American classics, as well as new works; together, the director and playwright allow us to climb inside the skin, as Atticus would put it, of characters representing another time and place, and pace, but seem instantly, sometimes disturbingly accessible.</p>\n<p>The performances are better than perfect; they&#8217;re revelatory, with each actor serving both the novel&#8217;s humane vision and the nuances and adjustments Sorkin has contributed. Jeff Daniels&#8217; magnificent Atticus—a new high-water mark for an actor whose presence makes any play (or film) worth seeing— may strike you as a more natural small-town Southern lawyer than the more patrician (if unforgettable) Gregory Peck. Hardy and a bit gruff, with a perceptible paunch, Daniels&#8217; Atticus isn&#8217;t above physically confronting a threatening bigot. But when he speaks to his children about the importance of having empathy for all people, his compassion is as true and as tender as his presence before the court is mighty—and in the latter arena, Sorkin furnishes opportunities for Atticus to express his frustration with the case, the system and even his client in terms that can be more blunt and biting than Lee&#8217;s or Foote&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>Tom and Calpurnia, the Finches&#8217; black housekeeper, are more intimately acquainted with the injustices of that system than any legal scholar could be, and Sorkin gives them more frank and expansive voices as well. LaTanya Richardson Jackson&#8217;s warm, witty and wise Calpurnia is both a constant source of love and loyalty to Atticus’s family and his sparring partner, contesting in particular his stubborn insistence on looking for the good in everyone.</p>\n<p>As Tom, Gbenga Akinnagbe emerges as more than the &#8220;quiet, respectable, humble Negro&#8221; Lee&#8217;s Atticus describes to the jury in his closing argument; Akinnagbe&#8217;s gently robust performance captures those qualities, but also Tom’s despair over the intolerance that has doomed him. His candor with Atticus, like Calpurnia&#8217;s, is made credible by the trust and fellowship this play&#8217;s earthy hero inspires. Tom’s integrity and dignity are thrown into even sharper relief by the bone-chilling malevolence of Frederick Weller&#8217;s Bob, and the repression-fueled hysteria of Erin Wilhelmi&#8217;s fragile, feral Mayella.</p>\n<p>No characters are more central to <em>Mockingbird</em> than the children, of course, and by having Scout share the telling of her tale with Dill and (to a somewhat lesser extent) Jem, Sorkin has provided showcases for a trio of superb, youngish actors. It would be hard to imagine a more ideal Scout than the ageless Celia Keenan-Bolger, who imbues the precocious tomboy with all the intensity and wonder you&#8217;d expect. Gideon Glick is quirkily charming and moving as the eccentric, brilliant and haunted Dill, a character inspired by Lee’s childhood friend Truman Capote, while Will Pullen’s impish Jem wins our hearts as a mischief-maker who is nonetheless undeniably Atticus&#8217;s son.</p>\n<p>The three remain in almost constant motion, whether at play or in the courtroom, where they are fascinated, appalled observers. Characteristically, Sher enhances the urgency and suspense of the piece in part through physical movement; actors carry parts of Miriam Buether&#8217;s handsome, bucolic set, which exudes a sense of resilience and tradition—the Finches&#8217; modest but sturdy home, the large tree that sits resolvedly beside it—that also inform darker features of the story, like the hooded, armed men who find Atticus outside Tom&#8217;s jail cell at another key juncture in the children’s disillusionment.</p>\n<p>An angel does finally arrive in this <em>Mockingbird</em>, briefly—and too late for Tom—but memorably, as he did in the book and movie. Danny Wolohan plays Boo Radley, the notorious, elusive neighbor the kids have stalked and feared, who emerges as their selfless protector. With his delicate, ghostlike presence, Boo drives home the point that goodness can indeed lurk in unexpected places, and that appearances, be they due to rumor or race, should never figure into judging a man or woman.</p>\n<p><em>Mockingbird</em>’s lessons may seem obvious, but like so many on offer at this moment, they also come across as depressingly timely and necessary. By acknowledging that need in a straightforward, utterly unpretentious manner, accompanied by blazing artistry, Sorkin, Sher and their cast and collaborators have given us a production that feels as urgent and eternal as its source.</p>\n<p><strong><b>To Kill a Mockingbird opened December 13, 2018, at the Shubert Theatre. Tickets and information:   information: <a href=\"https://tokillamockingbirdbroadway.com/\">tokillamockingbirdbroadway.com</a></b></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Carol Rosegg</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>For anybody wondering “Ruben and Clay <em>who?</em>” let’s briefly review:</p>\n<p>Ruben Studdard and Clay Aiken were contestants on the second season of the <em>American Idol</em> series in 2003. The rivalry between them is credited with driving the show to the top of TV ratings and securing its enduring popularity. Studdard narrowly won the contest over Aiken.</p>\n<p>During the 15 years since then, both performers have separately perpetuated their singing careers with successful recordings and tours, and appearances on TV and in film.</p>\n<p>The singers now team up for <em>Ruben &amp; Clay’s First Annual Christmas Carol Family Fun Pageant Spectacular Reunion Show</em>, which opened tonight at the Imperial Theatre for a visit through the end of the month.</p>\n<p>Anybody who wondered “Ruben and Clay <em>who</em>?” can safely skip this unpretentious attraction, which appears exclusively aimed to please these gentlemen’s admirers.</p>\n<p>Fashioned as a variety show, the two-act event opens with Studdard and Aiken striving to out-perform each other in a medley of “Silent Night” and “Come All Ye Faithful,” during which they keep reappearing in glitzier outfits and accompanied by props referencing the likes of <em>Wicked</em> and <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>.</p>\n<p>And so the show toddles along, as Studdard and Aiken banter about who’s better, crack a few jokes about being in New York City, and perform various holiday numbers-—usually separately, occasionally as duets, or as side by side solos of complementary songs. There is a running jest about whose name goes first over the title and another one involving a stocking in which they deposit bucks if anyone says something off color.</p>\n<p>Other than a toilet gag punctuated by a flushing noise, there’s nothing objectionable here. Nothing of particular amusement, either.</p>\n<p>Obviously the fans are there to hear their idols sing than do anything else. Aiken, whose hair has gone silver over the years, is the far more animated performer of the twosome, and his sugared tenor voice sounds clear and vital. Studdard seems markedly lower in energy to the point of sitting down every now and then, but his gospel-style baritone vocals remain downy in sound.</p>\n<p>Their musicianship is more about bravura singing than interpreting the sentiments of songs; they shoot for the big, lasting notes rather than explore any emotional nuances within the lyrics. Perhaps that’s too much to ask for in our meretricious current times, especially with material so familiar as carols and holiday novelty numbers. Still, there tends to be a muchness about such performances when they mostly involve vocal flash while offering scant heart.</p>\n<p>The co-stars are abetted onstage by Farah Alvin, Ken Arpino, Julian Diaz-Granados, La’nette Wallace, and Khaila Wilcoxon, who perform with eager zest. Dressed in sparkly black duds, they spell Studdard and Aiken during costume changes, participate in a <em>Laugh-In</em> style joke wall (remember <em>Laugh-In</em>?), and most notably race through a medley of 15 songs in four minutes. Five musicians support the performances.</p>\n<p>The production, directed by Jonathan Tessero, still appears a bit rough around the edges in its technical transitions. Designer Ron Bessinger provides some modest but appropriate holiday décor involving stylized fir trees, a rustic fireplace, and green and white arched portals.</p>\n<p>The top of the second act presents a brief video regarding the National Inclusion Project, which enables children with disabilities to participate in a range of programs and activities that might otherwise exclude them. A portion of this event’s proceeds will benefit this endeavor. This charitable gesture by Studdard and Aiken may well be the truly nicest thing about their show.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruben &amp; Clay’s Christmas Show opened December 11, 2018, at the Imperial Theatre and runs through December 30. </strong><strong>Tickets and information: <a href=\"http://www.rubenandclay.com/\">rubenandclay.com</a></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Photo: Jan Versweyveld</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A little more than halfway through <em>Network</em>—Lee Hall’s theatrical adaptation of the deliciously cynical (and eerily prescient) Paddy Chayefsky–scripted 1976 film—Tony winner Bryan Cranston (<em>All the Way</em>), as disgraced news anchor–turned–primetime prophet Howard Beale, is ready to deliver the character’s iconic mad-as-hell speech. Before he even says a word, we see how broken down Beale is. Cameras zoom in on his furrowed brow, on his lips as he starts to speak but chokes on his own words, on his weary eyes welling with tears. The pain is written all over his face, and projected onto a 12- by 20-foot screen for the entire Belasco Theatre audience to see. That’s when director Ivo van Hove’s multimedia-saturated concept clicks: <em>Naturally</em> you’d put cameras all over a production of <em>Network</em>. So we can see every inch of his anguished face, magnificent and magnified, as he repeats the words “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore.”</p>\n<p>Then, a few minutes later, two characters are having sex in a restaurant and, well…nothing about van Hove’s production works as well as the Cranston close-ups.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/12/06/network-ivo-van-hove-brings-the-1976-oscar-winning-film-glaringly-to-the-stage/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>To explain: UBS news division head Max (Tony Goldwyn, just off TV&#8217;s soapy <em>Scandal</em>) and Diana (Tatiana Maslany), an ambitious, tough–as–acrylic nails programming exec, are about to rekindle their romance. First, they engage in some flirty banter while walking down the street. West 44th Street, to be specific—just outside the Belasco. You’ll notice the sign for Virgil’s BBQ and the marquee for <em>Head Over Heels</em> in the background, and perhaps a mugging bike messenger on the edge of the frame. The two then walk from 2018 back into the mid-’70s-set play into an on-stage eatery, Foodwork (get it?), filled with real audience members paying a premium to enjoy dinner and drinks within spitting distance of Fitz and Walter White. In the film, the sex scene was funny because Faye Dunaway couldn’t stop talking about rival networks and money and subpoenas even though she was on top of William Holden. Here, it’s laughable because Maslany and Goldwyn are unnervingly close to theatergoers who are either averting their eyes or, on the night I attended, fanning themselves and acting like they’re part of the scene.</p>\n<p>While we’re on the subject of the restaurant—priced $299–$399, which includes the ticket plus a meal designed by White House executive pastry chef Bill Yosses (he made the yummy pies for the recent off-Broadway <em>Sweeney Todd</em>): <em>Why?</em> Because we’ve morphed into a generation for which dinner and the nightly news are inextricably entwined? There’s already so much commotion on stage: multiple cameramen swirling around; the always-buzzing glass-walled control room, behind which we can see makeup mirrors and a teleprompter (van Hove’s usual collaborator, Jan Versweyveld, designed the ultraslick set); a bank of televisions on the back wall, rolling a constant stream of vintage commercials featuring such icons as Mr. Whipple and Scrubbing Bubbles. A couple rows of people eating shrimp rolls and empanadas seems like an unnecessary distraction.</p>\n<p>When Cranston is on, we’re completely tuned in. His Beale is a force—commanding, ferocious, dignified, even vulnerable. He’s every inch the “latter-day prophet” and “magnificent messianic figure” that the ratings-hungry Diana turns him into. If only we could change the channel on the Max-Diana story. Maslany and Goldwyn simply don’t set off any sparks, and Goldwyn looks too far too fresh-faced to be playing a “craggy middle-aged man” (even though technically he’s the right age for the role).</p>\n<p>Only Broadway vet Nick Wyman, as corporate honcho Arthur Jensen, matches Cranston’s intensity. His unadorned delivery of Chayefsky&#8217;s ode-to-the-almighty-dollar speech envisioning a perfect world—“without war or famine, oppression or brutality—one vast and ecumenical holding company, for whom all men will work to serve a common profit, in which all men will hold a share of stock, all necessities provided, all anxieties tranquilized, all boredom amused”—is a thing of absolute beauty.</p>\n<p>Wyman’s speech is also beautifully, and simply, staged. Starkly lit. No bells or whistles. It’s a brief, welcome respite from a production that purposely plunges the viewers into pandemonium. “Television is a goddam amusement park,” Beale opines during one of his on-air segments/sermons. “Television is a circus, a carnival, a traveling troupe of acrobats, story tellers, dancers, jugglers, side show freaks, lion-tamers and football players.” (Again, how ahead of his time was Chayefsky? Another of the screenwriter’s prophesies: “There is a whole and entire generation right now who never knew anything that didn’t come out of this tube.… This tube can make or break presidents, popes and prime ministers.”) No wonder van Hove, theater’s great disruptor—last represented on Broadway in 2015–16 with a barefoot <em>View From the Bridge</em> and an extra-witchy <em>Crucible</em>—wants to play ringleader. But when you’re watching a grainy ancient Mazola ad instead of a live actor, the background noise is getting way too loud.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Network</em> opened Dec. 6, 2018, and runs through June 8, 2019, at the Belasco Theatre.

Photo: Jan Versweyveld</figcaption></figure>\n<p>“I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore” isn’t precisely how I felt watching—and listening to, ‘cause it sure is loud—Ivo van Hove’s stage version of Sidney Lumet’s <em>Network</em>, the 1976 Oscar-winning film. But I definitely did have a restrained reaction to the opus Lee Hall adapted rather faithfully from Paddy Chayevsky’s Oscar-winning screenplay.</p>\n<p>Before I get into all that, I need to report that the “I’m mad as hell…” phrase Chayevsky sent into the ether 40 years back is not only broadcast from the stage multiple times but blasted by the audience as well. In other words, whereas moviegoers weren’t encouraged to repeat the utterance (how might they have been?), ticket buyers get the chance to join in the fun. At the same time they prove eager to behave with sheep-like docility.</p>\n<p>(Or maybe they are truly mad as hell: at escalating ticket prices. Maybe not.)</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/12/06/network-maddening-as-hell/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>So the spectators are having a good time—or think they are. They’ve given themselves over to the volatile tale of UBS newscaster Howard Beale (Bryan Cranston, breaking quite good here) who, due to poor 1975 ratings, has been fired by news executive and best friend Max Schumacher (Tony Goldwyn). As a result and having nothing else in his life, he decides to end it all before his television audience.</p>\n<p>This infuriates higher-ups like network head Edward Ruddy (Ron Canada) and upcoming go-getter Frank Hackett (Joshua Boone) but not ambitious, conniving Diana Christensen (Tatiana Maslany). She sees Beale’s talk of everyday “bullshit”—and his threat of on-air suicide—as the key to increased ratings, which can lift UBS from heavy financial loses and reap greater revenues.</p>\n<p>Christensen gets her way, partially by cozying up to Schumacher, who then leaves wife Louise (Alyssa Bresnahan) for the young careerist. Beale is encouraged, coaxed, and cajoled into messianic broadcasts about, among other things, the unreliability of the news and the loss of individual freedom. This all clicks until Beale’s nightly harangues begin to pall, ratings slip and the unhinged, self-deluded fellow meets worse developments.</p>\n<p>It does behoove me to report that during Beale’s dizzying discourses, he conjures some unusually contemporary references. Carrying on about the media’s skewed reflection of events, he falls just short of saying, “Fake news.” Further focusing on viewers getting their entire vision of the world through television coverage, he could be describing boob-tube addicts like, say, Donald J. Trump.</p>\n<p>So that’s the <em>Network</em> plot gist. Then there’s the manner in which van Hove presents it. For many of his earlier works—right up to his earlier Broadway entry, <em>A View From the Bridge</em>—the busy director made a habit of playing a script’s subtext. (It worked gangbusters with the Arthur Miller drama, but that’s an exception.  His <em>The Crucible?</em>  Not so hot.)</p>\n<p>As of his recent take on Luchino Visconti’s <em>The Damned</em> he appears to be stressing milieu. That’s to say he emphasizes environment with as much theatricality as he can muster. He and scenic/lighting designer Jan Versweyveld muster plenty, which is to say that since this is <em>Network</em>, he’s thinking tv production. Cameras circulate, a huge screen hangs upstage to stand-in for a flat tv, monitors abound, lights blaze, engineering cubicles take up space, technicians and staffers scurry, a make-up room and a bar are housed in barely seen corners. There are even two rows of small tables at which audience members are planted to snack and suggest ratings populations.</p>\n<p>The result is sensory overload. That, of course, may be (must be?) van Hove’s intent. It’s understandable that <em>Network</em> is employing “network” as a metaphor. True, we’re all swamped by every damned thing coming at us on a daily basis. True, we’re drowning in too much of a muchness.</p>\n<p>Yes, repeatedly during the drama we’re not certain where we’re supposed to be looking; but van Hove’s allowing myriad distractions only obscures the ideas Chayevsky got across on screen. Now those critical notions sometimes seem confused and/or confusing. At other times as they probe the television’s deleterious societal effects, they seem wrong-headed and melodramatic. Maybe as 2018 slides into 2019 that’s more Chayevsky‘s problem. If so, van Hove and Hall aren’t doing anything to improve it.</p>\n<p>There’s another significant drawback: While creating his mirror-held-up-to-nature world, van Hove doesn’t appear to be paying any more than cursory attention to the actors and the acting. To his credit, Cranston runs quite an emotional gamut. He’s particularly amusing when first seen reading the news with a pronounced set of what could be called newsreader’s mouth. Okay, he plays the scene in which he comes up with the “I’m mad as hell…” proclamation as if he’s King Lear on the heath. Still, remember that in King Lear’s stripped circumstances he’s also mad as hell.</p>\n<p>As for the other players, it looks as if van Hove hasn’t done much more than give them a generalized director’s request that they issue wall-shaking yells whenever they have the slightest urge.</p>\n<p>Despite having a brazen on-stage intercourse-to-climax interlude, Goldwyn and, especially, Maslany fail to suggest obligatory sexual chemistry. Bresnahan certainly milks her wronged-wife moment for all it’s worth. Among the other scenery chewing personae, restrained Nick Wyman, in two sequences as pragmatic exec Arthur Jensen, looks good. Also, reliable actors like Frank Wood and Henry Stram can’t be blamed for excesses, as they’re hardly more than supernumeraries.</p>\n<p>For the record, Cranston as Beale initially blasts, “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take <em>this</em> anymore.” Then he hurls, “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take <em>that</em> anymore.”  Only then does he give out with, “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take <em>it</em> anymore.” If you decide to attend <em>Network</em> for its occasional undeniable pluses, see how long you can’t take this, that or it anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Network opened December 6, 2018, at the Neil Simon Theatre, and runs through June 8, 2019.

Block, and Micaela Diamond play the title figure of The Cher Show. Photo: Joan Marcus</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>A wildly entertaining affair, <em>The Cher Show</em> truly represents the singular superstar it chronicles: Just like the lady herself, this flashy new musical regarding the fabulous life and times of Cherilyn Sarkisian Bono Allman is funny, down-to-earth, madly flamboyant, occasionally conventional, blazing with talent, and delivers dozens of hit songs.</p>\n<p>Opening tonight at the Neil Simon Theatre, <em>The Cher Show</em> will thrill her fans. How this latest jukebox bio-show fares with a greater Broadway audience remains to be seen, of course, but it offers a helluva better experience than <em>Summer</em>, <em>On Your Feet!</em> or <em>Motown the Musical</em>, to name similar attractions that strived to illuminate the lives of pop music legends through their songs.</p>\n<p>Like <em>Summer: The Donna Summer Musical</em>, this show deploys three women to depict the star at different stages of life: Babe (Micaela Diamond) is the youngest Cher incarnation, Lady (Teal Wicks) is Cher in her middle ages, and Star (Stephanie J. Block) is the latter day Cher, who turns back time to review her story.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/12/03/the-cher-show-just-as-sassy-bold-and-determined-as-the-star-herself/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>All three performers—who manage to sound wonderfully like Cher without parodying her distinctive vocals—intermittently converse with each other, narrate events, and plunge into the various scenes and songs of Cher&#8217;s lifetime, which chronologically spins out.</p>\n<p>Rick Elice, the writer, boasts <em>Jersey Boys</em> among his credits, so he surely knows how to craft slick bio-shows. Since its doings are presented to viewers directly by Cher(s), Elice artfully makes the threesome casually speak in Cher’s conversational voice. This lends a personal, often humorous, quality to these proceedings that creates a genuine sense of credence and warmth.</p>\n<p>Such informality also gives Elice latitude to finesse his script, as when Star Cher ends a scene by saying, “Okay, moving on to the next part of the story.” One incredible incident involving Lucille Ball is annotated with the statement, “My hand to God, guys—this conversation actually happened.”</p>\n<p>Let’s not describe the mountains and valleys of Cher’s life depicted here, except to note that Elice maps them fluently while making cunning use of the lady’s song stack to reflect her good times and bum times. “Fame is a fleeting bitch,” says Cher, whose show certainly is a testament to tenacity, especially for a woman coping in a showbiz jungle mostly overrun by men. It’s great to see Emily Skinner forthrightly portray the star’s mama, who grounds Cher&#8217;s anxieties with the motto “the song makes you strong.”</p>\n<p>Cher (and Elice) gives full credit to Sonny Bono for her discovery and cultivation as a star, and he is charmingly given life by Jarrod Spector. The couple’s rendition of “I’ve Got You Babe” is downright adorable, and Spector’s rapport with Diamond, Wicks, and Block seems authentic. Cher’s romance and troubled marriage with Gregg Allman (a sweetly hazy Matthew Hydzik) is rendered neatly within the country &amp; western circumstances of “Ramblin’ Man” and other Allman hits.</p>\n<p>Probably the show’s most delightful sequences involve Cher’s longtime association with designer Bob Mackie, aptly embodied here with debonair flair by Michael Berresse, whose outrageously glam diva couture retrospectively parades by to the tune of “Ain’t Nobody’s Business If I Do.” Mackie also designs all of <em>The Cher Show</em> costumes and they look terrifically appropriate both in period and hotsy-totsy purpose.</p>\n<p>Not all of the show grooves quite so smoothly.</p>\n<p>The meltdown of Cher’s ties with Sonny erupts into a risible “Bang Bang” number involving torturous dancing amid an inferno of hellish projections, while the overstuffed second act, which hosts a droll “The Beat Goes On” salute to Cher’s movie career, proves somewhat choppy.</p>\n<p>Even so, it packs a dazzling, dramatic “Dark Lady” dance interlude during which Ashley Blair Fitzgerald wows the crowd as a Cher torn by rival emotions. Christopher Gatelli, who created the choreography for this showstopper, drives the production along sinuously, incorporating at times dance moves devised by others for Cher’s concert and video extravaganzas. The ensemble, sporting some sex-see Mackie duds, whips through the numbers with admirable energy and precision.</p>\n<p>Although <em>The Cher Show</em> has its occasional stumbles, the production mostly is fluently staged by director Jason Moore, thanks in no small part to the traveling video walls devised by Christine Jones and Brett J. Banakis, which accommodates effectively glitzy atmospherics conjured up by lighting designer Kevin Adams and video designer Darrel Maloney. Similarly, Daryl Waters’ music supervision unifies songs by dozens of writers into a Broadway-scale sonority that still suggests their original pop music flavor.</p>\n<p>Look: I&#8217;m no Cher fanboy, but I&#8217;ve grown up enjoying her songs, performances (I saw her breakthrough stage turn in <em>Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean</em> back in 1982 and, no lie, she was the real deal), and the forthright personality that she always radiates. Take it from me: <em>The Cher Show</em> does Cher proud and the show delivers enormous entertainment in doing so.</p>\n<p><strong><b>The Cher Show opened December 3, 2018, at the Neil Simon Theatre. Tickets and information:  <a href=\"https://thechershowbroadway.com/\">thechershowbroadway.com</a></b></strong></p>\n",

Block in The Cher Show. Photo by Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The indomitable Cher is making certain that the beat goes on—and on and on and on. As one of the producers of <em>The Cher Show</em>, she’s helped guarantee that the Neil Simon Theatre stage transfer is a great big hit as it reprises her life with and without her ambitious mother Georgia, with and without creative but money-hungry Sonny Bono, and with and without fancy guitarist and drug-inclined Gregg Allman.</p>\n<p>Her valentine to herself is just what a fan—this reviewer is a loyal one—might have expected it to be: a glittering, glamorous Las Vegas-like jukebox revue elevated by a basic but snappy Rick (<em>Jersey Boys</em>) Elice book that tracks the onetime Cherilyn Sarkisian from her poor childhood as a dark Armenian among California blonds to Top 40 standing to <em>The Sonny and Cher Comedy Show</em> to Oscar-winning actor and to abiding, often activist celebrity.</p>\n<p>Just as it takes three performers to portray Donna Summer in the Las Vegas-like jukebox revue <em>Summer</em>, Stephanie J. Block, Teal Wicks, and Micaela Diamond are Cher as, respectively, Star, Lady, and Babe. Their cumulative depiction amounts to a jaw-dropping presentation of Cher’s sound and inimitable sashay.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/12/03/the-cher-show-turning-back-time-with-a-singular-superstar/\"><em>Read Michael Sommers’ </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Actually, Block, Wicks and Diamond are so effective at their work that it’s got to be said that evidently Cher is imitable, after all. They nail Cher, about whom it might be said her vocal dynamics are what distinguish her more than the deep emotional feelings she lends a lyric. Block, in particular, who narrates throughout, is given the lengthiest share of Cher and is astounding.</p>\n<p>The hits are here—“Believe,” “Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves”, “Half Breed,” “If I Could Turn Back Time,” “The Way of Love.” The song list includes, of course—how could they not be included?—“The Beat Goes On,” “Bang, Bang,” and “I Got You, Babe,” all written by Sonny Bono, whom Jarrod Spector plays. Yes, it only takes one actor to represent Sonny, and Spector, a <em>Beautiful</em> alumnus (he opened as songwriter Barry Mann in that jukebox example), is perfect at the high Sonny Bono pitch and the tv-show picked-on swagger.</p>\n<p>(During the action, Sonny is shown hounding Cher to work long hours so they’ll never go hungry again, but this self-perpetuating production suggests that perhaps she isn’t against upping the bank account, either.)</p>\n<p>A strong argument could be made that a humongous part of the Cher look was created by Bob Mackie. So it’s only right that he has the costume design assignment here, which he takes with the endless glitzy fantasies that often turned Cher into a dazzling outré-fashion manikin.</p>\n<p>Backstage the costume racks must take up enormous space. The dressers must end performances needing oxygen. There’s a stunningly staged act-one dress parade that’s a <em>Cher </em>highlight. Certainly Mackie—played here by the agile Michael Berresse—has the costume design Tony sewed up (pun intended, needless to say). (What was the costume budget? The producers aren’t revealing.)</p>\n<p>No matter how uplifting or downgrading a Broadway musical might be, more often than not a craftsmanship prevails that never falls below a level not reached anywhere else on the theater planet. That display is on offer here with Charles G. LaPointe’s wigs, the Christine Jones and Brett J. Banakis sets, the Kevin Adams lighting and Nevin Steinberg sound. The same goes for Darrel Maloney’s video and projection design and certainly the Daryl Waters music supervision, orchestrations and arrangements and Andrew Resnick’s music direction.</p>\n<p>Jason Moore’s direction is spot on from start to finish, as are the actors energized under him. Prominent among them are Emily Skinner as Cher’s mom Georgia Holt, Matthew Hydzik as talented, bedeviled Gregg Allman and Michael Campayno as bagel guy Rob Camelletti, with whom Cher had a hot but paparazzi-infested fling.</p>\n<p>As might be expected in a jukebox review of this sort, there’s plenty of choreography. Christopher Gattelli is responsible for it. He looks to have gone after a music-video look, which he and his hard-working dancers easily accomplish. The result may not be consistently fresh and inventive, but there it is again and again.</p>\n<p>These days, Cher—who never shies away from expressing what’s on her mind with humor and intelligence—tweets regularly. Maybe the thing to do with <em>The Cher Show</em> is to regard it as a theater-sized tweet and a fan’s treat.</p>\n<p><strong>The Cher Show opened December 3, 2018, at the Neil Simon Theatre and runs to March 17, 2019.

Specifically, Trent and the three buddies who have traveled with him to fictional Edgewater, Indiana are middle-aged actors seeking to revive their sagging careers by protesting on behalf of a teenage lesbian.</p>\n<p>The satirical possibilities are numerous, but since this is a musical comedy directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw—also currently represented on Broadway by established hits <em>The Book of Mormon</em>, <em>Aladdin</em> and <em>Mean Girls</em>—we trust that they will be handled with minimal cynicism and an emphasis on exuberant showmanship. And they are.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it&#8217;s hard to imagine a show fueled by more extravagant good will than <em>Prom</em>, which Nicholaw put together with old friends and collaborators Chad Beguelin, Bob Martin and Matthew Sklar, with Martin and Beguelin co-writing the book and the latter crafting lyrics for Sklar’s music. They devised the show in part as a vehicle for a group of veteran performers whose  talents are well-known among theater fans, including Brooks Ashmanskas, Beth Leavel and Christopher Sieber.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/11/15/the-prom-plenty-of-showbiz-gagging-over-some-serious-issues/\"><em>Read Michael Sommers’ </em>★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Sieber is cast as the pompous but (like the other thespian characters) well-meaning Trent, a Juilliard graduate working as a cater-waiter when we first meet him. Leavel and Ashmankas respectively play two-time Tony Award-winning diva Dee Dee Allen and Drama Desk Award winner Barry Glickman, the stars of <em>Eleanor! The Eleanor Roosevelt Musical</em>, which as <em>Prom</em> kicks off is celebrating its opening night—also its closing, thanks to poor advance sales and a terminally scathing review.</p>\n<p>The problem, Dee Dee and Barry are told by their press rep, is that &#8220;nobody likes a narcissist.&#8221; So with Trent and another pal named Angie—an experienced chorine wittily played by Angie Schworer, an experienced chorine—they hatch a plan to reverse their fortunes and win the media over the way celebrities do nowadays, by adopting a cause.</p>\n<p>A quick Twitter search by Angie leads the quartet to Edgewater, where a high-school prom has been canceled by the PTA because a female student wanted to take her girlfriend. The student, a quiet, thoughtful 17-year-old named Emma—played with winning, moving understatement by Caitlin Kinnunen—is as wary of publicity as the actors are desperate for it; predictably, though, a bond is formed, and a small town flamboyantly disrupted as the invaders determine to change hearts and minds, and get lots of attention in the process.</p>\n<p>Beguelin and Martin have a swell time and deliver their best, funniest lines sending up the egotism and cluelessness of the visiting troupers, and their assumptions about middle America. In &#8220;It’s Not About Me,&#8221; one of a couple of showcases for Leavel&#8217;s still-mighty belt and sly comedic chops, Dee Dee sings to Emma that while she&#8217;s &#8220;far too busy to Google&#8221; what the acronym L.G.B.T.Q. stands for, &#8220;I’m no stranger to slander&#8230;The Post once said I was/Too old to play Eva Peron/Eva Peron!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ashmanskas, a duly treasured character actor who also gets to own or co-own the spotlight in a few numbers, revels in the openly gay Barry’s naughty antics; after the actors crash a PTA meeting, he yells at an appalled parent, &#8220;I&#8217;m Jewish, too!&#8221; (Barry also reveals a more tender side, growing particularly close to Emma—who has forged a different, more complicated connection with another principal character, younger and female, sweetly played by Isabelle McCalla.)</p>\n<p>Smartly, <em>Prom</em>&#8216;s writers are gentler with the local townsfolk, who are represented not only by an uptight, homophobic  PTA mom, given a suitably brittle edge by Courtenay Collins, but by the open-minded, big-hearted school principal, who happens to be black, played with convincing warmth by Michael Potts.</p>\n<p>We learn that Edgewater is under economic duress, a noteworthy factor that is nonetheless mentioned rather abruptly, then dropped. Mixing social commentary into a musical this giddy and frothy in texture isn&#8217;t an easy job, and while <em>Prom</em> doesn’t exactly proselytize, there are moments when its observations feel awkward or simplistic. A song titled &#8220;Love Thy Neighbor&#8221; begins with Trent, whom Siebert makes lovable and charismatic despite himself, lecturing the town youth on various acts considered sinful, in an effort to change their attitudes towards homosexuality.</p>\n<p>Happily, &#8220;Neighbor&#8221; evolves into the kind of high-spirited, effervescent production number that is Nicholaw’s strong suit, numbers which are in generous supply throughout <em>Prom</em>. The abundance of young ensemble characters in the musical provides a platform for some  of his most thrillingly energetic and athletic choreography, and Sklar delivers a few bouncy tunes to further propel Nicholaw and his inexhaustible dancers.</p>\n<p>Scott Pask&#8217;s fanciful, functional set design—which makes Edgewater just as scrumptious-looking as New York, only less fussy—and Anne Roth and Matthew Pachtman&#8217;s contemporary, colorful costuming reinforce our sense of being in a world not unlike our own, but a little brighter and easier to laugh at, or with. <em>The</em> <em>Prom</em> may not change your life, but the possibility of progress it celebrates, and the buoyant respite it offers from naysaying and gloom, are not unsubstantial things these days.</p>\n<p><strong><b>The Prom opened November 15, 2018, at the Longacre Theatre, and runs through August 11, 2019.

Photo: Deen van Meer</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Being flip about the significant defect that undermines <em>The Prom</em> would hardly be fair to the show’s proficient company of veteran and youthful performers, its big-league creative team, its vast roster of producers, and most of all, to our readers.</p>\n<p>So, for starters, let’s respectfully view this newest Broadway production, which bowed Thursday at the Longacre Theatre, as a good idea for a musical gone terribly wrong.</p>\n<p>It’s reported that theater executive Jack Viertel read about a flyover country incident of 2010, when a high school prom was cancelled after a student wanted to bring her girlfriend to it and even wear a tuxedo. Later, a group of parents threw a prom on their own and did not invite the couple.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/11/15/the-prom-bringing-red-and-blue-together-with-song-and-dance/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Viertel’s notion to expand this scenario into a musical was spinning the story around several washed-up Broadway stars who inject themselves into just such a brouhaha to amplify their celebrity.</p>\n<p>Thus <em>The Prom</em>, with music by composer Matthew Sklar (<em>Elf</em> and <em>The Wedding Singer</em>), a book co-written by Bob Martin (<em>The Drowsy Chaperone</em>) and Chad Beguelin (<em>Aladdin</em>), and its production staged and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw, whose credits among other hits include <em>Mean Girls</em> and <em>The Book of Mormon</em>.</p>\n<p>Their musicalization of Viertel’s concept begins with the opening night party of a flop Broadway musical headlined by Dee Dee (Beth Leavel) and Barry (Brooks Ashmanskas). In the wake of their show’s demise, these frayed co-stars and two other has-been troupers, Trent (Christopher Sieber) and Angie (Angie Schworer), resolve to resurrect their careers by becoming celebrity activists.</p>\n<p>They latch on to noisily righting “a safe, non-violent, high-profile, low risk injustice” by trundling off to a small town in Indiana to vociferously, if cluelessly, trumpet their support for Emma (Caitlin Kinnunen) an earnest honor student and lesbian who wants to—well, see the story noted several paragraphs above. That’s the first act for <em>The Prom</em>.</p>\n<p>The second act sees these narcissistic Broadway bumblers try to fix what they wrecked for Emma. During this process, the four showbiz characters each deliver a big, fat number keyed to the talents of their respective interpreters: Angie’s “Zazz” is a song-n-dance lesson in Bob Fosse attitude. Dee Dee’s “The Lady’s Improving” is a belted aspirational solo. Trent leads the local kids through “Love Thy Neighbor,” a hallelujah-type rouser with tambourines. “Barry Is Going to Prom” is a giddy romp by the aforesaid gay gent celebrating his delayed teen rite of passage.</p>\n<p>Of course, the self-involved show-offs eventually will learn the error of their thinking and a happy ending awaits long-suffering Emma, who meanwhile is blessed with a pair of sincerely pretty songs in “Dance With You” and “Unruly Heart.”</p>\n<p>So what’s so wrong about all that? The fatal flaw with <em>The Prom</em> regards its tone.</p>\n<p><em>The Prom</em> has been facetiously crafted as a cartoon type of ha-ha musical in the manner of <em>Something Rotten!</em> and <em>Gettin’ the Band Back Together</em>. That’s all very well until its silliness hits an iceberg in the serious issue of homophobia and LGBTQ discrimination. There is a jarring dislocation whenever these Sardi&#8217;s caricatures repeatedly collide with the relatively realistic likes of Emma, her closeted sweetheart (Isabelle McCalla), a nice high school principal (Michael Potts), and the rigid leader of the local PTA (Courtenay Collins).</p>\n<p>Everyone gamely and capably projects their characters, especially Leavel and Ashmanskas, who probably spit out nails after chewing so much scenery in their outsized roles as Dee Dee and Barry. Their fearlessly over-the-top performances, along with an assortment of showbiz gags in the amusing script and Beguelin’s lyrics, propelled by Sklar’s mostly upbeat tunes and plenty of fast-moving flurries of athletic dancing choreographed by Nicholaw, represent Broadway musical comedy in full-flowered frivolity.</p>\n<p>But such a bright approach in style does not befit the darker story about the ruthless exploitation of a woeful situation.</p>\n<p>Oh, well, we are all living through rather crude times. Possibly spectators will overlook this crass aesthetic disconnect and just go with the snappy flow of Nicholaw’s slick production. If some clothes appear ill-favored, there is nothing wrong with Scott Pask’s nimble settings, Natasha Katz’s dynamic lighting and Brian Ronan’s crisp sound design.</p>\n<p>Still, watching it unfold so blithely troubles me. <em>The Prom</em> undeniably is entertaining, but as a lyric in a <em>Forbidden Broadway</em> might describe this frisky though significantly misguided musical: <em>The Prom</em> is a bomb with aplomb.</p>\n<p><strong><b>The Prom opened November 15, 2018, at the Longacre Theatre, and runs through August 11, 2019. Tickets and information: <a href=\"https://theprommusical.com/#music\">theprommusical.com</a></b></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Mike Birbiglia, an altogether average looking fellow with a brightly sunny face, comes out and talks. And talks and talks and talks, about marriage, cats, couches and—most prominently—the effect on a man of offspring. Or the lack thereof, for as long as he can dodge the issue.</p>\n<p>The fellow just keeps talking, yes; but he grabs us at the beginning and holds our attention and good cheer throughout. Nonstop laughter of the finest kind, which is to say that rather than encountering diminishing returns, the laughs get bigger and warmer. He winds up after 85 minutes, leaving this viewer thoroughly and fully enchanted but wanting more. Much more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/11/11/the-new-one-public-radio-onstage-exactly-as-exciting-as-it-sounds/\">[<em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s★</em>★ <em>review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>Birbiglia has become prominent as a comedian over the last decade, bringing along a strong fan base. (<em>The New One</em> premiered in New York at the Cherry Lane in July, with the entire run sold out within hours of going on sale.) He is best known for his earlier autobiographical stand-up play, <em>Sleepwalk with Me</em>, which opened off-Broadway in 2008 under the sponsorship of Nathan Lane, of all people. And which was adapted into a non-fiction best-seller in 2010 and became a successful film in 2012.</p>\n<p>That said, the fellow is entirely new to this viewer. He walked on stage and from his first line (“I want to tell you a story but first I wanna tell you about my couch”), delivered in a warm-and-friendly-but-awkward manner, I was a convert. As soon as I finish this fortnight’s playgoing crush, I shall eagerly seek out <em>Sleepwalk with Me</em>.</p>\n<p>In <em>The New One</em>, we find a 40-year-old stand-up comedian who spends most of the year touring. Back home is his wife, a poet named Jen whom he sheepishly admits that he calls “Clo”—which, the way he does it, garners even more laughs. Jen and brother Joe (who is billed as associate producer) try to convince Mike that fatherhood will altogether change his life. Mike wholeheartedly agrees with this, thus vociferously resisting the notion.</p>\n<p>But we know what happens, or else there wouldn’t be a play. Would there? Birbiglia, in the tradition of look-at-me-and-only-me actors, loses the argument—if you will—but wins the war. Oona Birbiglia (b. 2015) slowly but completely wins her father over. And now, as he ends the evening, “I’m seeing the world through baby’s eyes.”</p>\n<p>Seth Barrish serves as director, although Birbiglia seems to be directing himself (which, admittedly, is precisely how it should appear). Jennifer Hope Stein, mother of Oona, receives credit for “additional writing.” She can also take credit for making a loving father out of her stubbornly unwilling spouse. (If he thinks fatherhood was a treacherous step, wait until he starts battling through the elementary school application game.)</p>\n<p>The set—a “bare-stage” rendition of the Cort, complete with inner false proscenium pillars which carefully replicate the existing proscenium—is from Beowulf Boritt. The always resourceful designer also sees fit to present us with a bravura coup de théatre which exec. producer Ira Glass (of radio’s <em>This American Life</em>) has personally requested that the critics refrain from discussing. And ruin a spectacular moment for future audiences? Definitely not.</p>\n<p>This week on Broadway, each and every reference to “the new one” no doubt referred to a gargantuan animatronic ape. Now we can wipe that out with Birbiglia’s <em>The New One</em>. Not as big and spectacular as <em>King Kong</em>, needless to say, but gargantuanuously more entertaining.</p>\n<p><strong>The New One opened November 11, 2018, at the Cort Theatre and runs through January 20, 2019. Tickets and information: <a href=\"https://thenewone.com/\">thenewone.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Comedian, storyteller, director, and actor Mike Birbiglia,” says a blurb from the comedian, storyteller, director, and actor on his show’s Playbill.com listing, “tries not to tell people anything about his new show because the less you know about the show the more you will enjoy it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is my unfortunate duty to burst his bubble and tell you a bit about his new show, which opened tonight at the Cort Theatre. It’s an evening of storytelling about his life, his marriage, and the birth of his first child, a daughter named an Oona. The performance is frequently funny, it contains a few astute observations, and Birbiglia proves himself pleasant company for the time you’ll spend with him. (It’s listed as 80 minutes, but it’s much more than that.) What </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New One</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is not, however, is a play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like, not at all.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/11/11/the-new-one-and-papa-makes-three-with-nonstop-laughter/\">[<em>Read Steven Suskin&#8217;s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a limitation which need not necessarily be an obstacle to the success of something playing in a Broadway theater. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Springsteen</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em> on Broadway</em> is not a play, really. Stand-ups do Broadway gigs. So do divas, putting on a concert. But all of those, or at least the successful ones, have a reason to be presented in a space typically thought of as a playhouse. In one way or another, they belong onstage. And it’s not at all clear that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New One</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meets that standard. It’s entertaining, to a certain point, but it’s not dramatic. And, other than one, brief moment—one that its producers have asked reviewing press not to reveal—it’s not in any way theatrical. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s an evening of a storyteller storytelling while schepping a stool around a stage like Elaine Stritch—if Elaine Stritch had never sang or dance or drank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, if Elaine Stritch wasn’t a pain in the ass. Birbiglia seems like a genuinely nice guy. His manner is flat, a little reserved, wry. He comes across as midwestern, although he’s from Massachusetts. A successful comic, he’s comfortable on stage and with his material. He can control his crowd, riffing comfortably with latecomers, texters, someone in the balcony recording video on her phone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this all serves to make him, well, boring. He does mildly surreal observational comedy — and does it well—while telling a larger story that is entirely banal: He liked his life without kids; his wife wanted to have a kid; they needed some medical help to make it happen; now he has a kid, and he kinda likes it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Birbiglia is a regular contributor to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This American Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and Ira Glass is listed as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New One</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s executive producer. And what this performance is is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The American Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> piece: An intelligent observer recounting a common life experience but adding wry commentary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This piece would be a pleasant few minutes on the radio. Apparently it was well-received off-Broadway at the Cherry Lane over the summer. Designer Beowulf Boritt has created an elegantly simple set (and provides the single theatrical moment that I’m not supposed to talk about). The director Seth Barrish, a frequent Birbiglia collaborator, does nothing (beyond that stool, and that mum’s-the-word moment) to interfere with the writer and star doing his thing. (Would that he had.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes the radio belongs on the radio.</span></p>\n<p><b>The New One </b><strong>opened November 11, 2018, at the Cort Theatre and runs through January 20, 2019. </strong><strong>Tickets and information: <a href=\"https://thenewone.com/\">thenewone.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>King Kong—the animated star of the new Broadway extravaganza, and when I say animated I don’t mean “full of life”—is awesome. The sheer size and range of movement of this 20-foot-tall puppet (although puppet doesn’t quite describe it) might well leave you agape, at least for 15 of the 130 minutes you’ll spend at the Broadway Theatre. The rest of the affair could have you pining for <em>Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark</em>, where they at least kept the evening suspenseful by offering the constant threat of calamity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/11/08/king-kong-the-beast-is-us-with-special-effects/\">[<em>Read Elysa Gardner&#8217;s </em>★★<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>Let us agree that, yes, this gigantuous puppet is impressively designed and altogether versatile, as operated by ten (?) visible on-stage bodies wearing what look like black monk’s cassocks with hoods. (There are also who-knows-how-many offstage flymen, computer operators, et al.) He—or, rather, it—is nimble, at least for a one-ton piece of machinery; and the technicians have given Kong a rather expressive and melancholy mien. But this is a Broadway musical, and the stuffed gorilla—which, once it finally appears late in the first act, has far more stage time than most of the Equity members on hand—does not sing or talk. Or dance, even.</p>\n<p>Kong spends much of his time being sung <em>at</em>, by the damsel Ann Darrow (Christiani Pitts). The story—devised by director Merian C. Cooper for his 1933 movie, although it has been recycled again and again—at root is the “Beauty and the Beast” tale, except in this case the beast is not a bewitched human yearning to return to princely form, but merely, and literally, a hairy ape. When Ann sings, Kong doesn’t gaze in her eyes and emote, no; but at least the creature seems to pay attention, which is not by that point in the evening the case with some viewers out front. And the animatronic ape seems not much bothered by the quality of the music and lyrics.</p>\n<p>As for the rest of the characters, the salient point is: There aren’t many. The plot tells of ambitious filmmaker Carl Denham (Eric William Morris) and his young discovery Ann, whom he takes to far-off Skull Island on a desperate mission to make a stupendous adventure movie in the wilds. This director journeys across the world, through dangerous waters, with a big film crew and <em>only one actor</em>. Who is the leading lady supposed to act with?</p>\n<p>The underpopulated dramatis personae turns out to be Kong’s Achilles paw. The creators have seen fit to whittle down the original film’s cast of presumably hundreds to <em>three</em> principals. That’s right, three not including the puppet; everyone else, even the threatening ship captain, is drafted out of the chorus. Denham, in this telling, is something of an evil genius; he can and does sing about his ambition, many times, but that’s about all he has to offer (which leaves us with an undistinguished performance). That puts undue pressure on Ann, who stands around singing most of the evening, much of the time to the ape. She does have some scenes with a comedic character called Lumpy—that’s subtle, isn’t it?—who in the person of Erik Lochtefeld provides limited but welcome comic relief and good cheer.</p>\n<p>Pitts sings well, or at least well enough; but she is more or less stranded in the spotlight for way too much of the running time. That&#8217;s not the fault of the performer, but still. The original film made a star-for-life out of Fay Wray, who proved an iconic beauty to the beast. Don’t expect the musical to make a star out of Pitts (recently seen in <em>A Bronx Tale</em>), although her conscientious efforts here will likely lead to future opportunities.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, we just have the chorus. Let it be said that the men do an awful lot of dancing; director-choreographer Drew McOnie has them leaping and spinning like the cast of <em>Newsies</em> after they’ve watched Fosse’s <em>All That Jazz</em> a few times too many. <em>King Kong</em>—at least in the Broadway sequences at the beginning of act one and throughout act two—is also oddly reminiscent <em>42nd Street</em> in the dark, only with grit and muscles. The ensemble is heavily slanted towards grunting men who do, indeed, go through their paces with abandon. There is a noticeably slender female contingent, with one dancer standing out among the entire cast, perhaps because costume designer Roger Kirk wraps her in a mustard colored gown. She also does well in a brief stint as a comedic showgirl, at least if that’s the same unidentified dancer.</p>\n<p>We apologize if we’ve slighted the contributions of songwriters Marius de Vries and Eddie Perfect, and bookwriter Jack Thorne (who did an infinitely keener job was his stage adaptation of the Harry Potter novels). But then, their collective contributions slight the show to the vanishing point. One might think that the producers of a troubled musical which goes through something like three directors, four songwriters, and three librettists would have kept working until they got it right.</p>\n<p>Following the lackluster Australian debut of the show in 2013 (directed by Daniel Kramer, with book and lyrics by Broadway veteran Craig Lucas), the producers saw the benefit of overhauling everything but the monkey at the hands of Tony-winner Jason Robert Brown (music and lyrics) and Tony/Pulitzer-winner Marsha Norman (book). Smart move, until they terminated them. Unsmart move. What do we end up with? A show without coherent words <em>or</em> music. I don’t imagine we’ll ever hear Brown’s songs for <em>King Kong</em>, but I’d have to guess that they are a tad more interesting than what’s at the Broadway.</p>\n<p>The Fosse-obsessed choreographer-director of record is Drew McOnie, whose most prominent credit seems to be the poorly received London stage version of <em>Strictly Ballroom</em>. This opened in April and has already danced its last dance. Perhaps not incidentally, the lead producers of <em>Strictly Ballroom</em> are top-billed producers of <em>King Kong</em>. The sets are many but not exactly specific—the final scene takes place on the oddest-looking replica of the Empire State Building you’ve never seen—and the costumes are many. The finest contributions of the evening come from lighting designer Peter Mumford, &#8220;creature designer&#8221; Sonny Tilders, and Gavin Robins, who is credited as “Kong/Aerial Movement Director.”</p>\n<p>The animated theatrics on view will likely attract a significant stream of curious theatergoers, as was the case with the aforementioned <em>Spider-Man</em>. But one doubts that the 36 producers with names above the <em>King Kong</em> title aspire to equal the success of <em>Spider-Man</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>King Kong opened November 8, 2018, at the Broadway Theatre. Tickets and information: <a href=\"http://kingkongbroadway.com/\">kingkongbroadway.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Matthew Murphy.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s been several days and nights since I caught a preview performance of Broadway’s new musical adaptation of <em>King Kong</em>, and I still can&#8217;t get that dang gorilla’s face out of my head.</p>\n<p>This ape-like being isn&#8217;t a live animal, mind you, but a 2,000-pound puppet conceived by acclaimed &#8220;creature designer&#8221; Sonny Tilders and manipulated by more than a dozen puppeteers. Some are dimly visible onstage, but you’ll barely notice, riveted as you will be by his mighty, wrinkled &#8220;wonder,&#8221; as the show&#8217;s heroine and its villain both call the title character, who falls prey to the insensitivity and greed of supposedly higher primates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/11/08/king-kong-broadway-agape-over-ape/\">[<em>Read Steven Suskin&#8217;s </em>★★<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>Years ago, I was reduced to heaving sobs by the Broadway production of <em>War Horse</em>, another show that incorporated puppetry to evoke the suffering of a non-human animal—though there the craftsmanship, while masterful, left more to the imagination (and more to the dialogue). My experience with <em>King Kong</em> was less cathartic, and more sour. After witnessing Kong&#8217;s elaborately executed capture in the first act, I spent much of the second dreading those scenes where I would have to meet his gaze, knowing what still lay ahead and that it would be just as graphically wrought, if not more so.</p>\n<p>To be fair, none of the folks I spotted sitting around me in the orchestra section showed signs of sharing my distress. There was a fair amount of laughter, first as Kong confronted and bonded with aspiring actress Ann Darrow, then later and more surprisingly as he fought off tormentors armed with gas and guns, in scenes made both spectacular and painfully accessible by Peter England&#8217;s set and projection design, Peter Mumford&#8217;s evocative lighting, and Peter Hylenski&#8217;s muscular sound. There was also applause, presumably for Kong, though the Peters and their various collaborators (among them Artists in Motion, credited with &#8220;video and projection imaging content&#8221;) deserved their share as well.</p>\n<p>Born in Australia and arriving on Broadway after considerable retooling, this <em>King Kong</em> follows the basic plot of the 1933 film (and the novella that preceded it a year earlier): An American film crew led by the ambitious director Carl Denham, with Ann in tow, discovers Kong after sailing to his home, Skull Island, and drags him back to New York to showcase to live audiences. The enterprise—spoiler alert, for the five people on the planet who may not be familiar with the story—ends atop the Empire State Building, badly.</p>\n<p>But the musical departs from the original movie, and subsequent remakes, in eliminating another central male character created as a love interest for Ann, who is presented here not as a stereotypical damsel but, in a feisty and endearing performance from African-American actress Christiani Pitts, as a woman determined to fend for herself. Librettist Jack Thorne and songwriter Eddie Perfect establish this from the get-go by having Ann endure, in the opening number, a series of unsuccessful and humiliating auditions and emerge tough enough to talk back, in the scene where she meets Carl, to a bartender who tries to oust her.</p>\n<p>Perfect&#8217;s songs, like the brooding accompanying music by <em>La La Land</em> and <em>Moulin Rouge! </em>alum Marius de Vries, are mostly forgettable; at best they function as vehicles for the whirlwind production numbers offered by director-choreographer Drew McOnie. A hot property across the Atlantic for his work on <em>Strictly Ballroom: The Musical</em> and several well-received revivals, McOnie keeps his company in constant, breathless motion, matching the business and prowess of the design as we are transported from a buzzing metropolis to a ship at sail on a glorious sea to the lush, exotic island, and back.</p>\n<p>The exceptions are Ann’s scenes with the male characters: Kong, Carl, and Lumpy, an employee of the filmmaker who as presented here—awkward, luckless, and saintly in his kindness—seems to exist chiefly to underline the callous, sexist, greedy Carl’s sheer awfulness. (Eric William Morris is as gamely slimy in the last role as Eric Lochtefeld is touching as Lumpy.) Like a number of splashy, expensive shows (and films) that have lamented our obsession with money and power, <em>King Kong</em> employs excess to rail against it; it&#8217;s this heavy-handedness that likely left me feeling manipulated by the unsparing depictions of cruelty, and of Kong’s despair—and by the feminist implications in Ann&#8217;s makeover, for that matter.</p>\n<p>Thorne&#8217;s record of intelligent, nuanced, morally complex work, which includes <em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em>, suggests that his contributions may have been, like Kong, diminished by the forces of commerce. But that&#8217;s just speculation, and frankly, few will attend this musical expecting the characters, human or otherwise, to be drawn with great sophistication. If technical wizardry is what you’re after—and you can withstand watching a magnificent beast endure repeated, extravagant physical and emotional abuse—<em>King Kong</em> may be just the ticket.</p>\n<p><b>King Kong </b><strong>opened November 8, 2018, at the Broadway Theatre. </strong><strong>Tickets and information: <a href=\"http://kingkongbroadway.com/\">kingkongbroadway.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Peter Cunningham</figcaption></figure>\n<p>With its ripped-from-the-headlines plot, deliberate arguments, and crystal-clear-from-the-start ending, <em>American Son</em> would have made an excellent episode of <em>Law &amp; Order</em>. (The original version, of course.) It’s eminently watchable, the cops get in a few wisecracks, and and you know when a rerun pops up 20 or 30 years from now that it’ll still be relevant. Unfortunately.</p>\n<p>Is it pessimistic to say that Christopher Demos-Brown’s play—which centers on a mixed-race couple, Kendra (<em>Scandal</em> star Kerry Washington, making a welcome return to Broadway) and Scott (Steven Pasquale), whose teenage son is missing—will probably always be timely? The entire show is set in a sterile police station in Miami (the playwright’s home), where Kendra is pacing and presumably thinking—as the audience is—the absolute worst has happened. First, she must contend with the rookie Officer Larkin (Jeremy Jordan), who seems <em>very</em> surprised that her 18-year-old son has no prior arrests, asks about the kid’s street name (“June Bug,” Kendra jokes, recalling a childhood nickname. “It’s what I call him now when I want to knock the cool out of him in front of his friends.”), and wonders if he has any “distinguishing” physical marks like “scars, tattoos, gold teeth.” Then he directs her to the side-by-side water fountains—can you guess why this old Southern building has two water fountains?—but not before assuring her that “we’re gonna find out where Jerome is.” Her son’s name is Jamal.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/11/04/american-son-modern-injustice-wrought-as-melodrama/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Things get both better and worse when Scott arrives: better because he’s white and wearing a badge—he’s an FBI agent—so the underling cop immediately begins kowtowing to him; worse because Scott and Kendra have been separated for the last few months. (Before they even really address their son’s situation, they get into a totally frivolous but nonetheless hilarious spat about grammar. Kendra: “ ‘Alls I’m sayin’.’ ‘A whole nother.’ Just purge that shit.” Scott: “A whole nother”? Kendra: “Yeah. ‘The current situation is probably a whole nother thing.’ ” Scott: “Sweet Sweating Jesus.”) It turns out that Scott has assumptions just like Officer Larkin does—especially when he learns that his private school–educated, West Point–bound son was one of “three black males” pulled over for some unspecified reason. “I think our half-White, half-Black, who-gives-a-shit-what-race-he-is son— the one who got a 1470 on his SAT and aced AP Physics—knows better’n to commit unforced errors in life by taking stupid risks,” Scott argues. Demon-Brown makes it easy to see both sides. Jamal should be able to “associate with other Black kids without stamping a presumption of guilt all over himself,” Kendra maintains. The playwright, incidentally, who’s making his Broadway debut with <em>American Son</em>, is also a practicing lawyer, and it shows. Presumption of innocence may be the basis of the American criminal justice system, but this mother is smart enough to know that “presumption of guilt” might as well be stamped on her son’s forehead.</p>\n<p>Of course, at this point, no one knows where Jamal is, what he’s supposedly done, or who these other boys are—only that the car, a Lexus that Kendra and Scott gave to Jamal for his 18th birthday, was involved in an “incident.” (You can guess, and chances are you’ll be correct.) Everything has to go through some mysterious “AM liaison officer,” Lieutenant Stokes (Eugene Lee). A bumper sticker was seen on Jamal’s Instagram: “Shoot Cops with your phone whenever they make a bust.” (The words “shoot cops” are in “<em>huge</em> letters,” says Larkin. “The rest in little bitty font so’s all anyone wasn’t two feet away from the bumper could see was a Lexus that said ‘Shoot Cops.’”) There’s also a grainy cellphone video with gunshot sounds.</p>\n<p>Once Lieutenant Stokes swoops in—calling Kendra “sistah” in a condescending attempt to bond with, or perhaps placate, her (this psychology professor and her self-described “Ph.D.-havin’ ass” are, thankfully, too smart for that)—he wastes no time making a few presumptions of his own: “One thing I know for sure about this incident already. Just like almost every other one of ’em: If the young brothers woulda just shut their mouths and done what they were told, none of us would be here tonight.” Stokes gets off his high horse and exits soon after that, leaving Kendra (and us) to simmer in her anger.</p>\n<p>Tony winner Kenny Leon (<em>A Raisin in the Sun</em>) directs with the smooth efficiency befitting this procedural-style work, and the cast—Washington and Pasquale are especially fine as parents whose emotions ricochet from angry to anguished to afraid and back again—wrings just about all the drama they can out of the newsprint-thin script. Hopefully they’ll both be available for the inevitable small-screen adaptation (Netflix, perhaps?). And expect regional theaters and college campuses to jump at <em>American Son</em> too. Timeliness is everything.</p>\n<p><strong><em>American Son</em> opened Nov. 4, 2018, and runs through January 27, 2019 at the Booth Theatre.

Photo: Peter Cunningham.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It feels almost irresponsible to pan a play as well-intentioned and laser-focused on timely and vital subject matter as <em>American Son</em>, the new melodrama starring <em>Scandal</em> star Kerry Washington and Steven Pasquale as parents of a biracial young man who goes missing one night, landing them at a Miami police station in the wee hours of the morning.</p>\n<p>The setup, for those unfamiliar with Christopher Demos-Brown&#8217;s play—which earned attention, and praise, in two previous productions—should give you a sense of the pressing issues at hand, racial identity and conflict and police brutality and accountability prominent among them. Demos-Brown, a trial lawyer whose playbill bio tells us he has written more than a dozen full-length plays and screenplays (and won awards doing so), clearly knows something about the frustrating procedural barriers facing a mother and father like Washington&#8217;s Kendra and Pasquale&#8217;s Scott as they await information linking their son to an incident, and how race can further complicate that process.</p>\n<p>This can even be true, Demos-Brown takes pains to show us, when the parents of the dark-skinned youth possibly in police custody are accomplished and well-connected: Kendra is a college professor with a Ph. D, and Scott, who is white, works for the FBI. As the couple, which has been separated for several months, is thrown back together under the worst of circumstances, their festering grievances are expressed; many have to do with race, with the fed—played by Pasquale with a stiff machismo that, while convincing, reinforces the banality of the dialogue—hurling some especially ugly innuendo and invective.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/11/04/american-son-ripped-from-the-headlines/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★ <em>review here</em></a>.]</p>\n<p>In his admirable but misguided determination to cram our country&#8217;s wretched record of racial injustice and polarization into an 85-minute play, Demos-Brown seems more focused on dropping in obvious historical and cultural references than he is in character development. Nods to Jim Crow, the O.J. trial and Black Lives Matter feel arbitrary or contrived, as does Kendra and Scott’s mention—during the inevitable where-did-our-love-go? interlude that makes <em>Son</em> feel even more like a basic-cable TV movie—of their shared affection for Thelonious Monk.</p>\n<p>The clichés extend to the playwright’s portrait of a junior officer, a dumb lackey (a role wasted on the talented Jeremy Jordan) who, trying to impress Kendra, mistakes Charles Dickens&#8217; words for Emily Dickinson&#8217;s. He also munches donuts, cluelessly offering the distraught Kendra one: &#8220;What can I say? We really do like &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kendra does have a poignantly written, disturbing monologue tracing the fears and nightmares that are unique to a black mother, particularly of a son, and Washington, under Kenny Leon&#8217;s sensitive direction, delivers it movingly. For the most part, though, the actress—who appeared once on Broadway before, nearly a decade ago, in a play titled, by chance, <em>Race</em> (by David Mamet)—makes Kendra a cauldron of indignation and irritation who erupts with increasing volume. There’s a good deal of yelling in the performance—not an unheard-of reaction for mothers of missing children, especially if they’re confronting people who may be withholding information. But it would have been nice to see a bit more nuance, more than tiny glimmers of the shock and terror and despair one would also expect, perhaps in greater measure.</p>\n<p><em>Son</em>’s most memorable scene pairs Washington with a more seasoned stage actor, Eugene Lee, who lends gravelly wit to the part of a brash police lieutenant who&#8217;s been around the block a few more times than Kendra or her husband. The old cop is something of a bully, but he&#8217;s also an African-American, and his insights into the limits of privilege and fairness for people with the wrong skin color—even those who have achieved as much as Kendra, or been born into circumstances as favorable as those that greeted her son, described repeatedly as a smart, sensitive soul—provide the sharpest and, at one point, funniest lines.</p>\n<p>The production&#8217;s most impressive feature, in the end, is Derek McLane’s scenic design, detailing a bleak, sterile waiting era, surrounded by windows through which we can see a steady downpour of rain, which stops intermittently but never for long. The set reflects Kendra’s and her son’s tragic conundrum—our nation’s, really—more credibly and cannily than <em>American Son</em>, for all its noble aspirations, does overall.</p>\n<p><strong><b>American Son opened November 4, 2018, at the Booth Theatre and runs through January 27, 2019.

Photo by Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Imagine it’s 1972, and Harvey Fierstein who’s been acting for some time at La Mama in the East Village, is about to appear in what is evidently the first play he’s written for La MaMa founder Ellen Stewart. It’s a one-act called <em>International Stud</em>. The lights go to black and when they come up, Fierstein is center stage bent over, facing front. Mildly bobbing up and down in that provocative position, he introduces himself as Arnold Beckoff and starts chatting amiably about his drag-queen life.</p>\n<p>Whoa, you think, this is new. Perhaps spectators familiar with what goes on in the back room at certain New York City gay bars will recognize this as a familiar sight, but they’ve got to be in a minority. All others will be getting a view of a certain culture they most likely haven’t previously enjoyed.</p>\n<p>The humorous nonchalance with which Fierstein recounts his story as he’s being penetrated by an unseen companion is highly appealing. You’re way impressed by it. If you’re a <em>Village Voice</em> reviewer—which I was then—you praise it in print and never forget it.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/11/01/torch-song-fiersteins-epic-shorter-but-fierce-and-funny-as-ever/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★ <em>review here</em></a><em>.</em>]</p>\n<p>Waiting for what the fearless Fierstein does next, you make sure to attend <em>Fugue in a Nursery </em>and <em>Widows and Children First </em>in 1979. They’re the second and third one-acts that, in 1982, were collected as Fierstein’s so-honest-you-could-laugh-and-cry-at-the-same-time <em>Torch Song Trilogy</em>, which won that year’s Tony for best play.</p>\n<p>And now the folks at Second Stage have very successfully moved the 2017 revival from their 43rd Street off-Broadway theater to the Helen Hayes, their 44th Street Broadway house, as <em>Torch Song</em>. Don’t ask why the property is no longer tagged a trilogy, since all three plays are included but with only a pause between the first two and an intermission before the third. Perhaps the answer is that these days producers don’t particularly like giving audiences two intermissions.</p>\n<p>That’s not the only change between now and then. <em>International Stud</em>—now identified in neon on David Zinn’s niftily changing set, as <em>The International Stud 1971</em>—is told from a dressing table before which this Arnold Beckoff (Michael Urie, working hard to enormous swishy avail) is prepping for a performance.</p>\n<p>Arnold does get to the <em>International Stud </em>locale later, though Urie doesn’t strike quite so radical a pose as Fierstein did back in the La MaMa day. Now Arnold is getting down to business there only after he’s been shown meeting and falling for Ed (Ward Horton), a bisexual man who can’t make his mind up between homo- and heterosexuality. It’s his indecision that gives Arnold the reason to live a torch song, if not literally to sing one.</p>\n<p>Ed is so uncertain that he marries Laurel (Roxanna Hope Radia), and the two of them have Arnold and new, very young boyfriend Alan (Michael Hsu Rosen) up for a weekend. This farrago makes up <em>Fugue in a Nursery 1974</em> and is presented in a large bed. During the segment the four agitated participants keep popping up from down under the sheets as changing twosomes. What’s examined is the tentative nature of the Ed-Laurel union as well as Arnold’s sincere feelings for Alan while he still harbors an unfaded attraction to Ed. Also, there’s Ed’s sudden interest in Alan.</p>\n<p>And then it’s <em>Widows and Children First 1980</em>, with Zinn revealing a live-in-looking apartment with four doors that can be slammed loudly. Arnold, now on the verge of adopting precocious almost-15-year-old David (Jack DiFalco), is hosting Ed, who’s separated from Laurel. Arnold is also expecting mom, Mrs. Beckoff (Mercedes Ruehl, smart and stinging in matron coiffeur from wig designer Charles G. LaPointe).</p>\n<p>Here, Fierstein offers a well-made play about a mother-son clash with others sometimes looking on and sometimes pulled smack-dab in. Whereas emotions have run large in the two previous pieces, they overflow here like lava down a Pompeii mountainside. The attitudes Arnold has been somewhat able to suppress between his mother and him and between Ed and him get a rigorous workout before the entanglements come to their satisfyingly inconclusive conclusions.</p>\n<p>Fierstein’s <em>Torch Song</em> has its flaws. The four-way, seated-upright-lying-down <em>Fugue in a Nursery</em> operates on a cute conceit, but its cleverness palls after an extended while. Ed’s uncertainty, pursued further in this one-act—and further still in <em>Widows and Children First</em>—does eventually reach the enough-already stage.</p>\n<p>There’s also a drawback with <em>Widows and Children First</em>, which Fierstein has written as a comedy-drama probing family relationships. Since he has a great gift for comic lines, he’s peppered them throughout. Perhaps my memory of the 2017 revival is fooling me, but I don’t recall the action—under Moisés Kaufman’s otherwise tender-tough direction&#8212;allowing Urie, Ruehl, Horton and diFalco to indulge themselves in so much over-the-top laugh-cajoling emoting. The histrionics may be effective, but they go some distance towards cheapening the tone</p>\n<p>(Incidentally, if truth were told, DiFalco has a hard time passing for a 14-going-on-15 adolescent, but let’s not tell the truth. He’s too much on a par with Urie’s appealing Arnold, Ruehl’s tough Mrs. Beckoff and Horton’s properly vacillating Ed. The excellent Radia and Rosen only populate the middle play and do their strong bit enhancing it.)</p>\n<p>At a time when a standing ovation is accorded just about anything in which the cast gets to the end of the play breathing, <em>Torch Song</em> absolutely earns this one. Sure, this is a script wherein a nervous gay man and his extended family flounder, flail and fight, but while he’s at it, Fierstein deals honestly and profoundly with universal themes. He communicates his understanding of recognizable human-condition aspects so easily and so sincerely that it’s the hardhearted audience member who won’t be endlessly grateful.</p>\n<p><strong>Torch Song opened November 1, 2018, at the Helen Hayes and runs through January 6, 2019.

Photo: Matthew Murphy.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Decades before &#8220;marriage equality&#8221; was a household concept, Harvey Fierstein dared to imagine a world in which an unapologetically flamboyant drag queen could yearn, at least, for the kind of settled domestic life that, it was then widely assumed, homosexuals neither merited nor really wanted.</p>\n<p>Even more miraculously, Fierstein managed, in 1982, to parlay that vision into a Broadway epic, <em>Torch Song Trilogy</em>, that proved just as popular with matinee crowds as it did with the more predictably receptive audiences who had flocked to see it, first in separate installments and then as a three-act play, off-off and off-Broadway. The semi-autobiographical work established Fierstein, who won Tony Awards for both his writing and his leading performance, as a playwright, actor and inimitable personality; the only questions were whether it could endure as times changed and, given Fierstein&#8217;s indelible persona, if other actors could successfully put their own stamp on Arnold Beckoff, the nice, wisecracking Jewish boy who just happens to love mascara and men.</p>\n<p>Both queries have, happily, already been answered in the affirmative, but that doesn&#8217;t make the new Broadway staging of <em>Harvey Fierstein&#8217;s Torch Song</em>, a cannily condensed version of <em>Trilogy</em> featuring just two acts, any less of a revelation. First presented off-Broadway last fall, the Second Stage production, directed with profound tenderness and rigorous wit by Moisés Kaufman, has as its leading man Michael Urie, one of the most comedically dexterous, effortlessly charming and frankly adorable stage performers to emerge in the past decade.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/11/01/torch-song-harvey-fiersteins-view-of-gay-life-not-always-gay/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★ <em>review here</em></a><em>.</em>]</p>\n<p>But Kaufman and Urie’s triumph is not simply in making Arnold funny and lovable, foibles and all. The first act of <em>Torch Song</em> certainly milks Urie&#8217;s strengths as a pure entertainer, segueing from Arnold’s delectably witty introductory monologue to the gay bar (based on the actual downtown establishment “The International Stud,” as the play&#8217;s first section is still named) where Arnold meets Ed, an apparently not-too-conflicted bisexual who, in Ward Horton’s deft performance, shows us how Arnold could find him endearing despite his cavalier airs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fugue in a Nursery,&#8221; also the title of <em>Trilogy&#8217;</em>s original second act, completes the first act here, playing out in David Zinn’s spare but fanciful set on an enormous bed, where Arnold and Ed are joined by Laurel, the woman Ed will marry (Roxanna Hope Radja, slowly and sharply revealing her character’s painful knowing) and Alan, the young man Arnold will come to love and lose, tragically and brutally, his dearness captured in a lovely, tender performance by Michael Hsu Rosen.</p>\n<p>But the real emotional meat of this <em>Torch Song</em> lies in the second act, introduced (as the third part of the initial trilogy was) as &#8220;Widows and Children First.&#8221; The opening music is Fanny Brice singing &#8220;Cooking Breakfast for the One I Love,&#8221; and Zinn’s scenic design has become fuller and distinctly domestic. It’s 1980, and Ed is still in Arnold’s life—cooking breakfast at this moment, as it turns out—but our protagonist’s focus is now David, a gay teenager he had planned to adopt with Alan but is now raising alone.</p>\n<p>Arnold, in bunny slippers, is anxiously awaiting the arrival of a fourth party, his mother—&#8221;the Sylvia Sydney of Brighton Beach,&#8221; as he refers to her, now widowed and living in Florida, where she can keep her son’s homosexuality at a safe distance for the most part. But as played by a fully fanged, movingly human and altogether magnificent Mercedes Ruehl, Mrs. Beckoff turns up loaded for bear, packing (along with her oranges and home-baked cookies) insensitive questions and hurtful comments that inevitably lead to a showdown, in which Urie makes shatteringly clear the depths of anger and sadness caused by his mother’s refusal, or inability, to truly engage or understand him.</p>\n<p>But <em>Torch Song</em> is still, ultimately, a comedy, and a hopeful one, in which the potential for progress—that is, in the simplest terms, love—is not left in doubt. Ed shows plain signs of growth towards the end, and David emerges, in Jack DiFalco&#8217;s wonderfully impish portrayal, as a ray of light pointing solidly towards Arnold’s future. More than 35 years after its premiere, and stripped down substantially, Fierstein’s breakthrough work remains an uplifting study of a highly imperfect world, and thus as relevant and timely as ever.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Torch Song opened November 1, 2018, at the Helen Hayes Theater and runs through January 6, 2019.

Photo: Brigitte Lacombe</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Was <em>The Waverly Gallery</em> always this hard to watch?</p>\n<p>I remember the original off-Broadway production, which starred Eileen Heckart in what would turn out to be her final role, at the Promenade Theatre (R.I.P.) in 2000. I have a faint memory of her moving performance as a Greenwich Village–dwelling octogenarian suffering from Alzheimer’s disease—but I don’t recall feeling so drained and despondent afterward.</p>\n<p>So what’s changed in the 18 years since <em>Waverly</em>’s New York premiere and its current Broadway revival, which stars the magnificent actress/writer/comic genius Elaine May? Well, I’m, ahem, 18 years older. As are my parents. As is my grandmother, who’s going on 91. Suddenly <em>The Waverly Gallery</em> is hitting a lot closer to home. Damn you, Kenneth Lonergan, for getting it so <em>right</em>.</p>\n<p><em>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/10/25/the-waverly-gallery-lonergans-memory-play-slim-but-heartbreaking/\">Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </a></em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/10/25/the-waverly-gallery-lonergans-memory-play-slim-but-heartbreaking/\">★★★★</a><em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/10/25/the-waverly-gallery-lonergans-memory-play-slim-but-heartbreaking/\"> review here.</a>]</em></p>\n<p>The reason Lonergan got it right is because, unfortunately, he lived it; the play is about his own grandmother. To tell the story, he’s given himself a <em>Glass Menagerie</em>–style stand-in, Daniel (played by his <em>Manchester by the Sea</em> star Lucas Hedges), who recounts Gladys’ decline through a detached, reporter-style lens: “I want to tell you what happened to my grandmother, Gladys Green, near the end of her life,” he begins matter-of-factly.</p>\n<p>We collectively sigh as Daniel explains to Gladys that he pens speeches for the EPA; we know he’s explained this to her once or twice or five times already. Yet still, Gladys cheerfully inquires: “Are you still…writing for the newspaper?” (Later, when she’s less lucid, she asks him if he’s still working “for the—the television”? And later: “For the magazine? And people call you and you bring them here and fix up what you want them to do for you?”)</p>\n<p>We collectively wince as her daughter, Ellen (Joan Allen), adjusts her hearing aid only to have Gladys futz with it immediately afterward. We collectively roll our eyes as Ellen’s husband, Howard (<em>The Band&#8217;s Visit</em> director/newly minted Tony winner David Cromer, a delight in one of his infrequent acting appearances), tries to put Gladys at ease with <em>very loud</em> attempts at humor: “IT’S NO FUN GETTING OLD!” Retorts Gladys: “Nobody wants to hear that!”</p>\n<p>We collectively shake our heads as Gladys lectures a New England artist, Don (Lonergan favorite Michael Cera, whose accent arrives somewhere in the vicinity of Boston), on the changing demographics of her beloved Greenwich Village: “This one’s sellin’ drugs, and that one’s tryin’ to—get your money—and that one’s boppin’ people on the head. They have all kinds of signals, they have red hats and blue hats, and you can’t tell one from the other, and there are a lot of people now from <em>South Korea</em>.” And don’t get her started on the bank around the corner! “I knew the manager for many years, and it was always a very friendly place,” she tells the family at dinner. “Now, the whole place is black.”</p>\n<p>We collectively hold our breath as Gladys starts to lose her words—not her mind, but her words. Of a bottle of wine: “Do you want some of this—bottle— some of this—Do you want some of this—liquor?” Of a piece of cheese: “Does anybody want some of this—stuff!” Because we know it’s only getting worse, much worse, from there.</p>\n<p>Director Lila Neugebauer (<em>Mary Page Marlowe</em>, <em>The Wolves</em>) moves things at a methodical, molasses-slow pace—which is entirely appropriate given the material. The events <em>should</em> feel painfully slow. While Hedges’ performance might seem too restrained, it matches Lonergan’s unsentimental tone perfectly. And May—returning to the very theater where in 1960 she starred in the groundbreaking <em>An Evening With Mike Nichols and Elaine May</em>—makes Gladys wonderfully lovable, frustrating, funny, and, to use one of her favorite words, kooky. She’s Every-grandma.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Waverly Gallery</em> opened Oct. 25, 2018, and runs through Jan. 27, 2019, at the Golden Theatre.

Photo by: Brigitte Lacombe</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her prime, Gladys Green was, to use a term my grandmother would have, quite a pistol. She still is, but not like she used to be. Gladys is at the center of Kenneth Lonergan’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Waverly Gallery</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and she’s an aging lady, still full of life, but well past the prime of it—and getting worse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We meet Gladys and her grandson, Daniel, in the first scene of this handsome and moving if not entirely fulfilling revival that opened tonight at the Golden Theatre, directed by Lila Neugebauer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re in Gladys’s small, dingy gallery in Greenwich Village, and Daniel is playing a dutiful visit. Gladys can’t hear so well, but, boy, can she talk. She doesn’t stop. She wants to know about Daniel’s life, about what he’s done to the family apartment he’s living in, about what’s going on around her, and she wants to reminisce about her life, the neighbor, Daniel’s family. His father’s mother, she tells him, “was a little kooky, you know?” He does, but she goes on. “She was charming as hell, but she never knew what to do with him.” There’s more. “I liked her, but she was a nut, she was meshugge. Do you know what that word means?” He does, he tells her, but she doesn’t hear, or doesn’t want to. “It means kooky, you know. A nut.” And so it goes, circularly, because she has both a big mouth and, these days, a short memory.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/10/25/the-waverly-gallery-real-talk-with-kenneth-lonergan/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That short memory is the problem. Gladys (the legendary Elaine May) is increasingly terrorizing her grandson, Daniel (played by Lucas Hedges, sweetly excellent, if a bit too blond for this family), who lives in the apartment next to her in the Village building she and her husband bought before World War II, and the rest of her family: Ellen (Joan Allen), Gladys’s put-upon daughter and Dan’s mom, and Ellen’s second husband, Howard (David Cromer). Daniel is Gladys’s main interlocutor, and he also periodically addresses the audience, to track her decline.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">May is, like Gladys, an aging icon, Mike Nichols’ partner in their pathbreaking comedy team. She brings a wonderful comedic yiddishkeit to the role, but she also brings a poignancy: She is fully in command of her scenes and her part, but she does not always seem to be entirely in command of her lines. It’s not clear whether she’s simply delivering a detailed performance of a woman losing her memories or whether she’s sometimes instead feeling her way through the script, but either way it reminds us of what makes this play so affecting, that we’re all—Gladys and Elaine and our parents and us—going to end up like this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To some degree, there’s not a lot that happens in this play dramatically. Gladys’s mind deteriorates through the course of it, and the landlord of her gallery—entirely separate from that deterioration, it seems—wants to evict her from the space, so he can open a cafe attached to the hotel he owns upstairs. The gallery does essentially no business; running it is an activity to keep Gladys, who was once a social butterfly, Greenwich Village activist, and, perhaps, if we are to believe some what she tells us, a practicing attorney, busy through her days, something to get her out of the house. The climax comes when Ellen and Howard must move a half-cognizant but very angry Gladys out of her apartment and into theirs, uptown. (Allen and Cromer are quite fine in these roles, by the way—especially Allen, portraying the frustrated rage that comes to a caregiver who repeatedly finds herself infuriated by a parent who she knows doesn’t know any better.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s one more character, an aspiring artist named Don, who wanders into Gladys’s gallery and becomes a family hanger-on. Don is from Massachusetts, stays with his sister in New Jersey, and arrives in the Village “with an expensive car and no money,” as Daniel puts it. As played by Michael Cera, he’s almost entirely vacant. (But, then, so many of Cera’s stage characters are.) The actor does the part no favors, but it’s unclear why the role is there. I suppose the point is that his New York trajectory—excited arrival, triumph of a gallery show, downslide of unattended opening, slow sales, car windows broken, departure back to Massachusetts—mirrors in capsule Gladys’s decline. But that’s all clear enough without him. Certainly he adds no drama: There are no revelations about Don or prompted by him, nor plot mechanics set in action.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, of course, Don, a foreigner, is not the point. What makes this play succeed is precisely its familiarity. When it debuted in New York nearly 20 years ago, it was in Ellen and Howard’s neighborhood, at the now-defunct Promenade Theatre on the Upper West Side. Its heart is very much in the two locations where it’s set: Greenwich Village and the Upper West Side. Lonergan is a New Yorker through and through, and he’s telling a New Yorker’s story—and, as must be noted in this woke era, a rather privileged New Yorker’s story. (There’s the Greenwich Village apartment building, the long-sold place on Fire Island that Gladys keeps confusing with Ellen and Howard’s one in Vermont, the empty gallery space that’s held onto as a sort of self-directed adult day care.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, we know these people, and the slow sadness of Gladys’s condition, the sad way so many die today when modern medicine—and, yes, some privilege—keeps them physically fine even as their minds disappear, is heartbreaking. I watched it happen to my grandmother. Sitting in the Golden, I thought about it happening one day to my parents. And eventually to me. That’s why I found myself sobbing in the second act. And that’s why this flawed play nevertheless packs a punch.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Waverly Gallery opened October 25, 2018, at the John Golden Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When people hear about my line of expertise, they often ask me to suggest a Broadway production that they might like. Before doing so, usually I inquire about what shows they have enjoyed in the past and whether they want to see an attraction that’s serious or otherwise.</p>\n<p>After all, some theatergoers might prefer to skip the complex, historical charismatics of <em>Hamilton</em> or the moody charms of <em>The Band’s Visit</em> to pleasurably party instead with the sex-see <em>Chicago</em> crowd.</p>\n<p>These days, however, the one musical that I unreservedly tell everyone to see, and take their family to it, too, is <em>Come From Away</em>.</p>\n<p>Its real-life story is stirring and honestly heartwarming, the tunes sound friendly to the ear, and the whirlwind staging is so smart that it’s scarcely noticeable.</p>\n<p>A visit to the Schoenfeld Theatre, where <em>Come From Away</em> has been packing in capacity audiences since early in 2017, finds the show to be in excellent shape with nearly all of its original 12-person cast still giving vivid life to what seems like hundreds of different characters.</p>\n<p>The actors expertly portray, among many, many others, a cross-section of the Canadian natives of Gander, a little town in rural Newfoundland that happens to have a large airport left over from the bygone times of pre-jet air travel. Back in September, 2001, that’s where 38 jets flying over from Europe unexpectedly descend when 9/11 erupts and all aircraft are ordered to land immediately.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the folks of Gander and nearby villages find themselves hosting more than 7,000 bewildered strangers who are scared, hungry, and otherwise distressed by their situation.</p>\n<p>These “plane people,” as the Gander folk call them, not only involve Americans of every color, creed, and race who are heading for home, but also include travelers from multiple nations around the globe—and their animals, too, as a volunteer from the local ASPCA discovers when she ventures into various cargo holds.</p>\n<p>How the good folk of Gander manage to accommodate and even entertain their multitudes of guests during the next week, as well as how these visitors who “come from away” deal with it all, fuses into an emotionally resonant saga adeptly created by Irene Sankoff and David Hein, who crafted the show’s book, music, and lyrics.</p>\n<p>The sorrowful aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. mainland smolder in the background as the writers concentrate on what happened among the newcomers and the natives of Newfoundland.</p>\n<p>Strangers fall in love, couples break up, unlikely friendships are forged, and cultural differences are bridged as everyday individuals reveal their better/nicer sides under challenging circumstances. This documentary-style musical—such a format is a musical theater anomaly—is rendered with compassion, humor, and insight during a fast-moving 100 minutes. The score’s rhythmic, folk-rock music, which possesses a windswept, Celtic flavor, briskly drives along these compelling doings.</p>\n<p>Christopher Ashley, who directs the production (and deservedly won a Tony Award for his artistry), and scenic designer Beowulf Boritt make strategic use of a turntable and some homely chairs and tables to present a flexible performance area that switches locations from a plane full of passengers to a coffee shop to the countryside in a second. The fluidity of such staging allows the show’s many story-lines to freely play out, just as the changeable everyday bits and pieces among designer Toni-Leslie James’ award-winning costumes cunningly enable the dozen actors to instantly switch through their many roles.</p>\n<p>These instant modulations in characterizations, with their varying accents and personal attitudes, are believably projected by the actors, whose tightly-meshed performances as an ensemble are so sterling that to single any one of them would not be fair.</p>\n<p>Still &#8230; let’s give in and at least mention the intense presence of Jenn Colella, whose steely depiction of an airplane captain from Texas (plus her show-stopping rendition of the character’s soaring “Me and the Sky” solo) proves especially striking. And let’s give a shout-out to the eight-member onstage band, whose lively country &amp; western-ish sounding instrumental music-making never cease to maintain the show’s upbeat energy level.</p>\n<p>Ashley’s brilliant (yet clandestine) staging of the production lends every moment of this show a spontaneous quality that aptly reflects the musical’s essential motive about people figuring things out as they go along.</p>\n<p>In our currently sad, nasty, troublous times of divisive politics and general distrust, it is really lovely to experience <em>Come From Away</em>, a humane, heartfelt reminder that people are capable of being kind and generous to each other in difficult circumstances. Yes, oh, yes, everybody should see this show.</p>\n<p><b>Come from Away </b><strong>opened March 12, 2017, at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre. Reviewed: October, 2018. </strong><strong>Tickets and information: <a href=\"http://www.comefromaway.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" shape=\"rect\">comefromaway.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It is audacious to anoint Jez Butterworth’s <em>The Ferryman</em> the best play of the century, as we are not quite 19 percent of the way through. Even so, <em>The Ferryman</em> is the best play of the century thus far, setting a high mark to match. Not since <em>Angels in America: Millennium Approaches</em> first appeared in 1992 has a new play been so thrillingly, enthrallingly breathtaking. You emerge onto 45th Street stunned, as if you’ve been off in an altogether different world. Because you have, courtesy of Butterworth and his spellbinding director, Sam Mendes.</p>\n<p>Butterworth, who caused a stir on the world stage in 2009 with <em>Jerusalem</em>, is working on a large canvas here. An <em>enormous</em> canvas. Following a brief prologue, he takes us to a farmhouse in Northern Ireland. Within moments, one of the characters sets a lamp <em>on fire</em>. No phony-looking lighting effect, here; the prop goes up in flames, for real. Soon enough, on pours a parade of children—there will be ten in all, aged 7 to 16 (although some of the eldest actors appear to be a tad older).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/10/21/the-ferryman-an-intimate-intense-irish-epic/\">[<em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo&#8217;s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>To heighten the point, one of the daughters walks on holding a baby; not one of those realistic-looking and properly weighted baby props, but an actual infant with legs a-kicking. (This role is essayed by four alternating infants; the one I caught was thoroughly intent on his performance, although in his second scene he clearly seemed to indicate that he expected someone to come along and play with him.) <em>The Ferryman</em> is, among other things, about family: “a man who takes care of his family,” says Quinn Carney, the father of the brood and the central character, “is a man who can look himself in the eye in the morning.” Quinn manages to do so, but not without undergoing unendurably brutal trials.</p>\n<p>The play is set in 1981, during the Irish hunger strike; within the course of the action, we hear Margaret Thatcher’s address rejecting the idea that the strikers be treated as political prisoners: “Crime is crime is crime,” she blares out over the kitchen radio, “there can be no question of granting political status.” Yes, we have seen numerous plays over the years about the Irish Troubles. <em>The Ferryman</em>, though, makes it immediate and altogether comprehensible; it also shows how the chain of violence—starting with the Easter Rising in 1916—has consumed this Carney family over four generations and up past the final curtain.</p>\n<p>Speaking of generations, 14 of the characters are family members, all named Carney. Butterworth and Mendes, and their abundantly talented cast, manage things so that each and every Carney—from youngsters to octogenarians—is distinct and memorable. Which, in itself, is notable.</p>\n<p>Much of the cast (all, it seems, except the preteens) has traveled with the play from London, where it opened at the Royal Court and transferred to the Gielgud. Central to the proceedings are Paddy Considine, in a knockout performance as Quinn; Laura Donnelly as Caitlin, the widow of Quinn’s brother who’s been “disappeared” for over ten years; Genevieve O’Reilly as Mary, Quinn’s withdrawn wife and mother of all the brood; and Stuart Graham as Muldoon, the IRA chief.</p>\n<p>(A recent and most-informative article in the <em>New York</em> <em>Times</em> explained that the plot was suggested by the family history of Butterworth’s long-time partner Donnelly, whose uncle was one of the disappeared. She won an Olivier for playing Caitlin, and also appeared on Broadway opposite Hugh Jackman and Cush Jumbo in Butterworth’s <em>The River</em>.)</p>\n<p>To give proper credit to the large cast is impractical; just about everyone is superb. We shall suffice by mentioning the three elderly Carneys: Mark Lambert as the loquacious Uncle Patrick; Dearbhla Molloy, who received a Tony nomination for <em>Dancing at Lughnasa</em> and was seen in the recent <em>Outside Mullingar</em>, as the ornery Aunt Pat; and Fionnula Flanagan, who on her local visits starred opposite Art Carney in Brian Friel’s <em>Lovers</em> and earned a Tony nomination as a most sensuous Molly Bloom, opposite Zero Mostel, in <em>Ulysses in Nighttown</em>. (The actress was altogether striking, but the production was an unfathomable mess). Flanagan here plays a distant character in a wheelchair known to the children as “Aunt Maggie Far Away.” Her performance is stunning, with surprises plus an altogether astonishing scene she plays with the four Carney daughters.</p>\n<p>Rob Malone, as the tortured and fatherless Oisin Carney; Niall Wright and Fra Fee as the eldest Carney sons; Tom Glynn-Carney, Conor MacNeill, and Michael Quinton McArthur as teenage cousins who come on late in the action and propel the plot to its conclusion: All are giving assured performances. (Young Mr. McArthur gets to deliver my new favorite line from the Irish-flavored drama, befitting O’Casey or O’Neill: “As the saying goes, there’s only so much whiskey a 13-year-old boy can drink.”) It is impossible not to equally salute the Carney daughters, played by Carla Langley, Brooklyn Shuck, Willow McCarthy, and the pert Matilda Lawler. The last is 7-year old Honor, who calls herself Cleopatra and at one point refers to her father, Quinn, as Julius. Butterworth gives her a couple of adult-size laugh lines, and she demolishes them.</p>\n<p>Mendes has pulled marvelous performances from them all, and protean contributions from his production team. The scenery by Rob Howell—of <em>Matilda</em>—is almost overpowering, with the farmhouse kitchen monopolized by a staircase which seems to go up into infinity. Howell’s costumes are equally impressive, with eons of Irish dirt, mud and bog baked in. The exceptional lighting comes courtesy of Peter Mumford, while sound and incidental music are provided by Nick Powell.</p>\n<p>Most impressive, though, is the text. Butterworth goes on at length, but with never a line or word that doesn’t contribute to the whole. (Occasional phrases might be lost, due to the poetry or the accents; but no matter, the essence comes through.) What’s more, he gives every one of his 21 actors—except two subsidiary IRA thugs, who serve as understudies to the leading men—important exchanges and sometimes critical scenes. Nothing is wasted, everything is fundamental, and the evening flies by so swiftly that you don’t realize you’ve been sitting there a tad over three hours. It&#8217;s hard to be restless when you’re breathlessly engaged.</p>\n<p>Butterworth’s <em>The Ferryman</em>, from start to finish, is a masterwork. Today’s theatergoers have been favored with excellent revivals of classics by O’Neill, Miller, Williams, and Albee. Here’s your chance to see a new, instant and monumental classic fresh off the author’s computer screen.</p>\n<p><b>The Ferryman </b><strong>opened October 21, 2018, at the Bernard B.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s virtually impossible to describe <em>The Ferryman</em> without using the word <em>epic</em>. Since Jez Butterworth’s drama opened at London’s Royal Court Theatre in May 2017, transferred to the West End, won a pile of awards, and made the move to Broadway, where it just opened, much has been made of its size: its 195-minute running time (which, frankly, feels like 90); the 30-plus cast members (which I suspect does not include the bunny rabbit and the goose); the mess of children (almost half the characters on stage are aged 16 and younger, including one cherub-cheeked 9-month-old baby boy); and, perhaps most important, the backdrop—the Troubles, Northern Ireland’s bloody 30-year conflict over Irish unification, and a group called the Disappeared (the 1981-set play begins with the discovery of a body of a man who’s been missing for a decade).</p>\n<p>There’s no denying that <em>The Ferryman </em>is epic, and undeniably Butterworth’s best play (apologies to fans of the allegorical, and almost equally lengthy, <em>Jerusalem</em>). Yet at its abundant heart, <em>The Ferryman</em> is a wrenching family drama, whose most moving moments are its most spare and most intimate—starting with the very beginning of Act 1: an early-morning game of Connect Four, a near-empty bottle of Bushmills, and a Rolling Stones/Beatles/Led Zeppelin debate between Quinn Carney (the immensely appealing Paddy Considine) and Caitlin Carney (a luminous Laura Donnelly, who also starred in Butterworth’s <em>The River</em>) that culminates with a small fire, both literal and figurative. Later, it’s Quinn who must tell Cait that her long-missing husband, Seamus, his brother, has turned up dead in a bog. And it’s Quinn who decides to confront Muldoon (Stuart Graham), who’s come to offer “condolences” and to “personally assure” the family that “whatever happened to Seamus all those years ago, whatever went on, that the IRA had absolutely nothing to do with it.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/10/21/the-ferryman-an-irish-masterwork-from-jez-butterworth/\">[<em>Read Steven Suskin&#8217;s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>Director Sam Mendes—who does his best work with plays (see: <em>The Winter’s Tale</em>, <em>The Cherry Orchard</em>, and more)—is a master at orchestrating chaotic scenes, such as when the whole Carney clan—more than a dozen of them, including amiable patriarch Quinn and his distant wife, Mary (Genevieve O’Reilly)—rolls downstairs, giddy with anticipation of the upcoming harvest. Uncle Pat (Mark Lambert) is already unscrewing the whiskey and unspooling his signature stories of harvests past—much to the consternation of Aunt Pat (Dearbhla Molloy). &#8220;You know what irks me most about this ‘story’?” she barks. “Nothing happens. No one gets drunk. No one feels up no one they shouldn’t. No one falls into the grain silo and drowns. There’s not even a good punch up.” (When they discover that the goose—aka dinner—has done a runner, Aunt Pat deadpans, “At least it’ll give you a half-decent story to tell.”)</p>\n<p>Yet you’ll find yourself on the edge of your seat during even the most sedate scenes. You can hear a pin drop when wheelchair-bound Aunt Maggie Far Away (Fionnula Flanagan)—named so because she drifts in and out and goes who knows where—regales the Carney girls with tales of her unrequited love for Francis John Patrick Maloney (“I swear to Christ I could have ridden that boy from here to Connemara”) and of Aunt Pat’s older brother, who fought with the Irish Republican Brotherhood (“Right before he died he looked her in the eye … and he smiled and said ‘Death to the English, Pat’”). And when teenage firebrand Shane Corcoran (Tom Glynn-Carney) riles up Caitlin’s impressionable son, Oisin (Rob Malone). And when Mary and Quinn finally confront their troubled marriage: “I forgot how to make you smile. I forgot how to make you laugh.”</p>\n<p>It’s not a spoiler to say that <em>The Ferryman</em> ends tragically—as so many epics do. But it ends so ferociously, in such a glorious burst of action, predictions, and promises, that a follow-up would not be unwelcome. After more than three hours, it feels like <em>The Ferryman</em> has just begun.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Ferryman</em></strong><strong> opened Oct. 21, 2018, at the Bernard B.

Photo: Peter Cunningham</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I took a former fact-checker to see <em>The Lifespan of a Fact</em> on Broadway. Not in the name of some anthropological experiment; she’s my frequent plus-one. Still, I knew she’d have a few things to say about the veracity of a play that centered on fact-checker Jim (Daniel Radcliffe), essayist John (Bobby Cannavale), and editor Emily (Cherry Jones) wrangling over truths, half-truths, and teeny-tiny details such as red bricks versus brown bricks. The first thing she said on the way out? “There’s no way the editor could’ve run that story.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/10/18/the-lifespan-of-a-fact-seeking-accuracy-with-dramatic-license/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">]</span></a></p>\n<p>Fact-checking is a dying art—much like copy editing. (In fact, they’re often lumped together. These days, publications that can afford such luxuries often rely on copy editors to do basic fact-checking. If you’re lucky enough to work with one of those double-threat dynamos, send them flowers.) That’s why Emily is forced to email her entire edit staff asking for volunteers to check John’s essay, luring them with the promise of a shiny pack of red pens. “There’s no fact-checking department per se since the restructure,” she tells the egomaniacal John, who’s ticked off that anyone—especially this intern Jim—has the stones to question a word of his precious prose. “We flattened the management tree, re-engineered everyone towards a streamlined and actionable editorial process, so all new hires in editorial also train to be fact checkers.” We feel you, Emily.</p>\n<p>As a play, <em>Lifespan</em> isn’t much more substantial than the paper your <em>Playbill</em> is printed on. It’s really just a fact-checker and a writer arguing, tennis match–style, about the semantics of a magazine story: the tale of a teenager who committed suicide in Las Vegas. How it took three playwrights, Jeremy Kareken, David Murrell, and Gordon Farrell—working from the book by John D’Agata and Jim Fingal (the guys portrayed by Cannavale and Radcliffe)—is anyone’s guess. But it makes for a weirdly compelling 95 minutes.</p>\n<p>Though he’s still best known for the <em>Harry Potter</em> film franchise, Radcliffe, over the past decade, has proved himself to be a terrific stage actor, and he’s only getting better with each outing. (He’s already been unjustly robbed of two Tony nominations: for 2011’s <em>How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</em>—What did he have to do, backflips? Oh wait, he did!—and for 2014’s <em>The Cripple of Inishmaan</em>.) Cannavale turns in another spectacular portrait of a tortured underdog—all bluster and brawn, and brilliant. And Jones is, of course, flawless in a thankless role. But that’s just in the job description; editors never get the glory.</p>\n<p>“I’m not interested in accuracy,” John tells Emily. “I’m interested in truth.” The truth is: Our country is obsessed with accuracy. Or at least what passes for accuracy. We’re living in an age when <em>The Washington Post</em> has a feature called the Fact Checker, which uses a Pinocchio rating scale to grade statements and speeches. That’s why we’re sitting here watching John and Jim almost come to blows over sentences like these: “On that day in Las Vegas when Levi Presley died, five others died from two types of cancer, four from heart attacks, three because of strokes. It was a day of two suicides by gunshot as well as a suicide from hanging.”</p>\n<p>John looks at those words and sees poetry. Beauty. Jim looks at them and sees inaccuracies. Flaws. What John calls liberties Jim calls liabilities. Just because John needs Levi to fall for nine seconds—for the sake of his essay, to “make some of the other themes work”—doesn’t mean he did. He fell for eight, according to the coroner’s report.</p>\n<p>“By changing paint colors and statistics,” Jim sighs, “by misrepresenting official and searchable documents, you undermine your argument, you undermine society’s trust in itself. Which is why facts have to be the final measure of the truth.”</p>\n<p>Even today, five days after the show, my former fact-checker friend is hung up on John’s very loose definition of the truth. “All those little liberties <em>still</em> irk me!” And yes, I checked that quote with her.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Lifespan of a Fact</em> opened Oct. 18, 2018, and runs through Jan. 13, 2019, at Studio 54.

Photo: Peter Cunningham</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are facts: John D’Agata is self-important essayist who lives in Las Vegas and has written a compelling essay about a teen’s suicide there for an unnamed but Manhattan-based magazine with enough history to have 52 years of autographed covers hanging on an editor’s office wall. Jim Fingal is the fact-checker who volunteers to check the lengthy piece on a quick, five-day turnaround and becomes so neurotically obsessed with the project that he flies to Vegas on his own to do his research and check in with D’Agata. Also, their editor, a mysterious woman of a certain age, both handles the line-editing of the essay and has sufficient authority within the organization to keep the printing plant on hold for a final decision on whether to slot in D’Agata’s story or the backup, on congressional spouses. She can order union overtime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is another set of facts: John D’Agata is a self-important essayist who lives in Iowa City, where he directs the graduate nonfiction program at the Iowa Writers Workshop. He wrote an essay about a teen’s suicide in Las Vegas that was rejected by <em>Harper’s Magazine</em> for accuracy issues, at which point he shopped it to <em>The Believer</em>, a magazine founded in 2003 and then based in San Francisco. Jim Fingal is the intern assigned to fact-check the essay, who begins an epic seven-year face-off with D’Agata about details in the piece and also the nature of truth. It was published in the January 2010 issue of <em>The Believer</em>, with some facts corrected and some conjectures left, as they say in the fact-checking trade, on author.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first version is the factual story as presented in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lifespan of a Fact</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the frustratingly empty play about D’Agata and Fingal’s battle over truth and accuracy that opened tonight at Studio 54 with a starry, excellent cast. The second is the actual facts of the story, as presented in D’Agata and Fingal’s insightful and charming book of the same name about their checking odyssey (and in news accounts). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclosure: I am a former magazine fact-checker.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/10/18/the-lifespan-of-a-fact-can-you-handle-the-truth/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">]</span></a></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lifespan of a Fact</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is presented as an urgent and timely examination of facts and accuracy, of how we can know what we think we know and what obligations nonfiction does or does not have to both mundane details and fundamental truths. But it knows its answers before it begins: For the sake of a brisk 85 minutes, the play changes the details of its story as needed. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that in a truth-based plan; few would want to watch Lin-Manuel Miranda reading from Ron Chernow live on stage. But in this case, it not only undermines the play’s fundamental conceit, it also renders the drama less compelling. The play can’t help feeling a bit ersatz, when its magazine seems unfamiliar with the concept of fact-checking, when its author comes off as such a pompous blowhard, and when its checker is turned into a unbalanced nutjob. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not to say that the play is unenjoyable, especially as stylishly directed by Leigh Silverman. Daniel Radcliffe continues to prove himself an excellent stage actor, giving credibility to even this manically obsessed version of Fingal (and in entirely successful American accent, no less). Bobby Cannavale’s macho world-weariness as D’Agata makes a fine foil for the hysteria of Radcliffe’s Fingal, even if his characterization shows none of the charm that comes across in D’Agata’s written replies to Fingal in the book. Cherry Jones, as the editor with all the exasperated answers, plays a character with all of her usual steely resolve, even if the actor feels underused in a part that’s so passive. (Even in the end, and unlike in real life, this editor never makes her decision. You might say she has doubts.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The script is credited to Jeremy Karekan, David Murrell, and Gordon Farrell, the first two names separated in the <em>Playbill</em> by an ampersand and the latter two by an “and,” suggesting multiple arrangements of writers working on multiple drafts. In any case, none of them is much known on Broadway, and none has cracked this nut. It’s not necessarily an easy one, as fact-checking is inherently undramatic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re also hindered by timing: D’Agata and Fingal’s years-long face-off was resolved by 2010, before fake news, before Russian Twitter bots, before even GamerGate, which was the Spanish Civil War to the World War II of online misinformation and harassment campaigns surfaced during the 2016 presidential election. In other words, everything that makes this debate about how far nonfiction writers can fudge the facts in service of larger truths, and how much they destroy their credibility by so doing, happened after the action in the play. Radcliffe gets a brief speech to this end late in the play, but the elephant in the room (or the Fancy Bear, as the case may be) is that the elephant hasn’t yet come into the room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The book </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lifespan of a Fact</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a charming and engaging meditation on the craft of writing and the ultimate inscrutability of knowledge. The play </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lifespan of a Fact</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an amusing evening at the theater.</span></p>\n<div><b><em>The Lifespan of a Fact</em> </b><strong>opened Oct. 18, 2018, at Studio 54 and runs through Jan. 13, 2019. </strong><strong>Tickets and information: <a href=\"https://www.lifespanofafact.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lifespanofafact.com</a></strong></div>\n",

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>To enjoy <em>Anastasia</em>—and I did enjoy it, quite a lot—you can’t expect it to be what it isn’t. It’s far from the serious-minded musical currently in vogue: consistent in tone, thematically focused and boasting the sound of today. Instead, as if cued by act one closer “Journey to the Past,” it’s a deliberate throwback to a bygone era. Virtually nothing in Terrence McNally’s lean libretto, or Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty’s lush score, couldn’t have been seen (or wouldn’t have been lauded) in the late 1920’s, when <em>Anastasia </em>is set. Buffs, who’ll recall <em>Anya</em> told in haut-floperetta style for two weeks in 1965, can readily identify elements of the light opera playbook followed by <em>Naughty Marietta </em>and <em>The Merry Widow. </em>(Scoff if you must, but those were crowd-pleasers in their day, as this show has been in its.)</p>\n<p>And you can’t honestly deem it a fairy tale. Fairy tales take place in mythical realms of magic, whereas <em>Anastasia</em> is set against real-life events. And what tumultuous events they are: Imperial excess in its last gasps; the Czar’s family murdered; civil war; survivors plotting in Jazz Age Paris. As in previous versions—the Marcelle Maurette-Guy Bolton play whose film brought Ingrid Bergman an Oscar, and the animated reworking that led to the attraction at hand—there’s plenty Romanov bling available to anyone who can establish a plausible claim. Which inspires some enterprising con men to make over an amnesiac peasant girl (Christy Altomare) in the image of the titular rumored massacre survivor, enough at least to persuade the grandmother (Judy Kaye, newly replacing Mary Beth Peil) to hand over the keys.</p>\n<p>That’s the story, but how it’s told is what matters. Because McNally is in essence writing an operetta libretto, downtrodden Dmitry (Zach Adkins, a fresh, charismatic new talent) has more at stake than wealth in his burgeoning romance with the confused Anya (Altomare striking a nice balance between neurosis and Broadway-heroine perkiness). They’re of the same hardscrabble world, but she may be of a different world, so there are problems but ah! Love will conquer all….if you catch my drift. Sidekick Vlad (John Bolton), besotted by Imperial Court memories, is motivated mostly by flirtation with Countess Lily (Lauren Blackman in for Vicki Lewis at the performance caught). Bolton and Blackman’s amusing turns reveal their characters have little interest in making a killing.</p>\n<p>Gleb, however, does want to make a killing: He’s a current commissar deputized to finish the job on this reputed rescued Romanov, who strangely rattles his Marxist-Leninist sangfroid. High-stakes villains torn between duty and passion frequently haunted operettas, and ever-reliable Max von Essen plays this one to the hilt and, but for one wince-inducing moment permitted by director Darko Tresnjak, without camp.</p>\n<p>There’s your lineup, light opera fans, and let’s not forget the waltzes. Lots and lots of waltzes from Peggy Hickey, some in flashback from old St. Petersburg, all eye-popping in Linda Cho’s extravagant costumes. And as lit by Donald Holder, Alexander Dodge’s elegant marble framing of Aaron Rhyne’s Drama Desk Award-winning projections—4K-clear vistas of Petersburg and Paris, and a thrilling ride on a moving train—pops whatever eyes are left to pop after Cho’s gowns have flitted by.</p>\n<p>So <em>Anastasia</em> sends you, if you let yourself be sent, off on a cascade of melody and visual splendor. Just don’t think about it all too much. Let it go that they insist on pronouncing the heroine’s name with an Americanized long A and middle “zh,” instead of the short A and soft “s” that would gibe with the show’s Old World qualities. (Don’t even get me started on how they mangle “Nikolaevna.”) Ignore the rejection of the broken-hearted cry “Malenkaia” when Nana recognizes her granddaughter, in favor of the 1,368th invocation of “Anastasia!” (Kaye, sharp and sturdy as always, could have knocked a “Malenkaia” out of the park.)</p>\n<p>And I wouldn’t fret about the taste choices in using the Russian Revolution, its causes and outcomes, as the backdrop for love story. Operetta always sees the real world through romantic mists lit by dim embers. Friml, Romberg, Victor Herbert and now Ahrens and Flaherty adapt John Ford’s old adage to their Great White Way purpose. When the legend becomes fact, stage the legend.</p>\n<p><b>Anastasia </b><strong>opened April 24, 2017, at the Broadhurst Theatre. Reviewed: October, 2018. </strong><strong>Tickets and information: <a href=\"https://anastasiathemusical.com/broadway/\">anastasiathemusical.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Championship snooker, that is, with the action climaxing in what you or at least Bean might call a championship battle of the balls.</p>\n<p>Snooker is something of a variation of billiards; in the realm of <em>The Nap</em>, it is a major sport complete with high-profile, live television coverage. <em>The Nap</em> originated at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, in South Yorkshire; the World Snooker Championship has, since 1977, been telecast from the stage of the Crucible. The &#8220;nap&#8221; refers to the seam of the baize, that green felt covering on pool tables. When you play &#8220;with the nap,&#8221; the ball runs straight.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/09/27/the-nap-no-farce-please-were-british/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Most fortunately for local audiences, snooker turns out not to be some complicated sport like cricket; the game is quickly and easily explained, and the two matches that make up parts of the evening are live-cast above the stage so we can literally see the action. (While the playwright clearly has an intended victor, he has contrived two endings—lest the wrong actor “pots the black” and wins the championship.)</p>\n<p>Dylan (Ben Schnetzer) is a local boy who has dedicated his life to the game, thus avoiding the usual dead-end fate of everyone else; a prime example of which is his father Bobby (John Ellison Conlee), a retired ex-con bank robber/drug dealer. As Dylan prepares for the championship, he is distracted by a muddle of misfits: His wayward mother, Stella (Johanna Day); her odorous romantic entanglement, Danny (Thomas Jay Ryan); Dylan’s colorfully-coordinated, lizardish manager, Tony (Max Gordon Moore); and a notorious mobster named Waxey Bush (Alexandra Billings), who has lost not only her right hand—like Nicholas Cage in <em>Moonstruck</em>, and that&#8217;s worth about five minutes of laughter—but an apparently even bigger appendage in a sex-change operation. All of this brings forth barrels and barrels of jokes.</p>\n<p>Complications arrive with the appearance of personable detective Eleanor (Heather Lind) and Mohammad Butt (Bhavesh Patel), integrity officer from the International Centre for Sport Security. The pair are investigating a suspicious bet on Dylan’s last match, and he has no recourse but to cooperate with them on a sting operation. Or is it a sting operation? And just who is going to be stung, or snookered?</p>\n<p>Fans of <em>One Man, Two Guvnors</em> will recall that Mr. Bean possesses a comic sense which is wild, fantastic and at times insane. He doesn’t simply offer a barrage of jokes; he plants them, marinates them, and finally allows them to burst forth at his hapless auditors. Daniel Sullivan, director of <em>Good People</em>, <em>Rabbit Hole</em> and countless worthy dramas, reveals a perhaps unsuspected flair for comedy both verbal and visual.</p>\n<p>Sullivan and the folks at Manhattan Theatre Club have seen fit to enlist set designer David Rockwell, who has something of a field day. Costume designer Kay Voyce has outfitted the Sheffield locals in some outrageously impossible leisure ware. With one exception: Tony the manager looks like an orange serpent (with loafers and no socks) in his first scene, turned lavender in the second and raspberry in the finale. Which is to say that director and designers gleefully accommodate the author, while the cast comports itself in high comic style.</p>\n<p>No, <em>The Nap</em> is not quite as broad as <em>One Man</em>; it would be unreasonable to expect it to be, wouldn’t it? But it is easily the funniest new play on Broadway. So go get snookered.</p>\n<p><strong>The Nap opened September 27, 2018, at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre and runs through November 11.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was a kid, in those pre-streaming days when people still idly channel-surfed and local channels filled late-night hours with sitcom reruns, the anglophiles at WNET had a particular fondness for BBC comedies. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fawlty Towers</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was the best-case scenario, but many of those reruns, or at least this is what it feels like in my memory, were well sub-</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fawlty</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They were recognizable as sitcoms but also simulacra of them, by virtue of their Britishness and their mediocrity. They looked different, thanks to divergent pre-digital tech standards, they were 40 or 45 minutes long, rather than the usual 30, they tended toward slapstick, and they weren’t especially funny, at least not to an American.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nap</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which opens tonight in a Manhattan Theatre Club production at the Samuel J. Friedman, is the staged version of those not-quite-right British sitcoms. It is funny, but less funny than you’d like it to be. It entertains, but it is instantly forgotten. You can’t shake the feeling that you’re missing something.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, of course, assuming you’re an American, you <em>are</em> missing something.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/09/27/the-nap-all-balled-up-in-sheffield/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nap</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> centers around the World Snooker Championships, held each year in Sheffield, in northern England. Snooker is the British version of pool—invented, as the play accurately tells us, by Imperial officers in India in the late 19th century. And the comic plot involves a gangster’s scheme to have an up-and-coming snooker star, Dylan Spokes (Ben Schnetzer), throw a “frame” of a match for their wagering benefit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along the way, we meet Dylan’s soccer hooligan of a father (John Ellison Conlee), his bimbo of a mother (Johanna Day), and the local gangster who’s masterminding everything, a transgender woman with a fake arm named Waxy Bush (Alexandra Billings), who is prone to outrageous malapropisms. You can see how this might feel like a silly British sitcom.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It could also be, and was clearly hoped to be, a great British farce. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nap</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is written by Richard Bean, whose uproarious </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One Man, Two Guvnors</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> played the Music Box, and won carpool karaoke-er-to-be James Corden a Tony Award, in 2012. That play, adapted from the 18th century Italian comedy </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Servant of Two Masters</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, was a masterpiece, carefully constructed, precisely staged, and played to perfection by Corden. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nap</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, equally well performed, never ascends to any giddy farcical heights. It remains consistently, stubbornly, mildly amusing. There is nothing laugh-out-loud funny. This is most likely because—and this should come as a surprise to no one—Americans are not primed for snooker humor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, a spoof of the self-seriousness of a minor sport can translate across languages. But </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nap</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—the title, by the way, refers to the texture of the fabric on a billiards table—is conceived, at its base, as an English in-joke. Every character is an English stereotype. The play debuted in Sheffield, in a theater called the Crucible, that is most famously home to the actual annual snooker championships. The final section, with deadpan commentators following that final match (cleverly staged here by MTC stalwart Daniel Sullivan), evokes the Christopher Guest movie </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best In Show</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It’s amusing. But not as amusing as if a live version of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best In Show</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was mounted on the Westminster set in Madison Square Garden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, what we get is a pleasant, provincial-British diversion. Whoever thought this would be a Broadway hit was simply—it’s unavoidable to say—snookered.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The Nap opened September 27, 2018, at the Samuel J.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In her roughly two dozen plays, Theresa Rebeck has written, in no particular order, a riff on <em>The Oresteia</em> (<em>The Water’s Edge</em>), a takedown of reality TV (<em>Our House</em>), a thriller about stamp-collecting (<em>Mauritius</em>), a backstage comedy built on Kafka and prop-banana jokes (<em>The Understudy</em>), a sexism-in-the-workplace satire (<em>What We’re Up Against</em>), a post-9/11 treatise (<em>Omnium Gatherum</em>, coauthored with Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros) and a one-woman show about looking for love and the perfect pair of shoes (<em>Bad Dates</em>). Now, continuing her pattern of unpredictability, Rebeck is taking on one of history’s most iconic actresses taking on perhaps theater’s most iconic role in <em>Bernhardt/Hamlet</em> on Broadway.</p>\n<p>Rebeck could hardly have picked a richer subject: Sarah Bernhardt was charismatic and colorful; she lived large and she loved fame. And, like so many of the most fascinating celebrities in entertainment history (see: Liz Taylor, Judy Garland, and more), she made headlines for not only her onstage performances but also her offstage behavior. Her romance with the decades-younger, married-with-children playwright Edmond Rostand (Jason Butler Harner, saddled with an unfortunate mustache that gives the impression of a perpetual sneer), to which Rebeck devotes a considerable amount of time, could inspire an entire play of its own.</p>\n<p>And there’s simply no one better suited to embody Bernhardt than Janet McTeer, who first took Broadway by storm more than a decade ago with her titanic Tony-winning turn in <em>A Doll’s House</em>. As soon as the lights go up and she begins soliloquizing—“Oh what a rogue and peasant slave am I!”—we are immediately, completely, utterly, spellbound.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/09/25/bernhardt-hamlet-janet-mcteer-in-teresa-rebecks-almost-ready-play/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Beyond the inherent allure of dramatizing a play-within-a-play, the Bernhardt that Rebeck shows us is a woman full of fascinating contradictions: she was extremely famous, but famously broke; she had star power to spare, but she still couldn’t write her own ticket.</p>\n<p>“She’s a great actress, but Hamlet? It’s grotesque,” sniffs Louis (Tony Carlin), a self-important critic. “If Shakespeare meant for Hamlet to be a woman, he would have named the play Hamlet princess of Denmark.” The hopelessly-devoted Rostand offers a weak explanation: “It is the greatest part ever written and she the greatest actress ever born.”</p>\n<p>What gets everyone in a tizzy is not that Bernhardt is more than 50 years old and Hamlet, well, isn’t—there’s a long-running joke about Hamlet’s age, something that’s still debated to this day. It’s simply that she’s a woman. No matter how well-reasoned her arguments—“Why shouldn’t I play Hamlet. I am perfectly suited. Nobody cares about his masculinity. So called. They care about the magnificent nuance of his heart”—the idea is not just incomprehensible; it’s actually incendiary.</p>\n<p>In one of the play’s ugliest, and most truthful, moments, Louis puts his finger on it: “A woman with power is a freak. A freak of nature, perhaps, but a freak nonetheless. Shakespeare himself acknowledged it. ‘Unsex me here’ is one of his mightiest condemnations. A woman reaching for power? It’s unholy.” The audience will gasp, but can anyone argue otherwise? He makes this proclamation in a merry, wine-soaked setting: a dinner in Sarah’s dressing room—a gilded boho-glam fantasy, swathed in rich tapestries and draped in sumptuous velvets, courtesy of Tony winner Beowulf Boritt (<em>Act One</em>)—among VIPs including Rostand; her costar, Constant Coquelin (Dylan Baker), who will soon famously originate the role of Cyrano de Bergerac; and the Czech Art Nouveau painter/theatrical portrait-maker Alphonse Mucha (Matthew Saldivar). Nothing kills a party like a critic.</p>\n<p>And as if Bernhardt versus the world weren’t enough, Rebeck sets up another conflict: Bernhardt versus the Bard. The Divine Sarah seems to be struggling to find her voice within Shakespeare’s multitudes of words. Of course there’s no doubt that McTeer could play Hamlet—or any other breeches role—if she wanted to. Recall her leather-jacket-clad Petruchio, where she whipped Cush Jumbo’s Kate into submission, in Phyllida Lloyd’s 2016 <em>Taming of the Shrew</em> in Central Park. Which raises the question: Why don’t we see more women in traditionally male roles these days? Go ahead. I’ll wait.</p>\n<p>As much as Rebeck’s drama deifies <em>Hamlet</em>—“It’s prayer; it’s incantation. It’s enchantment. It’s a hymn. It’s grace itself,” sighs Rostand dreamily—<em>Bernhardt/Hamlet</em> is less about a great actress playing the Dane than it is about a woman forging her legacy in, put plainly, a man’s world. It may not be the 19th century anymore, but some things never change.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Bernhardt/Hamlet</em></strong><strong> opened September 25, 2018, and runs through November 18 at the American Airlines Theatre.

Photo by Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Theresa Rebeck was the subject of a recent article in which it was implied that reviewers resisting her output were merely being snarky.  So I’ll have to accept that what is about to be declared here may be received as just some more snark-asm. So be it. It may be, however, that <em>Bernhardt/Hamlet</em>, Rebeck’s latest work, is one of her better plays.</p>\n<p>It isn’t yet, but that may have to do with its being vastly overwritten. What it needed before being put into production was someone like its director, Moritz von Stuelpnagel, or a strong dramaturge to work more closely with Rebeck at maximizing its potential.</p>\n<p>Rebeck’s title pretty much signals what will go on. In 1897 the great and belovedly histrionic Sarah Bernhardt (no understated Eleonora Duse, she) occasionally played pants roles but nonetheless shocked Paris by announcing she would tackle William Shakespeare’s durable <em>Hamlet</em>—not as Ophelia, whom she’d already embodied numerous times, and not as Gertrude, a role at which she evidently turned up her straight nose.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/09/25/bernhardt-hamlet-what-a-piece-of-work/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Portrayed here by the peerless Janet McTeer (Shakespeare’s Petruchio in <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> is on her resumé), Bernhardt has decided she’ll be Hamlet. As Rebeck writes, the decision doesn’t thrill everyone, and certainly not the married Edmond Rostand (Jason Butler Harner) with whom she is having an affair and whom she pressures to rewrite <em>Hamlet</em> because she thinks the script is in need of improving(!). She couldn’t care less that she’s forcing him to suspend work on his imminent masterpiece, <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>.</p>\n<p>Other friends and relatives she annoys as she determinedly strides on include the famous illustrator Alphonse Mucha (Matthew Saldivar), who can’t get a handle on the poster for the production, and son Maurice (Nick Westrate), who manages her affairs and worries that their financial straits might only worsen.</p>\n<p>Maurice is also not overjoyed about the Bernhardt/Rostand alliance, even as the adulterous couple attempts to keep the bruited scandal quiet. It takes Rostand’s indignantly dignified wife, Rosamond (Ito Aghayere), to see what she can do.</p>\n<p>But that development doesn’t kick in until late in Act Two and after Bernhardt’s intentions are repeatedly argued by her and those around her who are troubled about where things might lead. So as backstage life courses, the to-be-or-not-to-be-Hamlet quarrels go on and on while the lovers tiff, separate temporarily, and reunite for the nonce.</p>\n<p>Rebeck does distinguish herself with dialogue that frequently zings by. Bernhardt observes that “All theater is ego,” and that amuses the show-biz spectators in the crowd. Defending her estimation of Shakespeare, the actress—who may be the only female Hamlet who’s ever worn a doublet with a pronounced bust line—declaims, “Anybody who writes as often as he did is bound to slip up once in a while.” And Rebeck does know the right moment to have Bernhardt tell Rostand, “I want you to rewrite <em>Hamlet</em>,” a demand that may require the world’s largest exclamation point.</p>\n<p>Because Rebeck can blithely scatter lines like those as she unfolds her intriguing tale, it behooves a reviewer exhausted by the repetitious action to suggest that she rethink the comedy-drama. She might consider either ruthlessly editing it herself or finding someone who can. Were she to come up with a 90-minute redaction, she would likely have herself a potent piece.</p>\n<p>At the moment, her major asset is McTeer, who moves around the stage with the grace and steadfastness of a ripple crossing a stream. With hair cropped and tousled until she puts on a Prince Valiant wig copied by Matthew B. Armentrout from the one Bernhardt sported, she radiates such confidence and authority that she almost makes Rebeck’s excesses evaporate. That’s to say she does what the best actors do under these conditions: she raises the dramaturgical level without entirely saving the proceedings. Bernhardt herself undoubtedly couldn’t have done better.</p>\n<p>The supporting cast—notably Dylan Baker as all-purpose player Constant Coquelin, Tony Carlin (replacing Paxton Whitehead) as critic Louis, Brittany Bradford as Bernhardt’s Ophelia—are strong.</p>\n<p>Beowulf Boritt’s notion of a 19th-century backstage is elegant and evocative, especially as lighted by Bradley King. Toni-Leslie James hasn’t spared the expense—or the look of expense—on the costumes. When Bernhardt entertains admirers in her dressing room and therefore needn’t appear in tights, McTeer is in a glittery period gown that Paul Poiret might have concocted at the beginning of his career.</p>\n<p>A few years back, Rebeck created the two-season television series <em>Smash</em>. It wasn’t one, but with the proper attention, this one might be.</p>\n<p><strong>Bernhardt/Hamlet opened September 25, 2018, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs to November 18.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>There are only a few cast albums I listen to over and over and over again, and one of them is the <em>Beautiful: The Carole King Musical</em>. It’s bouncy and joyous, and Jessie Mueller, the original Tony-winning star, captures King’s emotion and phrasing without trying to duplicate her sound. In other words, it doesn’t keep me from going back to King’s iconic album <em>Tapestry</em> over and over as well.</p>\n<p>Even so, I hadn’t seen <em>Beautiful</em> since May 2014, just a few months after it opened. Now that I’ve returned, as the show is nearing its 2,000th performance, I couldn’t help but wonder, What <em>took</em> me so long?</p>\n<p>The script—by Douglas McGrath, who elegantly adapted Jane Austen’s <em>Emma</em> for the screen in 1996—is snappier than I remembered. “Girls don’t write music; they teach it,” Genie Klein (Liz Larsen) tells a teenage Carole (a marvelous Abby Mueller, sister of the aforementioned Jessie). Genie is full of great advice: “If there were only two places on earth, hell and Times Square, the nice people would live in hell.” Smartly, McGrath doesn’t bite off more than he can chew; the show focuses only on King’s breakthrough, when she sold her first song to Don Kirschner (Curt Bouril) to the start of her solo career. Along the way, she marries her writing partner Gerry Goffin (Evan Todd), befriends fellow songwriters Barry Mann (Ben Jacoby) and Cynthia Weil (comic whiz Kara Lindsay), and divorces Goffin. There’s much, much more to her story, of course, but how much can you fit into a two and a half hour musical?</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/09/20/beautiful-that-carole-king-bio-show-stays-good-to-go-and-see/\"><em>Read Michael Sommers’ </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Music-wise, the biggest thrill is hearing contrasting versions of songs you know and love. King and Goffin’s version of “Will You Love Me Tomorrow” is full of questions and insecurity; it’s tentative and slow. When it’s sung by the Shirelles (Gabrielle Elisabeth, Alex Hairston, Housso Semon, and Yasmeen Sulieman), it’s confident and hopeful. Goffin imbues “Up on the Roof” with pain and anguish; the hands of the Drifters (Sidney Dupont, Paris Nix, Nicholas Ryan, Dashaun Young), it becomes buoyant and cheerful. The switches between the writers’ and the pop stars’ renditions, thanks to director Marc Bruni, are quick and polished; and, even more important, the music, thanks to orchestrator/arranger Steve Sidwell, sounds dynamite—especially the “1650 Broadway Medley,” which blends and layers tunes including “Splish-Splash,” “Love Potion No. 9,” “Poison Ivy,” “There Goes My Baby,” “Yakety Yak,” and “Stupid Cupid.” The orchestrations are especially ebullient on “It Might As Well Rain Until September”—which the crowd definitely appreciated on a drizzly mid-September evening.</p>\n<p>You’re bound to recognize all these songs—and more—but please, for the sake of your fellow Carole King–loving audience members, don’t sing along. You’ll have your chance during the curtain call. Until then, there’s no need to sing along with Mueller, Lindsay, Jacoby, and Bouril on “You’ve Got a Friend.” And there’s <em>really</em> no need to sing along with Mueller on “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.” She’s already competing with Aretha Franklin. (And doing quite well with her own rendition, thank you very much.) She doesn’t need to compete with 1,000 off-key theatergoers as well.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Beautiful</em> opened Jan. 12, 2014, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre and runs through October 27, 2019.

Photo: Joan Marcus</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Recalling times in college during the early/middle 1970s—yeah, I’m vintage —it seems as if Carole King’s warm, jazzy, oh-so-sincere voice was always floating through the hallways of the dormitories. “I Feel the Earth Move” and “You’ve Got a Friend” are songs embedded in the soundtrack of my younger life, as no doubt they and other cuts from the <em>Tapestry</em> album echo across the memories of many members of the Boomer generation.</p>\n<p>Probably some people who buy tickets for <em>Beautiful: The Carole King Musical</em>, expect they’re going to hear plenty of <em>Tapestry</em>, but that’s not the case for this long-running bio-show, which is nearing its 2,000<sup>th</sup> performance on Broadway.</p>\n<p>The story for <em>Beautiful</em> mostly covers King’s life before making that album, roughly from 1958 to 1970, when she was not yet known as a singer but flourished primarily as a songwriter.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/09/20/beautiful-some-kind-of-wonderful-show/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>And what a bunch of terrific songs King crafted back then with Gerry Goffin, her lyricist and then-husband: “Will You Love Me Tomorrow,” “Take Good Care of My Baby,” and “One Fine Day,” to name just three of their classics that pop up in <em>Beautiful</em> and likely wing through your mind when you read these titles.</p>\n<p>More than two dozen amazingly catchy songs of yesteryear are heard throughout <em>Beautiful</em> as Douglas McGrath’s smart script nimbly relates how King, still in her teens, and Goffin, scarcely older, teamed up to turn out hits for The Drifters, The Shirelles, The Monkees, and other stars of their 1960s rock ‘n’ roll era. The musical also involves the couple’s chums and friendly rivals, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, makers of “On Broadway” and “We Gotta Get Out of This Place,” whose chart-busters also contribute to the show’s song stack.</p>\n<p>The rocky romance that sparks between Mann and Weil serves as a humorous counterpoint to King’s increasingly troubled marriage to Goffin, who suffers creative angst and starts cheating. They break up eventually, but during the process, King realizes her gift as a performer and achieves a fresh level of creativity as a solo songwriter. What makes <em>Beautiful</em> so, well, beautiful is watching King evolve from a dowdy, insecure teenager into a confident, mature artist.</p>\n<p>Director Marc Bruni, choreographer Josh Prince, and McGrath put together a fluent series of brief scenes interspersed by flat-out numbers that recreate the synchronized moves and harmonies of groups like The Drifters. Steve Sidwell’s orchestrations and arrangements are key to producing the show’s swift dynamics and nostalgic sounds.</p>\n<p>Electrified by Peter Kaczorowski’s sharp lighting, the visuals look bright. Framed by a multi-colored portal that slyly evokes a jukebox, designer Derek McLane’s two-level evocation of a Brill Building-type music factory disappears into numerous other locations. Alejo Vietti’s nifty Sixties wardrobe packs quick-change surprises: King and Goffin show their babysitter their latest song and, bam, instantly she’s Little Eva gyrating to “The Locomotion.”</p>\n<p>Although <em>Beautiful</em> is just a few months short of its fifth birthday at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre, the show looks fresh in performance, thanks to a versatile, highly energetic ensemble who briskly backstops the personable lead players. All wide eyes and warm, King-like vocals, Abby Mueller soulfully portrays Carole King as a nice girl who stays nice in spite of her troubles. Evan Todd handsomely fills out Gerry Goffin’s Brooklyn-accented personality as well as his jeans. Kara Lindsay’s sparkling Cynthia Weil shares a live-wire connection with Ben Jacoby’s adorable Barry Mann. Curt Bouril cuts an elegant figure as producer Don Kirshner. Liz Larsen nabs every laugh possible, and then some, from her brief role as King’s told-you-so mama.</p>\n<p>Let’s note that, due to a scheduling fluke, I recently caught <em>Beautiful</em> at different performances a few weeks apart. One of them saw an understudy, Sara Sheperd, confidently deliver a vivacious impression of King opposite Adam Dietlein’s edgy Goffin; they were fine and so was the smooth show around them, confirming that the production is being keenly maintained by the management.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Sondheim Theatre is essentially a modern, 1,055-seat facility that incorporates a landmarked façade and a few decorative elements from the Henry Miller’s Theatre that was formerly on that site. Opened in 2010, the theater offers very comfortable seating, expansive bathrooms, and good sightlines. Boomers who may not be quite as mobile as they once were will appreciate this venue as much as they will enjoy <em>Beautiful</em>.</p>\n<p><b>Beautiful: The Carole King Musical </b><strong>opened January 12, 2014, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre and runs through October 27, 2019.

Photo: Deen van Meer.&#8221; width=&#8221;1024&#8243; height=&#8221;638&#8243;&gt; The company in Disney&#8217;s Broadway musical <i>Aladdin</i>. Photo: Deen van Meer.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When Disney&#8217;s musical adaptation of its hit animated film <em>Aladdin</em> opened at the New Amsterdam Theatre back in March 2014, #MeToo was not yet a household hashtag, and &#8220;the wall&#8221; was a term most commonly used, at least by theatergoers, to indicate an imaginary rampart holding up our suspension of disbelief.</p>\n<p>Times have changed, as Reno Sweeney might have observed (though she couldn&#8217;t have foreseen the half of it), and while Broadway&#8217;s <em>Aladdin</em> is the same buoyant diversion it&#8217;s always been, certain elements may hold more resonance, particularly for the older audience members who make up a not insubstantial portion of the show’s fans.</p>\n<p>Indeed,<em> Aladdin</em> remains, with the possible exception of the visually breathtaking <em>The Lion King</em>, the most adult-friendly of Disney&#8217;s screen-to-stage confections, thanks in large part to the sharp but unabashedly goofy wit and whimsy of director/choreographer Casey Nicholaw and librettist Chad Beguelin, who also contributed lyrics to Alan Menken&#8217;s newer songs. The original tunes Menken crafted with Tim Rice and the late Howard Ashman—the rhapsodic “A Whole New World,” the heart-tugging “Proud of Your Boy,” the jazzy “Friend Like Me” (extended via Nicholaw into an elaborate, uproarious production number)—are still the most appealing, even if they don’t rival Menken and Ashman’s work on <em>Beauty and The Beast</em> and <em>The Little Mermaid</em>.</p>\n<p>But <em>Aladdin</em>’s score isn’t its strongest asset any more than <em>The Book of Mormon</em>’s (which Nicholaw also helmed, as co-director and choreographer) is its selling point. What makes <em>Aladdin</em> a more successful stage adaptation than either <em>Beast or Mermaid</em> is the clever but laid-back humor—rife with jokes and word play that defy demographic barriers, and with the accessible inside-theater references that are a Nicholaw hallmark—coursing through its gentle, unselfconscious critique of class and gender inequality.</p>\n<p>Racial and cultural tolerance are key here too; it’s not inconsequential that Nicholaw gave <em>West Side Story</em> an early nod in a latter-day musical that opens with the number “Arabian Nights.” But if the past two or three frenzied years have taught us anything, it’s that racism and classism work hand in hand, and we ignore the impact of the latter on our supposed meritocracy at our peril. Aladdin’s skin may be no darker than that of the palace guards who pursue him, but our young hero’s poverty surely informs his rapport with the enslaved Genie—played here, as he was in the original cast, by an African-American actor—and the tension that develops when Aladdin seems to reconsider his promise to set Genie free.</p>\n<p>If such dynamics will likely be lost on <em>Aladdin</em>’s youngest audience members, the heroine’s struggle for autonomy should escape no one’s notice. It’s become standard in recent decades for Disney princesses to pine for more than a handsome, well-positioned male rescuer—even if, with a few exceptions, their happy endings conveniently include the promise of marrying young and well. Princess Jasmine is a particularly likable and credible character, a loving daughter who simply doesn’t understand why her dad thinks she needs a guy to take care of her, and tells him so. And the ickiness of Jasmine’s suitors, from an arrogant prince demanding a completely acquiescent bride to the scheming Jafar—who essentially stalks her, if only to secure her father’s title—seems even more glaring, and creepier, in light of recent headlines.</p>\n<p>Jafar is still played, with delectable comic menace, by Jonathan Freeman, who originated the role on stage and screen, though other actors have, predictably, stepped into the younger principal roles. Musical theater veteran Telly Leung makes a surprisingly, fetchingly boyish Aladdin, with a tenor as bright and brassy as a polished lamp. Arielle Jacobs, the sister of the production’s original Aladdin, Adam Jacobs, is appropriately direct and wholesomely alluring as Jasmine; Leung’s youthful eagerness underscores her heroine’s maturity, and the flecks of irony in her lines.</p>\n<p>As Genie, Major Attaway wisely traces the footsteps left by James Monroe Iglehart, who duly earned a Tony Award for his breathless, fearless, entirely original take on a part introduced on screen by no less iconic a force than the late Robin Williams (or Williams’ voice, at least). Granted, Attaway seemed slightly more winded than Iglehart had, to my recollection, after leading the eight-minute aerobic routine “Friend Like Me.” But overreaching is part of the point, here and in the several other glittering, gleefully extravagant company showcases Nicholaw and his design team bring to a story that assures us material riches matter less than honesty, courage and, of course, love.</p>\n<p>That message is not contradictory, as heart, and humor, are what sustain <em>Aladdin</em>, all that scrumptious eye candy provided by renowned scenic designer Bob Crowley and costumer Gregg Barnes notwithstanding. More than four years after opening night, the musical is still a balm and a tonic—with perhaps a bit more punch nowadays.</p>\n<p><b>Aladdin </b><strong>opened March 20, 2014, at the New Amsterdam Theatre. Reviewed: September, 2018. </strong><strong>Tickets and information: <a href=\"https://www.aladdinthemusical.com/\">aladdinthemusical.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>The Lion King</em> was altogether awe-inspiring when it first stormed the Broadway savanna in 1997. The second of nine Disney-produced musicals to reach town (thus far), it stunned initial audiences who went in expecting a mundane, play-it-safe movie adaptation along the lines of the then-reigning <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>.</p>\n<p>But no! Disney went out on a limb and hired a team of visionary artists—none of whom had much in the way of Broadway experience—and let them run riot. <em>The Lion King</em>—which competed directly with <em>Ragtime</em>, across the street, along with a crop of lousy musicals that season (<em>The Scarlet Pimpernel</em>, anyone?)—was astonishing, in the jaw-dropping manner of speaking.</p>\n<p>And today, 21 years later, it still is.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/09/17/the-lion-king-another-ride-on-the-circle-of-life/\">[<em>Read Jesse Oxfeld&#8217;s&nbsp;</em>★★★<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>The show famously begins with “Circle of Life,” a grand parade of a number which summons a zoo-full of animals—mostly actors in body-puppets—from all corners of the auditorium and culminates in a breathtaking stage picture against a full-stage, tissue-paper-like hot African sun. A production number unlike any other, before or since. A good deal of the magic of <em>The Lion King</em> comes from the ability of director Julie Taymor and her team to provide—over the course of the evening—another five or six moments of this caliber.</p>\n<p>Taymor, the avant-garde director to whom Disney entrusted the piece, outdid herself. She was well met by her colleagues: Set designer Richard Hudson, lighting designer Donald Holder and choreographer Garth Fagan. Taymor herself designed the costumes, and collaborated on the masks and puppets with Michael Curry. True, her subsequent Broadway adventures—<em>The Green Bird</em>, <em>M. Butterfly</em> and the decidedly non-magical <em>Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark</em>—have been less than auspicious. But one <em>Lion King</em> is magic enough for anyone.</p>\n<p>Everything still looks wonderful, and looks practically brand new, too. One of the stunning elements for me, this time through, was the realization of how brilliantly this show moves. Scenery, lights, costumes, puppets and dancers are constantly in motion, and the stage pictures remain vibrant. The score is strong at places and functional at others; while Elton John and Tim Rice receive top billing, a scouring of the program will uncover ten credited songwriters, which explains why the score is not of one piece. The book by Roger Allers and Irene Mecchi remains functional; most of the audience—which nowadays includes a large foreign contingent—walk in knowing the film inside out, anyway.</p>\n<p>Presently playing the show is the umpteenth replacement cast. The principals are highly proficient, with Ramon Reed (Young Simba), Adrienne Walker (Nala), Tshidi Manye (Rafiki), and Fred Berman (Timon) standing out. The hard-working ensemble is well-drilled and exceptional.</p>\n<p>Astonishing in 1997, and—yes—just as astonishing today. <em>The Lion King</em> took six Tony Awards when it opened, for Best Musical, director, scenery, costumes, lighting and choreography. Let it be said that if it opened this season or in most any of the intervening 20 seasons, Taymor and company would likely be honored again and again.</p>\n<p><strong>The Lion King&nbsp;opened November 13, 1997, at the New Amsterdam Theatre and is now playing at the Minskoff Theatre.

Photo by Brinkhoff-Moegenburg</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All all this time—two decades, nearly 9,000 performances, a move from the gorgeously renovated New Amsterdam to the multiplex-like Minskoff, even after all those parodies—it’s Julie Taymor’s puppetry that continues to astound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, sure, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lion King</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which first opened in November of 1997 and continues to sell out nearly every seat, still warms children’s hearts. There are the well known Elton John-Tim Rice songs, the vaudevillian shtick, the usual Disney messages of destiny and fearlessness and fatherless sons and happy animals frolicking together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what makes the show stand out are those puppets.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/09/17/the-lion-king-disneys-pride-still-rules-the-savanna/\">[<em>Read Steven Suskin&#8217;s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taymor, the inventive director best known for her biggest flop, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, was given the challenging task back in the Clinton administration of turning a beloved (and money-minting) Disney movie about dynastic succession among regal lions and their happy Saharan subjects into a live-action musical. It would seem to be something of a challenge: Anthropomorphized animals are easy in animation, but less so on stage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taymor’s solution was the puppets. To portray those animals, her human actors wear extravagant costumes, manipulate intricate puppets, and sometimes do both. Taymor designed those costumes, she co-designed the masks and puppets along with Michael Curry, and she worked with choreographer Garth Fagan. The approach they conceived is frequently stunning, like in the famous opening number, when all the animals of the jungle dance in celebration of the circle of life and a new royal birth, and in several other numbers throughout the show.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lion King</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the coming-of-age story of young Simba, presented in the first scene as the newborn son of legendary Lion King Mufasa, a presumably worthy heir to the throne. But Simba is manipulated by his evil uncle, Scar, and when Mufasa dies after saving his son from a stampede—that stampede, mind you, is another Taymor triumph—Scar convinces Simba it’s the youngsters fault, and that the only solution is to run. Scar serves as king, the kingdom nears collapse—funny what happens when an evil con man somehow takes charge of a once happy and prosperous land—and eventually Simba returns to take up his birthright.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem is that the rest of the musical is not as good as Taymor’s vision for the animals and their gorgeous ensemble numbers. I somehow missed </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lion King</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when it first opened, and in the ten years since I’ve become a professional theatergoer it’s been the one show running on Broadway that I’d never seen. But for all those years, I’d heard how beautiful it is, and I’d seen so many lush clips.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the beauty is there, but the show feels a bit worn. Knowing what to expect, those bracingly chanted Zulu lyrics that open the show aren’t so terribly bracing. Some of the sets seem unimpressive. The plain-Jane Minskoff proscenium offers no help. The few big numbers aside, much of the John-Rice score is middling ’90s pop rock. (There is additional music and lyrics, some from the movie and some original to the stage show, credited to Lebo M. Mark Mancina, Jay Rifkin, Julie Taymor, and Hans Zimmer. This material introduces some African beats—accentuateed by in some cases by Masai-ish dancing—that’s far more compelling than much of the rest of the score.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audience rarely stops its barely </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sotto voce</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> conversation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In part, that’s because the book (by Roger Allers and Irene Mecchi) is weak, everything feeling expected and unaffecting. It’s only in the musical’s final scenes, when Simba wrestles with and finally reclaims his heritage, that the crowd quiets down and truly tunes in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, the performances, even now, are rather lovely. Kenneth Aikens, the Young Simba I saw, stands out with his puckish charm. So, too, does Bradley Gibson, strapping and full-voiced, as an excellent older version of the young lion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you’re not here for the performances. You’re here for the puppets. And they’re worth it.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The Lion King opened November 13, 1997, at the New Amsterdam Theatre and is now playing at the Minskoff Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Long ago, children, when I was an editor of <em>Theatre Crafts Magazine</em>, I interviewed the technical crew who were installing the massive scenery for <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em> at the Majestic Theatre. I recall one of them telling me, “We’re building this to handle eight performances a week for the next 20 years.”</p>\n<p>“Really,” I chuckled. “That sounds awfully optimistic.”</p>\n<p>So here we are, some 30 years later, and the show still is thrilling audiences at the Majestic. There are Broadway shows and Broadway shows—and then there is the incomparable <em>Phantom of the Opera</em>: Awesome in scale. Luscious with melody. And it’s kinda crazy, too.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/09/13/the-phantom-of-the-opera-the-music-of-the-night-plays-on-and-on/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Like a fevered pulse, a deep, dark current of madness throbs through the score, story, and visual wonders of this grandest of all current Broadway musicals. It is, after all, the 19th century tale of a mysterious musical madman who terrorizes the Paris Opera House as he promotes the career of Christine, an ingenuous songbird whom he adores. Tempestuous divas, skeptical producers, and even Raoul, the dashing Vicomte de Chagny who woos Christine, cannot thwart the Phantom’s inexorable will as he lords over and lurks around these opulent premises.</p>\n<p>The gas-lit footlights flare, looming shadows arise, and, high above everyone, the glittering chandelier ominously flickers and sways.</p>\n<p>Igniting and illuminating such melodramatic doings and furiously sweeping them along is the high-octane music composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber in his most inspired mode. Luxuriously orchestrated, these unabashedly plush songs and atmospheric underscoring align in a fine, quivering key with the ultra-heightened story and the spectacle that enfolds it. Perhaps the opera parodies that follow the amusingly florid <em>Hannibal</em> sequence are not as witty as they might be but, after all of these years, the intoxicating power of songs such as “The Music of the Night” and the thunderous title number remains irresistible.</p>\n<p>The tons of scenery and costumes designed by Maria Bjornson are as magnificent as anybody would ever wish them to be: Those dozens of candelabra eerily rising out of the mists of the Phantom’s underground lair. That imposing staircase and gorgeous get-ups for the swirling “Masquerade” sequence. Or the twisted grandeur of those entwined figures and faces that comprise the golden proscenium framing the action, every acre of it lit with spooky artistry by Andrew Bridge.</p>\n<p>Fusing all of these myriad elements together brilliantly is Harold Prince’s dramatic staging, which is gracefully supplemented by Gillian Lynne’s choreography. Sure, sophisticates may get the giggles over the show’s excesses, but no one can ever say that they’re not getting their money’s worth from this Broadway ticket.</p>\n<p>Dismayed by the relentless mediocrity of these new musicals lately manufactured from movies and animated features? Maybe it’s time to be mesmerized once more by <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>.</p>\n<p>A recent visit reveals that the production remains in tip-top performance shape, populated by actors whose faces recall Victorian-era daguerreotypes and whose voices do justice to Lloyd Webber’s romantic tunes. A tall and resonant Ben Crawford effortlessly cuts a commanding figure as the Phantom. Ali Ewoldt appears touchingly frail as the ever-endangered Christine even as her sweet voice and spirits prove resilient through every twist of the corkscrew plot. Looking like a cross between John Wilkes Booth and Edgar Allan Poe as Raoul, Jay Armstrong Johnson ably navigates his role’s heroic vocal and emotional demands. All imperious gestures and stares, Raquel Suarez Groen sharply portrays the unlucky prima donna whom the Phantom detests. Subsidiary roles are depicted with a strong sense of urgency by the ensemble even as the scenery smoothly unfolds its wonders and the music floods the theater.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, locals might snicker about the show being a tourist attraction these days, but the audience who saw a Thursday matinee with me were beautifully behaved. Never once did a phone ring or a camera flash during the performance. The ushers and security staff who I encountered were pleasant in their duties. I wish that every Broadway theater I attended were as well-managed as the Majestic, which remains an elegant residence for <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>.</p>\n<p><b>The Phantom of the Opera </b><strong>opened January 26, 1988, at the Majestic Theatre.

You’ll wave your hands for a while in front of the men’s room sink, before realizing you need to turn the knob. And then you’ll further realize: Of course, on both counts. Since January of 1988, the Majestic Theatre has been home to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Phantom of the Opera</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Every English-speaking theatergoer has seen it, and the Shuberts haven’t had to renovate its bathrooms in three decades.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phantom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the greatest warhorse on the Great White Way. Twelve thousand-plus performances, 18 million tickets sold, over a billion dollars in box office. (That’s just in New York.) When I last saw it, in October 1988, I was 12 years old and it was the hottest ticket on Broadway. (I’d played the main theme earlier that year in the spring piano recital; the next spring, the acquisition of those tickets would make its way into one of my bar mitzvah speeches.) I went to the Majestic last week, an adult Jewish man for nearly three decades, to find out what it’s like all these years, and millions, later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It turns out: Kind of a blast.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/09/13/the-phantom-of-the-opera-still-wonderfully-crazy-after-all-these-years/\"><em>Read Michael Sommers’&nbsp;</em>★★★★★<em>&nbsp;review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phantom of the Opera</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is so very much a product of its time. It is echt late-Reagan Broadway British invasion, full of rococo set pieces, heavy synths, all those classic Andrew Lloyd Webber swelling strings. It opens, famously, on its framing-device auction scene, when the aged aristocrat Raoul, in a wheelchair and attended by a nurse, is bidding on memorabilia from a now-defunct company at the Paris Opera House. There are some tchtochkes, a music box, and then, revealed from under a tarp, the grand chandelier that, the auctioneer reminds us, once fell from the ceiling. (Perhaps you recall the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scandale</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?) The overtures kicks in—</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DUHN, duhn duhn duhn duhn</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—the chandelier lights up, and herkily, jerkily, it lifts itself up to its rightful home at the top of the auditorium. It’s all very Disney-animatronic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then we’re back a few decades earlier, at a rehearsal for a new opera, and the company is on stage, singing “Think of Me.” That’s when you realize—ah, yes, you know every word to this show.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But first, a plot refresher.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Paris Opera House, you see, is haunted by a man known as the Phantom. He’s a musical savant who lives in the labyrinths under the building and ventures out only in evening clothes. He has a congenitally deformed face, and so he takes his revenge on the world by demanding a private box, a salary, and a deciding vote in casting decisions. He has taken a shine to a chorus girl named Christine Daaé, and is giving her voice instruction so that she may become a prima donna. (The instruction is by all accounts quite successful, although when we witness his methodology it appears to involve only him yelling “sing, sing, sing for me!” while thrusting his arms angrily in her direction. We tried this technique later, at home, and I can report that I remain unable to sing.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trouble is that at the very moment the Phantom elevates Christine from the chorus, she catches the eye of the patron of the Opera’s new owners, a vicomte named Raoul. They fell for each other as children, wouldn’t you know, and have finally reconnected. And so we have a love triangle. The Phantom has a musicosexual fixation on Christine; Christine appreciates his help but not his advances; Raoul loves Christine; Christine loves Raoul. This can’t, and won’t, end well. It doesn’t, of course. In part having to do with an opera the Phantom composes and forces the company to produce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second act is less fun than the first, as, exposition established in Act One, the plot works through its machinations. (Eventually, I realized, I know every word up through “Masquerade,” the Act Two opener, at which he presents his new score. After that, it’s a lot of semi-indecipherable recitative about putting on the show, and also a lot of Christine angst, all leading to the inevitable.) But, all the years later, just about every part of the evening remains a delight. This was not built to be a tourist-spectacle show—or, at least, not built </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to be one—and it still plays as a Class A production. The sets are towering, the costumes lush, the orchestrations overwhelming (in a good way). By setting the show in the world of opera, there are perfectly good reasons for the over-the-top sets, overwrought performances. It is what today’s international tourists (and late-eighties New Yorkers) come to Broadway to see, and they get their money’s worth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innumerable actors have played these roles over the past 30 years, some more famous than others. The current crop is quite fine. Ali Ewoldt makes a sweet Christine, with a pretty, clear soprano. Ben Crawford is a commanding and confidently bellowing Phantom, even if the characterization never quite escapes the hamminess of its creator, Michael Crawford (to whom Ben does not appear to be related). Hal Prince’s direction remains both overwrought and sensitive, with some truly lovely moments, like when the Phantom first brings Christine into his world. The Europeans in the will-call line are thrilled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yet there is an unavoidable problem with a production that has hung on for three decades. As good as it is, it is stagnant. No one, I’m sure, is clamoring for a radical re-interpretation of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mousetrap</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But there is a noble tradition of reconfiguring, rethinking, and reinterpreting classic musicals for different actors, different ideas, different times. Last season’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Fair Lady</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, with its slightly but totally different ending, proved that point nicely. So did </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Color Purple</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, stripped to its essence a few seasons back. Keeping this 1988 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phantom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> running, even running well, does a disservice to the piece and its creators. I’m ready for a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;de-synthesizered </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phantom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A&nbsp;John Doyle <i>Phantom</i>. A new </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phantom.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money aside—likely an insurmountable caveat—I’d like to think Sir Andrew is, too.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Phantom of the Opera&nbsp;</b><strong>opened January 26, 1988, at the Majestic Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Theatergoers streaming into the new musical <em>Pretty Woman</em>, at the Nederlander, are understandably likely to do so with visions of Julia Roberts in their mind’s eye and the strains of the Roy Orbison pop hit—“Pretty woman, walkin’ down the street”—in their mind’s ear. While there are more than a few delights on display here, neither the visions of movie star magic nor the urge to hear <em>that song</em> are satisfactorily fulfilled. While a sizable portion of the audience is likely to enjoy the musicalized <em>Pretty Woman</em>, I’d wager that few are likely to walk away saying: <em>Gosh, it’s even better than the movie!</em></p>\n<p>And in that group I’d place the two librettists, the late Garry Marshall (who directed the 1990 film) and J.F. Lawton (who wrote the screenplay). They would no doubt assert that their musical is pretty nifty; but better than their iconic movie, the whoppingly successful romantic comedy which catapulted Roberts to stardom?</p>\n<p>The story follows the film, and closely; it seems like a good deal of dialogue is carried over verbatim, and that turns out to be wise. The plot is—at its base—smarmy, jerk of a billionaire (Andy Karl) picks up a down-and-way-out Hollywood hooker (Samantha Barks) and takes her to the Beverly Wilshire, where a fairy godmother of sorts (Eric Anderson) transforms her into Eliza Doolittle at the Embassy Ball. Thus we have a combo of Cinderella and Pygmalion—<em>My Fair Lady</em>, in Broadway musical terms—and everyone naturally lives happily ever after.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/08/16/pretty-woman-hit-romcom-musicalized-only-pretty-good/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Marshall and Lawton managed to do this magically well on the screen, and a good deal of the celluloid charm translates to the musical’s first half. Once Eliza—or, rather Vivian—is transformed at the first act finale (the song carries the not-so-subtle title of “You’re Beautiful”), the merriment all but ceases. Whether act two follows the film or not is impossible to know without calling up <em>Pretty Woman</em> on your favorite streaming outlet; but on stage, the latter half lacks the charm and fun of the first. This is not the first musical comedy in creation to self-deflate once the “bad” characters turn “good.”</p>\n<p>Said charm and fun comes, in great part, from the ministrations of director-choreographer Jerry Mitchell. Mitchell has given us numerous hits over the years, including the durable <em>Kinky Boots</em>. His work here, though, brings to mind both <em>Hairspray</em> and <em>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</em>, musicals in which it seemed like at least half the jokes were heightened by the canny staging. <em>Pretty Woman</em> is overstuffed with splendid sightgags and deliciously wry choreographic touches. What’s more, Mitchell knows how to work the actual scenery—here from <em>Hairspray</em>’s David Rockwell—into the fun.</p>\n<p>The producers have eschewed the old jukebox in favor of original songs by the new-to-theater team of Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance, who have been turning out pop hits for 40 years or so. The results are encouraging, at least until repetition sets in and inspiration is dulled by that second act. What is notable about the score is the professionalism; the songs are crafted for the stage in a manner not apparent in this season’s prior musicals. Time and again, a moderately pleasing song is buoyed as Mitchell brings on the dancers.</p>\n<p>This is not a bad way to proceed, mind you. But the pattern for hit romantic comedy transfers from screen to musical stage was set in 1968 by <em>Promises, Promises</em>, in which a top pop songwriting team (namely Burt Bacharach and Hal David) proved that they had something to add to the Broadway musical. Adams and Vallance aren’t nearly so successful; their score, at least, is solidly workable and by all means a classic compared to this week’s other new musical.</p>\n<p>Standing head and shoulders above all is Karl, in the role formerly essayed by—well, within moments the image of Richard Gere is altogether wiped out and unmissed. Karl is the personable fellow who quickly leapt from a chorus role (including a bit as a memorable UPS man) in <em>Legally Blonde</em> to the leading roles in <em>Rocky</em> and <em>Groundhog Day</em>. (Is Karl fated to appear, again and again and again, only in mediocre musical reboots of popular movies?). He gave appealing performances in these musicals, but with <em>Pretty Woman</em> moves past appealing to top-caliber musical comedy star.</p>\n<p>There’s no reason that a first-time-on-Broadway leading lady can’t prove a knockout. Not this time, though. Barks is proficient and skilled, and might prove highly capable. At most moments, though, she is overshadowed by memories of Ms. Roberts. I suppose that even audience members who have never seen the film will wonder why Barks isn’t quite enough of a compelling Cinderella.</p>\n<p>It is also unfortunate to have someone with unvarnished star quality come out near the end of the long opening number, open her mouth, and galvanize the house. Unfortunate, that is, when said performer turns out <em>not</em> to be the leading lady but merely her obligatory best friend. This is the one-named Orfeh, who has had this precise effect on audiences before. Anderson provides a good deal of magic as the hotel manager-with-a-heart-of-gold originally essayed by Hector Elizondo. As a musicalization device, the creators have chosen to lace this “character” throughout the evening in multiple guises, principally as a gutterside street peddler who serves as de facto narrator. Anderson pulls it off, but the “Happy Man” (as he is credited in the Playbill) has neither the flair nor fun of his alter ego.</p>\n<p>Let us also mention the contributions of Tommy Bracco as a most expressive elevator man—an idea one imagines was devised solely by director Mitchell. Watching Bracco is like watching a half-size version of Tommy Tune back in the days before he became Tommy Tune. Bracco picks up the show whenever given the chance, and it is unfortunate that the powers that be insist on using him as an anonymous chorus member whenever he’s not in his bellhop garb.</p>\n<p><em>Pretty Woman</em> on Broadway also serves to illustrate that age-old adage of wise producing: To wit, you will look mighty smart if you contrive to schedule your Broadway opening directly after something like <em>Gettin’ the Band Back Together</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Pretty Woman opened August 16, 2018, at the Nederlander Theatre. Tickets and information: <a href=\"http://prettywomanthemusical.com\">prettywomanthemusical.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo by Matthew Murray</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Thanks to the brand of producers, bookwriters, and songwriters mad to make Fort Knox-like money from coin-minting musicals, the latest addition has arrived in the unabating frenzy for turning every movie ever released into a tuner. It’s the 1990 <em>Pretty Woman</em> that made a star of Julia Roberts as she beamed her trillion-watt smile around the globe.</p>\n<p>Not to keep in suspense those begging to know how the transformation has turned out, here’s the skinny: What’s called, natch, <em>Pretty Woman</em>, at the Nederlander, is a solidly mediocre entertainment—its mediocrity making it look like much more in a season so far overloaded with barely speakable Broadway and off-Broadway competition.</p>\n<p>Successful film director Garry Marshall and collaborator J.F. Lawton, who co-wrote the oh-so-successful screenplay, have joined with chart-topping singer-songwriter Bryan Adams and longtime songwriting collaborator Jim Vallance to pluck the film’s Cinderella tale for stage dressing up, just as top business executive Edward Lewis (Andy Karl) plucks hooker Vivian Ward (Samantha Barks) from seamier Hollywood streets for dressing up as higher-class arm candy.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/08/16/pretty-woman-lady-liza-of-the-streets-goes-hollywood/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Because this is a Cinderella tale—unabashedly so (see somewhat further below)—the happily-ever-after outcome is never in doubt. It’s the getting there that must be constantly involving. The adapting parties here employ sufficiently modest guile following Vivian as she not entirely leaves her working-hard-for-the-money street pals behind—among them the tough but soft Kit de Luca (Orfeh)—to better herself under Edward’s tutelage. At the same time, she’s teaching him a thing or two about becoming the better person he’s been unconsciously hoping to be.</p>\n<p>In terms of plot stakes, this means that <em>Pretty Woman</em> is mostly a story of two people who, for different reasons, rarely kiss someone else on the mouth (while engaging in other activities) yet grow so fond of each other that when six days have elapsed they can rescind their mouth-kissing ban.</p>\n<p>That’s it, with only the merest setbacks to catch them off-guard for a minute or two. One snag is Edward’s devious lawyer, Philip Stuckey (the usually captivating Jason Danieley in a thankless role), who can’t, and won’t, understand his client’s sudden reluctance to go through with the sort of this-side-of-legal deals that have been their stock-in-trade. Stuckey insists on regarding Vivian as a girl of the streets, while Edward, bless his heart, is gradually coming to see her as a woman of the suites. The exact suite would be the Beverly Wiltshire layout in which he’s ensconced her.</p>\n<p>By the way, this <em>Pretty Woman</em> has a constantly gyrating narrator, Happy Man (Eric Anderson), who guides the audience through the events. (Did the movie have him? I don’t remember, but I doubt it.) Happy Man serves that purpose only when he hasn’t morphed into BW house manager Mr. Thompson, who initially looks down his nose at Vivian but eventually adjusts his scrutiny.</p>\n<p>How about the Adams-Vallance score? Carpentering their first Broadway effort, they two don’t quite burst on the scene. They peek through. The songs, where off rhymes proliferate like mosquitoes in summer, do remain serviceable. Not surprisingly, two pop ballads given Edward—“Freedom” and “You and I”—impress as items Adams himself could render Top 40 candidates. The ballads handed Barks are less so, perhaps for obvious reasons. FYI: The hit Roy Orbison-Bill Dees “Pretty Woman,” used in the movie, isn’t included here.</p>\n<p>At the singing, though, Barks and Karl are no slouches when they need to guarantee that things land. They convince appealingly as lovers-to-be-who-eventually-are. Orfeh, her own tornado of energy, and Anderson, his own barrel of molecular fusion, bring welcome life to the proceedings. And others, including Ezra Knight as the head of a troubled company, are fine in support.</p>\n<p>Jerry Mitchell directs and choreographs with expected acumen but doesn’t necessarily outdo the results for his previous productions. Certainly, he’s drawn on his show-biz best at rounding up top-drawer craftspersons to go about their own <em>Pretty Woman</em> dressing up. David Rockwell smartly offers the sleek and seamy sides of Tinseltown. Spectators are advised to watch closely a bus-stop bench.</p>\n<p>Gregg Barnes provides the costumes and has carefully eyeballed the film so that the purchases Vivian makes on her shopping sprees adequately replicate the originals, and to be sure, the sophisticatedly sexy red gown Roberts dons for her big night out with Richard Gere has been copied and handed over to Barks, who exhibits it extremely well. Lighting designers Philip S. Rosenberg and sound designer John Shivers conjure the sunny, noisy Hollywood milieu.</p>\n<p>There is one overarching aspect that emerges unmistakably in a show lifted from a movie relying on charm to detract from its basic credulity-stretch. It’s the <em>Pretty Woman</em> Cinderella spin. The property is also a George Bernard Shaw/<em>Pygmalion</em> clone, which is its own Cinderella tale, of course: clever but somehow arrested-development boy meets down-trodden girl, instructs her in the finer things like how to behave at a ball, then either marries or loses girl.</p>\n<p>It may be more than coincidence that <em>Pretty Woman </em>shows up only a few months after <em>My Fair Lady</em> has been revived. To some extent, they’re the same show. Isn’t “pretty woman” just another way to say “my fair lady”? Isn’t there a black-and-white Ascot sequence in <em>My Fair Lady</em> just as in <em>Pretty Woman </em>there’s a black-and-white (with a dash of blue) Polo charity event—with accompanying “Welcome to Our World” song? Giving credit where it’s due, the latter scene has to be a deliberately cunning homage to the former.</p>\n<p>Oh, well, on the Cinderella-o-meter, nowhere does <em>Pretty Woman</em> rise to <em>My Fair Lady</em> level, but perhaps it’s pretty fair enough as these things go.</p>\n<p><strong>Pretty Woman opened April 16, 2018, at the Nederlander Theatre: Ticket and information: <a href=\"http://prettywomanthemusical.com\">prettywomanthemusical.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a bold move, to kick off your feel-good musical with a number ridiculing its likely audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gettin’ the Band Back Together</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which opened tonight at the Belasco Theatre, does a remarkably good job of taking a collection of seeming missteps—a show stacked with stereotypes, platitudes, and plot contrivances—and, with happy acknowledgement of all those deficiencies, turning them into a genuinely enjoyable if perfectly inane night at the theater.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an original Broadway musical, as its Tony-winning producer, Ken Davenport, who also is also co-author of the book, takes the stage to point out in a pre-show introduction (that’s included in the script). And while that’s true in that it is neither a revival nor something derived from a pre-existing property, it is also true that this “original” in only that dictionary sense. It is, in fact, the most hackneyed, predictable story you could imagine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitch Papadopoulus is a onetime garage band player from Sayreville, N.J.—Exit 124, the show points out—who grew up, moved to New York, and got a finance job, lost it, and moved back home. He’s itching to get out, but, inevitably, he ends up getting comfortable, reuniting that band, helping out his old friends, and—spoiler alert—winning back the high-school girlfriend he never got over.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But here’s the thing about Jerseyans, and I say this as the alumnus of a childhood at Exit 145: They’re all in on the goof. They know what everyone thinks about Jersey, and they (mostly) think it too. A little bit as defense mechanism, and a little bit because they’re wised up, they’re the first to laugh at a good Jersey joke.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so that opening number, “Jersey,” featuring high hair and tricked-out cars, dancers carrying bags from the Mall at Short Hills, ought to be offensive but somehow isn’t. In fact, it’s a great distillation of what’s to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because everything that follows is sort of dumb and a more than a little confusing. Mom is either still mourning dad or else is a Mrs. Robinson in waiting—but she’s played by Marilu Henner! His best friend, Bart (Jay Klaitz), is a sad-sack stoner loser—but he’s also a hilarious character actor who steals nearly every scene. His nemesis, Tygen Billows (Brandon Williams), is a nonsense-speaking, highlighted-hair foreclosure king—who’s somehow both a mobbed-up menace and a trapped-in-high-school goofball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s so full of Jersey namechecks—conspicuous verisimilitude amid the consumption—that one starts to suspect paid product placement, and yet its 1990s Central Jerseyans call it Six Flags. (Trust me, Mr. Davenport: In that time and that place, it was </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">always</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Great Adventure.) (But, then, which one would today play to place the product?)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it’s also so committed to its goofiness, so good-natured and having so much fun, that it’s impossible not to enjoy yourself. The music (and lyrics, by Mark Allen in his Broadway debut) is generic rock, but—at least for Jerseyans—generic garage rock is always welcome. (Despite your best intentions, the refrain of the main theme, “Gettin’ the Band Back Together,” might well be stuck in your head days later.) Derek McLane’s crayon-illustration of a set is a perfect match for the show’s tone. John Rando’s direction is sloppily big-hearted. And the performers are all singing their hearts out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Henner is game and gamine, perhaps sometimes a bit out of place but still always radiating her Marilu Hennerness. Mitchell Jarvis is stolid and hardworking, if less than entirely charismatic, as Mitch. Klaitz is a goofy delight. Manu Narayn and Paul Whitty, as two other sad-sack friends, more dutiful than Klaitz’s Bart, sing their character numbers beautifully. And Kelli Barrett as Dani, the girl who got away, is the real deal: fierce, sexy, and intense. You wouldn’t want to leave her behind in Sayreville, either.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show is too long. It’s plot mechanics are creaky. Some of those character numbers should be cut, delightful as they are—darlings waiting to be killed. (Bart’s, which is hilarious, is also too dirty for a family show.) And yet it’s all just a really good time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what do I know? I’m from Jersey.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Gettin&#8217; the Band Back Together </strong><strong>opened August 13, 2018, at the Belasco Theatre and runs to September 16</strong><strong>.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>You’ve got to hand it to Ken Davenport. He is very, <em>very</em> enthusiastic about <em>Gettin’ the Band Back Together</em>. He’s the producer, he cowrote the book, and he’s essentially the musical’s opening act. He bounds up on stage to welcome the audience; explains that the show was “improvised…to life”; recalls his own days in a high school band, the Barely Manilows; asks who else had a band in high school; and so on. But first, he tells us about this unicorn-like thing that we’re about to see: “a totally original musical.” Pause for applause.</p>\n<p>Davenport—who’s done this preshow shtick every night since the start of previews (and apparently plans to continue)—isn’t incorrect. <em>Gettin’ the Band Back Together</em> is not based on a movie, like so many of last season’s new musicals, including the Best Musical and 10-time Tony winner, <em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/08/05/the-bands-visit-music-of-the-jasmine-scented-night/\">The Band’s Visit</a></em>; it’s not a jukebox show, like another just-opened tuner on 44th Street, <em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/07/26/head-over-heels-the-beat-goes-on/\">Head Over Heels</a></em>. But it is most definitely not “totally original.”</p>\n<p>An overwhelming feeling of déjà vu—or, to quote one of Mark Allen’s more insightful lyrics—“disappointment mixed with déjà vu”—underscores <em>Gettin’ the Band Back Together</em>. There’s something very <em>Wedding Singer</em> about it: the New Jersey setting; the waitress, Dani (Kelli Barrett, miscast in the best possible way as a woman pushing 40), who’s dating a dolt, Tygen Billows (Brandon Williams); the fact that the eponymous band actually ends up singing at a wedding. It’s a little <em>Full Monty</em>–esque: When the main character, Mitch (<em>Rock of Ages</em> alum Mitchell Jarvis), gets laid off, he rounds up his ragtag bunch of musically inclined old high school pals to rock their blue-collar town; both shows also feature a similar parade-of-no-talent-misfits audition scene. There’s also a <em>School of Rock</em> vibe: <em>GTBBT </em>culminates in a Battle of the Bands, where Mitch’s old group, Juggernaut, faces off against the aforementioned dolt, Tygen, and his unfortunately named band, Mouth Feel (plus: actors playing their own instruments!). Throw in a little <em>Rock of Ages</em> as well, thanks to the vaguely ’80s look—costume designer Emily Rebholz rounded up an impressive amount of acid-washed denim—and the supremely silly don’t-stop-believin’ plot.</p>\n<p>One thing all those shows had: good-to-great scores, whether original like <em>The Full Monty</em> (the songs, by <em>The Band’s Visit</em>’s David Yazbek, are gritty, witty, and totally underrated) or recycled like <em>Rock of Ages</em> (which was blessed with a slate of head-banging hits from Journey, Quiet Riot, Whitesnake, and more). <em>GTBBT</em>, regrettably, has one—the title song. Maybe two if you count the “Hava Nagila” rap, winningly performed by 16-year-old Sawyer Nunes as Juggernaut’s hashtag-dropping axman, Ricky Bling. (Not everyone can pull off a lyric like “Make a ruckus with your tuchis.”)</p>\n<p>Though a Mazel-Tov call and response might not be everyone’s cup of Manischewitz, <em>GTBBT</em>’s best moments are its most ridiculous. That means virtually anything involving Williams and his leather-skinned, leather-wearing aging rocker/real-estate kingpin Tygen, who gets mega laughs by taking his character <em>super</em> seriously. (He also does this thing with his pecs that should be listed under “special skills” on his résumé.)</p>\n<p>And the show’s worst moments are its most sincere—such as the will-they-or-won’t-they-OMG-of-course-they-will love story between ex–high school sweethearts Mitch and Dani. Mitch actually has to say the line “Tell me you don’t feel something.” And Dani is ticked off that Mitch traded his garage-band dreams for stockbroker stability all those years ago. “And then you left town,” she spits. “Like I’m sure you will again as soon as Wall Street calls.” She is aware that he went to New York City, not New Delhi, right? (Incidentally, the book is credited to Davenport and The Grundleshotz, a dozen actors/writers/improvisers; <em>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</em>’s Sarah Saltzberg supplied “additional material.”)</p>\n<p>But why spend so much time thinking about Dani—or any of the women in <em>GTBBT</em>? The creators certainly didn’t. They’re only there so the guys in Juggernaut have love interests: Dani is supposed to end up with Mitch—you <em>know</em> they’re meant to be because she buys him <em>Springsteen on Broadway</em> tickets on her out-of-work-waitress budget; drummer Sully (Paul Whitty), the cop, falls for a handcuff-carrying coworker, Roxanne (Tamika Lawrence); dermatologist/keyboardist Robbie (Manu Narayan) ditches his arranged marriage for vegan fro-yo queen Tawney Truebody (Becca Kötte); Ricky finds the girl of his social-media dreams in Dani’s pink-haired daughter, Billie (Noa Solorio); and bassist Bart (Jay Klaitz), a MILF-loving math teacher, gets tied up—literally—with Mitch’s mom (age-defying actress Marilu Henner).</p>\n<p>You can also find Henner passing out Rice Krispies Treats during intermission. Completely ridiculous! But who doesn’t love a gooey, crunchy marshmallow treat?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Gettin’ the Band Back Together</em> opened Aug. 13, 2018, at the Belasco Theatre and runs to September 16.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Broadway’s best musical of 2017 retains its mantle midway through 2018. <em>The Band’s Visit</em>, which picked up 10 Tony Awards in last season’s shindig, remains a superlative and altogether splendid entertainment. This honey-and-spice-on-the-breeze musical is one of a kind: An intimately small show which seems to be about nothing much until the music and the emotion suddenly swells hearts onstage and—most magically—in the audience as well.</p>\n<p>High among the myriad treasures of <em>The Band’s Visit</em> is the score, deceptively gentle but filled with yearning, by David Yazbek; and the unexpectedly vibrant performance of Katrina Lenk. Both elements—20 months after the pre-Broadway premiere at the Atlantic—continue to enchant and grow richer, even after repeated viewings.</p>\n<p>Yazbek is the composer/lyricist of <em>The Full Monty</em>, <em>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</em>, and <em>Women on the Verge</em>; three musicals with notable scores weighed down by weaknesses in book and production. With <em>The Band’s Visit</em>, Yazbek has found collaborators—librettist Itamar Moses and director David Cromer—who are creatively on the same page and the same level. Thus, a highly unusual musical that works exquisitely well despite, or because of, its eccentricities.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/08/05/the-bands-visit-sasson-gabay-joins-the-still-excellent-tony-winner/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>As for Lenk, it was clear back at the non-Tony eligible Atlantic that this was a Tony-caliber performance. It happens almost instantly: Dina, a café proprietor in the middle of the desert, is immersed in a drab and unfulfilling life. But from the moment she sings of her long-absent husband—and simultaneously decapitates a watermelon—it is clear that this is not some desert rose but a desert tigress. The inflamed passion of Lenk’s performance remains vibrant; this is easily one of the finest performances on Broadway just now. When she launches into Yazbek’s evocative paean to the romantic films of Oum Kalthoum and Omar Sharif, the whole houseful at the Barrymore might well find themselves floating on a jasmine wind with honey in their ears. (Fact check: a quick Internet search reveals that Kalthoum—sometimes referred to as the most famous Egyptian woman since Cleopatra—did not appear with Sharif in the 1961 <em>River of Love</em>, and seems to have made her final film in 1947, when Sharif was 17.)</p>\n<p>The occasion for this revisit is the replacement of the leading man; thus, you can expect a slew of new reviews tonight and tomorrow and I’ll be hornswaggled if they’re not as wildly enthusiastic as the reviews from the Broadway opening last November and the earlier set from the Atlantic. Stepping into the “Sergeant Pepper suit” of Tony Shalhoub is Sasson Gabay. Shalhoub has long been a unique actor; he won his own Tony for <em>The Band’s Visit</em> and might well take an Emmy in September for <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em>, which he had been filming simultaneously with his appearance in the musical.</p>\n<p>Sasson is something else again, a major Israeli star who—not coincidentally—created the role of the Egyptian bandleader Tewfiq in the musical’s source material, Elan Klirin’s 2007 film of the same title. It is safe to say that Sasson gives an equally expert performance. What is perhaps unexpected is that his presence adds a new flavor to the piece. In this musical about “hearts searching in the darkness,” among other things, the Tewfiq of Shalhoub seemed like an unlikely-but-possible match for Dina. Hence, a frisson of sex.</p>\n<p>The new Tewfiq is not so much older than Shalhoub, by the calendar; but onstage, he reads as old enough to be Dina’s father’s older brother. Thus, as Tefiq sings of fishing and Dina dreams of reeling him in, it is crystal clear that the match is impossible; she is looking for love in the wrong place. Which is why, to use Yazbek’s words, she is trapped by “these walls I build.” It is also immediately clear—even earlier on—that the lover she yearns for (“Is this my shiek? Is this my love song?”) is standing onstage a few feet behind Tewfiq. While Dina has wound up with trumpeter Haled (featured Tony winner Ari’el Stachel) for hundreds of performances now, we see that he is not merely a substitute for Tewfiq—as it seemed before—but the right man.</p>\n<p>The rest of the cast, led by the excellent Stachel, remains the same and remains equally compelling. Some of the performances, indeed, have grown with time. Much of the comedic coloring comes from the tongue-tied waiter Papi (Etai Benson) and the unemployed and unmotivated Itzik (John Cariani). Benson and Cariani, both, are giving warm and heartwarming performances which are now even more touching.</p>\n<p>George Abud, as the band’s violinist, has seemed to make a larger contribution with each visit. This is practically a non-speaking role, but Abud—clutching his violin case for life, with an unlit cigarette precariously dangling always from his lower lip—uses face and fiddle for expression, at times seeming almost Chaplinesque. Andrew Polk (who explains how “love starts on the downbeat”) and Kristen Sieh (as the unfulfilled wife of Itzik) both enchant, and on repeated viewings it becomes clear how much Rachel Prather adds to the mix as Papi’s wallflower on roller skates.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that none of this—including Yazbek’s magical music—would stand so well without bookwriter Moses and director Cromer. They’ve each now got a Tony on their shelf, which is praise enough. But the short report on the evening is: <em>The Band’s Visit</em> remains the best new musical on Broadway since <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em>.</p>\n<p>“Nothing’s as surprising as the taste of something strange,” Dina sings, “nothing is as beautiful as something that you don’t expect.” <em>The Band’s Visit</em> is surprising, strange, and unexpectedly most beautiful.</p>\n<p><strong>The Band’s Visit opened November 9, 2017, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. Tickets and information: <a href=\"http://thebandsvisitmusical.com\">thebandsvisitmusical.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo by Evan Zimmerman for Murphy/Made</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Because more and more Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway productions seemingly materialize every year, reviewers don’t often get opportunities to return to any show after it’s opened. This can be a shame when so many offerings continue to gain depth even if they’ve premiered to five-star-level response.</p>\n<p>What does get us back into theaters, often after a production has run for some time, is the obligation to review an important replacement. That’s the case with <em>The Band’s Visit</em>. At the Tony-winning, Drama Desk-winning, New York Drama Critics Circle-winning musical, Sasson Gabay has replaced 2018 Tony winner Tony Shalhoub as the conductor of a Egyptian police orchestra mistakenly arriving in the sleepy Israeli town of Bet Hatikva when the troupe is due to present a concert at the opening of an Arab center in larger Petah Tikva.</p>\n<p>Sasson—who starred in the film of the same name from which bookwriter Itamar Moses and songwriter David Yazbek have adapted the tuner—is, not surprisingly, effective in the Tewfik role. Less a romantic figure (one way the part can be interpreted), he sympathetically plays an older man whose stained family life daily nags at him, even as he steadfastly commands his seven musicians. For all intents, Gabay (billed as Gabai in the film credits) is repeating his award-winning performance.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/08/05/the-bands-visit-music-of-the-jasmine-scented-night/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Though his characterization differs from Shalhoub’s (why wouldn’t it?), it doesn’t alter to the least degree the perfect chamber musical that the<em> Band’s Visit</em> was when it bowed at the Atlantic Theater and then moved uptown to the Barrymore Theatre. It’s perfect in every department, as it almost completely reiterates the movie’s dialog verbatim. Yazbek has added his songs of course. In doing so, he’s produced a score at least a third of a continent distant from anything he’s done in, say, <em>The Full Monty</em> or <em>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</em>.</p>\n<p>He’s listened to Egyptian and Israeli music and deftly filtered what he’s absorbed through his Broadway sensibility and now has his melodies played by on-stage musicians and musicians housed behind a second-story scrim on Scott Pask’s evocative, shifting set. The instruments include an oud guitar and a darbouka (a bongo by another name) for authenticity.</p>\n<p>If there’s a song currently o Broadway more beautiful than “Jasmine Wind,” I don’t know about it, and the ballad is still being delivered by 2018 Tony-winning Katrina Lenk, sinuous and subtle as frustrated restaurateur Dina. The lyric begins “Umm Kulthum and Omar Sharif/ Come floating on the jasmine wind.” (For those who don’t know, Umm Kulthum is a famous Egyptian singer. I didn’t know who she is, but I do now. So does YouTube.)</p>\n<p>Yazbek has also written a clarinet solo introduced as the beginning of a concerto, supposedly by band member Simon (Alok Tewari, acting and playing with notable emotion). The theme is repeated several times, and Yazbek has embedded into it a musical phrase from “Jasmine Wind.” The crafty turn is just one example of the imagination flowing through the musical’s own enveloping jasmine wind.</p>\n<p>As the band spends an afternoon, evening, and night in the wrong place, they intermingle individually and together with the locals, affecting them and being affected by them. As the symbiosis accumulates, <em>The Band’s Visit </em>becomes increasingly moving.</p>\n<p>Though I can point at absolutely nothing that disturbs me about director David Cromer’s presentation, it does occur to me that in establishing the Bet Hatikva mental and physical torpor, the action moves at a deliberate pace that could have some spectators initially drumming their fingers. Understandable, but hardly a drawback in my view.</p>\n<p>Curiously, last season’s award-copping <em>Come From Away</em> is a cousin to <em>The Band’s Visit</em>. It also features a foreign contingent unexpectedly landing (this time literally) in the midst of an isolated community during a 9/11-related incident. It’s intriguing that the theme of blending differing, even unfriendly groups shows up in two acclaimed musicals at a time when—thanks to a governing federal administration—divisiveness is clogging the <em>zeitgeist</em>.</p>\n<p>There’s another eye-catching coincidence marking Broadway at the moment: Three enterprises have the word “band” in their title—<em>The Band’s Visit</em>, <em>Boys in the Band,</em> and <em>Gettin’ the Band Back Together.</em> Somehow this begs the declaration: The boys in the band are getting’ the band back together for the band’s visit.</p>\n<p>Moreover, <em>The Band’s Visit</em>, also like <em>Come From Away</em>, has no marquee names associated with it. OK, the titles are now marquee names, but in these dynamic-pricing days both entries give the lie to the belief that big names are necessary to obtain Great White Way success. Anyone who doubts it is advised to join these sell-out audiences—if tickets are available.</p>\n<p><strong>The Band’s Visit opened November 9, 2017, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. Tickets and information: <a href=\"http://thebandsvisitmusical.com\">thebandsvisitmusical.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Here’s the sad truth: If you’ve been walking around the house humming “Heaven Is a Place on Earth,” it’s probably because you heard it on a Progressive insurance commercial. Even I, a card-carrying Belinda Carlisle fan (and someone who has performed that song more than once at karaoke), will admit that her oeuvre—meaning, of course, the music of her ’80s all-female pop-punk band the Go-Go’s—wasn’t exactly ripe for the Broadway treatment.</p>\n<p>But the giddy, gleeful <em>Head Over Heels</em> isn’t a biomusical in the <em>Beautiful</em>/<em>Jersey Boys</em> vein. It’s more like <em>Mamma Mia!</em>—with songs plopped into a totally convoluted ready-made plot. From the mad-genius mind of Jeff Whitty (<em>Avenue Q</em>) and adapted by James Magruder (who penned the libretto for the Marivaux musical <em>Triumph of Love</em>, but let’s not hold that against him), <em>HOH</em> lifts its story from Sir Philip Sidney’s late-16th-century romp-in-the-forest romance <em>The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia</em>. (Fun fact: <em>The Arcadia</em> planted quite a few seeds for Shakespeare’s <em>As You Like It</em>, and the Bard even poked fun at Sidney in a couple of his plays.)</p>\n<p>In the land of Arcadia, there’s a king and queen, Basilius (Jeremy Kushnier) and Gynecia (Rachel York); plain princess Philoclea (Alexandra Socha) and hilariously vain princess Pamela (Bonnie Milligan, in a star-making performance); the king’s faithful viceroy Dametas (Tom Alan Robbins) and his daughter, Mopsa (Taylor Iman Jones), Pamela’s attendant; Musidorus (Andrew Durand), a shepherd and Philoclea’s true love; and the “non-binary plural” Oracle of Delphi, Pythio (<em>RuPaul’s Drag Race</em> breakout star Peppermint), who delivers some bad news to Basilius: “Arcadia could lose its famous beat.” Something about redistricting and impending chaos and mass extinction—the point is: Arcadia is all about the beat.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/07/26/head-over-heels-a-new-musical-with-plenty-of-surprises/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Speaking of beats: As soon as the curtain goes up, you’ll hear the unmistakable driving drum riff of “We Got the Beat,” one of the band&#8217;s first (and best) singles, here transformed into a rousing full-company production number packed with exhaustingly good choreography by Spencer Liff. (The “La Vie Bohème”–meets––“Big Spender”–meets–<em>The Last Supper</em> moment he creates is genius.) If that number doesn’t put a smile on your face, go grab a frosé from the lobby bar at intermission, because you need a boozy millennial-pink frozen beverage to relax your facial muscles.</p>\n<p><em>HOH</em> is a parade of cross-dressing, mistaken identities, and, above all, moments of profound silliness. Some work, such as a flock of sheep singing backup on “Mad About You” (“ma-ad about ewe”). And some, like a lion-slaying scene, don’t. (Granted, decapitating a fake lion for laughs is a tall order.) Musidorus disguising himself as an Amazon warrior woman pays off brilliantly: Wearing a bronzed armor-style bustier and thigh-high boots, he looks like a platinum-blonde version of Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman; of course the whole royal family falls for him. Designer Arianne Phillips knows how to make a woman—and a man dressed as a woman—look gorgeous (also see: 2014’s <em>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</em>). But I’m still puzzling out the point of staging “Heaven Is a Place on Earth” as a massive bonk-fest silhouetted behind a curtain.</p>\n<p>Anyway—back to the beat. During the (dancing) curtain call, you’ll notice a group of five fab women who’ve been keeping it tight all night: guitarists Ann Klein and Bess Rogers, bassist Catherine Popper, drummer Dena Tauriello, and keyboardist/conductor Kimberly Grigsby, Broadway’s most badass musical director. They’re doing the Go-Go’s—Carlisle, Charlotte Caffey, Gina Schock, Kathy Valentine, and Jane Wiedlin—proud. Fittingly, they’re wearing crowns.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Head Over Heels</em></strong><strong> opened July 26, 2018, at the Hudson Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>There are surprises galore on the stage of the Hudson Theatre, where <em>Head Over Heels</em> has landed following two West Coast tryouts. Surprises in tone: The source material is an Elizabethan comedy by one of the Bard’s lesser contemporaries, set to songs by an all-female 1980s rock group called The Go-Go’s. Surprises in gender, which are pretty much the point of the evening. Surprises in production, with director Michael Mayer and his team altogether littering the stage with jokes and gags and gimmicks which grow, like a snowball, until just about everything gets a laugh. The most surprising thing, perhaps, is that after all is said and done, this purposely low-brow, far-from-subtle propaganda statement for sexual equality turns out to be a wittily wicked romp.</p>\n<p>Not that there aren’t flaws in the evening; there are, and by the midpoint it seems like it’s just about time to throw in the towel. But what appears to be meandering is actually part of the subversive whole, as Mayer and crew—and an immensely likable cast—ratchet up the fun past expectations.</p>\n<p>The plot is taken from Sir Philip Sidney’s <em>Arcadia</em>, which it turns out was not a play but a work of prose. Sir Philip was true royalty; when he was 10, Uncle Bob—Robert Dudley, favorite suitor of Elizabeth I and a familiar face from all those Elizabeth vs. Mary plays—was named Earl of Leicester. Sir Philip published <em>Arcadia</em> in 1580 and was substantially through a vastly-expanded rewrite (<em>The New Arcadia</em>) when he died fighting Spain on the battlefield in 1586. The book was later finished by his sister Mary, published in 1593 as <em>The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia</em>. After half a century, busy playwright James Shirley dramatized it as <em>The Arcadia</em>, the comedy hit of 1640.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/07/26/head-over-heels-the-beat-goes-on/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>We have read neither <em>Arcadia</em>, <em>The New Arcadia</em>, sister Mary’s <em>Arcadia</em> or Shirley’s play, but we surmise that it includes a certain amount of cross-dressing. It is most likely, though, that the <em>Head Over Heels</em> character Pythio—described as “a non-binary plural, neither he nor she but they”—was not so conceived by Sir Philip, Countess Mary nor playwright Shirley. The musical itself has gone through a bit of turmoil, it seems, with Jeff Whitty of <em>Avenue Q</em> fame receiving “Conceived and Original Book by” credit but apparently pushed aside by James Magruder (from Mayer’s quickly-failed <em>Triumph of Love</em>), who receives “Adapted by” credit.</p>\n<p>All of which brings us back to the current century, where dramatological plotting and gender are somewhat more fluid. King Basilius (Jeremy Kushnier) of Arcadia and his roving Queen Gynecia (Rachel York) have two marriageable daughters, the overbearing and overflowing-her-gown Pamela (Bonnie Milligan) and timid heroine-in-hiding Philoclea (Alexandra Socha). Philoclea is in love with the shepherd boy Musidorus (Andrew Durand), while Pamela rifles through unsuitable suitors by the dozen. She is faithfully attended by Mopsa (Taylor Iman Jones), daughter of court official Dametas (Tom Alan Robbins), and it doesn’t take more than one-and-a-half songs to discern that princess and handmaiden are sure to find themselves head over heels together. In fact, we can instantly tell that these eight principals will be neatly wrapped into four blissful couples.</p>\n<p>If this sounds overly-contrived and ultimately obvious, that is part of director Mayer’s game as he weaves these familiar story strands into a contemporary comedy which—like all good stories—ultimately grabs our attention.</p>\n<p>Musically, alas, the evening is weak; highly energetic and often rambunctious but weak. The Go-Go’s (and yes, the punctuation is misguided but that’s what they call themselves) were, and are, a popular all-female new wave band out of Los Angeles. They have enough of a catalog to serve as the basis for a jukebox musical, and this is it. The music is mighty frisky, especially as gussied up by arranger/orchestrator Tom Kitt and led by musical director Kimberly Grigsby and her all-girl band. The lyrics, though, rarely match the plot and in any event are often indecipherable. At points, though, the songs do indeed match the exuberant spirit onstage. The basis of the plot is that in Arcadia “they got the beat!”; the plot crisis comes when the oracle prophesizes that they are in danger of losing the beat. <em>Head Over Heels</em> has the beat, all right, and a boisterous one; but it turns out to be pretty much the same beat, song after song after song after song.</p>\n<p>The cast is game. Kushnier (who as a lad led the cast of Broadway’s <em>Footloose</em>) and York (who has been slaying ’em since <em>City of Angels</em>) are the adults in the room. Milligan is droll as the oversized princess, and well-matched by Jones (<em>Groundhog Day</em>). The non-binary Pythio is portrayed by a new-to-us artist named Peppermint (known for <em>RuPaul’s Drag Race</em>) and makes a good impression, while Robbins (the original Pumba from <em>The Lion King</em>) provides numerous laughs. Socha, a fine Medium Alison in the Public’s original production of <em>Fun Home</em> and a spunky heroine in Encores’ <em>Paint Your Wagon</em>, is sweet and pert. The find of the evening, though, is Durand, who has previously been noticeable in supporting roles (<em>Yank!</em>, the recent <em>Robber Bridegroom</em>). It turns out that he is a rubber-face comedian who has a field day as the shepherd transformed into the Amazonian warrior (or is it warrioress?) who is lustily chased by most of the others.</p>\n<p>Star of the evening, though, is Mayer, who has previously brought us diverse fare ranging from <em>Thoroughly Modern Millie</em> to <em>Spring Awakening</em>. No gag is too small for him, and he is ably abetted by choreographer Spencer Liff (<em>Falsettos</em>). What’s more, Mayer arms set designer Julian Crouch (<em>The Addams Family</em>) and costume designer Ariane Phillips with a full barrage of ammunition causing frequent laughter; even some of the props get belly laughs. Mayer presents lighting wizard Kevin Adams (<em>Spring Awakening</em>, <em>SpongeBob,</em> et al.) with the same comic license, and some of the evening’s images—like the forest green glade set against a fuchsia sky—will likely stay with you as you hurtle out onto 44th Street.</p>\n<p><strong>Head over Heels opened July 26, 2018, at the Hudson Theatre. Tickets and information: <a href=\"https://headoverheelsthemusical.com/\">headoverheelsthemusical.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Joan Marcus</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Young Jean Lee is a smart playwright known in adventurous theater circles for her unorthodox works that explore issues relating to identity, race, and gender. Lee makes her Broadway debut with <em>Straight White Men</em>, which opened tonight in a Second Stage production at the Helen Hayes Theater.</p>\n<p>This contemporary play and its staging may be a trifle offbeat, but they are nothing that will freak out a traditionally-minded Broadway show-goer, who might well become rather bored by a lack of story and strong dramatic conflict.</p>\n<p>Set in a nice, if bland, family room of a house in the American Midwest, the situation involves three brothers in their 40s who are spending the Christmas holidays with Ed (Stephen Payne), their widowed dad. Jake (Josh Charles) is a banker and a divorced father of two kids. Drew (Armie Hammer) is a university professor and novelist who remains single. Also single is Matt (Paul Schneider), the eldest brother and a Harvard graduate crippled by college debt, who is more or less keeping house for his father while holding down a paltry temp job.</p>\n<p>The 90-minute play is structured in three scenes that occur over three days. The men cheerfully participate in some family holiday rituals—wearing Christmas Eve pajamas, eating Chinese take-out food, drinking eggnog punch, singing “O Tannenbaum,” and other similarly cozy traditions.</p>\n<p>They also briefly play a board game called “Privilege,” which is a Monopoly set that their late mother doctored way back when in order to caution her sons about the advantages they will enjoy unfairly as educated, prosperous white men in American society.</p>\n<p>Although at times the brothers engage in juvenile silliness and horseplay, they obviously are fond of each other and their father. It also becomes apparent that these straight white men, like their dad, are genuinely nice guys with decent socially conscious attitudes.</p>\n<p>Yet as they share the holiday, Jake and Drew become aware that Matt, rather a woebegone fellow, is troubled. After Matt unexpectedly cries into his moo shu pork, his brothers attempt to figure out what’s ailing him.</p>\n<p>Why is he behaving like such a loser? Could Matt be sabotaging himself due to his liberal white male guilt? Should he see a therapist? Might they pay off his college loans? Would it be better for Matt to try to forge a life of his own rather than take refuge in his father’s house?</p>\n<p>Matt’s existential issues ultimately fracture the family circle.</p>\n<p>A comedy of sorts modelled after conventional father and son dramas, complete with a couch and coffee table plunked in the middle of the room, <em>Straight White Men</em>, rather like poor Matt, does not live up to its potential. The playwright’s intriguing suggestion that these guys are actually too comfortable living within their supposedly woke consciousness may be too subtly expressed for some viewers to grasp. The conclusion seems abrupt and not especially satisfying.</p>\n<p>Since <em>Straight White Men</em> first appeared at the Public Theater in 2014—in a production that registered as even more enigmatic than this one—the playwright has crafted a frame to give it a sharper focus. Literally: Set designer Todd Rosenthal puts a wooden picture-type frame around the taupe-on-beige family room that makes it appear like a museum diorama. There is even an engraved title plate on the bottom of it.</p>\n<p>Lee also has added two characters, Person in Charge 1 (Kate Bornstein) and Person in Charge 2 (Ty Defoe), who act as docents for the play. Dressed in slightly eccentric costumes, they patrol the theater’s aisles even before the show begins, apologizing for the shrieking female rap music being blasted through the auditorium. They further make brief, rather jocular, introductory remarks as a sort of prologue in which they identify themselves as non-binary individuals and urge the audience to “try to find some understanding for straight white men.” They later pop up as silent supervisors during the intervals when stagehands reset the room between scenes.</p>\n<p>Inventing these characters is a clever way to give audiences a sense of distance to view the story and its people dispassionately. But they do not compensate for the underwritten play, which is neither sufficiently satirical nor revelatory enough to achieve any sense of catharsis.</p>\n<p>Anna D. Shapiro, a very good, accomplished director, cultivates natural, warm performances from her fine actors that make the play seem more humorous than it happens to be. It’s very easy to like these guys, so there’s something of a cross-purposes gap yawning between the play and its production. The message that the playwright probably intends to relate about people vainly struggling to live up to their privilege gets lost somewhere in the middle.</p>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Straight White Men </strong><strong>opened July 23, 2018, at the Helen Hayes Theater </strong><strong>and runs through September 9.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A couple months ago, comedian/Food Network personality Josh Denny sent the Twitterverse into a tizzy with this apparently sincere assertion: “‘Straight White Male’ has become this century’s N-Word. It’s used to offend and diminish the recipient based on assumption and bias. No difference in the usage.” Denny was undoubtedly being intentionally provocative, but he certainly stirred a pot that’s been simmering for the past couple of years. <em>The Spectator</em>’s Brendan O’Neill dubbed 2016 “the year of the ‘white men’ slur” (“The most dehumanizing insult of our times,” read the headline). And in 2017, <em>The Boston Globe</em> ran an opinion piece called “In Defense of the White Male.” (<em>The Boston Globe</em>. Not The Onion.)</p>\n<p>By all accounts, this is the worst time in history to be a straight white man. So it’s probably the perfect time for Second Stage to bring Young Jean Lee’s <em>Straight White Men</em> to Broadway.</p>\n<p>But don’t expect Lee to jump on the hate train. What the Korean-American writer—the first Asian-American female playwright produced on Broadway—is doing, explains Person in Charge 2 (Ty Defoe), is “something a little tricky”; she’s trying to “find some understanding for straight white men.” (Whether we need that explained to us is altogether debatable.)</p>\n<p>Before you get to the title characters—father Ed (Stephen Payne) and his sons, Jake (a viciously funny Josh Charles), Drew (Hollywood heartthrob Armie Hammer, matching Charles punch for punch, sometimes literally), and Matt (Paul Schneider)—you’ll meet Person in Charge 1 and 2: They’re played, respectively, by Kate Bornstein and Defoe—neither of whom is a straight white man. “My gender identity,&#8221; says Defoe in the first scene, &#8220;is <em>Niizhi Manitouwug</em>, which means ‘transcending gender’ in the Ojibwe language.” As for Bornstein, a self-described “Jew from the Jersey shore”: “I’m what’s called ‘non-binary,’ which means ‘not man/not woman’ in the English language.”</p>\n<p>Bornstein and Defoe—whose roles are new since the 2014 Public Theater production—serve as the play’s affable hosts/Greek chorus/guides; they’re there to welcome you (“This theater we’re all sitting in is built on the land of my people,” says Defoe, who’s from the Oneida and Ojibwe nations. “So welcome.”), and to acknowledge that the preshow music—explicit rap, played at what some might call an eardrum-splitting level—might have made some audience members uncomfortable. (Personally I’d pay extra to download the preshow playlist, populated entirely by female hip-hop artists. But Lil’ Mama and Junglepussy is probably not to everyone’s taste.)</p>\n<p>They also help set the scene by bringing the actors literally into the frame—the proscenium is cleverly outlined by a gilded museum-style picture frame—and putting them into position. The whole thing has a clever, ever-so-creepy diorama effect—like we’re watching the actors in a museum, or at Epcot Center. It’s also a double-edged sword: Looking at them as if they’re merely figures on display to be studied lends an oddly thrilling anthropological angle to the production; it also, unfortunately, keeps us at arm’s length, never affording any emotional investment in the characters.</p>\n<p>Granted, a playwright can go only so deep in 90 minutes, but Lee can go deeper than most; this is a woman who brought Big Bird into her 2010 Shakespeare–meets–Sesame Street mash-up, <em>Lear</em>. So while the play incorporates plenty of standard men-behaving-badly shtick—think video games, slap fights, childish nicknames, ridiculously bad dancing (Hammer’s moonwalk pretty much brings down the house), and the absolute whitest version of Run DMC’s “Peter Piper” you’ll ever hear (hats off to Charles and Hammer, who could really pass for brothers)—these white men aren’t exactly standard. They grew up playing Privilege, their mom’s homemade woke version of Monopoly that involved moves like “get stopped by the police for no reason and go directly to jail.” Eldest brother Matt once started an “awesomely Stalinist” School for Young Revolutionaries. And now that he’s a Harvard-educated temp worker who lives at home with dad, it puzzles and frustrates the heck out of professor/author Drew and banker Jake, especially after Matt breaks down in tears over pot stickers. Everyone wants to fix Matt, and everyone has a theory—he needs therapy, he’s worried about his student loans, he’s fighting the system by sacrificing his own place at the top—except Matt. The playwright doesn’t even seem to have a theory, which might puzzle and frustrate viewers as well. <em>Straight White Men</em> is Lee’s most naturalistic play to date; it’s also her least plot-driven.</p>\n<p>You’ll remember that our mission, as explained by the Persons in Charge, was to “try to find some understanding for straight white men.” Understanding turns out to be in short supply. But Lee’s perspective—wry, unflinching, and altogether unique—is an unexpected privilege.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Straight White Men</em></strong><strong> opened July 23, 2018, at the Helen Hayes Theater and runs through Sept. 9.

Photo: Joan Marcus</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>The Boys in the Band</em> invites you to attend a birthday party from the gay hell of 50 years ago, when the love that dared not speak its name really was a hush-hush affair. Mart Crowley composed his dramatic comedy in the years shortly before the Stonewall uprising, and his play sharply reflects the manners and morals of upper middle class gay male existence as it was gingerly lived in New York City back then.</p>\n<p>A long-running Off Broadway sensation in 1968 and then a controversial film (featuring its original stage actors) in 1970, <em>The Boys in the Band</em> eventually was dismissed, in the bright light of latter-day social change, as a rather shady depiction of gay men. Thanks to its excellent new Broadway production, which bowed tonight at the Booth Theatre, <em>The Boys in the Band</em> is revealed to be a trenchant period drama that dazzles contemporary viewers with a barrage of explosive laughs even as its smart staging respects the thorny past.</p>\n<p>Crowley sets his story one night in a snazzy apartment, where Michael (Jim Parsons), a 30-something writer, throws an intimate birthday bash for his best frenemy Harold (Zachary Quinto). Unexpectedly dropping into this flamboyant assembly of representative gay gents is Alan (Brian Hutchison), Michael’s presumably heterosexual friend from college days. Appalled to find himself amid such queer company, the distraught Alan inexplicably sticks around to become ensnared in a drunken truth-telling game during which most of the men own up to the deepest loves of their lives.</p>\n<p>In terms of dramaturgy, rather than social significance and content, <em>The Boys in the Band</em> is a slickly-written piece of boulevard-type drama that is distinguished by the playwright’s adroit ability to create distinct characterizations of people; to say nothing of his expertise in lobbing corrosive wisecracks and crafting wickedly amusing exchanges. It is fiercely funny. Let’s also note that Crowley’s wonderfully actable dialogue can be rude in spots but it is never crude, with nary an f-bomb in it. As a frank, even fearless, time capsule of gay urban life from half a century ago, the work has acquired a certain gravitas today that poignantly underscores its remarkably entertaining qualities.</p>\n<p>Joe Mantello, one of the top directors around, delivers quite a seductive production. The playwright has trimmed some needless frou-frou from his text and eliminated the intermission, so that the show runs about 110 minutes. Mantello initially paces these proceedings quickly as the different guests arrive and then strategically modulates the tempo as the story’s dramatics flare up and wane. All the while, Hugh Vanstone’s lighting skillfully suggests the passage of time even as it gradually develops a boozy atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Employing openly gay actors for this production pays off in several ways. First, as the show opens on the eve of Gay Pride month, it publically illustrates how significantly our social mores have evolved since the play’s original day. Secondly and more essentially, these actors appear natural in their characterizations while their body language is exceptionally expressive.  It is interesting to note how the reddish-colored velour that dominates designer David Zinn’s glossy, Sixties-chic, bi-level setting varies in many shades ranging from lavender to mauve to magenta, depending upon the lighting. So, too, do the play’s individuals represent different sorts of gay men.</p>\n<p>Under Mantello’s astute guidance, a terrific ensemble sweeps the audience along on the story’s increasingly emotional roller-coaster ride as ribald laughter gives way to tears.</p>\n<p>A slight Southern drawl betraying the character’s provincial roots, Jim Parsons’ testy nature as Michael suggests that he’s not as sophisticated as he strains to be. So when the party he anxiously hosts goes off the rails, it seems instinctive for Michael to resort to swilling liquor, which brings out his uglier side. As Michael’s supportive buddy Donald, Matt Bomer tends to fade in the glare of flashier personalities, but he lends the character a watchful quality as one of those deferential souls who is content to observe others. Zachary Quinto, sporting mod duds and a formidable cool as Harold, the b-day boy, gives every deliberate word he slowly utters a sardonic edge that cuts deeply. Brian Hutchison’s uninvited Alan looks woefully (and appropriately) out of his square element.</p>\n<p>Lounging about in tight white jeans, Andrew Rannells is every inch a pretty boy on the constant prowl who obviously chafes at his bonds to a tautly buttoned-down lover firmly depicted by Tuc Watkins. Michael Benjamin Washington’s mild-mannered African-American character endures racist ribbing in an effort to be included as simply one of the boys. Charlie Carver sweetly hangs out as the dumb bunny gift-wrapped for Harold&#8217;s delectation. Wearing be-flowered shorts and leopard-print loafers as Emory, the fey interior decorator whose bold demeanor freaks Alan into a rage, Robin de Jesus speaks in a gritty outer borough accent that indicates he can fearlessly take care of himself. Not incidentally, the period clothes designed by David Zinn offer visual clues to these assorted individuals.</p>\n<p>Whether they are camping it up to “Heat Wave” or wallowing down in the depths of self-loathing, the members of Mart Crowley’s <em>Band</em> embody the damaged offspring of a repressive era that has passed, hopefully never to return. And, as troubled as they may be, these boys offer splendid company on Broadway.</p>\n<p><strong>The Boys in the Band opened May 31, 2018, at the Booth Theatre and runs through August 11.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Even the games they <em>don’t</em> play sound awful. Michael, the first character we meet, is hosting a shindig that’s going rapidly off the rails, and he has decided it’s time for a party game. The Truth Game and Murder are the ominously titled options suggested and rejected, and, in his and his guests’ lubricated states, neither seems likely to have gone well.</p>\n<p>But our host wants to play something else. It’s a new game he’s just ginned up—and he’s well on his way through a fifth of the stuff—that he calls Affairs of the Heart. There’s a complicated scoring system, but the main rule of it is this: Each man in his sunken living room must telephone the one person he has truly loved and confess his feelings. It’s emotional abuse, with points.</p>\n<p>This game is the central action of <em>The Boys in the Band</em>, newly and extravagantly revived at the Booth Theatre on its 50th anniversatry. It’s playwright Mart Crowley’s device for getting under the skin of the group of bitchy, quippy gay men gathered at Michael’s. It also, as ever, makes no sense. <em>Boys</em> is a milestone play in the history of gay theater, a fascinating and lacerating just-pre-Stonewall take on a <em>demimondial</em> gay Manhattan that’s essentially alien to the well-employed, well-partnered, post-Obergefelled couples currently snapping pre-curtain Playbill selfies. The play remains compelling viewing, for its wit and its pathos and especially as a slice of historical anthropology. But there’s just no good reason, and there’s never been a good reason, why the miserable men in Michael’s living room don’t simply get up and leave. It’s the unavoidable flaw in this unavoidable work.</p>\n<p>Director Joe Mantello—Louis in the original <em>Angels in America,</em> to interweave the iconic gay plays currently in revival—hasn’t solved that problem. (For the movie version, William Friedkin had the good sense to add a torrential rainstorm to keep them indoors.) But he’s otherwise given us as fine a version of <em>Boys</em> as we’re likely to get, one that deeply underlines it&#8217;s characters self-hatred even while reveling in their campy repartee—and one that remains very much a portrait of its time.</p>\n<p>This production is also, quite conspicuously, a portrait of how times have changed. For its initial production, off Broadway in 1968, and for the movie, released in 1970, being involved with such a notoriously gay property was through to be a career killer. Today, its producers include high-powered gay men like <em>Wicked </em>maestro David Stone, Broadway-Hollywood kingpin Scott Rudin, and TV auteur Ryan Murphy; it’s directed by another one, Mantello; and it features an out-and-proud cast of uncommon star wattage. That, perhaps more than anything on stage, is a measure of how much times have changed.</p>\n<p>But what’s on stage makes that point, too.</p>\n<p>The usually affable and ingratiating Jim Parsons stars as Michael, the host of the birthday party and a man whose self-hatred, manifested in spending money he doesn’t have, is driven by both alcoholism and Catholicism. (By the end of the night, he’ll head out for a late Mass at St. Malachy’s.) Parsons typically plays a good guy, and here he uses that veneer to give those claws that eventually come out even more malign sharpness.</p>\n<p>The party is for Harold, the self-described “thirty-two-year-old, ugly, pockmarked Jew fairy,” and Zachary Quinto plays this iconic role with relish. If Parsons is playing a menacing version of himself—and if Andrew Rannells, as the happily partnered and happily promiscuous Larry, is playing yet another version of the same role he always does—Quinto transforms into Billy Eichner with a cold and a Quaalude. Harold has many of the plays most famous lines — “I am turning on, and you are just turning,” he tells Michael and the host sharpens his talons — and also the group’s most obvious self-hatred. Quinto plays them masterfully, sinking into the character’s caricature but showing that the character is choosing to present himself that way.</p>\n<p>The other friends at the boozy birthday include Douglas (Matt Bomer, spending more time than strictly necessary standing around in his briefs, and, on the evidence, well-entitled to do so), who can’t take too much of the city and commutes in from the Hamptons on Saturdays for analysis and parties; Hank (Tuc Watkins), Larry’s aspiring-to-monogamy partner, who is straight-presenting and recently separated from his wife; Emory (Robin de Jesús), a Latino interior decorator and the most stereotypically effeminate of the bunch; and Bernard (Michael Benjamin Washington), who makes minstrelsy-type jokes about himself but won’t tolerate them from others.</p>\n<p>If today’s happy homosexuals are all alike, each of <em>Band</em>’s self-hating ones is self-hating in his own way.</p>\n<p>There’s also Alan, the token straight man (Brian Hutchison, also, in real life, gay), Michael’s college roommate and a proper gentleman with a proper wife. He’s in New York for the night, insists on stopping by Michael’s party and becomes progressively more and more horrified. Why he doesn’t leave is perhaps least clear—except that eventually we learn that he may have had a same-sex affair in college, too. Hence his need to beat himself up.</p>\n<p>The crux of the drama revolves around Alan. It’s his appearance and his gay-bashing attack on Emory that drives Michael to start <em>turning</em>. It’s the question of why he’s there that drives the characters to stick around, inasmuch as anything does. It’s the secret of his potential same-sex attraction that pushes Michael to play the awful game. What’s striking about all of that is how much even this classic of gay theater relies on its straight interloper as the audience’s way in. It all combines to make the play feel strictly like a museum piece. (And a museum-quality museum piece, at that. David Zinn’s set and costumes are très swinging-sixties chic.)</p>\n<p>“If we could just learn not to hate ourselves so much,” Michael says at its end, filled with regret about the terrible night he has created. “That’s it, you know. If we could just not hate ourselves just quite so very, very much.” He doesn’t finish the thought, but the idea is that maybe these men wouldn’t be so horrible to each other.</p>\n<p>The good news is that we don’t, and so we aren’t. But it’s the creaky dramatics, not the changed mores, that make <em>Boys in the Band</em> feel like it’s playing such an odd tune.</p>\n<p><strong>The Boys in the Band opened May 31, 2018, at the Booth Theatre and runs through August 11.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>The Iceman Cometh</em> is back to Broadway, in the fifth major New York production of the Eugene O’Neill masterwork since 1973. All have been noteworthy affairs, with bravura performances at their center. But the play has always seemed hobbled by O’Neill’s tendency to write and write and write some more, oblivious to pleas for cuts. <em>The Iceman Cometh</em> is a painstakingly wrought four-hour play which indeed seems something like a long night’s journey into day. Or more precisely, a long night’s journey into despair. So how is it that George C. Wolfe’s production, starring Denzel Washington, seems more engrossing this time around?</p>\n<p><em>Iceman</em> rests on the shoulders of the Hickey of the occasion. Theodore Hickman, that is, a charismatic hardware salesman who successfully peddles his wares along the Eastern seaboard. (O’Neill might also have called his play “Death of a Salesman,” a title that was still available at the time.) Hickey&#8217;s message, on what is to be his final barroom visit, is dire this time: Salvation will come only when you recognize and reject the &#8220;phony pipe dreams&#8221; which offer false hope.</p>\n<p>We’ve seen towering portrayals of Hickey by Jason Robards, James Earl Jones, Kevin Spacey and Nathan Lane. Add Washington, who—like Robards—seems to have the charm of the world in his hands until he breaks during his marathon monologue in Act Four. Washington carries the play, as one expects he would; given that the man can choose to work where he wants and when he wants, we imagine that <em>Iceman</em> is back on Broadway solely because the actor so desired. Give him kudos for his extraordinary performance, his dedication, and the opportunity he presents to his marvelous castmates.</p>\n<p>Equal attention is typically lavished on the actors playing the next two central roles: Larry Slade, the disillusioned and lapsed Wobbly (anarchist); and Harry Hope, proprietor of the “no chance” saloon where the play takes place. Both are played skillfully here, respectively by David Morse (ever-memorable for <em>How I Learned to Drive</em>) and Irishman Colm Meaney (who last visited Broadway as Phil Hogan in the 2007 Old Vic production of O’Neill’s <em>Moon for the Misbegotten</em>).</p>\n<p>What lifts this production, though, is the handling of the other 14 characters. Few have all that much to say; most are scattered, drunkenly, across the stage for much of the action. Wolfe seems to have carefully worked through those hours with each and every one of them. The evening begins with the cast ranged across the stage in drunken stupor, each body wracked and sculpted to form a Brueghelian tableaux of despair with lighting out of Van Gogh’s studies for <em>The Potato Eaters</em>.</p>\n<p>As the play continues, each character becomes full and real to us, as opposed to just part of the background crowd as in other <em>Iceman</em> productions. Wolfe sees to it that all remain intensely present, even though O’Neill might have rendered them speechless for 30 minutes at a time. Watch Reg Rogers, for example, as the washed-up war correspondent nicknamed “Jimmy Tomorrow.” Rogers blazes through what seems like hours of silence, hanging upon every word <em>anyone</em> says as if his existence depends on it. Credit goes not only to the actor but to the director, who instructs his lighting designers—the ever-estimable Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhower—to make sure we feel every thought and hope and failure that flashes through Jimmy’s eyes while others do the talking.</p>\n<p>Multiply this by a dozen and you can appreciate the manner in which this production illuminates the author’s intent. The performers include Michael Potts, the Yale-educated actor remembered as the “Hasa Diga Eebowai” man in <em>Book of Mormon</em>, mesmerizing here as the down-and-out gambling man/janitor Joe Mott; Neal Huff as Willie, the untried and unhinged lawyer who is wild-eyed from cheap rotgut; newcomer Austin Butler, as the teenaged son-of-an-anarchist looking to Larry for salvation and forgiveness; Danny McCarthy and Danny Mastrogiorgio, as barmen who run trollops on the side; and Tammy Blanchard, Nina Grollman and Carolyn Braver as tarts but not whores.</p>\n<p>Bill Irwin is on hand as the circus flimflammer and freeloading brother-in-law of the proprietor. Irwin inhabits his part so well that he seems to be mumbling Harry’s lines along with him; he’s heard the tales so many times. The carny background allows Irwin to indulge in some rubber-limbed moves, but he is ever conscious of the need to defer to and at all costs protect the illusions of his meal ticket. Frank Wood and Dakin Matthews, two familiar character actors, are so vibrant and real as veterans of the Boer War that you might not recognize them.</p>\n<p>Wolfe—wise man, he—once again surrounds himself with a perfect design team. Santo Loquasto’s scenery absolutely reeks of despair: dark, overpainted with decades of dullness, and flying upward into oblivion. Fisher and Eisenhower sculpt with darkness, hiding the truths from us but at the same time unobtrusively pinpointing every little detail the director wishes to enlighten. Ann Roth’s costumes are extra-brilliant: these clothes are worn and worn-through, as dead as the characters within.</p>\n<p><em>The Iceman Cometh</em>—written in 1939, initially produced in 1946 to a disappointing reception, and the final new O’Neill play staged with the playwright in attendance before his death in 1953—has always been a difficult evening of theater. Wolfe and Washington and a marvelous cast demonstrate that the play is indeed a monumental piece of theater.</p>\n<p><strong>The Iceman Cometh opened April 26, 2018, at The Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre and runs through July 1. Tickets and information: <a href=\"http://icemanonbroadway.com/\">icemanonbroadway.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>A formidable masterpiece for actors to perform and audiences to enjoy, <em>The Iceman Cometh</em>, much like <em>Long Day’s Journey Into Night</em>, was dredged out of Eugene O’Neill’s youthful troubles.</p>\n<p>Undone by depression and drinking in his early 20s, O’Neill lodged for some months during 1911-12 with other miserable down-and-outers at Jimmy-the-Priest’s, a decayed saloon and rooming house on the Hudson River waterfront. Drunken and despairing as he was—once even attempting suicide—O’Neill still was able to observe his fellow losers sufficiently well to incarnate some of them colorfully as various characters in <em>The Iceman Cometh</em>, which he wrote nearly 30 years later.</p>\n<p>More stylized than dramatically stirring in director George C. Wolfe’s arty staging, the latest Broadway production of this great and gloomy work is noteworthy for the mottled gallery of misfits and riff-raff created by actors in supporting roles rather than its leading performance by Denzel Washington.</p>\n<p>First-time viewers of the play, drawn by Washington’s star power, will find themselves in the ratty back room of a New York City gin mill, circa 1912, where a dozen or so derelicts blearily wake up to another aimless day of boozing, gassing about brighter yesterdays, and idly thinking they might do something with their lives tomorrow. They also are expecting some fun times from an imminent visit by Hickey (Washington), a back-slapping traveling salesman who’ll treat them all to plenty of drinks and laughs.</p>\n<p>When Hickey eventually arrives (some 40 or so minutes into the proceedings), he’s nearly as jaunty and generous as ever, but this time he’s on a mission. Somehow Hickey wants all of his old pals to face up to their future. Whether it’s to get that job or marry that dame or quit drinking or merely to take a long-postponed stroll around the neighborhood, Hickey is prodding them to realize their dreams tomorrow.</p>\n<p>The aftermath sees everyone’s self-deceptive illusions shattered, while Hickey—well, the sorrowful story that Hickey finally spills out about his own recognition of personal truth is the most tragic of all.</p>\n<p>Clocking in at nearly four overlong hours, <em>The Iceman Cometh</em> remains a complex, remarkably vivid play where low-life souls express their bitterest blues and wishful dreams in the racy lingo of a century ago. It is a challenging work to produce effectively. The rendition of the drama currently at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre does not achieve the requisite life and death significance of O’Neill’s somber vision. (Not incidentally, during the intermissions, some people unfamiliar with the play were complaining they had trouble understanding the actors.)</p>\n<p>Washington initially commands the stage naturally as Hickey genially joshes along his drinking buddies with broad smiles and light-footed gambols. But as the story darkens and Hickey explains his motives, the actor’s interpretation of the character becomes indistinct and deflates in force. Later in the play, during Hickey’s extended speeches, Washington resorts to sitting and addressing his words head-on to the audience rather than interacting with the others onstage. It appears that Washington has yet to plumb Hickey’s lowest emotional depths. Perhaps this monumental role does not really suit the actor’s capabilities.</p>\n<p>One wonders what Wolfe contributed to Washington’s performance, since the director does not offer a harmonious concept for the production. Designer Santo Loquasto provides a non-realistic setting for the seedy saloon-tenement that suggests a Victorian warehouse with vast, blank, peeling walls and an ironwork upper gallery looming high above a floor littered with random chairs and tables. These surreal environs are lit in obviously-cued shades and intensities by Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer. In odd contrast to such surroundings, the actors are dressed in suitably tatty 1900s clothes by Ann Roth and their depictions of the characters are similarly natural.</p>\n<p>Perhaps to compensate for Washington’s gradual fade as Hickey, David Morse delivers an unusually vital and pugnacious interpretation of a former anarchist who yearns for death. A blubbering Austin Butler looks wretched as his stoolpigeon admirer. Neal Huff flamboyantly depicts an Ivy Leaguer gone sadly to seed. A geeky guy clutching a bowler hat, Bill Irwin demonstrates light-fingered skills as a circus shill. The disgruntled Danny Mastrogiorgio and Tammy Blanchard drolly bicker as molting lovebirds. Frank Wood’s befuddled British officer, Colm Meaney’s blustering saloon owner, and Reg Rogers’ florid wreck of a bigtime reporter are nicely-cut cameos. Nina Grollman and Carolyn Braver lend tinny-voiced vitality to the premises as giggling, good-natured sluts.</p>\n<p>In a standout performance as a one-time high roller of a gambling man reduced to mopping the floors, Michael Potts evidences such pride of character and expresses the man’s frustrations so fiercely that he won deserved applause as he left the stage in a rage.</p>\n<p>While the larger vision and the major performance lack distinction, the pleasures of this revival of <em>The Iceman Cometh </em>are derived from seeing the members of the ensemble bring to life the people with whom O’Neill once shared his drinks and despair.</p>\n<p><strong>The Iceman Cometh opened April 26, 2018, at The Bernard B.

Photo: Joan Marcus</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Saint Joan</em> might well be considered the crowning glory of George Bernard Shaw’s long career. After the Theatre Guild’s premiere of the play on Broadway in 1923, its worldwide acclaim and popularity helped to nab Shaw the 1925 Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>\n<p>Its current production by Manhattan Theatre Club is scarcely so rewarding, nor will this competent but stolid staging by director Daniel Sullivan win awards for anybody this Broadway season.</p>\n<p>Straightforwardly crafting the 15th-century story in modern language, Shaw provides a thoughtful look at Joan of Arc, a charismatic young woman and saint-in-the-making who defied both church and state—and men—and was burnt for the trouble she caused them.</p>\n<p>The whimsical tangents that so often riddle Shaw’s works are minimal. (Some dialogue also has been pared away from the text for this revival.) Instead, the playwright gently depicts Joan as a simple, devout soul who wins battles for France in spite of the crew of petty individuals surrounding her, only to be easily abandoned by them to the English allies who intend to destroy her.</p>\n<p>It is suggested more than once that this world, both way back then and nowadays, has little desire or patience for actual saints.</p>\n<p>A drama that is far more about talk than action, the story presents its medieval characters swapping ideas about the rise of nationalism and those would-be Protestant inclinations that eventually will sweep away feudal existence. These Shavian conversations can be pleasing. Nevertheless, <em>Saint Joan</em> is a drama that requires inventive lifting on the part of its director and acting ensemble to make its often static charms amenable to Broadway audiences of today who, the occasional Tom Stoppard work aside, prefer entertainment over edification.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Sullivan might have staged the play in some radical style. Rehearsal clothes? Sci-fi décor? In a wild reconfiguration of the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre auditorium?  This staging appears terribly flat. Perhaps Sullivan might have striven for a more ironic or even a comic tone among the performances. This rendition is an awfully conventional interpretation of a play that demands a heightened ambience.</p>\n<p>At the very least, MTC should have secured a more personally resonant actor for Joan than Condola Rashad, whose cheery portrayal of Joan is confident, pleasant, and neither inspired nor inspiring. There should be a streak of madness sparking within Joan that electrifies everyone around her. (Gosh, where’s Nina Arianda when you need her?)</p>\n<p>Several actors have sufficient presence and technique to overcome the dull way in which the director so often has them simply sitting down and jawing. Patrick Page, always forceful and lucid, illuminates the crucial trial sequence as a mellifluous, sincerely spiritual Inquisitor. Jack Davenport is wonderfully urbane as a crafty English politician eager to incinerate Joan. Daniel Sunjata, radiating boyish charm in his armor, is appealing as Joan’s best chum. John Glover’s chilly archbishop, Adam Chanler-Berat’s peevish Dauphin, and Walter Bobbie’s grumpy bishop are other capable, though traditional, characterizations.</p>\n<p>The most memorable takeaway from the production is designer Scott Pask’s unusual setting, which provides a flexible frame and background for an otherwise bare stage with vertical metallic tubes that resemble over-sized chimes. Lit in varying colors by Justin Townsend, this somewhat overwhelming setting probably was suggested by Joan’s remarks how she heard her saintly voices in the reverberations of church bells. It’s a pity that the rest of this revival of <em>Saint Joan</em> is not nearly so striking.</p>\n<div class=\"gmail_default\"><b>Saint Joan </b><strong>opened April 25, 2018, at the Samuel J.

Photo: Joan Marcus.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It has been a quarter century since George Bernard Shaw’s <em>Saint Joan</em> was last performed on Broadway, but its subject has not gone entirely missing from New York stages. Just over a year ago, she popped up at the Public Theater in the musical <em>Joan Of Arc: Into the Fire</em>; played by singer/actress/DJ/indie darling Jo Lampert, this Maid of Orleans was stalwart, fierce and virtually sexless. One could easily have imagined her either leading or disappearing into the ranks of young French soldiers battling the English during the Hundred Years’ War.</p>\n<p>Condola Rashad, who assumes the role in Manhattan Theatre Club’s stirring new Broadway revival of <em>Saint Joan</em>, exudes a very different kind of purity. With her doe eyes and sweetly resonant voice, Rashad’s Joan is a distinctly feminine presence, even a girlish one at points, though it’s clear that gender is of no consequence to her.</p>\n<p>But there is no mistaking this Joan’s gentle mien for passivity. Her belief in herself and her cause is absolute—so much so that she neither fears nor questions her divine mission. Or sees how it might in any way contradict her modest perception of herself as “a poor country girl.” Rashad’s performance—tender, resolute, and deeply human—presents us with something we’ve become sadly unaccustomed to in reality: a leader whose strength is rooted in humility.</p>\n<p>Director Daniel Sullivan, who has offered revelatory takes on classics ranging from <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> to <em>The Homecoming</em>, manages to capture the timelessness and the topicality of Shaw’s play without straining to emphasize the latter. That Rashad is an African-American actress playing a famously persecuted woman holds obvious resonance, but Sullivan trusts the text and a superb company to show us how relevant the playwright’s progressive humanism is right now.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Sullivan surrounds his leading lady with experienced performers who infuse the other characters, all but one of them male, with varying degrees of gravitas, arrogance, fecklessness, and fellowship, all of which underscore Joan’s innocence and resolve. The marvelous Patrick Page is among several actors who juggle two roles—first lending his savory basso voice to the military squire Robert de Baudricourt, who reluctantly lets Joan enlist his troops early on, then making a chilling Inquisitor in the trial scene, which Sullivan mines for all its emotional and moral tension.</p>\n<p>The equally estimable John Glover appears as the pompous, ineffectual Archbishop of Rheims; rising star Adam Chanler-Berat, hugely appealing as a romantic lead in last season’s musical <em>Am</em><em>élie</em>, proves just as effective as the lily-livered Dauphin who becomes King Charles VII. Walter Bobbie and Robert Stanton respectively play Cauchon, the Bishop of Beauvais, and Chaplain de Stogumber, who both perceive Joan as not just a nuisance but a threat.</p>\n<p>The future saint finds a more loyal and sympathetic spirit, and a comrade in armor, in the warrior Dunois, whom the excellent Daniel Sunjata plays with a mix of sensitivity and unforced masculinity that stands in stark contrast to the posturing and patronizing of other male characters. “My heart is full of courage, not of anger,” Joan tells him, and an instant bond is formed—one made all the more striking by the way these very attractive actors manage to connect without a trace of eroticism.</p>\n<p>Dunois cannot save Joan, any more than she can save herself from the fate sealed for her by men claiming to represent the country and God she has served so completely. “Forgive us, Joan: we are not yet good enough for you,” Dunois remarks, in an epilogue that allows her to learn of her eventual coronation, centuries after her death. Ulimately, though, this forthright <em>Saint Joan</em> doesn’t condemn its heroine’s oppressors as much as the enduring power structures they represent; Joan’s story promotes action and advocacy over bitterness or rage, and in this sense she still has quite a lot to teach us.</p>\n<p><b>Saint Joan </b><strong>opened April 25, 2018, at the Samuel J.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The great good news is that the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Travesties</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that opened tonight at the American Airlines Theatre is in neither context a travesty. Or, at least, we are supposed to think it is one only in the latter sense — except that I’d argue there is nothing inappropriate about its gleefully goofy style.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Travesties</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an early Stoppard play, originally staged here in 1975, when it won the Tony Award for Best Play. It is my favorite kind of Stoppard: Erudite, allusive, and grappling deeply with history, but also fun, funny, and compulsively entertaining. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It springs from historical coincidence: V.I. Lenin, James Joyce, and Tristan Tzara, who helped found Dadaism, were all in Zurich at more or less the same time, waiting out the First World War in neutral Switzerland. So was Henry Wilfred Carr, a minor diplomat in the English consular service, who — and this is true — starred in a production of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Importance of Being Earnest</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Joyce staged among the British expats in Zurich. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carr becomes the quasi-narrator of Stoppard’s appropriately ridiculous vaudeville, and as he spends long set pieces with each of these three men who seek to change the world — in politics, literature, and art — the playwright guides us through a debate about the role of the artist in war and revolution. Because it’s framed as an elderly Carr looking back, he is an unreliable narrator — “constant digression being the saving grace of senile reminiscence,” he says in a transfixing early monolgue — and his story is impressionist, twisting and turning and mixed and matched, arguable Dadaist.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tom Hollander plays Carr, and he’s a virtuoso in a complicated part, shifting among styles and bouncing around the stage. There are songs and dances, long speeches, occasional rhyming couplets. The whole thing borrows from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earnest</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including two love interests named Cecily and Gwendolyn. Stoppard’s genius, especially in his earlier work, is to mix high intellect with low comedy, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Travesties</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> manages to be both deeply thoughtful and guffawingly funny. I don’t want to spoil the punchline, but you’ll be surprised at how much you laugh at a long-payoff dumb joke about a library only learning things in alphabetical order.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Patrick Marber keeps this joyful folly happily afloat, and the set by Tim Hatley (who also did the costumes) seems almost a perfect visual representation of Stoppardism: We’re in a library-cum-drawing room inside Carr’s head, an old-Europe repository of wood panelling and books everywhere. Hollander is the standout but the cast is uniformly fine, especially Patrick Kerr as Carr’s secretly Socialist manservant, Bennett. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To lose one revolution may be regarded as misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness,” Stoppard has Lenin say, Wilde-ishly, as he leaves Zurich to return to Petersburg after the fall of the czar. Here, two playwrights is rather no misfortune at all.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Travesties opened April 24, 2018, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through June 17.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If you’re looking for an example of theatrical brilliance made tangible, here’s what you do. You get yourself to the revival of Tom Stoppard’s <em>Travesties</em>, just imported—and not a moment too soon—from London’s Menier Chocolate Factory, where it was acclaimed and subsequently became a West End hit.</p>\n<p>So get there fast, and when you do, be prepared to listen fast. That’s because Stoppard has long had a reputation for being verbally hilarious, and of his works the 1976 Tony-Award-winning <em>Travesties</em> may be the funniest. That’s as a certain kind of heady comedy. It may be not only the funniest but also the smartest anyone anywhere has ever quilled.</p>\n<p>Which immediately requires a buyer-beware aviso: Getting the most out of Stoppard’s propulsive wordplay requires a good education or the accomplishments of a first-rate autodidact. We all know there’s such a thing as sophomore humor. <em>Travesties</em> isn’t that. It’s graduate school-Ph.D-level humor, delivered by a man for whom English is a second language he’s mastered as have before him Joseph Conrad and Vladimir Nabokov.</p>\n<p>In getting ready for possibly the only perfect production now occupying a Broadway theater, potential theatergoers might want to ask themselves a few preparatory questions. Are they familiar with Oscar Wilde’s perfect comedy, <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em>? Would they recognize a parody of the signature song delivered for many vaudeville years by Ed Gallagher and Al Shean? How do they feel about Dada not as a child’s first word but as a response to, and outgrowth of, the Cubist and Futurist art movements? Are they up on James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> and the Irish author’s love of limericks. Where do they stand on their Francois de la Rochefoucauld aphorisms? Might they twig to the connection between the Marquis of Queensbury and Stoppard’s neologism “Gommorist”?</p>\n<p>Granted, it may be that quick-witted patrons will simply go along with Stoppard’s blizzard of allusions and references whether they get them or not. They may be able to have a high old time with the (more or less) plot he’s produced. It‘s ingenious, not to say genius.</p>\n<p>One lucky day, it occurred to Stoppard that in 1917 James Joyce, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, and Tristan Tzara of Dada fame were all in Zurich. Having realized that, the clever Stoppard imagined what it might have been like had they all known each other. Then he concocted Henry Carr (Tom Hollander), a Brit who’d been in the Great War trenches but, due to a wound, had been invalided out and taken up residence in Zurich as a consul. Or maybe not as a consul.</p>\n<p>Stoppard imagines Henry as a stooped man 50 years on looking back at—and traveling back to—those days and remember/reliving the days when Joyce (Peter McDonald). Lenin (Dan Butler), and Tzara (Seth Numrich) dropped by to report on their self-important doings. Not only that but rambling on about the wages of war and, more pressingly, what constitutes genuine art—Art with a capital “A.”</p>\n<p>Often they’re in company with Carr’s opinionated butler Bennett (Patrick Kerr), Lenin’s wife Nadya (Opal Alladin), librarian Cecily (Sara Topham), and/or Gwendolen (Scarlett Strallen). By the way, anyone who recognizes Cecily and Gwendolen as being the same names as the ingenues in Wilde’s <em>The Importance of Being Earnest </em>is already showing signs of having the devil’s own time at <em>Travesties</em>.</p>\n<p>As the famous figures burst in—sometimes not through real doors—it starts to look as if the rollicking proceedings might be in Carr’s 1967 head. Often robed and donning a worn-out boater, he gregariously reminisces about his colorful past. Just as often he’s standing up straight, in sporty 1917 outfits, including a now pristine boater.</p>\n<p>At all of this, Hollander—only seen once before on a Manhattan stage (David Hare’s 1998 <em>The Judas Kiss</em>)—has the cocky, twinkling confidence of master storyteller. A shortish fellow with the energy of a long-distance runner, he’s the now bent, now erect backbone of the gadabout opus.</p>\n<p>On Tim Hatley’s capacious dark wood set, in Hatley’s snappy period costume and wrapped in Neil Austin’s lighting, rapscallion Hollander is directed by Patrick Marber, who never lets up on the comic drive. As Tzara, Numrich inhabits the most flamboyant role, but all the others, each given at least one solid opportunity to shine, do so. This is an outstanding ensemble.</p>\n<p>Getting back to the seemingly innumerable script outbursts about what art is: Stoppard does something cute and gets away with it. While repeatedly defining what constitutes art this way and that, he’s spoofing pretentious people who need to carry on about it. At the same time he gets those definitions aired.</p>\n<p>What pertains here, however, is: No matter by what definition of art you swear, this <em>Travesties</em>—thanks to Stoppard, Hollander, Marber, and everyone connected to it—is that rare thing: Art with a capital “A.”</p>\n<p><strong>Travesties opened April 24, 2018, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through June 17.  Tickets and information: <a href=\"https://www.roundabouttheatre.org/Shows-Events/Travesties.aspx\">roundabouttheatre.org</a> </strong></p>\n",

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Here’s a thing you’ll want to know: Donna Summer is dead. She died in 2012, of lung cancer that she believed was caused by exposure to toxic dust in New York after the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>\n<p>This is, remarkably, not something you would know from <em>Summer</em>, the odd duck of a biomusical that opened tonight at the Lunt-Fontanne. Donna gets sick near the end of the show, but she and her family sing a defiant song, and then she goes on telling her story. If you have only a glancing familiarity with the Queen of Disco’s life—and, let’s be honest, how many living today have more than that?—you’re likely to walk out of the theater thinking, “Huh, so I guess she’s still alive?”</p>\n<p>It’s only one of the many plot details that will leave you scratching your head. <em>Summer</em>, with a script credited to Colman Domingo, Robert Cary, and the director Des McAnuff, uses three Donnas—Duckling Donna (Storm Lever), the little girl who hopes to grow up into a swan; Disco Donna (Ariana DeBose), the talented woman riding her success; and Diva Donna (LaChanze), the icon looking back at her life—to provide an episodic, song-driven, non-chronological look at her life. The performances are frequently electric, and the songs sound spectactular, but any attempt to learn something about Summer’s life, to understand what drove her, to gain a deeper era understanding of the disco era, comes and goes as quickly and lightly as that barely acknowledged tumor.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/04/23/donna-summer-lachanze-broadway/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Each number proceeds the same way: There is a plot development interpolated into a song; the song ends and that chapter is over, never to be mentioned again. This is how we learn, barely, about her cancer, about her learning to drive, about abandoning Casablanca Records for Geffen, about an allegation that her childhood pastor molested her. Each episode is given equal weight, with immediate resolution, and thus nearly no weight at all. There’s virtually nothing on Summer as a songwriter, no sense behind some passing mentions that she was the author of her hits—or of her own life.</p>\n<p>What’s oddest is that the musical is trying to tell a story or make a point at all. It clearly wants to be nothing more than a concert, and that’s when it’s at its best. There are 23 Summer hits here, in an intermissionless 100 minutes or so, and McAnduff, with the choreographer Sergio Trujillo, stages the hell out of them. It’s a sinewy, sexy, disco-inspired but not cheesily <em>Solid Gold</em>-style dancing, and the two main leading ladies are sensational, LaChanze fully embracing her character’s divaness, and her own, singing and moving as an unstoppable force. DeBose, as Disco Donna, does the hardest work, the one actor must not only sing the songs but also portray the bulk of Summer’s life and successes. The awkward, enervated script does her no favors, but she gives her character dignity and drive—and she’s as good as LaChanze in the big numbers.</p>\n<p>One interesting choice by McAnuff and Trujillo is the casting of <em>Summer</em>’s ensemble. There are nearly no men in it. There are some male actors in the cast, playing Donna’s father and love interests. But the chorus is nearly all female, dancing and moving as disco-era women and men, some of the dancers in flowing gowns and others in bell-bottoms and sportscoats. It’s a nice illustration of the ambisexuality of the disco world, and it’s also—and a line in the script spins it this way—a women’s-power nod to the changing gender dynamics of the era. But it’s a decision that I suspect misjudges this musical’s audience. If the point is to have a good time at a sexy disco concert, I think I speak for all the gay men and middle-aged women in attendance when I say: some hunky chorus boys to look at, please. (Also, occasionally the lineup of women in suits looks like a Robert Palmer video.)</p>\n<p>But, then, <em>Summer </em>is a musical that throughout seems to want you to have a great time but also slightly misses the mark. There is a moment early on when it seems like it might actually have something to say. After an opening dance number, we’re in the first scene. Diva Donna is on stage, regal in an electric-blue gown and windswept hair against a black stage. Her microphone has some reverb in it, suggesting a rock god commanding a stadium.</p>\n<p>“For the longest time, people had me convinced there was something wrong with this music,” she says. “‘Dance music.’ Like the term was some kind of insult. … A synthesizer can sustain notes forever, so people said, ‘It’s not a real instrument. It’s cold, it’s robotic, it’s artificial.’ Well, screw ’em. We were the future. Our musical instrument wasn’t just the synthesizer. It was the whole recording studio.”</p>\n<p>It’s the start of a spirited defense of disco as a genre and electronic music as an art. It hints at a sustained argument for that world and Summer’s work it. Instead, <em>Summer</em> just settles for having a good time.</p>\n<p><strong>Summer opened April 23, 2018, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Nearly six years after her death, Donna Summer remains one of the most underappreciated singers of her time, in part because of the unfairly maligned genre she was associated with. Every note Summer sang was a refutation of disco’s supposed soullessness, and the recordings she made in the mid-to-late ‘70s with dance-pop maestro Giorgio Moroder and co-producer/writer Pete Bellotte offer more pure, vibrant musicality than most of the corporate rock or, certainly, punk cranked out during that period.</p>\n<p>Summer’s big, gleaming voice, a marvel both technically and in its unfiltered passion, proved equally at home with musical theater, rock, standards and inspirational music, and Broadway’s new <em>Summer: The Donna Summer Musical</em> aims to show us just how much turf the woman tagged the Queen of Disco covered—and not just as an artist. Jukebox musicals tend to take one of two forms, either a collection of songs strung together by a usually thin fictional plot or, essentially, hagiography; <em>Summer</em> falls into the latter camp, with traces of the former in its sometimes awkward positioning of tunes.</p>\n<p>Happily, the subject of this show is ripe for celebration, and by the time it blazes through Summer’s life and career (in roughly 100 minutes, with no intermission), you’ll forgive librettists Colman Domingo, Robert Cary and director Des McAnuff for their lamer lines and more awkward transitions, and be sucked into the sheer joy generated by a woman who still doesn’t get enough credit for repeatedly defying expectations, boundaries, and stereotypes.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/04/23/donna-summer-des-mcanuff-sergio-trujillo-disco-queen-broadway/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Summer is played here by three winning performers: Broadway newcomer Storm Lever is cast as “Duckling Donna,” the precociously gifted, yearning girl and church soloist born LaDonna Adrian Gaines, with rising performer Ariana DeBose and beloved vet LaChanze respectively cast as “Disco Donna” and final incarnation “Diva Donna.” (Lever doubles as Mimi, the eldest of Summer’s three daughters, and LaChanze also plays Summer’s mother, Mary Gaines.)</p>\n<p>LaChanze’s warm, no-nonsense Diva serves as mistress of ceremonies, leading us through Summer’s trials and triumphs; the former include molestation, domestic violence, and being cheated by her label, Casablanca Records, not to mention the pervasive sexism and racism directed at both the singer and the music she came to represent. Family and faith are sources of strength and healing, though it’s acknowledged that Summer’s staunch religious beliefs informed a famously insensitive remark that offended her many gay fans.</p>\n<p>By the end of the show, Summer has sought forgiveness for her trespasses, and offered it to others, such as Casablanca founder Neil Bogart, played by a dutifully slithery Aaron Krohn, who doubles as Summer’s German ex. (A young Summer’s time in Munich, where she performed in a production of <em>Hair</em>, produces a few wince-worthy jokes, one involving a pun on “wurst.”)</p>\n<p>Ken Robinson and Jared Zirilli are relative pillars of integrity and decency as, respectively, Summer’s righteous father, Andrew Gaines, and the musician who becomes her husband, Bruce Sudano. Bruce not only embraces Mimi, the product of an earlier relationship, but allows our heroine to become doting mom to two additional kids, and stands by her through her fatal bout with cancer.</p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s some hokum here, McAnuff, whose credits include <em>The Who’s Tommy</em> and <em>Jersey Boys</em>, smartly avoids getting mired in the darker aspects of Summer’s story; that approach wouldn’t suit the form, or an artist whose music promoted both carnal and spiritual transcendence. Robert Brill’s scenic design and Paul Tazewell’s costumes revel in bold colors and glitter as the Donnas perform favorites such as “MacArthur’s Park” and “Love to Love You Baby,” though other classics are set in less glamorous contexts, from the inside of a car (“On The Radio”) to a funeral (“Dim All The Lights”).</p>\n<p>There remains a fundamental problem of this type of musical: However impeccably these songs are delivered, they can’t reproduce the magic of the original recordings and live performances. Still, at the preview I attended, a number of audience members eagerly accepted Diva Donna’s invitation to rise up and dance along. During the final number, I&#8217;ll confess, I joined them; it was my—spoiler alert—last chance, and I wasn’t going to miss it.</p>\n<p><strong>Summer opened April 23, 2018, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The stage is a-swirl—with dervishing capes, sliding stairways, scores of actors and even Death Eaters—throughout the new, “now and forever” extravaganza at the exquisitely reconfigured Lyric Theatre. <em>Harry Potter and</em>… well, you don’t need the full title, do you?  Which for the record is <em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em>, but just say <em>Harry Potter</em> and everyone will know precisely what you mean. At least, everyone in the market for theater tickets in New York, London, Melbourne and wherever there is enough gold for this worthy enterprise to mine.</p>\n<p><em>Harry Potter</em> started life on U.K. bookshelves in 1997 as an unlikely page-turner by a single mother on the dole. <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</em> it was called; stateside, it was redubbed <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</em>. It has sold gazillions of copies and was made into the chart-topping motion picture of 2001. There have been six sequel novels—from <em>Chamber of Secrets</em> to <em>Deathly Hallows—</em>each of which has been transformed into screen blockbusters. Rowling called it quits in 2007, figuring presumably that enough was enough and just how many adventures can you devise anyway?</p>\n<p>But enough is sometimes not enough. After delving into video games, theme parks, spin-offs and other empire-building activities, the author was enticed by West End Wizard Sonia Friedman to bring Potter to the stage. Rowling joined with director John Tiffany (<em>Black Watch</em>, <em>Once</em>) and playwright Jack Thorne (who worked with Tiffany on the National Theatre of Scotland’s adaptation of the Swedish vampire novel <em>Let the Right One In</em>, which traveled to the Royal Court in London and St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn). They developed an eighth adventure for Harry and friends, the official billing informing us that it is “based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne.” It continues from where the epilogue of <em>Deathly Hallows</em> left off, with the 37-year-old Harry sending young Albus Potter off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And leaping lizards, does it crackle and snap and vibrate the senses; or, to coin a new phrase unless Rowling has already coined it, “leaping wizards!”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/04/22/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-a-magic-man-tested/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>We have been entreated by management to “keep the secrets”—not only in official communications but in pin-back buttons distributed to theatergoers as they exit. So all we’ll say is that your favorites are there, I’d guess; and no matter what misadventures overtake them, most everyone more or less comes through smiling at curtain calls. Except the audience, which beams even more than Tiffany’s special effects.</p>\n<p>And mind you, the show is <em>all</em> special effects. But while there is a good deal of machinery and a greater deal of millions behind it all, the specialest effect that shines through—and, truly, makes <em>Cursed Child</em> what it is—is high-grade theatrical imagination. We can easily list the admirable production staff: Christine Jones (sets), Katrina Lindsay (costumes), Neil Austin (lighting), Finn Ross and Ash Woodward (video), Gareth Fry (sound), Jamie Harrison (illusions and magic), Carole Hancock (hair, wigs and make-up) and Imogen Heap (composer and arranger). It is not quite so easy, though, to separate their accomplishments: <em>everything</em> blends in to create this wizardrous mélange. Prime among Tiffany’s team is “movement director” Steven Hoggett, of both <em>Once</em> and <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em>. <em>Cursed Child</em> is a true collaboration between Tiffany and Hoggett, and quite something to see.</p>\n<p>There are actors galore, of course. Seven have traveled from the original London production (still at the Palace on Cambridge Circus, now and forever), including Olivier winners Jamie Parker (as Harry Potter), Noma Dumezweni (as Hermione Granger) and Anthony Boyle (as Scorpius Malfoy). I found Boyle especially refreshing, as a nerd who can’t quite tell whether he’s hero or villain, and was quite taken by Sam Clemmett as the young Potter. Of the American contingent, I was most surprised by that protean overactor Byron Jennings, thoroughly in his element as he channels John Carradine snorting through three roles; and enchanted by a sprightly newcomer named Lauren Nicole Cipoletti who emerges from an underground bathing fountain in a tiny role and has the makings of a fine comedian.</p>\n<p>All your favorite Hogwartians are here, yes, as well as gaggles of magical wands, Gryffindor robes, Dumbledore tassel hats, et al. (These donned not by actors on stage but fans in the seats.) But while we’re glad to go along with the keep the secrets campaign, we approached <em>Cursed Child</em> in something of a conundrum. Seven novels, seven films and seven trillion merchandising items later, there are still a handful of Muggles in this galaxy who can say, to quote Mrs. Paroo of <em>Music Man</em> fame, “excuse me for livin’ but I never read it.” Yes, she was talking about Balzac, but Honoré was a piker—sales-wise—compared to J.K.</p>\n<p>How is a Hogwarts neophyte likely to fare at the Lyric? Which, by the way, is the formerly impossible barn that under a variety of names housed <em>Ragtime</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em>, and which the Ambassador Theatre Group of London has magically transformed into an altogether grand showplace by—in part—removing seats, shrinking expanse, and tasteful refurnishing as a house fit for a wizard.</p>\n<p>Quite well, thank you. At first one might feel a bit overly potted, if you will, as the other 1,621 patrons greet favorite characters by the dozens. <em>You</em> won’t recognize them, no; but you <em>will </em>immediately recognize supreme stagecraft. Midway through Part One you’ll likely be glad you’re there; and as Part Two starts, you’ll be thrilled, enthralled, and sitting raptly forward in your comfortably plush seats.</p>\n<p>Yes, it’s two parts, six hours, and will cost you two theater tickets; but if you were to compare a day of <em>Harry Potte</em>r with a joint visit to <em>Frozen</em> and <em>Aladdin</em>, say—well, there’s no comparison.  And they might as well send out the 2018 Best Play Tony Award for engraving already.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child opened April 22, 2018, at the Lyric Theatre.

Photo: Manuel Harlan</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Like many folks of a certain age, I came to J.K. Rowling’s <em>Harry Potter</em> series through a reader much younger than myself. I’d never been much of a fantasy buff, as I initially warned my daughter, and was drawn more to the majestically shot, winningly acted film adaptations than to the novels themselves. Then about two years ago, shortly before her ninth birthday, I was asked to review the two-part play <em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em> in London, and took her along; this time, after seeing the play—which follows the world-famous boy wizard as a man, with a wife and kids—we both dove into the rehearsal script with relish.</p>\n<p>As winning as the Potter movies are, there’s something about seeing Rowling’s wizards, witches and Muggles—non-magical folk, in Potter parlance—presented in the flesh that drives home their essential, well, humanity. It helps that the Brits have long had a flair for summoning the fantastic and spectacular on stage with wit and discretion, qualities evident years ago in the National Theatre’s stunning adaptation of Philip Pullman’s <em>His Dark Materials</em> and in the more earthbound <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog In the Night-Time</em>, which also transferred to Broadway.</p>\n<p>I can happily report that <em>Cursed Child</em> has arrived in New York with those assets intact, along with an even more essential element in the Potter books and films: emotional and moral complexity. Anyone who has viewed Harry’s mission to save the wizarding world from destructive forces as a simple matter of courage obliterating evil doesn’t appreciate the fears, flaws and internal conflicts Rowling infused in her young hero and his protectors and tormentors (not all of them mutually exclusive).</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/04/22/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-broadways-enchanted-kingdom/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Conceived by Rowling, celebrated director John Tiffany (last represented on Broadway with a radiant revival of <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>) and playwright/screenwriter Jack Thorne, <em>Cursed Child</em> was written by Thorne, whose gift for finding shades of grey in the fairest surfaces and darkest corners—recently on display in the brilliant British TV series <em>National Treasure</em>, available on Hulu—makes him an ideal interpreter. The play begins where the epilogue of the series’ final novel, <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows</em>, left off: in a train station, where Harry and fellow adventurers Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, now in early middle age, are sending their own children off to their alma mater, the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>\n<p>Harry, played by Jamie Parker—one of seven principal actors from the original London cast, all terrific, featured here—is now married to Ginny, Ron’s sister, with whom he has three children. Their younger son, Albus, and his strained relationship with his legendary dad lay the foundation for everything that happens in both parts of <em>Cursed Child</em>, which clock in at just over five hours combined. Harry, the boy who lived, has grown into a man with a gnawing sense of survivor’s guilt, fallout from the danger and carnage that have trailed him since his young parents were murdered.</p>\n<p>Harry worries specifically about Albus, who has become a sullen and lonely teenager, his only friend at Hogwarts the son of Harry’s former school adversary, Draco Malfoy, a rather sunnier lad named Scorpius. As marvelously played by Sam Clemmett and Anthony Boyle, respectively, Albus and Scorpius summon a mischievous rapport that is tested and, eventually, made more tender as both boys grapple with their legacies and are swept into new adventures involving a Time-Turner, an alternate reality and tasks as daunting and terrifying as any that befell Harry.</p>\n<p>Old and new characters pop up along the way, but to identify them (one in particular) would require dangling massive spoilers. The focus, besides, is on the challenges faced and growth experienced by the books’ central group of friends—and Draco, who has aged into a more sympathetic fellow (and an often funny one, in Alex Price’s robust performance)—and their progeny. The women, tellingly, prove more patently indomitable: Hermione, the precocious daughter of Muggles, has matured into the most powerful figure in the wizarding world—leader of the Ministry of Magic—and is imbued with unfussy gravitas by the radiant Noma Dumezweni. Ginny, played with similarly unmannered dignity and warmth by Poppy Miller, is just as stalwart a force in Harry’s life, as well as a patient minder to goofy Ron (Paul Thornley, droll and endearing), now Hermione’s husband and affectionate foil.</p>\n<p>Christine Jones’s richly handsome but essentially minimal set provides the perfect canvas for Jamie Harrison’s tastefully spine-tingling illusions and magic effects, which include spinning clocks, bursts of fire and light and creatures hovering ominously over the stage and audience. Imogen Heap’s atmospheric incidental music and Stephen Hoggett’s typically vital choreography—called “movement” here, as it&#8217;s dominated by simple but vivid whirling and swaying—add to the staging’s otherworldly ambience.</p>\n<p>But the core of <em>Cursed Child</em>’s appeal lies in its more grounded aspects, like the basically naturalistic dialogue (references to developments in the book are generally given enough context to avoid stumping Potter virgins), and in moments when the characters—particularly Parker’s beautifully textured, frustrated, humane Harry—must confront demons not terribly unlike those in our own world, before fully realizing the wonder of love. My daughter may have been, again, enchanted by the funnier and more fantastic elements, but I left the theater both haunted and grateful—and not just for the production.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child opened April 22, 2018, at the Lyric Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Wouldn’t it be loverly to have Lerner &amp; Loewe’s magical <em>My Fair Lady</em> back on Broadway? And wouldn’t it be “warm and tender” if it were a tasteful staging which captured the style and grace of the fabled original? Well, Bartlett Sher’s new staging at the Vivian Beaumont is and does. The Lincoln Center Theater <em>My Fair Lady</em> is absobloominutely loverly, and you can quote me on that.</p>\n<p><em>My Fair Lady</em> has long held prime space on the Best Broadway Musicals of the Golden Age list. It&#8217;s not as groundbreaking as <em>Carousel</em>, as moving as <em>South Pacific</em> nor as rambunctious as <em>Guys and Dolls</em>, to name three illustrious predecessors; but it was exceptionally and exquisitely well written. Back in 1956, Lerner and Loewe took the advances that their peers—most especially Rodgers and Hammerstein—had developed and assembled what was instantly hailed as the altogether perfect musical. This can be seen, and grandly so, in Sher’s lavish new production. With all the wares on display, it becomes clear that in this case the play’s the thing; “the play” meaning not only the songs and script, but G. B. Shaw’s <em>Pygmalion</em> upon which it is built.</p>\n<p>That has not always been quite enough. <em>My Fair Lady</em> first returned to the Rialto in a carefully recreated 20th Anniversary production, which was bright and shining in material but outdated in style. (One remembers how jaw-droppingly passé it looked when Freddy Eynsford-Hill came out to serenade his fair lady, with the street where she lived represented by a crumpled curtain with painted-on lampposts.) The show returned in 1981 in antiquarian shape, with a 73-year-old leading man (Rex Harrison, on his last legs). It fared even worse in 1993, with one of those brilliant young London directors superimposing a radicalized conception. So <em>My Fair Lady</em>, brilliant writing and all, is not exactly fail-safe.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/04/19/my-fair-lady-shaw-goes-ibsen-in-shers-appealing-revival/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Mount the show with impeccable taste, utmost respect and sufficient resources, and all is well on Wimpole Street. Sher is an acknowledged wizard at this sort of thing, having previously joined with André Bishop of Lincoln Center Theater and music master Ted Sperling for <em>South Pacific</em> and <em>The King and I</em>. (If these were both superb, the partnership began even more auspiciously with the original production of Adam Guettel’s <em>The Light in the Piazza</em>.)</p>\n<p>Sher returns with his long-time design team, Michael Yeargan (sets), Catherine Zuber (costumes) and Donald Holder (lighting), plus choreographer Christopher Gattelli. The team takes full advantage of the vast confines of the Beaumont, with the ability to give us a stageful of scenery but also widely open vistas as desired. Yeargan dresses the side aisles of the theater with pastel views of London rooftops, and it sets one aglow even before we hear the clarion call of those eight <em>tutti</em> notes heralding the sterling overture.</p>\n<p>Warm and tender, yes, tiptop entertainment suitable for all audiences and sure to send them beaming to their choc’late box. There is a tad missing, though; think of the irrepressible sparkle that radiated from the stage in both <em>South Pacific</em> and <em>The King and I</em>. (I won’t say it, but I’ll spell it: K-E-L-L-I.) We don’t get that here. Lauren Ambrose, the <em>Six Feet Under</em> regular who had been announced to star in Sher’s aborted 2012 production of <em>Funny Girl</em>, does perfectly well as the draggletailed guttersnipe Eliza Doolittle. Perfectly well, yes; but she doesn’t send the necessary chills of enchantment past the curtain line. (And if you want to know what I mean, head to the Barrymore to watch Katrina Lenk magnetize the crowd in <em>The Band’s Visit</em>).</p>\n<p>“Just You Wait, ’enry ’iggins” gives Eliza a ferocious showstopper, furnishing the singer with lightning bolts to hurl to the back row. Ambrose doesn’t, perhaps because she is forced to deliver the song while positively loping through the 27A Wimpole Street set, which turns and turns and turns as the heroine traipses in and about and up and down staircases.  Maybe the number would land better if they just let her stand there and sing it? She is doubtless racking up an impressive step count on her Fitbit, at least.</p>\n<p>Harry Haden-Paton makes a strong local debut as Higgins, that exacting professor of the mother tongue. Considerably younger than his predecessors in the role, the actor—who has numerous West End credits but is best known hereabouts as Bertie Pelham, who finally makes an honest woman of Lady Edith in the final reel of <em>Downton Abbey</em>—demonstrates the charm beneath the curmudgeon. This makes the production a slightly more romantic <em>Fair Lady</em>; one can see, at least, how opposites might indeed theoretically attract.</p>\n<p>The large cast is bolstered by Allan Corduner as a fine Pickering, albeit 30 years older than “confirmed old bachelor” Higgins; Tony-winner Diana Rigg, charming her way through as Henry’s upper-class mother; and Norbert Leo Butz as the freethinking, do-little dustman. Norbert commands the crowd as always, although one might protest that he’s got a way to go before settling down into these two-songs-and-a-scene roles.</p>\n<p>Unlike other recent revivals that have come along, the show is performed more or less as written; when everything is nigh perfect to begin with, it’s treacherous to make changes. Sher leaves his ending open to interpretation, which is fine and good. One wonders, though, who chose to present a bevy of male dancers dressed—or rather undressed—in women’s underthings, some of them sporting 21st century body tattoos. Neither Edwardian nor Shavian, old boy, nor likely to the taste of Alfred P. Doolittle. (Lerner&#8217;s stage direction simply states &#8220;the crowd pulls out the stopper and has a whopper.&#8221;) But no matter; if the estates don’t complain, why should we?</p>\n<p>The invincible strength of the evening is demonstrated when Eliza sings “I’ll never know what made it so exciting.” You can actually <em>hear</em> what makes it so exciting; that full-bodied orchestra, playing the original orchestrations for all they’re worth. And they’re worth a lot. Just listen to those bubbling reeds accompanying her in “I Could Have Danced All Night,” and to all those strings which lift Eliza soaring. Lincoln Center gives us the full string complement that Russell Bennett devised for his 29-piece ensemble. That’s <em>fifteen</em> string players. Nowadays, it’s rare to find fifteen musicians in a Broadway pit, altogether.</p>\n<p><strong>My Fair Lady opened April 19, 2018, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Bringing the marvelous Alan-Jay Lerner-Frederick Loewe <em>My Fair Lady</em> back to Broadway at Lincoln Center’s big, big Beaumont stage, director Bartlett Sher seems to have had no less than Henrik Ibsen in mind. Not that Sher’s possibly intentional, possibly unconscious inclination is that odd. Shaw was a vocal Ibsen champion at a time when many others may not have been.</p>\n<p>But more of that later, after grateful observations are listed about the grand plusses of the revival and a few notes on the minuses. So what if Lerner, whose centenary this is, switched Shaw’s initial stage direction from “Torrents of heavy spring rain” to “a cold March”? Hardly a calamitous alteration. It certainly alleviates the need to pour water on Michael Yeargan’s capacious set, over which Henry Higgins’ Edwardian home frequently glides slowly forward and back.</p>\n<p>At another moment many may notice, but fewer might care, that the intermission occurs at a different spot. Earlier, more Shaw-Lerner aficionados could tense at the absence of the buskers who appear busking at the very start of the action.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/04/19/my-fair-lady-lerner-loewe-bartlett-sher/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>But these are minor when compared with the fast introduction of squalling flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Lauren Ambrose), briskly annoyed at being closely observed by phonetics professor Henry Higgins (Harry Hadden-Paton) while India-dialect expert Colonel Pickering (Allan Corduner) looks on.</p>\n<p>Just about instantly, it’s clear that the cherished musical comedy roles are in good hands. The ginger-haired Ambrose will tidily handle Eliza’s transition from put-upon street urchin to intelligent woman of the world. Hadden-Paton will expertly shape Higgins as a professionally competent, socially dense fellow who has no clue to recognizing his developing feelings about Eliza. Corduner charms as a great good companion.</p>\n<p>Norbert Leo Butz as unwilling moralist Alfred P. Doolittle appropriates every scene in which he figures, and Diana Rigg—not on a Manhattan stage since 1994, when she won a Tony as Medea—is a sharp-eyed, sharp-tongued Mrs. Higgins.</p>\n<p>With those performers not only acting but singing—and occasionally dancing—this <em>My Fair Lady</em> moves bracingly along. The musical Higgins is known for his speak-sing attack due to the curtailed singing abilities of original interpreter Rex Harrison, but Haddon-Paton, new to these shores (but a <em>Downton Abbey </em>alumnus), actually has formidable pipes. He shows them off sleekly on “Why Can’t the English?” as well as on “I’m an Ordinary Man” and “A Hymn to Him.”</p>\n<p>Ambrose—several years ago an intended Fanny Brice in a <em>Funny Girl</em> revival that never materialized—astounds the house on “I Could Have Danced All Night” and “Without You” and, with a Covent Garden-based male quartet, is part of the lilting “ Wouldn’t It Be Loverly?”</p>\n<p>Jordan Donica, playing Freddy Eynsford-Hill unleashes a &#8220;On the Street Where You Live.&#8221; And as for Butz, he’s the irresistible focus of the production’s most exciting routine, the expanded “Get Me to the Church on Time.” Seemingly greatly expanded from the original number—does this mean the Robert Russell Bennett orchestration and Trude Rittman dance arrangement have been lengthened?—it involves Butz terping and performing top-hot tricks while can-can girls, all rousingly choreographed by Christopher Gattelli, lift their skirts.</p>\n<p>Gattelli also does commendably well by “Ascot Gavotte,” where noses-in-the-air English upper-class members promenade in Catherine Zuber’s striking uniformly gray outfits. (Cecil Beaton favored black-and-white, of course. So Zuber’s is a clever meeting-halfway affair.)</p>\n<p>Gattelli’s choreography is less grand during the embassy ball sequence, when only six couples execute much of the waltzing. And for some reason not exclusively Gattelli’s, the ebullience during “The Rain in Spain”—when Eliza, Higgins and Pickering celebrate her proper vowel break-through—registers as unusually subdued.</p>\n<p>Maybe the toned-down “Rain in Spain” eruption can be traced to the Ibsen tone affecting Sher’s take. It definitely obtains at the end but, because a spoiler lurks, won’t be explicitly described. Suffice it to say that at one point, the perceptive Mrs. Higgins chides Pickering and her son for treating Eliza like a “living doll.”</p>\n<p>Could this phrase have put Sher in mind of <em>A Doll’s House</em>? Perhaps, beause to an extent, Nora and Eliza are similar—a happenstance that Shaw surely recognized. (Mrs. Patrick Campbell, for whom Shaw wrote <em>Pygmalion</em>, had also appeared as Nora.)</p>\n<p>As Shaw indicates of Eliza in his penultimate stage direction, “She sweeps out.“ So of course does Nora. Where Eliza doesn’t sweep out is in Lerner’s version. There, she remains at Higgins’ 27A Wimpole Street, probably about to fetch Higgins the slippers he demands while knowing everything she needs to know about him.</p>\n<p>Lerner is on record as promoting his more or less happy ending because he believes Shaw to be wrong about the prospects for a longer Higgins-Eliza alliance.</p>\n<p>Apparently Sher and Shaw agree heartily. They’re so much in tandem on the Ibsen-esque conclusion that Sher stages a sweeping-out of such dimensions that it has the potential to put off many a Shaw and Lerner partisan. I’m one of those dismayed and so have to enter a dissenting vote.</p>\n<p>Though the offending sweep-out occurs during the final <em>My Fair Lady</em> moments, it can’t completely distract anyone from the abundant successes of the revival. Enough of it is a potent reminder that Lerner, Loewe (with original director Moss Hart) were able to take a property that others couldn’t tame—Oscar Hammerstein II and Richard Rodgers backed off—into one of the most entertaining musicals ever written.</p>\n<p><strong>My Fair Lady opened April 19, 2018, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When Mark Medoff’s <em>Children of a Lesser God</em> bowed on Broadway in 1980 after a Berkshire Theatre Group tryout, it nabbed the Tony, The Pulitzer Prize and, on opening in London, the Olivier. This isn’t to say that the Pulitzer crowd, for instance, is always right—not when in 1962 the administrators passed on Edward Albee’s <em>Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</em></p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the accumulated Medoff citations suggest that something positive about the drama must endure. It does in this tale of James Leeds, a teacher of the deaf who specializes in perfecting the ability to speak, and Sarah Norman (Lauren Ridloff), a deaf woman strongly uninterested in learning to speak.</p>\n<p>Though at first the argumentative Sarah rebuffs the initially patient James because he’s not deaf, he soon overcomes her resistance to him—but not her conviction never to speak. He gets through to her so effectively in one way that they begin a romance, eventually marry but then continue to differ, often volatilely, over her inflexible attitude.</p>\n<p>They bicker vocally and through American Sign Language (ASL), with James simultaneous speaking and signing (an activity known as sim-coming). Intermittently, school head Mr. Franklin (Anthony Edwards) interrupts, as do speaking deaf students Lydia (Treshelle Edmond), who has a crush on James, and Orin Dennis (John McGinty), who sometimes resents James’s manner. Mrs. Norman (Kecia Lewis), Sarah’s mother from whom she’s been estranged, is invited back into her distressed life.</p>\n<p>At its core <em>Children of a Lesser God</em> is a love story. It’s a love story that becomes a story about nurturing love in a troubled married life. It’s the story of a marriage where one partner has focused on his belief in an ability to change the other—and the unfortunate consequences of the misconception. To that end, it can be said that Medoff’s work also operates as a metaphor for any marriage where one partner is under the misguided impression that he or she can affect change when few people ever truly do. It’s a pulsing screed of miscommunications’ tribulations.</p>\n<p>Thirty-eight years later, <em>Children of a Lesser God</em>, as tightly directed by Kenny Leon, has the power it had—and will likely have 38 years and more on. The depiction of a man and a woman who love each other but stay stubbornly committed to conflicting beliefs reflects a universal happenstance. (The same for goes for same-sex couples, of course)</p>\n<p>Needless to say the play’s power is maximized through the forceful performances. Jackson and Ridloff offer those. At the outset, Jackson is an understanding mentor confident he’s able to get through to his students no matter how recalcitrant they may be. James’ slow realization that he’s been wrong about his intentions, as inflexible as Sarah’s, is something Jackson achieves movingly.</p>\n<p>The indefatigable Sarah—whose fury about an unwelcoming hearing world is constant and whose fragility is underlined by costume designer Dede Ayite’s filmy outfits—is outstanding. She’s a dervish of discontent. Lewis, Edmond, McGinty, and Lewis, as well as Julee Cerda as part of a commission investigating the school, are fine in support.</p>\n<p>Derek McLane has designed what at first looks to be a puzzlingly abstract set. Prominent on it are a series of doors placed separately and at right angles to each other. Mike Baldassari has lighted the insides of the doorless blue frames a deep Dan Flavin pink that gives the production an eerie glow.</p>\n<p>The reason for the unspecific location—standing for many locations—is explained by a questionable program line: “The play takes place in the mind of James Leeds.” In other words, <em>Children of a Lesser God</em> is a memory play. This puts it in a category including, for one unforgettable instance, <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>.</p>\n<p>Inserting the explanatory line here has the curious effect of implying that what the audience is seeing might be factually loose, whereas it’s usually assumed that memory plays, unless otherwise mentioned in the script, are presenting unvarnished truths.</p>\n<p>Since many patrons may not even find this disclaimer, it can’t be regarded as more than a minor drawback. Not so minor is another problem in the writing and performing. Throughout the play, James not only translates what Sarah is saying but also speaks and signs everything he says. Unfortunately, the process, not required in real life, is increasingly trying.</p>\n<p>It’s especially so because much of the intensifying dialog that leads to the play’s harrowing climax is unnecessarily repetitious. It may be that the Tony, Pulitzer and Olivier deciders thought so highly of the themes at hand that they overlooked the attenuation.</p>\n<p>But nowadays? Since 1980 playwriting has been noticeably transformed.   Then, the trend towards intermissionless 90-minute (or shorter) plays hadn’t quite kicked in. Were Medoff writing <em>Children of a Lesser God</em> today, however, he might have kept it trimmer, thereby minimizing both the strain on any actor taking up the demands of the James Leeds and the strain on viewers having to listen to and watch him carry unrelentingly on.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, what Sarah and he have to say to each other, no matter now they express it, is emotionally cogent. <em>Children of a Lesser God</em> packs the solar plexus wallop punch it always has.</p>\n<p><strong>Children of a Lesser God </strong><strong>opened April 11, 2018, at Studio 54 and runs through May 27.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Being immersed in the theater for most of my life, I forget that not everybody is familiar with the bittersweet joys of <em>Carousel</em>, one among the several enduring musicals created by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. During a preview performance of the latest Broadway revival of <em>Carousel</em>, which opened tonight, widespread murmurs of surprise erupted amid the audience in reaction to unexpected turns in the plot for this poignant romance between a carnival barker and a factory girl.</p>\n<p>Subsequent sounds of sniffles and rustling tissues at the Imperial Theatre were not so astonishing. Ever since its premiere 73 years ago, <em>Carousel</em> has remained a true-blue tearjerker in the most honorable sense of the term. The artful simplicity of Hammerstein’s heartfelt text and the lyrical loveliness of Rodgers’ music for <em>Carousel</em> rarely fail to tap into wellsprings of emotion. It is a supreme example of Broadway musical storytelling from its Golden Age.</p>\n<p>Bringing great works back to Broadway is never easy. Even the finest vintage musicals can be damaged by directorial misguidance, as witnessed by such sad occasions as the revivals of <em>Porgy and Bess</em> in 2012 and <em>Guys and Dolls</em> in 2009. Then again, old-timers will recall how Nicholas Hytner’s striking production of <em>Carousel </em>for Lincoln Center Theater back in 1994 discovered fresh wonders within the musical (as well as launched Audra McDonald as a rising star).</p>\n<p>The latest rendition of <em>Carouse</em>l is scarcely so revelatory. It is smudged visually. Yet, as briskly staged by veteran director Jack O’Brien, this production for the greater part proves satisfying. It is beautifully sung, exuberantly danced and ardently performed.</p>\n<p>As far as the work itself is concerned, O’Brien has wisely trimmed a few sludgy passages out of the script and excised “Geraniums in the Winder” and “There’s Nothin’ So Bad for a Woman,” two minor numbers from the clambake sequence that nobody is likely to miss and which tightens up the show’s long second act. The trickiest part of the musical, which gave Rodgers and Hammerstein problems during the show’s out-of-town tryout, relates to the later scenes when Billy, the protagonist, arrives in the afterlife.</p>\n<p>O’Brien and Justin Peck, the choreographer, provide the audience with a taste of these mystical doings during the first seconds of the show’s musical prelude: Suppliants kneeling in prayer materialize in front of a giant bulls-eye moon. This brief vision then dissolves into the traditional opening scene as a carnival and merry-go-round burst forth into festive swing as Billy encounters Julie, the mill worker who soon becomes his wife. Thereafter, as the story set in late 19<sup>th</sup>-century New England proceeds, fatal decisions that Billy will make are silently observed by a gentleman dressed in a white suit, who eventually is revealed in the scenes “up there” as the Starkeeper who guides Billy towards redemption.</p>\n<p>Giving the audience hints of what’s to come is a smart touch, although “up there,” with its swirling white fog, smattering of stars, and denizens clad in sackcloth-and-glitter shmatas, looks none too appealing. Designed by the eminent Santo Loquasto, whose artistry serves O’Brien’s concepts, the show’s settings are frankly theatrical, with two-dimensional trees, transportable rock outcroppings, and flat seascapes ornamented by toy sailboats. Unnaturally illuminated by Brian MacDevitt, maybe such artificial environs are meant to suggest the illusory nature of our world, but whatever they are, they sure ain’t pretty. Casting aside those nasty angel’s garments, the nice period clothes otherwise designed by Ann Roth help to brighten the surroundings.</p>\n<p>While the visuals are dubious, this <em>Carousel</em> sounds terrific, with fresh, windswept orchestrations crafted by Jonathan Tunick and an assembly of fine voices to sing classic numbers such as “You’ll Never Walk Alone” and “June is Bustin’ Out All Over.” The ensemble vigorously swirls through the frequently circular rotations of Peck’s jaunty choreography that naturally flows through the production.</p>\n<p>The leading actors provide confident, well-sung performances. A sturdy Joshua Henry brings to his imposing Billy a resonant baritone voice and expressive acting skills that culminate in his splendid delivery of the challenging “Soliloquy” as Billy ponders future fatherhood. Sincere and steadfast as Julie, a loving soul who understands Billy better than he does himself, Jessie Mueller offers a quietly touching “What’s the Use of Wond’rin?” Their odd chemistry as a couple reveals how Billy is absorbed almost entirely with himself and how the selfless Julie accepts it simply as the way he happens to be.</p>\n<p>Delightful is the only way to describe Lindsay Mendez’s high-spirited depiction of Carrie, Julie’s closest chum, who weds a self-assured sardine magnate-in-the-making capably played and handsomely sung by Alexander Gemignani. Their voices intertwine charmingly on the cozy “When the Children Are Asleep,” which perfectly offers the sort of homely interlude that Hammerstein used to say always made him cry.</p>\n<p>Renée Fleming’s cheerful musicality as Nettie Fowler, Margaret Colin’s acrid presence as the carousel owner, and a kindly John Douglas Thompson as the well-dressed Starkeeper, contribute other pleasures to the heavenly stage magic conjured up by Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein at their matchless finest.</p>\n<p>How wonderful it must be for anyone to take a spin on <em>Carousel</em> for the very first time.</p>\n<p><strong>Carousel opened April 15, 2018, at Imperial Theatre and runs through September 16.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Of all the sublime works that make it impossible to dismiss Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II as simple sentimentalists, none does so more gloriously or wrenchingly than <em>Carousel</em>. Adapted from the Hungarian play <em>Liliom</em>, the musical offers an unflinching look at our capacity for violence, despair, and redemption, with a score as soaring and searing as any that Rodgers—one of the greatest melodists of the 20<sup>th</sup> century—wrote. Simply put, if you don’t leave a staging of <em>Carousel</em> both devastated and uplifted, it’s because the production failed.</p>\n<p>Suffice it to say the new Broadway revival that opened this week succeeds on these terms, and pretty much any other that a fan would consider. This <em>Carousel</em> may not have the raw, startling immediacy that distinguished the last Broadway production, by Lincoln Center Theater in 1994. But under Jack O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s expert direction, with new choreography by ballet wunderkind Justin Peck, it fully serves the overwhelming beauty and boldness of material that, 73 years after the show’s premiere, remains as subversive as ever in its compassion and its keen awareness of the contradictions that make us human.</p>\n<p>The central love story, which unfolds in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries in a small fishing village in Maine, may actually seem more controversial today, as it involves a man—erstwhile carousel barker and towering anti-hero Billy Bigelow—who hits the woman he loves, the gentle Julie Jordan, and causes her constant worry, but manages to sustain her devotion. What do we make, in the #MeToo era, of Julie explaining to a concerned friend that Billy just can’t find a job? Or of her singing, in the shimmering, shattering ballad “What’s the Use of Wond’rin’?,” “Something gave him the things that are his/One of those things is you”?</p>\n<p>Billy is, notably, an outsider from the start, regarded with suspicion within this close-knit community, and O’Brien has added to the complex dynamics in his relationship with Julie, and the topicality of this staging, by casting an African-American actor: the robustly gifted Joshua Henry, a standout in talent-packed productions such as <em>Shuffle Along&#8230;</em> and <em>The Scottsboro Boys</em>. It’s impossible to watch Billy’s run-ins with local police—or to listen to his indignant appeal later, to a much higher authority, for fairness—without considering recent injustices. The lithely handsome Henry, whose powerful voice is relatively light in timbre, also brings a tender sensuality to the role, revealing the vulnerability under Billy’s intimidating stances.</p>\n<p>Julie, in fact, for all her suffering, is the stronger and more resilient of the two; capturing the spirit she is forced to suppress, and the melancholy that results, is no small feat. Jessie Mueller, whose versatility as an actress and singer has been evident in roles ranging from Cinderella (in <em>Into the Woods</em>) to Carole King (<em>Beautiful</em>), meets the challenge with a performance that combines palpable sorrow with quiet dignity and fortitude. Even if you’re not familiar with the harrowing twist that seemingly seals her doom, or the bittersweet ending that follows, you’ll recognize this Julie as a survivor.</p>\n<p>The cast also includes the magnificent John Douglas Thompson, lending gravitas and folksy wit as the mysterious Starkeeper who follows Billy from the beginning, and opera star Renée Fleming, who as Julie’s nurturing cousin Nettie Fowler gets to mine the warm depths of her soprano, and add lustrous embellishment to classics such as “June Is Bustin&#8217; Out All Over” and “You’ll Never Walk Alone.” Lindsay Mendez and Alexander Gemignani offer deft comic relief as Julie’s buddy Carrie Pipperidge (another role Mueller has played to acclaim, twice) and Carrie’s aspirational beau and Billy’s foil, Enoch Snow.</p>\n<p>No player in this <em>Carousel</em> is more valuable, though, than Peck, the New York City Ballet’s youngest resident choreographer to date, who has expanded the dancing—originally choreographed by the groundbreaking Agnes DeMille—in ways that both reinforce and further explore character. For “Blow High, Blow Low,” Billy joins his ne’er-do-well companion Jigger, played with sexy swagger by City Ballet principal Amar Ramasar, and Jigger’s fellow sailors in a production number that would make Jerome Robbins and his Jets and Sharks proud in its expression of machismo through dance. The more extensive ballet that Rodgers and DeMille provided for Billy and Julie’s daughter, Louise, becomes a showcase for the City Ballet soloist Brittany Pollack, whose radiant dancing conveys both the sense of mischief and the deep discontent that are Billy’s legacy.</p>\n<p>By the end, we realize that Louise has also inherited her mother’s forbearance, albeit with a more developed sense of herself and her autonomy. A teenage girl, the product of a tragic romance, is left with greater potential for self-determination than either parent; in underlining that point, and overall, the new <em>Carousel</em> is at once faithful and forward-thinking—just the qualities this timeless treasure demands and deserves.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"gmail_default\"><strong>Carousel opened April 12, 2018, at the Imperial Theatre and runs through September 16.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s a bizarre decision, to revive <em>Children of a Lesser God</em> in 2018.</p>\n<p>And it’s an equally bizarre decision to open said production with several uninterrupted minutes of Stevie Wonder, played over a moodily lit stage, after the houselights are down and as audience members shift awkwardly in their seats, wondering if it might be some new sort of exhortation to unwrap your hard candies.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the problem is that rights weren’t available to the more obvious sound cue here, a dramatic reading of Kipling’s “The White Man’s Burden.” Because this is a play that holds as its hero a hearing, white, male bully of a speech teacher, boldly dedicated to saving his hearing-impaired charges by training them to speak and, occasionally, with the attractive female ones, committing light sexual assault. It was a Tony Award winner for best play in 1980, translated into the William Hurt-Marlee Matlin film in 1986, and now, freshly revived at Studio 54, appears today as a remarkably, uncomfortably dated work. (Though Roundabout Theatre Company gets a producer credit, presumably because it’s the landlord, this is not a Roundabout production.)</p>\n<p>The TV and movie star Joshua Jackson gets top billing, bulldozing his way through his Broadway debut. He’s James Leeds, a theoretically charismatic new therapist at a school for the deaf. He is an idealist, we’re made to believe, a sixties wannabe-radical (he burned his Blue Cross card to protest the draft, because he was scared to burn his actual draft card) who served in the Peace Corps. “The guy who taught the Ecuadorians to grow and love brussels sprouts,” he calls himself at one point, and no doubt Ecuador renamed an airport in his honor.</p>\n<p>Soon James meets Sarah, a beautiful and strong-willed student in the school, who refuses to make any effort to speak. (Lauren Ridloff, making her Broadway debut, is a former Miss Deaf America and, on the evidence, a spectacular actress.) She’s taking a political position: She’s fully able to communicate, she points out in one argument; why is it her job to learn how to communicate verbally rather than a hearing person’s responsibility to learn to sign?</p>\n<p>Playwright Mark Medoff makes Sarah 26 years old, conveniently, but, still, she’s introduced to James as a student, a reluctant speaker whom he should “take on in his spare time.” Effectively, we’ll eventually learn, she’s a ward of the school, there since childhood, cut off from her family, happily working as a dormitory maid. When she refuses to follows James’s instruction, his solution is to ask her to dinner at “a little Italian restaurant I discovered last weekend.” The next time they get together, they fight a bit and then James stops her from leaving and forces a kiss. His next line of dialogue moves the moment from Horace-Mann-in-the-1970s weirdness to Weinstein-era alarm bells. “It’s always worked before,” he says. “See, when I get in trouble, I kiss the girl and make everything better.” She runs off.</p>\n<p>The first act, as James continues to both bully and seduce Sarah, is icky. They fall in love, and they marry, but in a dysfunctional, James-dominated relationship. The lack of any chemistry between the leads doesn&#8217;t help. And that this production, staged by the great, Tony-winning African-American director Kenny Leon, makes Sarah (and her mother) black turns it from icky to deeply discomfiting.</p>\n<p>The second act, when Sarah is no longer a preyed-upon student, when James the teacher is no longer shimmying up trees and through dorm windows, is less gross but no less uncomfortable. It’s even easier to mansplain when the recipient of the lectures is literally silent, and James (and Jackson’s portrayal of him) milks that to the hilt: It’s a play about deaf people, and there is constant shouting. Even the theoretically progressive point about which everyone is shouting—that deaf people are entitled to valuable lives on their own terms—is a call for self-assertion and group pride that may have been eye-opening in 1980 but seems self-evident today.</p>\n<p><em>Children of a Lesser God</em> has some things going for it. Ridloff is sensational, as expressive as she is lovely, able to convey wells of shame and frustration and pride and anger without ever uttering a word. The play is described as taking place “in the mind of James Leeds,” which labels it simultaneously a memory play and his take on the relationship with Sarah (can you imagine being such an ass even in your own recounting?) and, finally, as a world in which people hear words and the deaf are considered silent. The simple set of doorways and treetrunks, by Derek McLane, and especially the lighting, by Mike Bladassari, are lovely. Kecia Lewis has quiet, sad dignity as Sarah’s mother, John McGinty is compelling as Orin, the lip-reading student trying to take a stand for deaf rights, and Treshelle Edmond gives ebullience to Lydia, the younger student who grows infatuated with James.</p>\n<p>The bad guy in the deaf-rights fight is the school’s punctilious director, Mr. Franklin, a man who on one hand has devoted his life to educating deaf kids and on the other says things like, “I won’t continue in the field if the subjects of my efforts are going to tell me how to minister to them.” He is a bore and an ass, and mostly forgettable, and <em>ER </em>residuals must not be what they used to because for some reason Anthony Edwards has chosen to take the role.</p>\n<p>Early in the second act, Sarah believes she’s found happiness and contentment as Mrs. Leeds, cooking quiches and showing off her new blender. Eventually, by its end, she’s fled their home and James’s rages, returned to her mother. For the relationship at the heart of the play, that’s supposed to be a tragedy. For an audience today, it looks like freedom.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Children of a Lesser God</em> opened April 11, 2018, at Studio 54 and runs through May 27.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Tina Fey, having conquered the small screen, the big screen, the best seller list and who knows what other celebrity/writer/personality yardsticks, has now brought a stage adaptation of her rambunctious 2004 movie <em>Mean Girls</em> to the August Wilson Theatre, and who’d imagine that we’d be conjoining Wilson and Fey in the same sentence? But life upon the wicked stage ain’t ever what a girl supposes, to quote the immortal Oscar, whose <em>Oklahoma!</em> opened 75 years ago last weekend. And who’d imagine that we’d be conjoining Hammerstein and Fey in the same sentence?</p>\n<p>Here comes Fey storming onto the Rialto, having never concocted such a thing before. Perhaps she might profitably have taken a few lessons on musical comedy, you might wonder? No; maybe she should be <em>giving</em> lessons. Because <em>Mean Girls</em> is “fetch.” Which in the parlance might be considered “mean good”; or as Tina might say, but Oscar most assuredly would not, “tits.” The legally pink juniors from North Shore High have taken residence of the stage long claimed by those Jersey boys, and these Chicago girls are likely to enjoy a similarly raucous reign.</p>\n<p><em>Mean Girls</em> is like a chocolate box filled with goodies. One can imagine the authoress sitting on a hammock in her backyard with one of those 48-piece Whitman’s Samplers, sampling all four dozen and carefully replacing the ones not to her liking in the crinkly brown wrappers (as if an acolyte might come along to taste the half-eaten rejects). Because no, not <em>every</em> concoction in this new musical is 100 percent up to snuff; but most of them are.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/04/08/mean-girls-feys-film-is-very-fetch-on-broadway/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>We can skip the book, as we’ve already made clear that it is pretty damn funny, and what a novel statement is <em>that</em> to make about a contemporary musical comedy. Not since <em>The Book of Mormon</em>, maybe; which is not coincidental, as <em>Mean Girls</em> comes from that musical’s wizardly Casey Nicholaw along with other cohorts. (These include universally respected executive producer Stuart Thompson, who died in August but retains producer billing on the new show). Director-choreographer Nicholaw, who is known for dance numbers that are so over-the-top that you can’t possibly top them except he continually does, is in a happy mood here; a tap-happy mood, if you will, as he returns to <em>Mormon</em> form after three less gleeful efforts.</p>\n<p>The score comes from newcomer Jeff Richmond, composer of TV’s <em>30 Rock</em> and husband to the librettist, and lyricist Nell Benjamin. To say that the latter was lyricist of <em>Legally Blonde</em> is not altogether beside the point; at times, <em>Mean Girls</em> plays something like a mix of <em>Legally Blonde</em> and <em>Mormon</em>. Benjamin has heretofore demonstrated a way with words; she was also author of the underappreciated but outlandishly funny comedy <em>The Explorer’s Club</em>. The Richmond/Benjamin wares are consistently amusing and more than functional, which compared to the winter/spring crop of musicals is high praise indeed. At some point the songwriters seem to have run out of steam, leaving too many songs that seem like what we just heard. Even so, the score is mostly cheery and spirited.</p>\n<p>The joys of the evening continue with the scenery by <em>Mormon</em>ite Scott Pask, which serves as a perfect palette for the video design by Finn Ross and Adam Young: <em>Mean Girls</em> continually pops when Nicholaw mixes dance moves with the physical goings on. The costumes of Gregg Barnes and lighting by Kenneth Posner round out an altogether nifty production. The lead producers are longtime Fey cohort Lorne Michaels, of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> and producer of the <em>Mean Girls</em> film; the aforementioned Thompson; and Sonia Friedman, the producer of seemingly every West End hit of the past decade, including the U.K. <em>Mormon</em>. Friedman’s present slate includes <em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em> and Jez Butterworth’s thoroughly astonishing <em>The Ferryman </em>(opening at the Jacobs in October, and get your tickets now).</p>\n<p>The cast, too, enhances the fun. Erika Henningsen, whose only Broadway appearance has been as a replacement Fantine in <em>Les Misérables</em>, makes a refreshingly bright impression as Cady, the home-schooled girl transplanted from a Kenya game park to the Chicago jungle. (Watch for the manner in which Nicholaw and designers skewer Disney’s African musical.) Taylor Louderman, of <em>Bring It On: The Musical</em>, leads the plastic mean girls of the title; she is treacherously lethal as the first act Regina, and effectively handles the comedy as she carbo-balloons into non-pink sweatpants. Kate Rockwell (<em>Bring It On</em>) garners character sympathy and plenty of laughter as Karen, the vapid mean girl. Ashley Park is delightful and ultimately touching as the overly accommodating Gretchen, our appreciation growing as we realize midway through that this is the same actor who made a stirring Tuptim in the Kelli O’Hara <em>King and I</em>.</p>\n<p>Two performers more or less pilfer the evening’s comedy. Grey Henson, a replacement Elder McKinley in <em>Mormon</em>, sweeps through the evening as the wry Damian. Henson is rewarded with “Stop,” a glitz and tap Nicholawian showstopper that is altogether purloined from “Turn It Off” in <em>Mormon</em>. And if you think building one of these numbers is easy, head over to <em>SpongeBob,</em> <em>Margaritaville</em> or <em>Frozen</em>, where they attempt the same with more perspiration than inspiration.</p>\n<p>The supercharged secret weapon of the evening is Kerry Butler, playing three adult roles. Well remembered from <em>Bat Boy</em> and <em>Hairspray</em>, Butler is altogether uproarious here. (While one assumes that no dogs were harmed in the production of <em>Mean Girls</em>, Butler might make your mind momentarily flash to Edward Albee’s <em>The Goat</em>.) The rest of the cast is terrific, with Cheech Manohar and Mathlete buddies Ben Cook and Nikhil Saboo meriting special mention.</p>\n<p><em>Mean Girls </em>does not apparently aspire to be an instant Broadway classic on the level of <em>Mormon</em>, <em>Hamilton</em> or <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em>, but it succeeds as an exuberantly mirthful crowd-pleaser. In high school parlance, Nicholaw earns himself a scarlet-and-spangled A while Fey graduates summa cum laughter.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mean Girls</em> opened April 8, 2018, at the August Wilson Theatre.

Fey is joined here by the composer Jeff Richmond, who is her husband, the lyricist Nell Benjamin, and, significantly, the director and choreographer Casey Nicholaw, the vet of <em>Book of Mormon </em>and <em>Spamalot</em> (and so much more) who puts on a fun and funny show perhaps better than anyone else on Broadway.</p>\n<p>That’s what they’ve achieved here: <em>Mean Girls </em>delightfully fun and funny, silly and sweet, energetic and adorable, sarcastic but good-hearted. It delights devoted fans of the movie, but it stands on its own stilettos as an original musical.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/04/08/mean-girls-tina-feys-little-foxes-slay-broadway/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>You know the story: Nice girl Cady moves back to the United States for high school after growing up with her biologists parents in Africa, where they do field work. Recognizing the tribal dynamics among American high schoolers as similar to those of the primates her parents studied, she decides to infiltrate the Alphas, a cool-girl (slash mean-girl) clique called the plastics, and undermine the queen of the plastics, a blonde terror named Regina George. Along the way, Cady falls in love with Regina’s ex, the hunky Aaron, and gets so caught up in her manipulations that she becomes just as bad a Regina. Ultimately, of course, good prevails, Cady and Aaron end up both kind and together, and it all it takes is a bus accident to bring about the happy ending.</p>\n<p>Fey’s script retains the same story and many of the movie’s most famous lines, but she’s also created a fully theatrical world. Sweet-kid sidekicks Damian and Janis get framing-device opening and closing numbers, and Damian’s theatricality—he’s the one who is, of course, “almost too gay to function”—is amped up, putting a stage kid on stage.</p>\n<p>But what works so well is that Fey’s smart, sly tone stays intact, even as Richmond and Benjamin add around 20 songs, a pop-rock pastiche of a score that’s sometimes guitar rock, sometime hip-hop-infused, occasionally old-time Broadway—there’s a big tap number, of course—and sometimes soulful, especially for Regina’s Adele-sounding, Bond-theme-like numbers. (Benjamin’s lyrics, of course, preserve Fey’s tone and wit.)</p>\n<p>Even better, it’s all spectacularly performed by a razor-sharp young cast. They’re all great, but even so some stand out. Erika Henningsen knocks your socks off in her big numbers as Cady, and Taylor Louderman makes a powerful Regina. Ashley Park, as Gretchen Winters, the eager deputy to Regina’s tyranny, is the great comic talent of the show, and Grey Henson as too-gay-to-function Damian pulls off a sassy second-act opener that might be the highlight of the show. And Kerry Butler charms her way through all the adult-women roles, including Regina’s ditzy mom and also Ms. Norbury, the math teacher played by Fey in the movie and who here is costumed to bare more than a passing resemblance to a certain beloved comedic writer and actor.</p>\n<p>Even with all that talent, though, it’s Nicholaw’s work that makes <em>Mean Girls</em> a triumph. From the nonstop action that lets one scene slide into the next to the exuberant choreography that sets teenagers dancing almost like apes in the moment Cady surveys the primate behavior to numbers that include both a real tap dance and, elsewhere, the audible effect of one, rendered with cafeteria trays, his direction sharp, sure, relentless (in the good way) and rousing.</p>\n<p>Still, one quibble: As ably as this musical is constructed and performed, and even with its jokes about social media and smartphones, to update the movie script, it can still feel surprisingly out of touch with the moment. For a show about teenage angst and redemption, one that makes all the right progressive arguments for believing in yourself and being true to who you are, with the announced moral that “calling someone stupid won’t make you any smarter,” it’s incredibly white and straight. There’s an ethnically diverse ensemble of perfectly fit 20-somethings, of course, and one Asian actor (playing the pathologically submissive Gretchen). But all the other leads are white. And every teenager is straight, even all the hornily coupling band kids—except for roly-poly, sardonic, celibate Damian.</p>\n<p>The otherwise thoroughly mediocre <em>Escape to Margaritaville</em> quietly includes one gay couple among the drunkenly cavorting island visitors. (They’d be miserable, of course, amid all the bro-ery. But they’re there.) And <em>Miss You Like Hell,</em> at the Public, features a noticeably diverse cast and chorus, including plus-sized and AARP-member dancers. It’s a shame this excellent show, with such excellent intentions, couldn’t see its way to such broad-mindedness.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mean Girls</em> opened April 8, 2018, at the August Wilson Theatre.

Photo: Brigitte Lacombe</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Towards the end of <em>Angels In America</em>, now being splendidly revived on Broadway, a gay man dying of AIDS pleads for more life, noting, &#8220;I&#8217;ve lived through such terrible times, and there are people who live through much worse, but&#8230;You see them living anyway.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Compare that philosophy to one being espoused just a few blocks away, in a stellar new production of another Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Edward Albee&#8217;s <em>Three Tall Women</em><em>, </em>by a woman in seeming good health, and of considerable means. If the very young were told honestly what life might have in store for them, posits the character, identified simply as B, &#8220;the streets&#8217;d be littered with adolescent corpses!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Though clearly not intended as some great declaration of truth, the line has a specious ring—as does one uttered later in the play, by an older woman, A, also wealthy, who proposes that the happiest moment in life is “coming to the end of it.”</p>\n<p>If you’re not familiar with the play, A, B, and a third character, C, are intended to represent women at different stages of life, though other aspects of their roles change. They embody, in reverse order, carefree young adulthood, jaded middle age, and advanced old age, in which we find A still proud but in substantial physical and mental decline. A young man also figures into the story, the product of a marriage that brought both added privilege and misery.</p>\n<p>The personal struggles of the privileged, a frequent subject in Albee’s work, are not in themselves likely to inspire much sympathy in our fraught time. But the women in <em>Women</em>, a play informed by Albee’s own difficult relationship with his mom, also survive and even thrive in their own ways; the play is less an existential argument or lament than a canny, thought-provoking and often quite funny character study. As such, it succeeds gloriously in this staging, thanks to Joe Mantello’s simultaneously razor-sharp and tender direction and a trio of ideally cast actresses—Alison Pill, Laurie Metcalf, and the miraculous Glenda Jackson—all at the top of their game.</p>\n<p>The multifaceted Mantello, who in his last Broadway outing offered a bold reimagining of a character based on Tennessee Williams, by Williams (in Sam Gold’s revelatory <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>), takes fewer liberties in returning to the director’s chair. The clean, tasteful scenic design, by Miriam Buether, perfectly serves the milieu established in the more naturalistic first act, set in A’s bedroom as death approaches. Here B is presented as A’s acerbic caretaker and C as a young woman representing A’s attorney, who has come in futile hopes of putting A’s affairs in order.</p>\n<p>The conflicts and uneasy camaraderie forged between these women—how Metcalf’s way-past-frazzled B withstands the endless, sometimes senseless chatter of Jackson’s A, while trying to prevent Pill’s curious, confident C from encouraging her boss—foreshadow the charged interaction in Act Two, when character details are rearranged to tighten and complicate the bond between the three. C begins both acts with the breezy self-assurance particular to youth, alternately frustrated and amused by the elder figures; in an Act Two monologue, Pill adopts a flirty, almost conspiratorial air as C shares details of her first seduction.</p>\n<p>Pill then expertly manages C’s transition from complacency to sheer horror, and denial, as A and B school her on some of what lies ahead, having a bit of fun themselves in the process. Metcalf savors the biting wit in her lines so thoroughly and adroitly that B can almost seem triumphant— until we come to grasp the depth of her bitterness and anger, at which point the actress shatters us.</p>\n<p>As for Jackson, whose recent accomplishments include playing King Lear at the Old Vic, she is simply a marvel. About a decade younger than her character (the actress turns 82 in May), she allows us to see the elegant and entitled young woman—tall indeed, literally and figuratively—she once was, the ravages she has endured, and the clear line connecting them. Repulsive in her bigotry, elusive even beyond her fractured memory, Jackson’s A nonetheless exudes life, from her booming voice to the twinkle in her eye. She makes us laugh through our fear, and feel compassion as well.</p>\n<p>The performance, in fact, refutes A’s theory that life becomes sweetest when we’re past mortal cares. Long may Jackson harbor such concerns, and share them with us.</p>\n<p><strong>Three Tall Women opened March 29, 2018, at the Golden Theatre and runs through June 24.

Photo: Brigitte Lacombe</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Glenda Jackson! Glenda Jackson! Glenda Jackson! Oh, we’ll get back to that….</p>\n<p>How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is to have a thankless child, you might have heard old man Lear complain; Edward Albee, it seems, knew something about that. <em>Three Tall Women</em> is about three tall women, yes; but He—a character referred to with increasing vehemence by the ladies in question—is the fly in the ointment, the serpent in the pantry, the poison in the nectar. This mysterious He never gets a chance to actually defend himself, the author having chosen to leave all the talking to his title characters. Albee being Albee, though, “He” doesn’t need a defense—not when mother is hung by her own petard, or rather her own dialogue.  Strung, quartered, and lacerated, too.</p>\n<p><em>Three Tall Women</em> was a revelation when it first appeared at the Vineyard in 1994, following a preliminary 1991 English-language production in Vienna. Albee was outcast at the time; the author of <em>Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</em> and <em>A Delicate Balance</em> had been box office poison since 1966. His three commercially-produced Broadway plays of the 1980s lasted forty performances combined; hence, the new work was relegated to an off-Broadway non-profit. It didn’t help that Albee waspishly labeled Broadway, in the press, as “our national disgrace.”</p>\n<p>But <em>Three Tall Women</em>, with a cast headed by the little-known Myra Carter and the legendary Marian Seldes, was instantly heralded as one of the strongest and most effective dramas of the time. Albee, no, was not washed up; and he triumphed, winning him the 1994 Pulitzer Prize, his third. (A revival of the 1993 prize-winner, Tony Kushner’s <em>Angels in America</em>, opened four nights ago as the most dynamic production of the 2017-18 season—until tonight’s premiere, that is.)</p>\n<p>Albee’s play transferred uptown for a successful off-Broadway run and was seen later that year on the West End (starring Maggie Smith, and wouldn’t we have like to have seen <em>that</em> production). <em>Three Tall Women</em> has never been produced on Broadway, though, until now.  While memory burnishes the original production and the original cast, the play—in this new staging by Joe Mantello—seems even more dynamic and brilliant, in the “luminous” sense of the word. One imagines that the author, who died in 2016, would love it; although knowing the prickly Albee, it’s anybody’s guess.</p>\n<p>The play tells of a dying invalid of 92 or perhaps 91, she doesn’t care to remember. Crotchety, vulgar and all-round disagreeable, the role offers a tour de force opportunity for the right actress; and Jackson, in her fifth Broadway visit, <em>is</em> the right actress. She has been hurtling words on stage and screen with scalpel-like intensity since 1965, when the young actress stabbed Ian Richardson in the bathtub. (That is, while playing Charlotte Corday to Ian’s Jean-Paul Marat in Peter Brooks’ legendary <em>Marat/Sade</em>.) Jackson has always been a performer with commanding control, traits which make her <em>Three Tall Women</em> performance soar. She has two Oscars and two Emmys on her mantle, and might care to make room for a Tony come June.</p>\n<p>Sharing the stage are two characters, one of whom is 52 while the other is 26; Albee cryptically calls them “B” and “C,” with Jackson essaying “A.” Describing the plot would spoil the playwright’s conceit. Let’s just say that the play is something of a nostalgic valentine to the author’s mother, as in the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre.</p>\n<p>B is played by Laurie Metcalf, an expert and powerful actress along the lines of Jackson. Metcalf seemingly underplays the role until the author gives her a lacerating passage, at which point the method of the play crystalizes. The late Seldes swooped through the role, dominating our view. Metcalf does so much more by doing so much less; another masterful performance from the actress, who triumphed on the very same stage last spring in <em>A Doll’s House, Part 2</em>. The cast is rounded out by Alison Pill, who remains ever memorable from <em>The Lieutenant of Inishmore</em>. Pill is excellent here, in a role which is by design less assured and flashy than the other two tall women.</p>\n<p>Mantello once again demonstrates his sensitive touch for high drama, as in <em>The Humans</em> and <em>Other Desert Cities</em>. He and set designer Miriam Buether have some tricks up their joint sleeves, about which the less said the better the surprise. (Mantello was very much on my mind entering the Golden, having spent the prior two evenings at <em>Angels in America</em>—in the original Broadway production of which he vibrantly created the role of Louis Ironson.)</p>\n<p>Buether is a British designer whose stunning work you might remember from <em>A Doll’s House, Part 2</em> and <em>Cock</em>.  (In last year’s <em>Albion</em> at the Almeida, she constructed a set in which the actors literally planted hundreds of potted plants during the play, climaxing with a rainstorm which turned the stage into a full mudbath.)  Here she gives us a simple, “wealthy” bedroom that sits there reeking of elegance. Until Buether and Mantello pull an intriguing sleight-of-hand on us, and later cap the evening with a final stunning burst of theatricality.</p>\n<p>Frances Cotter Albee died in 1989, after which her not-so-dutiful son set out to memorialize her (musing with filial candor that there was perhaps “too much blood under the bridge”).  A season-and-a-half after the playwright’s death, <em>Three Tall Women</em> stands as a riveting, acid-dipped memorial to the both of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Three Tall Women opened March 29, 2018, at the Golden Theatre and runs through June 24.

Photo:) Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The monumentally silly idea—and not a new one, either—behind <em>Rocktopia</em> is mashing up 1960s-1970s rock warhorses with classical music warhorses to demonstrate that the old and the new can run in the same idiotic race. The result is that when the classical music favorites are combined with the rock standards, both are coarsely cheapened.</p>\n<p>So going on at length about this high-decibel, lowbrow debacle is pointless, but a few explanations on how it’s all gone often hilariously wrong aren’t totally uncalled for.</p>\n<p>Aside from holding whoever came up with the giddy notion entirely responsible for <em>Rocktopia</em>, most of the blame has to be placed on Randall Craig Fleischer, who carpentered the bloated arrangements and who, billed as Maestro Randall Craig Fleischer, conducts them for maximum deafening results.</p>\n<p>Anyone reading this and in love with rock from those decades will have already guessed that Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” is present here. It’s blasted in tandem with—wait for it—Ludwig von Beethoven’s “Symphony No. 7.” One especially laugh-out-loud pairing is Giacomo Puccini’s “Quando Me’n Vo” with George Harrison’s “Something.” The cutesie-poo idea behind the linking is that both chat about feminine movement.</p>\n<p>And so it goes for two and a half Mozart-Styx-ensnarled hours with one intermission andone spectacularly numbing sequence in which the featured cast takes on Puccini’s “Nessun Dorma (No one is Sleeping)” and wrestles with it until it cries “Uncle.” You can bet there’s no one sleeping as this group caterwauling carries on.</p>\n<p>No one could possible sleep throughout the entire production. Absolutely everything is amplified, including, of course, the assaulted arias. And since the enterprise is presented as a rock concert on Michael Stiller’s set with a Stiller-Austin Switser projection design harking back to Joshua White Show days, everything from start to finish is obstreperous.</p>\n<p>The featured cast is billed in this order: Rob Evan, Chloe Lowry, Tony Vincent, Kimberley Nicole, Alyson Cambridge, and special guest star Pat Monahan, the <em>Train</em> lead singer. Supporting them are violinist Mairead Nesbitt, guitarist Tony Bruno, and pianist Henry Aronson. The New York Contemporary Symphony and the New York Contemporary Choir attend. There is no director credited, but perhaps not for lack of trying. Or maybe it’s executive producer William Franzblau.</p>\n<p>Belting, whether rock or classical, is the well-honored order of the day. And while Nesbitt fiddles for all she’s worth and Bruno works his guitar and his hips, the singer-screamers adhere to ear-splitting rock traditions, including melismatic embellishments codified on <em>The Voice</em>, where a couple of these shouters spent time, and on the now-returning <em>American idol</em>.</p>\n<p>I saw a press matinee on the Saturday when the March for Our Lives was taking place. Parkland, Florida, students, along with huge crowds worldwide, were protesting gun laws, pressing for voter registration and praising their teachers in an historic national, even international, protest.</p>\n<p>So it was a particular pain in the neck to hear portly, middle-aged Evan, once so effective in <em>Jekyll &amp; Hyde</em>, yell the Pink Floyd lyric from “Another Brick in the Wall,” “Teacher, we don’t want no education.” Could anything have been more out of joint with the times? The effrontery to the effects of good education on display throughout the marches was stunning.</p>\n<p>Note: The costumes that Cynthia Nordstrom designed for the <em>Rocktopia</em> women all looked glitzy but shredded. Is it possible that Nordstrom meant them as a devious metaphor for the shredded music?</p>\n<p><strong>Rocktopia opened  March 27, 2018, at the Broadway Theatre and runs through April 29.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Watching a recent preview of <em>Rocktopia</em>, the “rule-busting multimedia extravaganza” (according to its official site) that just landed on Broadway, I couldn’t help but think of Dewey Finn, the central character in the vastly more entertaining musical <em>School Of Rock</em>. If you’ve seen the latter show, or the movie that inspired it, you know that Dewey, a wanna-be guitar god who reveres the classic-rock canon with religious fervor, would love everything about <em>Rocktopia</em>—the earnest spectacle, the overstated reverence, the guitarist whose pained expression and skin-tight pants evince his complete dedication to art.</p>\n<p>But more about that second dude later. Give <em>Rocktopia, </em>which arrives following a national tour, this much credit: It knows its audience, and it serves them honestly and without cynicism. Co-creators Rob Evan and Randall Craig Fleischer, respectively featured onstage as vocalist and “maestro” (conductor), have not cooked up some cockeyed plot or artist hagiography as an excuse to string together a series of familiar tunes. This is not a jukebox musical but a concert, and as such it can cater unabashedly to baby-boomer nostalgia.</p>\n<p>Alas, extolling the glories of that old-time rock &amp; roll isn’t the sole mission of <em>Rocktopia</em>. Subtitled “A Classical Revolution,” the production features the New York Contemporary Symphony Orchestra and the New York Contemporary Choir alongside pop singers and musicians, and blends songs by Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, The Who, Queen, Aerosmith and similarly iconic acts with works by the likes of Beethoven, Mozart, Handel, Strauss, Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. In many numbers, arranged by Fleischer, excerpts from the latter are used to introduce longer performances of the rock tunes, and strains of the classical material are filtered in with varying degrees of success. (“Kashmir” and Puccini&#8217;s “Nessun Dorma” prove a good match only in the level of histrionics accompanying both.)</p>\n<p>At the performance I saw, audience members frequently applauded whenever the rock song entered the mix, as if they’d taken their medicine—Stravinsky&#8217;s <em>The Rite of Spring</em>, for instance, or Gershwin’s <em>Rhapsody In Blue</em>—and were ready to turn the dial up to 11. But they were appreciative of all the technical skill on display; it&#8217;s impossible to ignore, as the soloists practically hit you over the head with it. Subtlety and discretion are not among the higher virtues in album-oriented rock, or in aspirational hybrids of the kind that surface periodically on PBS—which broadcast a performance of <em>Rocktopia</em> from Budapest last year.</p>\n<p>Violinist Máiréad Nesbitt is, as a founding member of Celtic Woman, is familiar with the latter milieu, and she undulates and tosses her long blonde hair around dutifully. Aforementioned guitar hero and music director Tony Bruno, who stands across the stage—occasionally moving to the center to jam with another artist, or let one of the leg-flashing female singers lean lasciviously against him—keeps his shirt buttons open and his pelvis thrust forward, tearing into one juicy solo after another. (He has a bunch, with the set list including “Stairway To Heaven,” “Baba O’Riley” and Jimi Hendrix’s “Purple Haze.”)</p>\n<p>Bruno’s credits include TV’s <em>America’s Got Talent</em>, <em>The X-Factor</em> and <em>The Voice</em>, the last of which was also a showcase for two of <em>Rocktopia</em>’s featured vocalists, Tony Vincent and Kimberly “ROCK Ballerina” Nichole. The singers, who also include Chloe Lowery and operatic soprano Alyson Cambridge, all favor the more-is-more approach common to such contests, belting and bending and holding notes—in Foreigner’s “I Want To Know What Love Is,” Elton John’s “Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me,” and Styx’s “Come Sail Away,” among other anthems—till you fear they’ll all drop to the floor in sheer exhaustion.</p>\n<p>There are vehicles for Evan, a veteran of bombastic musicals such as <em>Les Miserables</em> and <em>Jekyll &amp; Hyde</em> and member of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and guest vocalist Pat Monahan, lead singer of the rock band Train, with the show through April 8. (Cheap Trick’s Robin Zander joins the production April 23-29.) There’s plenty of visual grandiosity, too, with blinding lights and video images designed to fit the material: youth protests for “Another Brick In The Wall,” psychedelic patterns for “Purple Haze,” various outdoor scenes for U2’s “Where The Streets Have No Name.” And lots of flowers and water.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll admit to being moved when Special Olympian Chelsea Werner appeared, smiling, as part of the montage accompanying Beethoven&#8217;s  <em>Symphony No. 9: Ode To Joy</em> and Journey&#8217;s &#8220;Don&#8217;t Stop Believin.'&#8221; I&#8217;ll bet Dewey would have liked it too.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Rocktopia</em> opened March 27, 2018 at the Broadway Theatre and runs through April 29.

Photo: Joan Marcus</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Second Stage inaugurates its newly renovated Hayes Theater with a sterling production of <em>Lobby Hero</em>.</p>\n<p>Originally produced in 2001 but only now making its Broadway debut, Kenneth Lonergan’s play resonates today as highly timely in its penetrating look at sexual misconduct, racial perceptions, and shady police behavior. Smartly constructed by Lonergan with finely-detailed characters whose talk and conflicts provoke plenty of laughter and suspense—and even a few moments that cause audible rumbles of dismay from among the audience—<em>Lobby Hero</em> is a realistic drama set in New York City, circa 1999.</p>\n<p>Metro area viewers in particular will enjoy the play for its urban edginess of story and tone. Think of it as <em>Law &amp; Disorder</em>.</p>\n<p>The engrossing two-act drama unfolds over several late nights in and around the grungy lobby of a high-rise apartment building that maintains a security guard instead of a doorman. Working the graveyard shift behind the desk is Jeff (Michael Cera), a gabby, dorky-looking white guy in his late twenties. William (Brian Tyree Henry), his supervisor, a harried African-American man, drops by to caution Jeff about his sloppy ways. Almost incidentally, William mentions how his brother could be connected to a serious crime. William might need to provide an alibi and Jeff is happy to counsel his boss on what to do.</p>\n<p>Two cops patrolling in the neighborhood are Bill (Chris Evans), an assertive veteran, and Dawn (Bel Powley), a foul-mouthed rookie who obviously is crushed on her swaggering (and married) partner. Soon Dawn learns some dismaying news about Bill’s dubious doings from Jeff—anxious to impress her—that sours their personal and professional relationship. Eventually the ugly situation involving William’s brother boils over and mires everyone in a mess of falsehoods, confrontations, and recriminations.</p>\n<p>Lonergan, a top-tier writer whose subsequent work includes the Academy Award-winning screenplay for <em>Manchester by the Sea</em>, develops this story thorough extremely natural-sounding, often humorous, conversations that reveal the characters and their desires.</p>\n<p>His deepest character study considers Jeff, more or less a loser who aspires to improve his life and do the right thing but usually ends up making trouble for himself and others. It is a seriocomic portrait of an irritating, none-too-swift bumbler that proves oddly endearing. Cera’s performance as Jeff certainly earns viewer sympathy. Strategically dressed by designer Paloma Young in an oversized uniform and a bad haircut, the skinny Cera uneasily jams his fists into his pockets as Jeff haplessly yammers away in an obvious, and mostly vain, effort to ingratiate himself with people.</p>\n<p>In bristling contrast, Evans assuredly presents a not-so-good policeman who easily manipulates others. Henry aptly interprets the beleaguered William as a man betrayed by his kindhearted nature. Noticeably smaller in stature than the men, Powley empowers Dawn with a feisty attitude usually belied by her troubled countenance. All of the actors invest their characters with gritty naturalness and authentic accents under Trip Cullman’s finely-tuned direction that presents the drama literally from every angle, thanks to a turntable setting of the lobby designed by David Rockwell.</p>\n<p>Second Stage was established in order to provide a second look at plays that were not sufficiently appreciated in their initial productions. During the nearly 40 years since, the company has evolved to premiere new works as well, but it’s always good to see a worthy play such as <em>Lobby Hero</em> revived with such all-around excellence.</p>\n<p>In its latest incarnation, Second Stage acquired the 106 year-old Helen Hayes Theater to present some of its shows as Broadway productions. After undergoing a reported $22 million renovation by the Rockwell Group, the 600-seat theater now reopens its doors with <em>Lobby Hero</em>. Not incidentally, the venue’s name has been neutered to The Hayes in hopes of a future rebranding by a wealthy sponsor. Helen Hayes, the former First Lady of the American theater, likely would appreciate such show-biz pragmatics.</p>\n<p>From the looks of it, most of the money has been invested into backstage systems and improvements unseen by patrons. The public bathrooms have been enlarged and modernized. The still-modest lobby areas are done up in light greys with orange accents. The auditorium, however, is boldly repainted in shades of blue that are lighter in the rear of the house and grow darker closer to the stage. The walls are curiously decorated in pixilated patterns said to suggest the motifs of long-gone French tapestries that were there a century ago. It’s a nice idea that does not register easily to the eye. The major drawback to the auditorium is its cramped seating. The seats are re-covered in a plush, orange-colored fabric, but they remain too-tightly configured together and admit only limited knee and wiggle room.</p>\n<p>It would be wonderful if Second Stage could attract a donor whose dough would be spent removing a few rows of seats so that theatergoers could enjoy their shows in relative comfort. Such beneficence might well be rewarded in heavenly as well as in Broadway circles.</p>\n<p><strong>Lobby Hero opened on March 26, 2018, at The Hayes Theater and runs through May 13.

Photo: Joan Marcus</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Second Stage is marking the opening of its first Broadway house—the don’t-call-it-Helen-anymore Hayes Theater—in grand fashion: with a splashy David Rockwell renovation (think digital murals and pops of Pantone’s trendy Ultra Violet); a cast of millennial-endorsed actors including geek-chic idol Michael Cera (<em>Superbad</em>, <em>Juno</em>) and erstwhile Captain America Chris Evans; and a revival of <em>Lobby Hero</em>, a chatty, plot-light comedy by playwright and screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan, an Oscar winner for 2016’s <em>Manchester by the Sea</em>.</p>\n<p>Cera stars as security guard Jeff, one in a long line of Lonergan’s signature screw-ups, underdogs, and Everymen. (In 2014, he played another, the privileged teenage petty thief Warren, in the revival of <em>This Is Our Youth</em>.) With his slight build and overly solicitous demeanor, Jeff isn’t exactly a natural fit as a security guard in a Manhattan high-rise. Heck, he doesn’t even fit into his uniform. The too-short pants, the too-loose collar, the baggy shirt—no one’s ever going to take him seriously. Certainly not Bill (Evans, in a seriously impressive Broadway debut), the smooth-talking ego-tastic police officer who can’t even be bothered to sign the ledger when he’s visiting, ahem, a friend. And probably not rookie-cop Dawn (<em>The Diary of a Teenage Girl</em>’s Bel Powley, overacting criminally), who’s too busy mooning over her philandering partner, Bill, to succumb to Jeff’s smooth moves: “Do you know why the New York City cops changed from the light blue shirts to the dark blue shirts recently?” Like we said…<em>smooth</em>.</p>\n<p>In fact, the only person who sees Jeff as something more than a rent-a-cop is his boss, fellow security guard William (Brian Tyree Henry, of FX’s <em>Atlanta</em>). “I don’t know why I like you, but I do,” William tells Jeff. That’s likely why William confides in Jeff—revealing details about his brother’s arrest and his potential crisis of conscience. Or maybe it’s simply because Jeff’s <em>there</em>. Either way, William’s admission sends the skittish, garrulous Jeff into a moral quagmire.</p>\n<p>Is Jeff using the dicey legal details to get closer to Dawn? (Yes, undoubtedly.) Does Dawn want the information to bring down Bill, or to bring justice to the victim’s family? (Both…but probably more of the former.) Is there any way that something Jeff told Dawn that William told him would hold up in court? We’ve all watched enough <em>Law &amp; Order</em> to answer that question. And why are William, Jeff, and Dawn the only ones who actually walk through the lobby door? Doesn’t anyone actually <em>live</em> in this presumably insanely overpriced apartment building?</p>\n<p>But let’s not overanalyze this. The action—such as it is—in the 17-year-old <em>Lobby Hero</em> is almost immaterial. For a few very brief moments, a bully gets his comeuppance; a “f&#8211;kin’ bitch” doesn’t have to shut up and be “very, very <em>nice</em>” to her older, more powerful partner; and a ne’er-do-well night guard grows a bit of a spine. In 2018, that’s a little bit heroic.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Lobby Hero</em> opened March 26, 2018, at the Hayes Theater and runs through May 13, 2018.

Photo: Helen Maybanks</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Tony Kushner burst upon modern-day culture in 1993 like Athena emerging from the forehead of Zeus. In a complete set of armor, in the case of the Greek goddess of wisdom and war; in a complete set of armor and ferociously slashing his ballpoint like Ivanhoe flailing his lance, in the case of the playwright. <em>Angels in America</em>—which premiered in California in 1991, London in 1992, and in its complete two-part, seven-plus hour form on Broadway in 1993—was bounteous, blustering, unrestrained, and altogether remarkable. It remains unblinkingly bold and politically provocative in Marianne Elliott’s astounding production, imported from the Royal National Theatre to the plebeian Neil Simon on 52nd Street.</p>\n<p>It seems unwarranted, today, to offer dramatic criticism of Kushner’s self-proclaimed “gay fantasia on national themes.” A most interesting subtitle, in retrospect; the very word “gay,” in the reign of Reagan, was as dangerous as burning coals. And “fantasia,” at that point in time, signified only one thing: <em>Disney</em>, whose ambitious 1940 genre-bursting animated cornucopia had just been extravagantly restored and flooded the nation’s movie screens in the fall of 1990. A “gay fantasia” indeed.</p>\n<p>But perhaps a plot recap is not altogether unhelpful, as a middle-aged suburbanite on line at the loo—eagerly awaiting the beginning of the first act of the second play—was overheard telling her friend, “I loved it last night, but I don’t really understand what it’s at all about.” Simply put, it follows the adventures of office-worker Louis Ironson and Prior Walter, his roommate in those long-ago days when legalized marriage was nothing more than a gay fantasia.</p>\n<p>Prior has just been diagnosed with then-lethal AIDS, which sends him to the hospital and Louis into the arms of Joe Pitt, a gay Mormon Republican lawyer who leaves his wounded, Valium-popping wife Harper so she goes to Eskimoland with Prior’s friend/lover/nurse Belize while Joe’s boss and mentor—the evil and disgraced and soon-to-be-disbarred Joe McCarthy henchman Roy Cohn—loudly proclaims that he is straight even after he winds up under Belize’s care in the AIDS ward, where Ethel Rosenberg (who McCarthy and Cohn sent to the electric chair in 1953 under what seem to have been, you should pardon the expression, trumped up charges) sits by his deathbed and says Kaddish.  There’s a monumental, very much corporeal angel with prodigious wingspan, too.</p>\n<p>Yes, Kushner’s play is uncontrolled and unrestrained; but what was (almost 30 years ago) and is (today) so remarkable is how the man spins words. Trepidatious newcomers might well wonder how you can possibly sit there through two full-length evenings, or a matinee/evening combination, without growing weary, disengaged, restless, or otherwise distracted. It’s not the tangled web of story, which indeed seems all over the place (including the Arctic and the heavens). It’s the manner in which Kushner weaves plot, character, history, and whatever else apparently came to his fever-pitched mind like a modern-day Scheherazade. Except he cuts those 1,001 nights down to two because, I suppose, only the hardiest of ticketbuyers are likely to go back to see, say, <em>Angels in America Part 739</em>.</p>\n<p>Let me restate that: you sit there as these characters go on tangents, some of which are so very far afield as to seem incomprehensible. But you hang on every word, and after seven hours Kushner manages to tie each and every element into a grand fantasia (there’s that word again) that is astonishing, unimaginable perfection. Which is what we pray for when we go to the theater, no?</p>\n<p>Having seen numerous productions over the decades, I’ve come to the conclusion that <em>Angels</em>, in the hands of a suitably visionary director, is <em>always</em> going to be astounding. Comparisons unnecessary. The present edition comes from Marianne Elliott, whom you might well consider “suitably visionary.” If the name is unfamiliar, her two recent National Theatre escapades—<em>War Horse</em> and <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em>—will jog your memory.  Her work on <em>Angels</em> is equally stunning. The fantastical staging is abetted by designers Ian MacNeil (scenery), Nicky Gillibrand (costumes), Paule Constable (lighting), Ian Dickinson (sound), and Finn Caldwell (puppets); the latter three were part of Elliott’s above-mentioned adventures. MacNeil, let it be said, designed what is one of the most memorable sets in my memory bank, for Stephen Daldry’s production of <em>An Inspector Calls</em>. His <em>Angels</em> work is suitably monumental, built on individual neon-lined cubicles that range across the playing space. The set is impressive, but it seems to have been conceived for the National’s larger and wider Lyttleton and likely played better there (but you can’t hold that against the designer).</p>\n<p>The cast, too, is exceptional—although one of the most exceptional moments might come when you realize that there are only eight actors up there. This iteration is galvanized by Andrew Garfield, of <em>Spider-Man</em> fame, as Prior, and Nathan Lane as Cohn. One might assume, by the playing, that Kushner wrote the role specifically for the oversized comic talents of the present-day Lane. The actor all but absconds with the first part in a manner which might seem overdone. But it is not; rather, Lane’s comedic rampage pays off as Cohn succumbs to mortality. There are too many extraordinary scenes in the play to start recounting them, but the hospital exchanges between Lane and Nathan Stewart-Jarrett (as Belize) are riveting. The cast is rounded out by James McArdle as Louis, Lee Pace as Joe, Denise Gough as Harper, Amanda Lawrence as the Angel (et al.), and Susan Brown (as Ethel Rosenberg et al.).</p>\n<p>“Where’s my Roy Cohn?” the leader of the free world recently pleaded.  He’s on the stage of the Neil Simon, sir; and it might do you well to stroll over from your nearby tower to watch your revered role model in the flesh, as it were.  Although you’ll no doubt quickly grow fidgety, and I’d wager you won’t get cheered by the crowd.  Maybe you should send your vice?</p>\n<p><strong>Angels in America </strong><strong>opened March 25, 2018, at the Neil Simon Theatre and runs through July 1.
