Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Fans of <em>Will &amp; Grace</em>, you ain’t seen nothing yet. Sean Hayes is delivering a tour-de-force performance, or shall I say a “twofer-de-force“ as he dazzles us with bravura skills as both actor and classical pianist. And if you think that this play set in 1958 about Oscar Levant—a man most audiences have never heard of–is too remote to hold much interest, you would be dead wrong. <em>Good Night, Oscar</em> is a captivating work, as hysterically funny as it is heartbreaking.</p>\n<p>Levant was way ahead of his time. Like Lenny Bruce who skirted the decency rules about comedy back in the day, Levant spoke his mind. And what a mind he had! Struggling with a host of mental disorders—manic depression, OCD, auditory hallucinations among so much else—he became hooked on drugs. And that landed him in mental institutions where he was subjected to electroshock therapy.</p>\n<p>He was also something of a musical prodigy, dazzling concert goers with virtuosic skills on the piano. But it was his unvarnished way with a quip, his stinging wit and sometimes vulgar observations that put him on the talk show circuit where he routinely ran afoul of the censors.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/24/good-night-oscar-sean-hayes-is-the-famed-ivories-tickler/\">Read David Finkle’s ★★★☆☆ review here.</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Good Night, Oscar</em> takes place on a night when Levant is booked as a guest on <em>The Tonight Show</em> which was hosted back then by Jack Paar, a comedian in his own right as popular back then as Jimmy Fallon is today. Levant is late to arrive as usual but this time, his wife shows up to explain the delay. When he does finally arrive, he is a mess with his OCD coffee regimen on full display along with his bizarre superstitions. But he is funny, sometimes self-deprecatingly: “For exercise I stumble and then I fall into a coma”, and insultingly: “I knew Doris Day before she was a virgin.” But like a court jester, the humor was bitingly honest.</p>\n<p>In the role, Hayes pulls off a most incredible transformation taking on the posture, the tics, the halting voice of a deeply troubled man who pushes the limits of likeability. Throughout, he is unapologetically irascible and difficult. And yet we are totally on his side. For that, credit must be shared by Hayes with his phenomenal performance, director Lisa Peterson, and Doug Wright who penned an outstanding play that brilliantly captures Levant, warts and all.</p>\n<p>In 1958, when wholesomeness was the watchword on television and everyone had to avoid the third rail of politics/religion/sex, Levant routinely touched on all three. As he put it, “polite comedian” is an oxymoron, adding “People dislike me or hate me.” It was his brand, so to speak, and it cost him dearly.</p>\n<p>The play has added resonance today, as comedians are contending with so-called “woke” culture where everything they say is scrutinized under a lens of appropriateness, and jokes must avoid causing offense.</p>\n<p>Despite Levant’s inappropriateness, he was tolerated in large part because of his prowess at the piano. We learn that he would often conclude his talk show appearances with a musical performance which won him accolades and another guest booking. But as gifted as he was, Levant measured his talents against the genius of George Gershwin, a contemporary and friend; and the comparison always left him feeling so deeply inadequate, he stopped performing. On this one night though, after much angst, he finally agrees to perform, and what follows is a stunning revelation. Sean Hayes as Levant plays Gershwin’s <em>Rhapsody in Blue</em> with astonishing mastery. It’s a huge bonus in an already remarkable production.</p>\n<p>The rest of the cast is quite marvelous. Emily Bergl as Oscar’s wife, June, is wonderful, revealing the restraint of a good wife in the patriarchal 50’s while tactfully maneuvering to get her way. As June lovingly spars with her husband, the chemistry between them rings true, giving the play a much needed emotional foundation.</p>\n<p>Ben Rappaport’s Jack Paar is equally convincing. He commands the stage with the slick delivery of a late night host while allowing the better comedian to take center stage. He champions Levant as something of an idiot savant, all the while knowing the risks he poses on live TV.</p>\n<p>Alex Wyse adds fine comic relief as the over eager production assistant Max. His celebrity worship serves as a perfect catalyst for Levant’s unhinged rants. Marchant Davis plays Alvin, Oscar’s minder from the mental hospital where he’s been furloughed for a few hours. Davis too sounds just the right notes of exasperation and admiration as Oscar pushes boundaries to the limit.</p>\n<p>If there’s such a thing as a villain in this play, it is Bob Sarnoff, the president of NBC who continually pushed back against Levant’s unscripted appearances. For him, Levant was a time bomb just waiting to blow up the entire network with his inflammatory humor. True to form, it happened time and time again, but it was hard to argue with the entertainment value he provided. Levant’s off the wall wit gained viewers even as the advertisers threatened to (and often did) pull out. Peter Grosz makes a persuasive case as the CEO whose prime directive is maintaining profit margin.</p>\n<p>Lisa Peterson, helmed the production beautifully with the finesse of an artist balancing the sweet spot between comedy and drama. And it all feels and looks entirely real. Kudos to costume designer Emilio Sosa for conceiving the period so accurately with the simplest of touches. And scenic designer Rachel Hauck completes the picture with an authentic rendering of a TV studio’s inner sanctum.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t help thinking that if Oscar Levant was around today, he would be more readily accepted. But maybe not. Comedians are still finding that slaughtering sacred cows, even when targeting themselves, remains risky business.</p>\n<p><strong>Good Night, Oscar </strong><strong>opened April 24, 2023, at the Belasco Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s likely there are three distinct groups for Doug Wright’s intermissionless 100-minute <em>Good Night, Oscar</em>, as directed by Lisa Peterson for a 2022 Goodman Theatre production. The largest consists of Sean Hayes fans, familiar with the three-time Emmy winner for his television series <em>Will &amp; Grace</em> as lovable Jack McFarland. Possibly, they also know him for his <em>Act of God</em> and <em>Promises, Promises</em> Broadway appearances. That he trained as a classical pianist may come as news to them. His <em>SmartLess</em> podcast probably won’t.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second, undoubtedly much smaller group (and getting smaller by 2023), are Oscar Levant fans. They know Levant (1906-72) was a favorite Jack Paar guest, showing up to crack wise on late nights in 1963 and 1964. They are aware he made nearly a score of movies, including <em>Rhapsody in Blue</em>, in which he played himself. He was a good friend to George Gershwin, the film’s subject. They know he frequently concertized, almost always including Gershwin’s “Concerto in F.” They know he wrote songs, “Blame It on My Youth” (lyrics by Edward Heyman), among them.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third, even smaller group are fans of both Hayes and Levant.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/24/good-night-oscar-sean-hayes-displays-dual-talents-in-masterful-performance/\"><em>Read Roma Torre’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m writing as a member of the second group, keeping the other two in mind, of course. Even before we had the term “appointment television” I tuned into the enthusiastic, highly sensitive Paar when he’d billboard having the chain-smoking Levant on hand. I waited for every one of the man’s dyspeptic comments but, as a doctor’s son, recognized they emerged from someone with an advanced medical condition. (I wasn’t prepared with a diagnosis.) I had already cottoned to Levant in <em>Romance on the High Seas</em>, the first Doris Day movie, about which he subsequently said, “I knew Doris Day before she was a virgin.” I owned his 33s, still do.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I was eager for <em>Good Night, Oscar</em> to see how my inordinately witty, ceaselessly acidic culture hero would be presented. Wright offers a slice-of-life work – and what a troubled life it is. (Incidentally, the playwright’s <em>I Am My Own Wife</em> foreshadows his ability at observing a determined, self-possessed person.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s Spring 1958. It’s the night when <em>The Tonight Show With Jack Paar </em>has moved to California and he is about to preside over his introductory Burbank Studios outing. The guests include Jayne Mansfield and Senor Wences but, first, Levant. With little time before the José Melis band strikes up, however, Levant has yet to arrive.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paar (Ben Rappaport) – nervous and loomed over by worried NBC’ president Bob Sarnoff (Peter Grosz), is making futile calls – as is gofer and overly enthusiastic Sarnoff family member Max Weinbaum (Alex Wyse).  Their shared panic is not quite ended when Levant’s devoted, long-suffering wife June (Emily Bergl) enters.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She informs Paar that Oscar is coming. She’s recently had him committed, and he needs to be picked up at Mt. Sinai, the Klein Pavilion, She’s secured a pass – but for their “daughter’s wedding.” Balking, Paar agrees. Levant arrives with aide Alvin Finney (Marchant Davis), who totes an attaché case containing Levant’s meds. Among them is a Levant no-no, Demerol. Does it figure in the action? Guess.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What follows – and rather heavy-handedly on Wright’s part – is Levant behaving as if his Klein Pavilion residence is nowhere near terminating. He’s depressed. He’s rich with sour ripostes and retorts. He’s assailed by voices, the most prominent the voice and materialization of none other than George Gershwin (John Zdrojeski), much taller than the genius, woman-baiting composer was. And why not? He’s towering in Levant’s memory.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two <em>Good Night, Oscar </em>peak peeks. The first is Levant’s on-air chat with Paar. Though I don’t recall seeing it (I probably did), I hardly memorized it and haven’t been able to track it down. On the other hand, I assume Wright did and has made it the play’s centerpiece. Every line pulses like a flaming arrow.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second high point is – maybe this should be a spoiler alert, but who wouldn’t be expecting the sequence? – is classically-trained Hayes sitting down at a Steinway concert grand and playing “Rhapsody in Blue,” an orchestra joining, thanks to sound designer André Pluess. All the while, Levant is thinking about how well he’s doing, how Gershwin might have reacted. It’s a stunning interpretation. Even Levant might have approved.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It could be that <em>Good Night, Oscar</em> exists as much as anything for handing Hayes an at-the-ivories <em>tour de force</em>. Otherwise, his Levant portrayal is strong enough. He bumbles and stumbles across Rachel Hauck‘s couple of NBC studios, constantly entrenched in Levant’s havoc, lighting up as obsessively as Levant did. Perhaps aficionados won’t be entirely watching the commanding grouse their guy was, but Hayes adulators will assume they’re getting the real thing.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Could be the same for old-time Paar-tisans. Rappaport doesn’t seem to be out to impersonate the man and his assured-yet-uncertain-of-himself manner. He gets much of the Paar’s professionally charming ways when in front of television cameras. The other cast members, Bergl chief among them, respond to Peterson’s serviceable direction.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the audience groups cited above: <em>Good Night, Oscar</em> has something, if not everything, for all three. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Good Night, Oscar </strong><strong>opened April 24, 2023, at the Belasco Theatre.

Photo credit: Bronwen Sharp</figcaption></figure>\n<p>You would never know that Jodie Comer is making her stage debut in Suzie Miller’s harrowing one-person play <em>Prima Facie</em>. The thirty-year-old British actress has rocketed to fame in recent years, thanks in large part to her award-winning turn as a ruthless assassin in the international hit television series <em>Killing Eve</em>. But while many film and television stars prove underwhelming on stage, Comer instantly affirms herself as a top-rank theater performer with this dynamic star turn in which she absolutely commands attention for 100 uninterrupted minutes. Already the recipient of the Olivier Award for the play’s London run, she should repeat that success when the Tonys are handed out in June.</p>\n<p>Comer plays Tessa, a woman from a working-class background who has become a successful defense barrister specializing in criminal cases involving sexual assault. At the play’s beginning, she’s standing on top of a table in an office lined with impossibly high shelves containing case files, giddily regaling us with an account of her latest success in the courtroom. For her, the law is simply a winning or losing proposition. “Today, I was a winner,” she crows. “Today, I came first.”</p>\n<p>Comer’s opening speech, accompanied by a percussive score courtesy of composer Rebecca Lucy Taylor (better known as Self Esteem), is delivered at such a fever pitch that it feels like a virtuoso jazz solo. You think that the actress couldn’t possibly sustain that level of intensity for the rest of the evening. But she does, infusing the often-stodgy monologue form with a relentless physicality that proves compelling from first minute to last. Even more miraculously, she neither wears out the audience’s energy nor her own.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/23/prima-facie-jodie-comer-in-arresting-stage-debut-as-barrister-turned-plaintiff/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★☆ </a><em><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/23/prima-facie-jodie-comer-in-arresting-stage-debut-as-barrister-turned-plaintiff/\">review here</a>.</em>]</p>\n<p>The play takes a significantly darker turn when Tessa describes her camaraderie with a colleague, Julian, that eventually results in a sexual encounter while they’re working late at the office one night. She’s not averse to pursuing the relationship, and the pair have a real date that winds up with them at her apartment. But she’s had too much to drink and becomes violently ill, during which he takes the opportunity to forcibly have sex with her despite her vigorous protests. Immediately, Tessa is thrust into the criminal justice system, only this time as a victim. Actually, not so immediately, as illustrated by a video display rattling off the number of days from when she first reported the crime to when Julian’s trial begins: 782, to be exact.</p>\n<p>The Tessa that we see during the process of being interrogated by a less than sympathetic police officer — after learning she’s a defense barrister, he taunts, “Now you need us, though, don’t you?” — and enduring the trial is a very different one from before. Comer heartbreakingly portrays her character’s crumbling into despair in a visceral manner; when we see Tessa during a dramatic staging effect, it’s like watching an animal caught in a trap.</p>\n<p>The play doesn’t quite live up to Comer’s mastery. While it certainly feels vitally relevant, as reinforced by the pamphlet about the epidemic of sexual assault that is included in the program, it also feels schematic and predictable at times. There’s little doubt from the beginning that Tessa is headed for a fall, but the playwright doesn’t make her transition particularly revelatory.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, <em>Prima Facie</em> proves a shattering evening, masterfully staged by Justin Martin and making superb use of sound, lighting and projection effects to inject theatrical energy into the proceedings. Not that any of it was necessary with such a dynamic performance at its center.</p>\n<div style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\"><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Prima Facie </strong><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened April 23, 2023, at the Golden Theatre and runs through July 2.

Photo: Helen Murray</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Can you have a compelling case of &#8220;he said, she said&#8221; without the &#8220;he said&#8221;? Or to identify the dilemma raised by Suzie Miller&#8217;s new play, <em>Prima Facie</em>, more specifically, can an accusation of sexual assault be fairly judged if we hear only the plaintiff&#8217;s side, and not the defendant&#8217;s?</p>\n<p>These are far more delicate and complicated questions than they were even a few years ago, of course. In the long overdue reckoning brought by the #MeToo movement, &#8220;Believe women&#8221; became a mantra, as high-profile men representing all manner of professions and backgrounds were held accountable for oppressive, abusive and in some cases criminal behavior. A pamphlet folded into the playbill for <em>Prima Facie</em> cites a number of disturbing statistics; Tessa Ensler, the one-act drama&#8217;s sole character, mentions another.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One in every three women are sexually assaulted,&#8221; declares Tessa, a whipsmart, fast-rising young barrister—the play is set in the U.K., where it premiered last year—who by this point, after a date that went terribly wrong, has become the complainant in a rape trial. The irony of this development is enhanced by the fact that Tessa, played in an astonishing stage debut by the BAFTA and Emmy Award-winning actress Jodie Comer (who introduced the part across the pond), has built her reputation largely by securing acquittals for men arrested for such crimes.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/23/prima-facie-a-jodie-comer-tour-de-force/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Addressing the judge directly, out of the jury&#8217;s presence, Tessa asserts, &#8220;The law of sexual assault spins on the wrong axis. A woman&#8217;s experience of sexual assault does not fit the male-defined system of truth.&#8221; She admits, &#8220;Now I know that when a woman says &#8216;no,&#8217; when her actions say &#8216;no,&#8217; it is not a subtle, unreadable thing at all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a compelling argument, and Comer, under Justin Martin&#8217;s vigorous but sensitive direction, makes it soar and sting. Best known for her witty, searing portrayal of a sociopathic Russian assassin on the television series &#8220;Killing Eve,&#8221; the actress captures both Tessa&#8217;s manic energy—which dominates the first half of the play, as the character documents her whirlwind rise from a working-class upbringing to law school at Cambridge and a bright career, with a breakneck pace that she clearly relishes—and the vulnerability and self-doubt that consume her after the incident.</p>\n<p>Miller, who was herself an attorney before turning full-time to playwriting, makes the technical elements of both Tessa&#8217;s job and her personal legal ordeal accessible and engaging throughout, and draws the latter in complex and dramatically rich detail, which is enhanced by the thumping electronica of Rebecca Lucy Taylor&#8217;s original score. Tessa has been assaulted by a colleague, a man with whom she had previously had consensual sex—once on a separate occasion, and once on the evening in question, during which both have a lot to drink.</p>\n<p>We never meet the accused, Julian, though Tessa makes him sound very appealing initially, and concedes she had considered him a romantic prospect. But details of his superior socio-economic status—his father is a &#8220;KC,&#8221; the acronym for king&#8217;s counsel, and his mother an art collector—contribute to a portrait that becomes less and less sympathetic. By the time the trial concludes, he has been reduced to a callous son of privilege—the British equivalent of a rich, snotty frat boy, essentially.</p>\n<p>The play, in other words, creates the illusion of nuance and balance, then shatters it. It might be argued that crimes as horrific as the one alleged in <em>Prima Facie</em> make such factors difficult, or even impossible, to establish. But I&#8217;d like to think that as long as men and women are both susceptible to human frailty, and deserving of justice, they must apply.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Prima Facie </strong><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened April 23, 2023, at the Golden Theatre and runs through July 2.

Photo credit: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Larissa FastHorse’s clever satire of political correctness is set in a classroom where a group has gathered to “devise” a 45-minute holiday play for an elementary school audience. The team includes Logan (stage veteran Katie Finneran), a drama teacher whose previous directorial credits include a production of <em>The Iceman Cometh</em> featuring fifteen-year-olds; Jaxton (Scott Foley, TV’s <em>Felicity</em>), her very woke yoga practitioner/street performer boyfriend who gifts her with a water bottle “made from recycled glass from broken windows in housing projects”; Caden (Chris Sullivan, returning to Broadway after hitting it big in television’s <em>This is Us</em>), a history teacher with a passion for theater who’s there to make sure the piece is historically accurate; and Alicia (D’Arcy Carden, TV’s <em>The Good Place</em>, making her Broadway debut), a sexy professional actress from Los Angeles who’s  been cast because her Native American heritage fulfills the demands of a “Native American Heritage Month Awareness Through Art” financial grant.</p>\n<p>“I have always been drawn to your ways,” Jaxton gushes to Alicia when they first meet. Unfortunately, there’s been a misunderstanding, as Alicia isn’t Native American at all but rather “English and French and a little Spanish.” It turns out that she was mistakenly hired because of her “Native American headshot,” one of six that feature her as different ethnicities. She’s got plenty of experience playing minorities, citing the time she was the “third understudy for Jasmine” at Disneyland.</p>\n<p><em>The Thanksgiving Play</em> — which was first seen at Off-Broadway’s Playwrights Horizons in 2018 and has since gone on to become one of the most produced plays in America, the first by a Native American playwright to achieve that feat — hilariously dissects political correctness via such plot elements as Logan’s goal to make a “culturally sensitive” play about a holiday revolving around “the slaughter of millions of animals” in spite of her veganism and Jaxton’s determination to get to the core of the “Native American gestalt.” Caden vainly attempts to set the historical record straight about the actual, little-known beginnings of the holiday, while Alicia horrifies the others with her joyous recollection of playing “frozen turkey bowling” as a child. “They call them Butterballs, but they’re not really balls,” she explains.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/20/a-thanksgiving-play-much-to-give-thanks-for/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Interpersonal dynamics also enter into the picture, with both men finding themselves irresistibly drawn to the sexually alluring if not particularly bright Alicia. The insecure Logan becomes increasingly jealous, but Alicia reassures her that she could be gorgeous with just a little make-up and a valuable lesson in &#8220;hair-flipping.”</p>\n<p>Interspersed with the scenes depicting the piece’s chaotic creation are several holiday-themed videos featuring children, including one in which they’re dressed as pilgrims while singing the parody song “The Twelve Days of Thanksgiving.” There are also some very amusing theatrical in-jokes, including throwaway gags about whether the proper spelling is “theater” or “theatre” and what exactly a dramaturg does.</p>\n<p>Not all of the jokes land, and even with its brief 90-minute running time, the evening ultimately has the feel of an overextended sketch. That’s particularly true of this new production directed by Rachel Chavkin, which feels much broader than the original staging and features some theatrical flourishes near the end that feel wholly unnecessary. But the play still delivers plenty of uproarious moments and this starrier Broadway cast milks them for all their worth, with Carden and Finneran particularly hilarious with their physical comedy.</p>\n<div><strong>The Thanksgiving Play </strong><strong>opened April 20, 2023 at the Helen Hayes Theater </strong><strong>and runs through June 4.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<p>Larissa FastHorse, born into the Sicangu Lakota Nation, has been quoted as saying that she came to write <em>The Thanksgiving Play</em> in 2015 because she had been told that since there are no indigenous Native American actors(!?), she couldn’t cast a work requiring native American actors.</p>\n<p>Taking that proscription in, she pivoted to write a work concerning Indigenous Americans but using only four white actors.  The result: <em>A Thanksgiving Play</em>, which, after being presented at Playwrights Horizons in 2018 and across the country for several years, now reaches Broadway and, according to disseminated information, makes FastHorse the first Native American to arrive here.</p>\n<p>FastHorse has remarked that she favors comedies as the way to communicate her serious beliefs about how misunderstood her people have been over the centuries. She’s on to something piercingly salient, of course, and she’s right about laughs being a potent way to reach audiences with a powerful message.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/20/the-thanksgiving-play-the-satire-of-political-correctness-we-need-right-now/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>She’s written an intermissionless 90-minute joke-filled piece that can certainly be regarded as a comedy. But how comic is it, from start to finish? Her notion is that four white characters have gathered in a high school classroom in an unspecified town. (Riccardo Hernandez, the set designer). Logan (Katie Finneran), a drama teacher has received grants to present a Thanksgiving play. She’s decided to improvise the educational entertainment and has invited participating associates Jaxton (Scott Foley) and Caden (Chris Sullivan) as well as imported Hollywood actress Alicia (D’Arcy Carden), whom Morgan has hired for her tribal background.</p>\n<p>Logan, Jaxton and Caden are severe victims of Political-Correct-itis, not necessarily a condition new to satire. Logan, for instance, is so deeply infected, not to say affected, that when she introduces people, she includes names and pronouns. When dismayed, she mutters, “Oh my goddess!”</p>\n<p>Alicia is something else again. She knows nothing other than that she’s an actress trained in Disneyland technique. At one moment when told she’s about to learn something, she replies, “I don’t want to learn.” That’s another giggle line, although it doubles – without FastHorse maybe intending it – as a reminder that the United States is currently a sadly dumbed-down nation. Not incidentally, Morgan chose Alicia after looking at a headshot of the actress wearing a turquoise necklace, although this Alicia isn’t Indigenous American, after all.</p>\n<p>With Alicia, the woefully PC three – these contemporary bleeding-heart liberals (if “bleeding-heart liberals” remains an acceptable phrase) – begin shaping their version of a Thanksgiving play. The many improvisations that they imagine quickly strike them as unacceptable. Should they portray Indigenous Americans? Maybe not. Morgan is wary of anything that could affront her grant donors but is uncertain which ideas might offend and which might not.</p>\n<p>No complete list of attempted notions will be given here. They can and do elicit copious giggles, chuckles and chortles from a generally happy audience (though not, always, this viewer). The first improv suggestion is Caden’s that they begin their Thanksgiving dinner history by going back about 4000 years, Morgan objects that they’re restricted to a 45-minute entertainment. Alicia notes that 20 minutes is the Disneyland limit.</p>\n<p>Of the many other intermittently amusing improvs, there’s one improv that to this viewer seems questionable. Towards the end, Jaxton and Caden rush forth with bags from which they pull supposedly severed “Indian” heads and toss them bloodily about. Evidently, the sequence is meant to remind jubilating spectators about the historic violence of the country’s earlier history, but there must be a better way to make the point.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the obviously talented FastHorse, a MacArthur Fellow, is having her puckish way with what fools these present-day knee jerk liberals, these contemporarily “woke” characters be. Thanks to her for that, especially as played by cast members Finneran Foley, Sullivan, and James.</p>\n<p>Director Rachel Chavkin (Tony for <em>Hadestown</em>) has the able four working like Energizer bunnies. As Finneran always does, she wrings as much humor as there is to wring; in the circumstances, maybe even more. So do the other in-for-a-penny-in-for-a-pound players.</p>\n<p>N.B.: Before FastHorse’s comic proclamation and the live cast members enter, a downstage screen fills with a video of mixed-race children singing a “Twelve Days of Christmas” parody. The items representing the numbers are “a turkey in a turkey patch,” “two turkey gobblers,” and so on. In a matter of two or three minutes, a notion of how children are inappropriately taught about the meaning and the truth of Thanksgiving, as okayed by today’s CRT-fearing school boards, is presented. It’s a brilliant inspiration that gets <em>A Thanksgiving Play</em> off to a grand start.</p>\n<p><strong>The Thanksgiving Play </strong><strong>opened April 20, 2023 at the Helen Hayes Theater </strong><strong>and runs through June 4.

Over at the Barrymore, we suddenly find a ragtag company with a duct tape-and-spit budget but none of the pretensions of the aforementioned entertainments offering not only a bagful of hand-made magic and clumsy enchantment but also more good-natured cheer than both those big-budget musicals combined.</p>\n<p>You even get to lustily boo the villain, if that is your wont, and he’ll boo right back at you. (“Josh Groban is a block over slitting everybody’s throat,” he yells at the audience over the din, “and nobody boos <em>him</em>!”) It’s been three years since sitting in a packed Broadway house with an eager Broadway audience has felt so—well—back to normal.</p>\n<p>As those who remember the 2017 laff-fest <em>The Play That Goes Wrong</em> might discern, we speak of the Mischief troupe’s new romp, <em>Peter Pan Goes Wrong</em>. Yes, we have seen other <em>Pans</em> go wrong, either happily (as in <em>Peter and the Starcatcher</em>) or not (as in multiple problem plays which try to get under the pseudo-sexual psyches of contemporary Wendys and Peters). The present example, however, prides itself in going <em>wrong</em>—that’s in the title, after all—and the wronger, the cheesier, the hoarier the better. The folks who call themselves Mischief lust for low laughs. And they find ’em, by the kegful.</p>\n<p>[<a style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-text-opacity: 1;\" href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/19/peter-pan-goes-wrong-so-wrong-its-high-flying-right/\"><em style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆ <em style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>In this case, they take on J.M. Barrie’s 1904 play—just now on the cusp of a belated entry into the public domain, due to copyright vagaries—and explode it. The conceit is the same as in their earlier foray into the drayma, which ran almost two years at the Lyceum and continues in an off-Broadway transfer at New World Stages. We are attending a production of the Cornley Polytechnic Drama Society, which combines eager amateurs with what they term “real near-professional actors and directors.” The fictional members of the Cornley cast paste their provincial personalities on their <em>Pan</em> roles—as genuine professional actors <em>never</em> do, of course—so we are watching imported professional actors playing amateur actors giving a down-grade performance of <em>Peter Pan</em> on a set, and within a production, in which everything indeed does go wrong.</p>\n<p>The five core members of Mischief, who seem to float between various productions of their various enterprises, have stepped back into the roles (and shtick) they created. Henry Shields introduces the piece, in his guise as director of this Cornley production, and goes on to play the dual roles of Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. I first encountered Shields standing in the aisle, prior to the performance, dressed in evening clothes and seating unsuspecting playgoers—who presumably took him to be an usher—in presumably wrong seat locations. He is tall, thin, and limber; at one point in the nursery scene, he seems to slip sideways through a closed door. But give him a sneer, a mustache, and a hook affixed to his right hand when it doesn’t slip off, and he is a terror who easily out-hams Cyril Ritchard (and if you don’t get that reference, Nathan Lane will do).</p>\n<p>Henry Lewis doesn’t even attempt a level of decorum. He spends much of the night as Nana, the dog. Too beefy to push through the doggie door in the lower half of the nursery door, he gets stuck and causes an array of missed entrances and bolloxed stage traffic. He moves into the guise of Hook’s henchman Starkey, who mumbles so prolifically that the trio of authors (the two Henrys and Jonathan Sayer) give him a full, unintelligible section which goes on until we can actually decipher his jabberwocky. The beefy (or fat-suited?) Lewis also steps into an ill-fitting black leotard to play Peter Pan’s shadow—don’t ask—and does an improbably funny shadow dance. Sayer takes the part of local actor Dennis, who in turn portrays Wendy’s brother John. He is relegated to the fringes, alas; the running gag upon which his role is built—that he cannot remember his lines, so they are obtrusively fed to him over a pair of anachronistic headphones—is not funny, at least to this viewer.</p>\n<p>Charlie Russell has relatively little room for fun as Wendy; she does, though, contribute some furtive farcical sexual business behind the scenes (or when she <em>thinks</em> she is behind the scenes). The fifth cofounder of Mischief, Nancy Zamit, offers delightful clowning all the way through. She doubles as Mrs. Darling and the Darling’s housekeeper, Lisa, which results in scampering through doors making exits as one and entrances as the other, with—as the pace quickens—élan but also wardrobe malfunctions. She is then drafted to play the fairy Tinker Bell; Zamit continually falls into that sparklingly Disney-esque Tinker Bell pose, despite the fact that she—or at least Cornley actor “Annie Twilloil”—would likely never be mistaken for a Disney fairy.</p>\n<p>All of this is staged in rapid-paced fashion by director Adam Meggido on a very much provincial set featuring a turntable that, when put to the test, indeed goes wrong. The scenery is designed, with gags and multiple breakaway pieces, by Simon Scullion. Roberto Surface’s costumes combine professional values with hand-made elements. Peter Pan (Greg Tannahill) is in a green, camouflage-like costume incorporating a breast piece that looks like it’s a remnant from a Christmas sweater granny hand-knit 15 years ago. And don’t think we don’t notice that Wendy’s younger brother, Michael (Matthew Cavendish), wears a pink romper with a genuine Peter Pan collar. Matthew Haskins designed the lights, which also—continually—go wrong with humorous effect. The designer of the flying sequences is unbilled, likely because he or she walked out when it became clear that what Mischief actually wanted was a series of near-miss aerial mishaps.</p>\n<p>Producer Kevin McCollum, who heads the team that brought this production to Broadway, gets in on the fun with a bit of product placement, a very funny six-shooter bit which salutes his musical hit (<em>Six</em>) running across the street. The corn, at times, is even higher than that over at the Nederlander.</p>\n<p>A special paragraph is deserved by guest star Neil Patrick Harris. Starting out as a dignified <em>Masterpiece Theatre</em>-type narrator, his performance disintegrates into a protean slapstick turn with magic and audience interaction mixed in. Any suggestion of “yes, they can easily bring in any name actor to play this” disappears as Harris loses his pants; devolves into a scowling pirate, without dagger or bottle of rum; and winds up sprawled across the deck—of the pirate ship, the Cornley stage, and the Barrymore itself. Harris is scheduled to depart at month’s end. But really, mightn’t he stay? Film and television or sitting by the fireside with your loving family who are already inured to your jokes simply cannot be this much fun, black and blue bruises aside.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_18050\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18050\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-18050 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pan-nph-good2-PPGW_1093.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pan-nph-good2-PPGW_1093.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pan-nph-good2-PPGW_1093.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pan-nph-good2-PPGW_1093.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pan-nph-good2-PPGW_1093.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pan-nph-good2-PPGW_1093.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-18050\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Neil Patrick Harris in Peter Pan Goes Wrong.

Well, no; it’s difficult or perhaps impossible to offer the surprises of that initial foray into the Mischief formula. But the frantic, manic, desperate humor is the same; you might start the affair sitting in your seat thinking “go ahead, just <em>try</em> to entertain me” as you watch pseudo-stagehands scurrying to apply last-minute fixes to the ramshackle scenery. But as with the earlier show, they quickly win you over.

Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Full Disclosure: I’m a sucker for the <em>Goes Wrong</em> series: <em>The Play That Goes Wrong</em>, <em>The Play About a Bank Robbery, </em>to name the two I’ve seen<em>– </em>and more than once. The creators are Henry Lewis, Jonathan Sayer, and Henry Shields, three inveterate fun lovers who’ve turned themselves into Lords of Mishap, Masters of Wreckage, Honchos of Haywire.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s hardly a surprise but a welcome turn of cock-up events that they’ve now turned their glinting eyes, their lip-smacking tongues to J. M. Barrie’s children’s (and adults’) classic, <em>Peter Pan</em>. The rapture this time is that eager spectators on the way in are already well versed in the property. They – we – are already thinking about what could go wrong and hoping everything they’re – we’re – thinking about going wrong does go wrong.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foremost might be the flying, without which no <em>Peter Pan</em> would be a respectable <em>Peter Pan</em>. Then there’s the Darling family’s house pet, big and lumbering Nana. Will Nana be a puppet with entangled strings or a person in a dog suit? What about Captain Hook and his formidable hook? What’ll go wrong for that love-to-hiss villain and sidekick Smee? What’ll be with the already hand-ingesting crocodile? And on and on.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/19/peter-pan-goes-wrong-heap-o-corny-cheesy-mayhem-goes-right/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a pleasure to report that those of us – our number is growing mightily, especially among kids – arriving primed to find out the answers to these important questions and carloads more won’t be disappointed. Lewis, Sayer, and Shields show up (doubling and tripling,  like everyone else in the hilarious cast) offering hilarious answers. They’ve imagined abundantly gratifying fiascos, such as a narrator repeatedly running into trouble when the winch on which he’s perched fails to retreat to the wings smoothly, such as a character unable to remember lines that must be fed him through headphones, such as doors failing to open, such as a pirate ship unable to remain level.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No more of their misfits and mis-feats will be described here. Nothing more will be even spoiler alerted. They’re all too precious to be given away before they dutifully  fail. The only thing to say is that Lewis, Sayer, and Shields must have been cracking each other up when devising <em>Peter Pan Goes Wrong</em>. They must have been unable to go on for minutes when something howlingly funny struck them,</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All right and truth to tell, not every single one of the supposedly howlers works, only approximately 98 percent. So, anyone angrily storming the box office for his or her money back will only be someone totally unaware that silliness – the silliness here is sublime – is a necessary life ingredient, particularly during our current parlous, parodic times.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three writers, who met when studying at LAMDA (and  the rest is comedy-writing history), are so adept at handling the audience that they are able to have themselves roundly booed while turning those heartfelt boos into heartfelt cheers.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Lewis, Sayer, and Shields are, as always, part of the cast, they see to it that they blend in. There is no first among equals, the rest of whom are Chris Leask, Matthew Cavendish, Neil Patrick Harris (guesting for Harry Kershaw through April 30), Charlie Russell, Nancy Zamit, Brenann Stacker (in for Bianca Horn at the performance I saw), Greg Tannahill, and Ellie Morris. To all of them, kudos and (let’s hope) no crutches, unless the role calls  for crutches, which one role does.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It looks as if Lewis, Sayer, and Shields are now so bankable that their budget has fattened.  The result: the beauty of a three-sided Simon Scullion set sometimes twirling so fast it’s dizzying, Roberto Surace’s costumes (sometimes even plucked off unceremoniously), There’s also Matthew Haskins’ lighting design, and Ella Wahlstrom’s sound design, Richard Baker and Rob Falconer’s original music, and Tommy Kurzman’s wig and make-up design. Richard Hoist does the flying rig operating.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam Meggido directs, having also directed <em>Magic Goes Wrong</em>. He knew what he was getting into when he took on this sweating-brow assignment, and he’s made it look as if engineering all the controlled chaos is no more challenging than staging a drawing-room comedy.

(Why cucumbers are calm is a play for Lewis, Sayer, and Shields to tackle at another time.)</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, it looks as if Meggido has easily pulled off a Broadway marquee example of top-drawer theater madness.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Peter Pan Goes Wrong </strong><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">opened April 19, 2023, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre and runs through July 9.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>One of the problems with producing first-class productions of classic musicals from the so-called Golden Age is that there aren’t quite enough of them to go around. Lincoln Center Theater and resident director Bartlett Sher have favored playgoers with resplendent productions of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s <em>South Pacific</em> and <em>The King and I</em>, followed by a slightly engineered but nevertheless satisfying production of Lerner and Loewe’s <em>My Fair Lady</em>.</p>\n<p>Now comes Lerner and Loewe’s <em>Camelot</em>, which alas cannot hold a candle to <em>My Fair Lady</em>. Director Sher has called in Aaron Sorkin, that man for all seasons, to try to fix the book. Lyricist/librettist Alan Jay Lerner spent a fair amount of time trying to fix it himself; this proved impossible, as the intertwined love stories he concocted are never, either of them, altogether convincing. One doesn’t begrudge the folks at Lincoln Center, nor the authors’ estates, from handing it over to the man from <em>The West Wing</em>. But Sorkin runs into the same problem Lerner did, and without new songs to go with the new characterizations, <em>Camelot</em> remains as disjointed as before.</p>\n<p>This musical about “that one brief shining moment” has gone down in memory, among people who never saw it, as a classic. But <em>Camelot</em>—in its original 1960 production, starring the young Richard Burton and the younger Julie Andrews, as well as the relatively few major revivals starring the likes of Richard Harris or the aged-and-wobbly Burton himself—has always been a lumbering affair. Memories of the justly treasured original cast album make some folk recall it as a great show; I mean, Robert Goulet singing “If Ever I Would Leave You” has the resonance of “Younger Than Springtime” and “On the Street Where You Live” combined. Listeners are welcome to their fond memories of the score, yes. But the romantic core of the book, with its “boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy sends girl to be burned at the stake” center, was unconvincingly unworkable in 1960 and remains so in Sorkin’s 2023 rewrite.</p>\n<p>[<em>Read David Finkle’s</em> ★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em>]</p>\n<p>It is simplistic to say that the present-day King Arthur and Queen Guenevere cannot hope to compare to memories of Burton and Andrews; who can? Few of today’s playgoers likely saw Burton, who left the show after less than a year and who was the only one among Lerner, Loewe, Andrews, and the original production&#8217;s director and producers to nab a Tony. That said, the best-selling cast album makes many <em>think</em> they saw—and loved—that first <em>Camelot</em>.</p>\n<p>Lincoln Center’s king (Andrew Burnap) and queen (Philippa Soo) do well enough, given that Sorkin has pulled out the underpinnings of their characters and motivations. Soo (of <em>Hamilton</em> among other entertainments) comes off best, shining through the befogged proceedings even though portions of her songs have been trimmed. Burnap (of <em>The Inheritance</em>) makes a likable Arthur, if you can forget Burton. Jordan Donica, who without that grizzly beard sang “On the Street Where You Live” in Sher’s <em>My Fair Lady</em>, sings up a storm as the Frenchified Lancelot, just like Goulet did sixty years back. If there is “one brief shining moment” in this production, it’s when Donica launches into “If Ever I Would Leave You.”</p>\n<p>If Donica raises the Beaumont rafters, let it be said that nobody else does. LCT has continued its noble mission of restoring the musical splendor of its revivals, in this case with the original orchestrations (by Russell Bennett and Phil Lang) and a bulging pit orchestra (of 29). But there’s a mismatch; you might well need those 29 court musicians when you’ve got a chorus of 42 singers and dancers-who-sing, as in 1960. But here we’ve got a downsized combined ensemble of a mere dozen. Music director Kim Grigsby and her players sound great, but only point to the lack of choral power—and composer Loewe prided himself on the choral work in his scores. Compare this to the recent cornbread <em>Oklahoma!</em>, with its seven-piece fiddle-and-guitar band; as much as we honor Russell Bennett, that staging would not have worked so well with the full orchestration—which would have sounded, indeed, as if it was from another century.</p>\n<p>There is a similar lack of splendiferous panoply. The original <em>Camelot</em> was the most luxuriously ornate musical ever to hit the Rialto, so much so that when John Shubert—the only child among the three brothers Shubert—died in 1962, his funeral was held at the Majestic on Oliver Smith’s stunning throne-room set. Up at Lincoln Center, Sher’s usually majestical set designer Michael Yeargan seems to have been restricted to two thrones stranded in a sea of open space. There&#8217;s not even one of those tents with pennants streaming they used to erect for the nobility. Burton, famously, made his entrance from up a tree (where Arthur was hiding from the approach of his bride-to-be). Here, said tree is a spindly affair that looks like it’s constructed from cardboard. So much for <em>that</em> star entrance. The lavish costumes called for by <em>Camelot</em>, and by the Arthurian legend itself, are curiously absent; instead of all those royal ermines and gold-threaded purple tunics, Jennifer Moeller attires her players in stylish and relatively inexpensive black. What fun is there in that? The far reaches of empty stage space are, at least, effectively lit by Lap Chi Chu.</p>\n<p>Struggling to keep the proceedings under three hours, Sorkin eventually resorts to a dramatically lazy overlay of three items: the meeting between Mordred and Morgan Le Fey, who in this version is not the mystical sorceress of old but what I suppose they’d call a “lady scientist” and—get this—Arthur’s first love and mother of his child; Guenevere and Lance consummating their affair and, ultimately, being caught in flagrante; and the song “Fie on Goodness,” a clumsy filler which was never much good and Lerner himself tossed out while he was trying to fix the show. Not surprisingly, this cinematic overlap bogs down.</p>\n<p>We end up with one of those &#8220;I’ve always loved you, from the first moment&#8221; scenes between Arthur and Guenevere. That’s fine for Sorkin’s version of the book, if he feels audiences need it; but there is little in the Lerner script or the Lerner and Loewe score to support it. Guenevere’s one musical moment of honest emotion in the score, “I Loved You Once in Silence,” is unaccountably given to Lancelot, leaving Guenevere stranded.</p>\n<p>Let us add that Sorkin sees fit to have <em>his</em> Guenevere refer to Arthur’s signature song, “Camelot,” as “dumb” and, later, as “that stupid song about the weather.” I can’t say that I agree, personally; and I suppose that the thin-skinned Lerner would have been enraged to have that opinion of “Camelot” memorialized from the stage of <em>his</em> show.</p>\n<p><strong>Camelot opened April 13, 2023, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As for the Lincoln Center Theater revival of the Alan Jay Lerner-Frederick Loewe-Moss Hart <em>Camelot</em>: The first thing to know is it’s not a revival. It’s what’s categorized these days as a ”revisal.”</p>\n<p>Nothing wrong with that, as far as I’m concerned. I saw the original (1960) production, in which Lerner ran headlong into a daunting problem while adapting T. H. White’s <em>The Once and Future King</em> for the musical stage.</p>\n<p>White wrote at length, somewhere close to 700 pages. Lerner maybe managed in his first act to cover, with great whimsey and charm, approximately the first 100 or so pages of mythical King Arthur’s marriage to Guenevere and her disastrous extra-marital affair with Launcelot du Lac. The beset librettist then attempted to crowd White’s remainder into a second act that all but begged for once and future revisals.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/13/camelot-revival-offers-one-and-only-one-brief-shining-moment/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s</em> ★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Which is where the estimable Aaron Sorkin comes in. His last adaptation, the top-drawer <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, had Bartlett Sher directing; he also directs the new <em>Camelot</em>, following up his LCT <em>South Pacific</em> and <em>My Fair Lady</em> hits. Now Sher and Sorkin are reteamed, Sorkin acknowledging in more than one interview that, while loving musicals, he’s never written the book for one.</p>\n<p>So, how did he intend to crack this assignment? “I wanted this King Arthur to grow up to be Martin Sheen in <em>The West Wing</em>,” he has said. In other words, he’s going to write material harking back to material with which he’s already familiar, already comfortable. Turning <em>The Once and Future King</em> into a middle ages version of a dramatic television series, he starts by removing all the elements of magic that White instilled. He forgoes the notion of stage magic so he can focus on the transplanted aspects on a 21st-century White House.</p>\n<p>Result? His story lacks magic. Arthur (Andrew Burnap) is a pleasant enough young bloke who has (democratic?) notions of a unifying (never seen) round table. He meets his not cute but cold, arranged French bride Guenevere (Phillipa Soo) in a setting that designer Michael Yeargan envisions as, with its lone leafless tree, something like Samuel Beckett’s barren <em>Waiting for Godot</em> plain.</p>\n<p>Extolling the magic of his adopted home, he sings “Camelot,” which Guenevere quickly dismisses as a “dumb song.” That’s right. What Jackie Kennedy labeled the Kennedy administration signature anthem, is now a dumb song and, presto-chango!. establishes this Queen-to-be as the coolest of pragmatists. (It’s a good bet neither Lerner nor Loewe would have allowed this development were they able to be consulted.)</p>\n<p>Guenevere remains deep-winter chilly throughout Sorkin’s revised proceedings. That includes her introduction to Lancelot (Jordan Donica), who has already intoned “C’est Moi,” but is now to be informed in so many words by the haughty lady that his boastful “It’s me” cuts no ice with her.</p>\n<p>As Sorkin writes her, she’s so off-putting and off-put that (spoilers heading this way) nowhere in this <em>Camelot</em> does chemistry between Lancelot and her intrude, this despite a truncated bedroom scene. It’s even a weird surprise when in the final sequence Guenevere confesses she’s loved Arthur from the first words he spoke to her. Really? “Dumb song”? Guenevere could’ve fooled him – and the audience.</p>\n<p>Along the rocky <em>Camelot</em> way, there is some strong singing, especially from Soo, who initially proved her vocal prowess in <em>Hamilton</em>. The always engaging Taylor Trensch enlivens things as Arthur’s bastard son by Morgan le Fey (Marilee Talkington). He turns his <em>Camelot</em>-ending villainy into brief fun.</p>\n<p>Even more welcome is Dakin Matthews as Merlyn and Pellinore. Sorkin sends Merlyn into the wings after the first scene, the disappearance serving as a metaphor for Sorkin’s dismissing so offhandedly the mere thought that anything magical should occur during this nearly three-hour evening. Also, the swordplay at the Arthur and knights challenge to Lancelot (B. H. Barry the fight director) is flashy stuff, at last a few minutes of heated stage action.</p>\n<p>The belated good revisal news is that this <em>Camelot</em> can boast heroes: Lerner and Loewe, of course. Whereas bookwriter Lerner couldn’t solve his book (musical lovers know the non-stop disasters plaguing the endeavor), he triumphed with his lyrics. Loewe set them equally triumphantly. Nothing can beat ‘I Wonder What the King is Doing Tonight,” “How to Handle a Woman” or ‘What Do the Simple Folk Do?” “If Ever I Would Leave You” may be the last great love song composed for a Broadway musical.</p>\n<p>Not a clinker among the tunes, certainly not as initially delivered by the magical Richard Burton, Julie Andrews, Robert Goulet, and Roddy McDowell. And yet, even the Lerner and Loewe score runs into trouble. Due to Sorkin’s undernourished scribing, the emotions the songs reveal don’t fit the emotion-deprived characters.</p>\n<p>Since, for instance, the audience gets no glimpse of the clandestine Guenevere-Lancelot romance, her “Before I Gaze at You Again” and his ”I Loved You Once in Silence” lack the required weight. Lancelot is offered so little by the no-nonsense Guenevere that he’s never viewed truly loving her, not even once in silence. Earlier, she hardly seems the best candidate to lead “The Lusty Month of May,” From this version’s start to almost the finish, Guenevere masks any lustful twinge she might feel.</p>\n<p>In short, these <em>Camelot</em> revisers do not metaphorically pluck magic sword Excaliber from its stone. They leave it there. There’s simply not a more congenial spot for happily ever-aftering than here in <em>Camelot</em>; it’s just that this particular <em>Camelot</em> spot isn’t that <em>Camelot</em> spot.</p>\n<p><strong>Camelot opened April 13, 2023, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If you ever needed proof that Shakespeare stands the test of time, look no further than <em>Fat Ham</em>. The play by James Ijames is a profound riff on the Bard’s <em>Hamlet</em> set in the present day and, without apologies to the purists, it is a modern classic in its own right.</p>\n<p>Instead of Denmark it’s set in North Carolina at a family barbecue, but let there be no mistake, something is indeed rotten here. Shakespeare was writing about the corrupt state of affairs which had led depressed Hamlet to contemplate suicide. Ijames re-imagines the tragic tale as a comedy or rather a dramedy led by Juicy, a young black gay man suffering his own depression brought on by his dysfunctional, homophobic family.</p>\n<p>The names may have been changed but Ijames ingeniously matches both plot and characters. Juicy is visited by the ghost of his father who reveals that he was murdered by his own brother, Rev. He goes on to tell Juicy that he must avenge the murder and kill his uncle. And as in Hamlet, the plot thickens as we discover that Uncle Rev has just married Juicy’s mother, Tedra.</p>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\">[</span><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/12/fat-ham-james-ijames-play-is-the-thing/\"><em style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\">Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\">★★★★★ </span><em style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\">review here.</em></a><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif;\">]</span></p>\n<p>In an interview, Ijames noted that in the South where he grew up, everyone’s walking around with trauma and pain. That pretty much sums up his characters in this adaptation. And it’s where the play takes a left turn. Unlike Hamlet, these folks are more introspective about their lives; and with self-awareness comes plenty of organic humor.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Juicy shares Hamlet’s confusion but he can no more resort to violence than he could change his sexuality. Despite all the insults and taunts from his father and uncle about his so-called “softness”, his defense is a witty comeback. Marcel Spears aces this role with a dry understated delivery. As complex as Hamlet, Juicy is also a self-proclaimed empath; and in the most subtle way, Spears commands the stage, drawing us into his every move and gesture.</p>\n<p>Tio, Juicy’s cousin and close friend, is the alter ego of Shakespeare’s Horatio. When we first meet him he’s got his head buried in his phone watching porn. It’s comical but also revealing as he later spouts words of wisdom talking about choosing pleasure over harm. Chris Herbie Holland is terrific in the role,  a seeming slacker who turns out to be a true 21st century Horatio helping to center Juicy, telling him he suffers from inherited trauma and “can’t let it define you”.</p>\n<p>That trauma largely comes from Juicy’s bullying father “Pap” and his uncle “Rev.” Billy Eugene Jones takes on both roles, delivering portraits as perfectly seasoned as the ribs he’s got cooking on the grill. His Rev can turn on the charm while cutting down Juicy with the cruelest slights. A modern day King Claudius with a preacher’s gift of gab, this is the show’s true villain. And yes, we do yearn for his demise.</p>\n<p>Juicy’s mother, Tedra, like Hamlet’s Gertrude, loves her son but is thoughtlessly self-involved. Ijames gives her a back story that explains her motives and her neglectful nature. Nikki Crawford rounds out Tedra’s rough edges with some fine nuance. As careless as she seems to be, it’s hard to hate her.  She has her reasons.</p>\n<p>It points to another divergent twist in <em>Fat Ham</em>. Shakespeare largely colored his characters in black and white, giving <em>Hamlet</em>’s tragic end an air of inevitability. By contrast Ijames paints with a lot of grey. All of his characters, good and bad, even the nasty Rev, have their reasons, and there’s nothing inevitable about them. Real life is like that, and it’s what makes <em>Fat Ham</em> so compelling.</p>\n<p>The Ophelia counterpart is Opal and she is a sullen creature with her own demons to contend with.  She likes girls. Her overbearing mother, the Polonius stand-in, played by Benja Kay Thomas with delicious abandon, won’t have it, insisting that she wear dresses.</p>\n<p>As Opal, Adrianna Mitchell is excellent, popping off insightful gems of her own. Unlike Ophelia, she is no shrinking violet. At one point she proclaims to Juicy “We’re on the verge of gaining our powers.”</p>\n<p>Opal’s brother is Larry, <em>Fat Ham</em>’s answer to Laertes. Outwardly he’s a crisply uniformed Marine. Inwardly, he too is “soft”. Ijames imagines an attraction between him and Juicy. But just as the plot veers way off course, the dynamic shifts back to the source with a brutal scene that is as shocking as it is honest. Calvin Leon Smith runs the gamut of emotions in very short order and he pulls it off with tremendous finesse. No doubt he’s a gifted actor but nothing will prepare you for his final entrance.</p>\n<p>What a challenge it must be for any director to manage all that shifting back and forth between comedy and drama, prose and poetry, light and dark, But Saheem Ali is masterfully up to the task, treating each moment with absolute truth. It does get surreal at times with evocative dancing and music, even a little magic thrown in. And yet it’s all of a piece in this production. Nothing seems too weird or out of place.  In fact the collaborative effect of text, direction, lights, set, costumes all serve to amplify both theme and characters. In a karaoke sequence when Juicy sings Radiohead’s Creep, it’s hard to believe the lyrics weren’t written expressly for this show:<br />\n<em>But I’m a creep<br />\n</em><em>I’m a weirdo<br />\n</em><em>What the hell am I doin’ here?<br />\n</em><em>I don’t belong here</em></p>\n<p>There’s a brilliant merging of the two plays when Ijames has Juicy recite verbatim Hamlet’s famous soliloquy “What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason…” It points to the two unhappy protagonists’ attempts to understand the human condition. But while Hamlet fails to appreciate humanity in all its messy glory, Juicy seems more hopeful. And if there’s any doubt about that optimistic tone, just wait till you see how <em>Fat Ham</em> ends. I was wondering how Ijames was going to wrap it all up, considering that in <em>Hamlet</em> practically everyone dies. Turns out to be a delightful surprise. Consistent with his message – choose pleasure over harm – Ijames offers us a gloriously uplifting takeaway that might have given even Shakespeare pause. Maybe they didn’t have to die after all.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong><em>Fat Ham</em> opened April 12, 2023, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through June 25.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Slight spoiler alert: <em>Fat Ham</em>, James Ijames’ clever contemporary queer take on <em>Hamlet</em>, is not a tragedy. We hope the playwright will forgive us for revealing that his version, now on Broadway after a sellout 2022 off-Broadway run—doesn’t end with all those deaths via stabbing, poison, and/or drowning. We won’t tell you exactly how it concludes, other than to say that it involves sequins. And something that might make Florida republicans very nervous.</p>\n<p>No show that features Teena Marie’s 1981 funk anthem “Square Biz” and Crystal Waters’ 1994 dance-pop hit “100% Pure Love” could ever be classified as a total downer, even if it is inspired by Shakespeare’s most famous tragedy. (Fun fact: Teena Marie name-checks Shakespeare in “Square Biz.”) But you needn’t know anything about the soliloquy-spouting depressive Dane to appreciate <em>Fat Ham</em>.</p>\n<p>If you are familiar with <em>Hamlet</em>, you’ll notice Ijames’ crafty character and plot references: a recently deceased man, Pap (Billy Eugene Jones), whose wife, Tedra (Nikki Crawford), very quickly weds the aforementioned dead hubby’s brother, Rev (also Billy Eugene Jones). Pap appears as a ghost to his son, Juicy (Marcel Spears), inciting thoughts of revenge. Ijames seamlessly weaves in monologues—e.g., “What a piece of work is man…”—and famous lines (naturally, “there’s the rub” pops up while discussing pork ribs). Juicy and his pal Tio (Chris Herbie Holland) even chat about a guy they once knew called Yorick.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/12/fat-ham-pulitzer-prize-winner-makes-for-a-savory-dish-on-broadway/\"><em>Read Roma Torre’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>And if you’re not a <em>Hamlet</em> superfan, <em>Fat Ham</em> is simply a play about a young gay man, Juicy, who’s having trouble reconciling the loss of his mean-as-a-snake dad and with the acquisition of a possibly even-meaner stepdad. During his backyard barbecue wedding party, pitmaster Rev sneers and calls him “soft,” and a “pocket of nothing,” not long before sucker-punching him in the gut. Former pitmaster Pap—Rev has usurped not only his woman but also his smoker—materializes as a ghost ostensibly to ask Juicy to avenge his death. Or is it to criticize his eating habits and call him a “pansy” and “girly ass puddle of spit”? (Jones, incidentally, makes a meal of both roles.) We should all listen to momma Tedra, who can boost anyone’s self-esteem, proudly telling her &#8220;baby&#8221; that he’s “thicc”: “A Thickums. A Yum Yums. Thicker than a bowl of oatmeal. Boooooody.… Baby, people paying good money for an ass like that?”</p>\n<p>The entire Public Theater–National Black Theater off-Broadway cast—including Adriana Mitchell as the headstrong Opal, Calvin Leon Smith as secretive soldier Larry, and Benja Kay Thomas as their overbearing but loving mom Rabby (stand-ins for Ophelia, Laertes, and Polonius, respectively)—has made the move uptown, and the ensemble is as fabulous as ever. Spears’ performance as the self-described “empath” Juicy is painted with delicate—one might even say soft—brushstrokes, but the details reach even the rear orchestra. His despondent rendition of Radiohead’s “Creep”—a party-killing karaoke choice if ever there was one—is darker (literally and figuratively) and more dramatic; the lyrics (“I want a perfect body/ I want a perfect soul”; “What the hell am I doin’ here?/ I don’t belong here”) are Juicy’s cri de coeur.</p>\n<p>And speaking of karaoke, Crawford’s booty-shaking, R-rated, twerk-filled performance of “100% Pure Love” now gets the stage space it deserves. (Is Tedra really making Juicy sing the “I want your love, I want it tonight” part as she gyrates in front of his uncle-slash-stepdad? Awkward!) Credit director Saheem Ali—who’s making his Broadway debut, as are five of the actors—for keeping the 95-minute play tight in the transition from an intimate 275-seat theater to a 700-plus-seat house. It’s not just about ensuring that the jokes land, which they do; it’s also about the subtler moments. “I want to lay my head in your lap,” Larry tells Juicy. When Hamlet tries that on Ophelia (<em>“</em><em>Lady</em><em>, </em><em>shall I lie in your lap?”)</em>, he’s going for laughs and sexual innuendo. Between Larry and Juicy, there’s genuine tenderness, and maybe even more.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Fat Ham</em> opened April 12, 2023, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through June 25.

Photo credit: Matthew Murphy, Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When it was first announced<em>, Shucked</em> didn’t seem a likely candidate for Broadway success. A show featuring country music that began as a send-up of <em>Hee-Haw</em>? Sure, New York City has plenty of tourists from rural states, but the Great White Way tends a bit toward snobbery. (And yes, I’m aware of such successes as <em>Big River</em> and <em>The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas</em>, among others. But those are the exception to the rule. <em>Bright Star</em>, anyone?) And while I enjoyed Minnie Pearl’s hats and Roy Clark’s guitar picking as much as the next guy, I can’t say that I was looking forward to a musical that seemed to revolve entirely around…corn. Indeed, you can’t walk a block in midtown without encountering one of the show’s banners featuring a bright yellow husk.</p>\n<p>Well, hush my mouth! The musical, featuring a book by Robert Horn (<em>Tootsie</em>) and songs by Nashville veterans Brandy Clark and Shane McAnally, emerges as one of the brightest surprises of the spring season, delivering more hilarious gags per minute than any show since <em>The Book of Mormon</em>. It does nothing less, and to be fair, not much more, than provide a wonderfully good time, assuming you don’t mind feeling a bit sheepish for laughing at jokes that could easily have been delivered by Jeff Foxworthy.</p>\n<p>The show, which has departed from the original <em>Hee-Haw</em> idea, takes place, where else, in Cob County, which, as you might guess, depends on its namesake crop for its livelihood. So it’s particularly distressing when the corn starts dying for no apparent reason, prompting local girl Maizy (Caroline Innerbichler, thoroughly charming in her Broadway debut) to leave her small town for the first time in search of help in the “big, scary city” of Tampa. There, she enlists the help of Gordy (John Behlmann), a slick, handsome con man posing as a podiatrist she believes can solve the problem because of his sign advertising his services as a “corn doctor.”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/04/shucked-salty-corn-on-the-musical-cob/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s</em><em> </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Gordy offers to help, but only because he’s deeply in debt to gangsters and believes that the precious stones adorning her bracelet, which she says are plentiful throughout Cob County, will solve his financial problems. The innocent Maizy also falls immediately in love with Gordy, despite being already engaged to her longtime boyfriend Beau (Andrew Durand) whom she was just about to marry when the corn started failing.</p>\n<p>All of these plot developments, by the way, are introduced by a pair of narrating “Storytellers” who also regale us in song and occasionally play other minor characters. They’re played by a baby-faced Grey Henson (<em>Mean Girls</em>) and a more sardonic Ashley D. Kelley, and they’re a constant delight.</p>\n<p>To describe more of the plot seems silly, since the show doesn’t exactly traffic in narrative nuance. What it does traffic in, and to a degree that rivals midtown Manhattan during rush hour, are jokes. Lots and lots of jokes, many of them of the punning variety. I normally find puns to be a lower form of humor, but Horn, who has plenty of comedy writing bona fides thanks to his experience as a creator, writer and producer of such sitcoms as <em>Designing Women</em>, <em>Living Single</em> and others, turns them here into a fine art. Also hilarious are the mock aphorisms on display, many of them delivered by the town philosopher, Peanut (Kevin Cahoon, his deadpan delivery enhancing every line). Even if some of the jokes are more groan than guffaw worthy, they arrive with such rapid-fire velocity that you’ve barely stopped laughing at one before succumbing to the next.</p>\n<p>Beginning with the rousing opening number, “Corn,” featuring a corn cob kick line (I kid you not), the score by Clark and McAnally, featuring not just country-flavored songs but also traditional Broadway-style ballads, proves consistently tuneful. One highlight is “Independently Owned,” delivered in showstopping fashion by big-voiced supporting player Alex Newell, whose spectacular turn as Maizy’s cousin Lulu is guaranteed a Tony nomination. Innerbichler and Durand are given moments to shine in their respective solo numbers “Maybe Love” and “I’ll Be Okay,” with the latter also garnering audience catcalls in a scene in which he removes his shirt to reveal a chiseled torso in a comic attempt to win back Maizy with some exaggerated muscle flexing.</p>\n<p>Director Jack O’Brien orchestrates the proceedings with endless imagination and precise comic staging that accentuates the show’s strengths while downplaying its weaknesses. Thanks to the outstanding efforts of all concerned, <em>Shucked</em> feels as light and airy as Scott Pask’s beautiful set design of a huge, multi-level wooden barn.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Shucked opened April 4, 2023, at the Nederlander Theatre.

Kelley, Grey Henson in Shucked. Photo: Matthew Murphy, Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Oscar Wilde is frequently credited with declaring that puns are “the lowest form of humor.” Another Oscar – Levant – altered the remark by insisting, “A pun is the lowest form of humor – when you don&#8217;t think of it first.” As a matter of playwriting annals, Wilde thought of it first and many times over in <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em>, starting with the title.</p>\n<p>But why the talk about the purpose and power of puns when beginning a review of <em>Shucked</em>, the new musical tracking troubles in Cob County where corn is the cherished, and only, produce?</p>\n<p>Because: Puns are the primary focus of an argument in <em>Shucked</em>’s favor. The tuners bookwriter is Robert Horn, last on Broadway with the script of the (so-so) musicalized <em>Tootsie</em>. Along with that credit, he arrives with a long list of awards for properties like television’s <em>Designing Women</em>, where he was a writer. The latter explains how so much of <em>Shucked</em> has a sit-cob ring – oops, I meant to type sit-com ring.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/04/04/shucked-cornpone-hilarity/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>What’s pertinent here is that with <em>Shucked</em>, Horn is following in Oscar Wilde’s stealthy footsteps. From start to finish of this work, he raises punning from its incorrectly regarded place as the lowest form of humor. Instead, and practically from line to line, he lifts it to the level of art. I’m not going to offer illustrative kernels. That could impair the undeniably cumulative watching and listening enjoyment – and yes, “kernels” is editorial punning.</p>\n<p>Also, keep in mind that the name “Horn” rhymes with “porn.’ The estimable playwright deals in that as well – or close enough. As comics say about other comics, he (or she) “works blue.” Horn works so blue, he practically<br />\nturns midnight blue. There’s a <em>Shucked</em> character called Peanut (the much-loved Kevin Cahoon), who might as well be handed a mic. More than once, he delivers a blue stand-up routine. For instance, he gets to say<br />\nseemingly innocent remarks such as recalling an incident when putting a Christmas tree up himself.</p>\n<p>Being exposed to Horn’s masterful pun demonstration comes close to equaling the price of <em>Shucked</em> admission, but what about the rest of it? Slightly less of a recommendation – with a caveat: Jack O’Brien’s direction.</p>\n<p>For this production, which prides itself in being as corny as Cob County, O’Brien imbues the production with rat-a-tat style that not only knocks your socks off but blows your mind. The knocking and blowing are enhanced by Scott Pask’s set of a large, slatted barn with occasional corn rows sliding on. Japhy Weideman’s lighting and John Shivers’ sound help a bushel, too.</p>\n<p>What are all these first-rate Broadway values enhancing? The above-mentioned Cob County (in an unidentified state: Kentucky?) is a town ruled by a law not unlike <em>Brigadoon&#8217;</em>s town of Brigadoon. Sufficient unto themselves, no Cob County citizen can leave.</p>\n<p>Someone does, however: Maizy (Caroline Innerbichler) – Maizy, like Maize (get it?) – who feels obligated to quit not only Cob County but also fiancé Beau (Andrew Durand). She’s learned, as has the entire town, that Cob County soil is drying up and reckons that only an out-of-town expert can solve the problem. Off she goes to Tampa and locates “corn doctor” Gordy (John Behlmann), a podiatrist and con man, whom she brings back to Cob County, believing he’ll solve the problem.</p>\n<p>That’s the storyline, during which she gets entangled in marriage vows to Gordy, while he falls for her hard-as-nails funny cousin Lulu (Alex Neville). And the audience is expected to hang on the suspense as to who will end<br />\nup nuptialing whom, which is hardly a cliffhanger of <em>Perils of Pauline</em>/<em>Flash Gordon</em> magnitude.</p>\n<p>Okay, it all passes by easily enough – as enlivened by a proficient cast and Horn’s Olympic-style punditry. And by the way, it’s narrated (longer than necessary) as a supposed fable by Storyteller 1 (Ashley D. Kelley) and<br />\nStoryteller 2 (Grey Henson), who are the lucky recipients of much of that unceasing pun-running.</p>\n<p>Remember, please, that this is a musical about corn of at least two types piled “as high as an elephant’s eye.” (Thanks for that borrowed <em>Oklahoma!</em> lyric, Oscar Hammerstein!) Because the corn is so high, it must have<br />\nstruck the Shucked purveyors that it should have a corntry music sound. Oops, I meant to type country music.</p>\n<p>The music and lyrics are attributed to Brandy Clark and Shane McAnally, for whom this appears to be a first Broadway score. To country music lovers, the names won’t be new: Grammy noms by the big numbers. For <em>Shucked</em> they offer “Somebody Will,” that Durand sells like a trouper, and “Independently Owned,” that Neville blasts as if it’s the roof-raising 11 0’clock number, even if it’s in the first act. There’s also “Hee-Haw,” which the male cast members sing – and is choreographed by the underused Sarah O’Gleby. This one could be an homage to the long-running CW tv series, though without Minnie Pearl.</p>\n<p>Other than those three items, the songs serve their purpose but don’t accomplish much more, which could lead to Clark and McAnally being judged as only serviceable for such an assignment. Their fans know better. The explanation is that here they’re ostensibly writing for hire, whereas their best work singly or with others is writing unflinchingly from within themselves. For starters, listen to her “Buried” and his “Are Your Eyes Still Blue” and immediately join their<br />\nfan clubs.</p>\n<p>What of <em>Shucked</em> itself? Let’s just go with an endearing, soil-kicking “Aw, shucks!”</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Shucked opened April 4, 2023, at the Nederlander Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p><i><br />\nLife of Pi </i>is a ravishing collaboration of art, craft, and a magnificent lead performance. It would be very easy for me to say the design team steals the spotlight in this exquisite production, but that is not the case.</p>\n<p>Adapted from the bestselling novel by Yann Martel, <i>Life of Pi</i> tells the story of Pi Patel, the son of a zookeeper from India whose idyllic childhood is tragically upended at sea when his family leaves home for a better life in Canada.</p>\n<p>Pi, short for Piscine, is a precocious teenager with an intense curiosity about religion. Not content solely with the Hinduism of his upbringing, he seeks answers in Catholicism and Islam. He says he just wants to believe in God but is confused by the divergent stories of faith.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/03/30/life-of-pi-the-acclaimed-novel-and-film-is-now-brought-to-thrilling-theatrical-life/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>It is Pi’s spiritual strength that enables him to survive as he endures the devastation of losing his entire family when their cargo ship containing most of the zoo animals sinks in the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>As hard as it is to believe, Pi tells the miraculous story of his 227 days on a life boat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.</p>\n<p>The adaptation by Lolita Chakrabarti smartly begins at the end of the book just days after Pi’s harrowing journey ends on a remote beach in Mexico. From his hospital room, he is interviewed by a Japanese official from the cargo ship company and a representative from the Canadian embassy. Through flashback, Pi begins to narrate the events that led to his ordeal.</p>\n<p>That’s also when director Max Webster begins to weave his stage magic as the set instantly converts to Pi’s home, a thriving marketplace, and the zoo where we first meet the animals so inventively realized by puppet co-designers Nick Barnes and Finn Caldwell, also credited as Puppetry/Movement Director. Their work is stunning as the puppets seem to come to life thanks to the incredible manipulations of a dozen or so puppeteers embodying, among others, the motions of a zebra, hyena, orangutan, and most especially Richard Parker.  With no effort to disguise them, the human handlers essentially disappear with every movement of those lifelike creations.</p>\n<p>It’s a sleight of hand and body that amounts to bravura choreography, rivaling in its way the talented ensemble in <i>Bob Fosse’s</i> <i>Dancin’ </i>currently on stage just across the street.</p>\n<p>The sleight of hand doesn’t stop there. Tim Hatley’s inspired scenic designs will have you scratching your head wondering ‘how did they do that?’ The life boat seems to materialize out of the blue, quite literally, with schools of luminescent fish passing by amid roiling waves you’d swear was actual water.  The imagery conjured up by lighting designer Tim Lutkin and video designer Andrzej Goulding is astonishing. And so realistic are those visuals, in a scene when Pi jumps into the “water” and disappears, we actually see ripples of waves in his wake. Wow!</p>\n<p>And now for more “wow”. Pi is played by Hiran Abeysekera, a young man with gobs of talent that seems to know no end. He’s already won the Olivier award for this performance which calls for him to be on stage the entire two hours as he emotes like a Shakespearean while nimbly leaping, balancing and bounding like a world class acrobat.  He has clearly mastered this complex role after his many months performing in London’s West End and it’s an absolute joy to see this gifted actor, so fully nuanced by now, tapping into such remarkable virtuosity.</p>\n<p>The other performers round out the cast with a fine degree of professionalism though the roles are not nearly so well defined. Chakrabarti made some necessary changes to the script, largely justified, considering that so much of the book is interior thought. So when Pi reads a survival manual, an actor playing the naval captain who wrote it, enters, verbalizing the life-saving tips. And Pi’s father, impressively played by Rajesh Bose, shows up as if in memory helping Pi to understand how to tame his man-eating companion.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting some prophetic words of wisdom from the father complaining that the problem with the world is that bad behavior has no consequences and we need more accountability.  Some very timely sentiments in our own hostile universe.</p>\n<p>For those familiar with the story, either from the novel or the Ang Lee film, one of the most arresting moments centers on Pi’s arrival at a mysterious island inhabited exclusively by thousands of meerkats. Given the dazzling artistry of the technical crew, I was looking forward to seeing how they were going to depict those fantastical scenes. Instead, the play addressed that episode only through dialogue. It was all left to the imagination. I hate to think it was due to a budgeting shortfall.</p>\n<p>A note of caution to anyone bringing young children. This is not a G-rated puppet show &#8211; less Disney, more National Geographic. There is carnage &#8211; blood, guts and all!  And because the designers do such a good job mimicking reality, some of the scenes can be difficult to watch.</p>\n<p>The production will likely bring to mind two other ingenious displays of theatrical puppetry &#8211; <i>Lion King </i>and <i>War Horse. </i>Like them, <i>Life of Pi </i>does a phenomenal job of creating a sense of realism with extraordinary stagecraft. And while <i>Life of Pi </i>may not have the emotional punch of the other two shows, it succeeds in different ways. In light of Pi’s relentless pursuit of spirituality, the play prompts us to ponder our own beliefs, the nature of truth, morality, faith, and perhaps most resonantly, the incomparable power of live theater.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Life of Pi </b>opened March 30, 2023, at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre.

Photo credit: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The art of stagecraft is on stunning display in the new theatrical version of <em>Life of Pi</em>, Yann Martel’s 2001 best-selling novel about a teenage Indian boy who inexplicably survives being stranded at sea for 227 days while sharing a small boat with a deadly Bengal tiger. If the metaphysical underpinnings of the tale don’t fully register in Lolita Chakrabarti’s Olivier Award-winning adaptation, audiences will nonetheless be thrilled by the spectacular Broadway production featuring virtuosic puppetry.</p>\n<p>Also adapted into an award-winning film directed by Ang Lee, the story revolves around Pi (a superb Hiran Abeysekera, with Adi Dixit serving as alternate), the nickname of Piscine Molitor Patel, whose family owns a zoo in India. When his father (Rajesh Bose) decides that the political conditions in the country are proving too volatile, he arranges for the family and the zoo animals to be transported on a Japanese freighter ship to Canada. Along the way, the vessel sinks due to a massive storm, leaving Pi as the only survivor in a small lifeboat.</p>\n<p>Well, not the only one. He discovers that several of the zoo animals are in the boat as well, including a hyena, an injured zebra, an orangutan, and a rat. Oh, and the tiger as well, whose innocuous-sounding name, Richard Parker, belies his fearsomeness. It isn’t long before the law of survival of the fittest has kicked in and the only animal left standing is the tiger, with Pi desperately attempting to figure out how not to get eaten by him.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/03/30/life-of-pi-play-delivers-stunning-stagecraft-to-die-for/\"><em>Read Roma Torre’s </em>★★★★☆<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>We know in advance that Pi survives his horrific ordeal because the tale is told in flashback, with Pi recuperating in a Mexican hospital and being interrogated by a kindly Canadian diplomat (Kirstin Louie) and a much less sympathetic Japanese insurance investigator (Daisuke Tsuji) who finds Pi’s story wholly unbelievable. But that doesn’t detract from the show’s suspense, because what we don’t know is exactly <em>how</em> Pi manages to survive.</p>\n<p><em>Life of Pi</em> comes across as a rather thin story onstage, one that was surely richer and deeper in novelistic form. The central character is depicted as wise beyond his years, exploring multiple religions as a young boy and delivering philosophical and spiritual aphorisms like an old sage in an adolescent boy’s body. Those elements, however, are subsumed by the survival tale, which proves thrilling on its own terms, especially in this galvanizing staging by Max Webster in which all the animals are brought to life by an expert team of puppeteers. They include Fred Davis and Scarlet Wilderink, who shared the Best Supporting Actor Olivier Award for the London production.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind, by the way, that this is not a show for young children, as the puppet animals, as adorable as they sometimes are, are shown behaving in typically animalistic bloodthirsty fashion that proves a far cry from <em>The Lion King</em>. Although kids would probably get a kick out of Richard Parker’s simulated excrement, dropping from his hind quarters, that a starving Pi attempts to eat out of desperation.</p>\n<p>Besides the spellbinding puppetry, the production features stunning projection designs, special effects, lighting, sound design and musical underscoring that combine to create a truly stunning experience. That praise, however, must come with a caveat: Theatergoers would be well advised not to sit in the front orchestra section, as many of the projections, including the swirling ocean, are displayed on the particularly high stage floor, making viewing them difficult if not impossible from there. The best seats would definitely be in the front mezzanine.</p>\n<p>The play feels somewhat drawn out at 135 minutes (including intermission), and the climactic narrative twist is too blatantly spoon-fed to the audience, as if the show’s creators were afraid that we would not be able to figure it out. But those are minor quibbles about this enthralling, wildly imaginative production.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Life of Pi </b>opened March 30, 2023, at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre.

Photo by Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Two themes dominate Stephen Sondheim&#8217;s recorded memories of the genesis of his masterpiece <em>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</em>. Running into Christopher Bond&#8217;s pocket-sized Grand Guignol treatment of Victorian serial murder in London, the composer-lyricist saw a chance to pay homage to the lush cinema scoring of Bernard Herrmann (1911-1975) and others of his movie-mad youth. At the same time, according to the memoir <em>Finishing the Hat, </em>he hoped to &#8220;keep the audience in suspense and maybe even scare the hell out of them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many fine productions, large-scale or intimate, have sauntered their way up and down Fleet Street since Hugh Wheeler&#8217;s book and Sondheim&#8217;s score premiered in 1979 in Harold Prince&#8217;s acclaimed staging. But the current revival at the Lunt-Fontanne is a thing apart. Thomas Kail, director of that latter-day groundbreaker <em>Hamilton, </em>has assembled all the pieces needed for what Sondheim himself finally summed up as &#8220;a movie for the stage.&#8221; The result is something both sumptuous and terrifying, truly a <em>Sweeney Todd </em>for the ages.</p>\n<p>A cinematic motif is established from the very first cues. Out of smoky blackness come stinging rays of white light from stage left, as if waiting to entrap Peter Lorre scuttling in from Fritz Lang&#8217;s <em>M. </em>The prodigious lighting designer Natasha Katz knows just when and how to capture a character in overhead spots for maximum drama, as when the lighting elevates Anthony&#8217;s (Jordan Fisher) impassioned promise of liberation, &#8220;Johanna,&#8221; into an act one showstopper.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/03/26/sweeney-todd-a-bloody-good-treat-for-sondheim-fans/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s</em> ★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Katz and scenic designer Mimi Lien prove ideal accomplices in bringing film noir to life. Employing a two-tiered set — a bridge hovering high above the main playing area — Lien situates scenes in tight spaces that Katz starkly outlines, often in counterpoint to each other. Kail&#8217;s is a bold choice, to put so much action (ingenue Johanna&#8217;s prison by her evil guardian Judge Turpin, and a stunning silhouetted flashback) at such a remove. But Lien and Katz conspire to ensure that what&#8217;s crucial is always within our line of sight. And certainly having Sweeney&#8217;s tonsorial parlor up there permits his victims to take a fantastic slalom down to the baking cellar (kudos to FX master Jeremy Chernick for that amazing barber chair).</p>\n<p>Dazzling as this physical production is (you can practically feel the heat emanating from the pie oven, thanks again to Lien and Katz), it&#8217;s those who enact the tale who make the difference. Josh Groban, his acting chops demonstrated in Broadway&#8217;s <em>Great Comet of 1812, </em>unsurprisingly sings the bejeezus out of this score. Groban takes us from Heaven back to Hell again in Jonathan Tunick&#8217;s orchestrations, which are blessedly featured in their full complement of 26 pieces under <em>Hamilton </em>conductor Alex Lacamoire&#8217;s vigorous direction. But Groban&#8217;s got something else going for him in this role, cf. scene one, when Todd reminisces about his old self Benjamin Barker and Lucy, his &#8220;beautiful&#8230;virtuous&#8221; wife. As for the barber himself? &#8220;He was — naїve.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hard as it is to imagine Len Cariou (the original) or Johnny Depp (in the movie version) ever the victim of naїveté, there&#8217;s a purity to Groban that no heavy beard can mask. That innocent affect renders instantly believable his long-ago betrayal by judicial authority, the part of his backstory we don&#8217;t see enacted. Essential groundwork is thus laid for his ultimate arc from human being to madman to monster.</p>\n<p>As for his partner in appalling crime, pie shop owner <em>manqué</em> Mrs. Lovett, it&#8217;s not enough to say that Annaleigh Ashford is a hilarious grotesque. Hers is, in fact, a uniquely comic creation right up there with <em>Born Yesterday</em>&#8216;s Billie Dawn or <em>Guys and Dolls</em>&#8216; Miss Adelaide. Younger than springtime and spry as a cricket, Lovett is both her name and her goal, insistent on seducing the erstwhile Barker into her bed long before unveiling her cannibalistic scheme. &#8220;A Little Priest&#8221; garners even more laughs than usual through Groban and Ashford&#8217;s seeming impromptu in topping each other with punnery. (Ashford tosses in a little salute to Donald O&#8217;Connor in <em>Singin&#8217; in the Rain </em>along the way.) I daresay no other Mrs. L., not even the glorious Angela Lansbury, has ever played her intention with such physical and vocal abandon, nor underplayed her greed so sinisterly.</p>\n<p>Underplaying is, in fact, the order of the day. Kail insists that character choices be revealed clearly but unpunctuated, from Beadle Bamford (a truly scary John Rapson) strangling a caged bird with one effortless hand, to Tobias (charming young Gaten Matarazzo of <em>Stranger Things</em>) swaying beatifically to the ground while touting Lovett&#8217;s meat pies in &#8220;God, That&#8217;s Good.&#8221; Swaying, along with aborted, strangled movements, are highlights of Steven Hoggett&#8217;s choreography, during which the outstanding ensemble participates in the emotions on which they&#8217;re commenting. This production has no patience for black-clad, supercilious, quasi-Brechtian fist-shaking (&#8220;The world is shit and it&#8217;s your fault, audience&#8221; — possibly the least persuasive of staging choices back in &#8217;79). Instead, they and we are all seen as Sweeney&#8217;s victims, complicit, as brilliantly costumed by Emilio Sosa, in visions of human pageantry worthy of a Bruegel, and riotously played against a full-moon backdrop. And you know how crazy folks get during a full moon.</p>\n<p>With Kail and company as his right arm, <em>Sweeney</em>&#8216;s complete again.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Sweeney Todd </b>opened March 26, 2023, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Recently, I read an article theorizing that Stephen Sondheim fans group themselves into camps according to their favorite shows—<em>Into the Woods</em> people, <em>Follies</em> people, etc. Presumably there’s some kind of psychological diagnosis to be made here: <em>Company</em> fanatics are more likely to be commitment-phobes and loners (“Marry me, and everybody will leave us alone”); <em>Sunday in the Park With George</em> acolytes are surely artists; <em>Assassins</em> enthusiasts—well, I just hope the government is monitoring their social media activity.</p>\n<p>I’d never call myself a <em>Sweeney Todd</em> person—thrillers simply aren’t my thing, on stage or screen—but every time I see a production I leave with a deeper appreciation for Sondheim’s score, packed with swoon-worthy melodies and subversively witty lyrics. (Is “A Little Priest” the best-ever example of Sondheim’s wordplay? Discuss.) The new Broadway revival—starring Josh Groban, Annaleigh Ashford, a 26-member orchestra, and Jonathan Tunick’s original orchestrations—is guaranteed to do the same for you. It sounds spectacular.</p>\n<p>Judging by the ear-splitting shrieks that greet his entrance—a brilliant coup-de-théâtre by director Thomas Kail (<em>Hamilton</em>, <em>In the Heights</em>) that you’ll wish you could rewind and watch over and over—Groban is this version’s main draw. And while he’s no stage neophyte—he received a 2017 Tony nomination for his turn as the melancholy Pierre in <em>Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812</em>—Groban certainly isn’t the obvious choice for the “demon barber of Fleet Street.” There will be some griping that he’s not scary enough. But if theatergoers are thinking about the last New York City revival, the intimate Tooting Arts Club import that turned the Barrow Street Theater into a bakehouse, it’s tough to match the menace of Jeremy Secomb locking eyes with you from mere inches away. Also note that Groban isn’t given the horror makeup treatment—no pasty white face, or hollowed-out eyes (I can still see Michael Cerveris’ supremely creepy Sweeney in the 2005 John Doyle Broadway revival). Groban essentially embodies this lyric that company sings after Sweeney reunites with his beloved razor: “His voice was soft, his manner mild.” But you want frightening? His “Epiphany”—when Sweeney decides that “we all deserve to die”—is downright bone-chilling, Groban crouched on the floor in a fit of madness, his face lit from below like he’s hovering perilously above the fires of hell.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/03/26/sweeney-todd-god-thats-great/\"><em>Read Bob Verini’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>As Sweeney’s literal partner-in-crime, Mrs. Lovett, Ashford (a Tony winner for <em>You Can’t Take It With You</em>) plays the part of the worst piemaker in London for laughs—big laughs—and gets ’em. She’s hilarious—and extremely handsy with Sweeney—but, regrettably, not at all villainous. Remember, it’s she who comes up with the cannibalism scheme: Sweeney just wanted to slit the throat of Judge Turpin (Jamie Jackson), the man who wrongly imprisoned him and separated him from his wife and now teenaged daughter, Johanna (Maria Bilbao, lovely)—and then, well, anyone else who got in his way. She had the depraved, if economical, idea to grind up the corpses for pastry filling. (Upcycling centuries before it was trendy!) But there’s not a hint of depravity in Ashford’s portrayal, full of genius comic touches though it is.</p>\n<p>Ruthie Ann Miles (a Tony winner for her Lady Thiang in 2015’s <em>The King and I</em>) makes the most of the small but pivotal role of the Beggar Woman; no spoilers, but when she sings “Hey, don’t I know you, mister?” to Sweeney, that’s what we call a clue. And Gaten Matarazzo (Netflix’s <em>Stranger Things</em>) couldn’t be better as Tobias, the “simple” boy who goes from hawking hair tonic for faux Italian barber Pirelli (Nicholas Christopher) to pushing pies for suddenly in-demand baker Mrs. Lovett.</p>\n<p>The other star of this production? Natasha Katz’s lighting, a master class in chiaroscuro that brings some much-needed dimension to the massive stage of the Lunt-Fontanne. One wishes for a smaller Broadway theater to get closer to this <em>Sweeney Todd</em>, but perhaps then we wouldn’t have had a couple dozen people moving about onstage like <em>The Walking Dead</em> (pretty cool). Or the trick barber chair that sends Sweeney’s victims sliding down a tunnel into the basement (very cool). Or, of course, that massive orchestra—the coolest thing of all.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sweeney Todd</em> opened March 26, 2023, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre.

Photo credit: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Is it too late to rename the show “Great Stepmother?”</p>\n<p>Not that the stepmother in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s new musical is virtuous, not by any means. But thanks to three-time Tony nominee Carolee Carmello’s uproarious performance, she becomes the dominant force in <em>Bad Cinderella</em>.</p>\n<p>It’s one of the few saving graces of this campy exercise in fairy tale exhumation which inexplicably received favorable reviews in its original London incarnation but will require a genuine Fairy Godmother to make its spell last longer than midnight on Broadway.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to know exactly to whom the show is pitched, except perhaps bachelorette groups or their male equivalents who are bored with Chippendales. Indeed, there are so many hunky shirtless men parading around the Imperial Theatre you think the show marks the return of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, minus Charles Ludlam’s wit. There’s even a lengthy scene featuring them fencing while bare-chested, because everyone knows that when you’re fencing you want to expose as much skin as possible.</p>\n<p>The sophomoric book is credited to Emerald Fennell, who won an Academy Award for <em>Promising Young</em> <em>Woman</em> and seems intent here on belying that film’s title. Alexis Scheer is credited with “Book Adaptation” on the program’s title page and “Additional Book Material” in the bios, so it’s anyone’s guess what she actually contributed. The musical’s title seems to refer to the fact that Cinderella (Linedy Genao, underwhelming in what should have been a breakout turn) is introduced while defacing a statue of Prince Charming. She’s also rather petulant, but “Petulant Cinderella” but wouldn’t look as catchy on the marquee. In any case, the character doesn’t make any sense. Nor is she appealing, which presumably explains why she disappears for long stretches in a musical revolving around her.</p>\n<p>Since Prince Charming has disappeared and is presumed dead, the next in line to the throne is the hapless Prince Sebastian (Jordan Dobson, recently seen in <em>A Beautiful Noise</em>), apparently a childhood friend of Cinderella’s (you’d think they would have traveled in different circles). They live in the town of Belleville, ruled by the maniacal Queen (Grace McLean, another bright spot in the show) and populated by lots of beautiful people looking like they do their clothes shopping at Frederick’s of Hollywood.</p>\n<p>“Every single citizen’s a cut and chiseled god/Beauty is our duty/Everyone among us has a ripped and rockin’ bod,” they sing in the opening number featuring a tight-trousered male baker boasting about his “hot buns.”<img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-17785\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/0760-portriat_Carolee-Carmello_photo-by-Matthew-Murphy-and-Evan-Zimmerman.jpg?resize=200%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/0760-portriat_Carolee-Carmello_photo-by-Matthew-Murphy-and-Evan-Zimmerman.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/0760-portriat_Carolee-Carmello_photo-by-Matthew-Murphy-and-Evan-Zimmerman.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/0760-portriat_Carolee-Carmello_photo-by-Matthew-Murphy-and-Evan-Zimmerman.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/0760-portriat_Carolee-Carmello_photo-by-Matthew-Murphy-and-Evan-Zimmerman.jpg?resize=1025%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1025w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/0760-portriat_Carolee-Carmello_photo-by-Matthew-Murphy-and-Evan-Zimmerman.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /></p>\n<p>Naturally, Cinderella doesn’t exactly get along with her domineering stepmother (Carmello, the show’s MVP) or her two stepsisters (Sami Gayle, Morgan Higgins) who look like they’ve stepped out of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>. The stepmother and the Queen seem to have shared some sort of checkered past, as not too subtly hinted at in the amusing song “I Know You.” That number, incidentally, constitutes one of the show’s highlights, as it allows Carmello and McLean to let it rip with the sort of comic gusto suggesting they know they’ve got some heavy lifting to do to keep the show running.</p>\n<p>There is, of course, the Godmother (Christina Acosta Robinson, somehow maintaining her dignity), a plastic surgeon (what?!?!) who transforms Cinderella into Storm from the X-Men, or at least that’s what she looks like. And, spoiler alert, Prince Charming returns near the show’s end, making it very clear that he has no interest in marrying…a woman, at least. He’s played by Cameron Loyal, who packs so many muscles on top of muscles that you fear the stage will buckle under his weight.</p>\n<p>Webber displays little of his gift for melody, purloined or otherwise, in the blandly generic score, which features enough power ballads to stop the show dead so many times the stagehands should be equipped with defibrillators. Weirdly, many of them are sung with the stage turntable in constant rotation, as if the performers were attempting to get as many steps in as possible. Of course, they may also be trying to outrun the atrocious lyrics by David Zippel, by now making it clear that his superb work for <em>City of Angels</em> is but a distant memory. On the other hand, you have to admire his chutzpah, if not sophistication, in rhyming “Cinderella” with “salmonella.”</p>\n<p>So relentlessly vulgar and campy that it would make Ron DeSantis’ head explode (now <em>there’s</em> a pull quote), <em>Bad Cinderella</em> is the sort of terrible show whose defenders would describe it as “fun,” as if anyone looking for genuine quality in a Broadway musical for which tickets costs hundreds of dollars is a cranky spoilsport. The sheer cynicism of the entire enterprise, designed to capitalize on the public’s seemingly insatiable appetite for irreverent fairy tale adaptations, is enough to turn a carriage into a pumpkin.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Bad Cinderella </b>opened March 23, 2023, at the Imperial Theatre.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The heart, soul, and irrepressible spirit of <em>Bob Fosse’s Dancin’</em>, which just opened in a burst of sparkle and joy at Broadway’s Music Box Theatre, is best embodied in the curtain call. One by one, each dancer glides out from the wings and to the front of the stage performing a different combo—wearing the costume from their biggest moment in the show, adding a few steps, spins, or flourishes from said moment. All the while, the dancer’s name appears in blazing blue neon letters on the back wall of the stage. Every one of them is given star billing, and it would be unfair not to name the full company here: Ioana Alfonso, Yeman Brown, Peter John Chursin, Dylis Croman, Tony d’Alelio, Jōvan Dansberry, Karli Dinardo, Aydin Eyikan, Pedro Garza, Jacob Guzman, Manuel Herrera, Afra Hines, Gabriel Hyman, Kolton Krouse, Mattie Love, Krystal Mackie, Yani Marin, Nando Morland, Khori Michelle Petinaud, Ida Saki, Ron Todorowski, and Neka Zang.</p>\n<p>You might have heard some theatergoers complain about the storyline in <em>Dancin’</em>—mainly, there isn’t one. This show (rightly) makes no apologies for that. “The CDC, the AMA, the FDA, the World Health Organization, and the Surgeon General have determined that the viewing of too many musical comedies with sentimental and over romantic plots may cause serious and sometimes incurable damage to the playgoer and the critics’ standards. Therefore, what you are about to see is an almost plotless musical,” says Herrera in an introduction. “What you will see is dancin’…dancin’…some singin’…and more dancin’.” <em>Dancin’</em>, a celebration of everything Fosse, is a love letter to the makers and performers, and clearly pitched to the people who appreciate the artistry in every pointed toe and crescent jump. (“Almost plotless” because there is text, including a couple Fosse voice-overs, most of which is brief and innocuous.)</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/03/19/bob-fosses-dancin-the-a-1-choreographer-misremembered/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★</a><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/03/19/bob-fosses-dancin-the-a-1-choreographer-misremembered/\">★</a><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/03/19/bob-fosses-dancin-the-a-1-choreographer-misremembered/\">☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Also note that the full title of the revival is <em>Bob Fosse’s Dancin’</em>. Tony-winning choreographer (<em>The Who’s Tommy</em>) Wayne Cilento—who appeared in, and received a Tony nom for, the original 1978 <em>Dancin’</em>—directs, but the choreography is all Fosse’s. (Christine Colby Jacques is credited with the reproduction of Fosse’s choreography, and Corinne McFadden Herrera with additional reproduction.) Still, Cilento isn’t simply restaging the 1978 version; he’s made cuts and additions, working as much as historian and archaeologist as director. So even if you saw the show 45 years ago, you didn’t see the Big City Mime section, which was axed before opening. And you definitely didn’t see the <em>Big Deal</em> numbers, since the musical premiered (and quickly flopped) in 1986.</p>\n<p>The Big City Mime sequence might be overwhelming for some viewers, but it’s a fascinating stew of chaos—snippets from hits such as <em>Sweet Charity</em> (“Big Spender,” “Rich Man’s Frug”) and <em>Liza With a “Z”</em> (“I Gotcha”) and obscurities such as the alley dance from <em>My Sister Eileen</em>. In the 1955 film, Fosse performed it alongside Tommy Rall; here, it’s a fabulous fedora-topped display of pirouettes and one-upmanship for Herrera and Chursin. As for <em>Big Deal</em>, it’s less successfully woven in; it’s the only section, featuring actual characters such as Lilly and Kokomo, that feels more suited to a revue. Yet it gives us the chance to hear Petinaud croon “Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries,” and to see the jailhouse dance “Ain’t We Got Fun”—not to mention the swingy spectacular “Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar.”</p>\n<p>Everyone will have their favorite numbers, but two had me on the edge of my seat; they were also the ones that truly displayed Fosse’s range—the man was about more than shuffle steps and hip pops, after all. The four-part Percussion, which utilizes the dancers as instruments (not the first time we’ll see that) beautifully demonstrates his appreciation of long lines and traditional ballet movement; Dinardo, Love, and Saki are perfection, intertwined as they change positions to the ping of a triangle. And the showstopping “Sing, Sing, Sing,” which opens Act 2, blends explosive stage-sweeping leaps—Krouse hits almost unbelievable heights in the trumpet solo—with intimate Astaire-and-Kelly-esque tap (Guzman and Herrera are a dynamic duo). It also features Reid Bartelme and Harriet Jung’s most stunning costumes, an array of 1920s-style embellished gauzy dresses, baggy jackets, and high-waisted trousers in shades of blush, beige, and peach. But was anyone else distracted by the mannequins in the background? <em>Dancin’</em> is dedicated to movement; faceless, frozen bodies only detract from the living, breathing, high-kicking humans in front of us.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dancin’</em></strong><strong> opened March 19, 2023, at the Music Box.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone attending <em>Bob Fosse’s Dancin’</em> hoping to get a fresh gander at adored numbers like “Steam Heat” or “Rich Man’s Frug“ or “All That Jazz” or you-name-it – that’s to say, anyone waiting with bated breath for this supposed salute to eight-time Tony-winning choreographer Bob Fosse – is best advised to have second thoughts. Nothing like those kinds of re-creations is coming your way.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s on offer instead in today’s <em>Bob Fosse’s Dancin’</em> is perhaps best explained by Wayne Cilento, the production’s director and stager, who recently told an interviewer he’s honored to bring an updated version (hardly a revival) of the 1978 <em>Bob Fosse’s Dancin’</em> that’s “fit for this generation.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Fit for this generation”! Isn’t that a warning for anyone around during Fosse’s 1927-87 generations? Another subtler warning could be that the “Bob Fosse’s” on the program’s cover and title page appears in smaller type size and dimmer font than the bold-faced “Dancin’.” Fosse seems to be disappearing, as if the designer had some misplaced prescience.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/03/19/bob-fosses-dancin-a-love-story-of-rhythm-and-rhyme/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s</em> ★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This disappointed Fosse fan will explain in depth farther down but first wants to praise the unquestionable pinnacle <em>Bob Fosse’s Dancin’ </em>reaches from start to finish: the dancers. They represent the corps Fosse himself would likely have tipped his weathered fedora hat to for their individual flare, their energy, their stamina, their 100% commitment, their drop-dead physiques.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are, in alphabetical order and bouquets to them all: Ioana Alfonso, Yeman Brown, Peter John Chursin, Dylis Croman, Jòvan Dansberry. Karli Dinardo, Aydin Eyikan, Pedro Garza (on for Tony d’Alelio), Jacob Guzman, Manuel Herrera, Afra Hines, Gabriel Hyman, Kolton Krouse, Mattie Love, Yani Marin, Nando Morland, Khori Michelle Petinaud, Ida Saki, and Ron Todorowski. Though there’s no first among equals – let alone no first, second or third – Chursin, Croman, Dinardo, Herrera, Krouse deserve call-outs.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now to the less sanguine news: When Cilento expresses concern for “this generation,” it may be that he’s recognizing how musicals – even this plotless one – are geared up when amplification is such a contemporarily advanced element. And I don’t mean amplification as introduced by David Merrick for Anna Maria Alberghetti as Lili in 1961’s <em>Carnival</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m talking about the heightened amplification that thunders from musical stages all over town nowadays and is all but thoroughly practiced here by sound designer Peter Hylenski. No criticism aimed directly  at him, however, when he may only be adhering to Cilento and the squad who have structured – that’s to say restructured – Fosse’s works. These include Christine Colby Jacques for reproduction of the dances, Corrine McFadden Herrera for additional reproduction, Jim Abbott for orchestrations and music supervision, David Dabbon for new music and dance arrangements, and music director Justin Hornback, who doesn’t make a point of keeping the horns back.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It looks as if all of them have colluded with Cilento to show that the Fosse for this generation is not unlike a choreographing Hannibal crossing the Alps. The result is less tribute than travesty. Cilento and dance associates have carefully taken many of the Fosse signature moves – the pelvis thrust, the hip roll, the shoulder hitch, the seminal <em>Pippin</em> stance with flexed foot, the slowly heavenward-extended arms, the flared-fingers bowler-doffing, – and blown them up in a series of sequences that shout, scream and screech, “Here’s Bob Fosse not on ash-heavy cigarettes but inhaling this generation’s more mood-expanding stimulants.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, certain observations of the Fosse technique need to be made about his indubitably flashy routines.  He reveled in dance as, more often than not, sexual expression. It could be said that the most apt adjective to nail his outcomes – which almost always conjure reflections of any city’s redlight district – is “louche.” But Fosse’s louche was built on sophistication, wit, humor, emotion, on elegant sleaze. It’s louche with a knowing sidelong glance. It’s louche with tongue lodged puckishly in cheek.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this 2023 <em>Bob Fosse’s Dancin’ </em>arrives when sophistication is considered hifalutin, when wit is a dimming talent, when humor has nothing to do with nuance, when blatant is applauded, when outright emotion can register as embarrassing,  when elegance is thought phony and only unmasked sleaze remains.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And there lies the myriad reimagined <em>Bob Fosse’s Dancin’ </em>sections, the quintessential one being Cilento’s shaping (bloating?) of first-act closer “Big Noise From Winnetka.” “Big noise” is the order of the evening and matinee – bigger and bigger and yet bigger noise. Second-act opener is “Sing, Sing, Sing,” that in 1935 boosted Benny Goodman’s career. Goodman managed to keep his early big band intonation thrilling yet contained, whereas Cilento – with marvelous Gary Seligson drumming (thinking of Gene Krupa’s licks?) – lumbers the number with rock-concert decibel level.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Occasionally, events do quiet down. There’s a pleasant interlude featuring Jerry Jeff Walker’s “Mister Bojangles,” danced by Jacob Guzman and Yeman Brown, but even then the singing is goosed volume. Also, the lyric “his dog up and died” is missing. Too embarrassingly emotional? Too insufficiently computerized?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During <em>Bob Fosse’s Dancin’</em> there’s dialogue introducing segments identified as, among them, “Percussion,” “Big City Mime,” “Joint Endeavors” (it’s a pun), “America” (intended  as satire), and Big Deal (recalling a large Fosse flop). Some of the chats are intended to be informative, although learning that “Dancers love to dance” doesn’t entirely qualify as breaking news.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe the most encouraging <em>Bob Fosse’s Dancin’</em> word to get across is that it has been conjured for two diverse audiences: 1) die-hard Fosse-ites happy to see Fosse no matter how he’s conveyed; and 2) those who’ve never seen Fosse’s shows and assume this is what they looked and sounded like. Which they didn’t.  So, possibly this is not such an encouraging word, after all?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One last takeaway:  For “The Female Star Spot,” four female dancers and one male come out to bemoan the pressures inflicted on the leading ladies of musicals. Or could the reference be to one very particular leading lady: Gwen Verdon, on whom Fosse choreographed some of his most enchanting items. Other than (maybe?) here, <em>Bob Fosse’s Dancin’ </em>ignores lithe, twinkle-eyed, charismatic Verdon. The (deliberate?) oversight has the probably unintentional effect of confirming what was often said of her. She was unique, inimitable. What might she have thought of this dubious enterprise?</span></p>\n<p><strong><b>Dancin&#8217; </b>opened March19, 2023, at the Music Box Theatre.

Photo by Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Parade</em>, the Jason Robert Brown-Alfred Uhry musical that won twin Tony Awards in 1998, was revived and revivified in November in <a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/11/02/parade-triumphant-return-of-the-jason-robert-brown-alfred-uhry-musical/\">a concert version at City Center</a>. This was so instantly successfully that the figurative troops have been reassembled for a full commercial run. The good news — or “Real Big News,” as a standout first-act production number headed by a hack journalist is called — is that <em>Parade</em>, now at the Bernard B. Jacobs, is even stronger than it has ever been (at least in the experience of this viewer). Which is to say, better than last fall at City Center, and better than the original, Hal Prince-directed production at the Vivian Beaumont.</p>\n<p>This is the real-life tale of Atlanta factory manager Leo Frank (Ben Platt), a displaced Jew from Brooklyn, who was accused of the 1913 murder of factory girl Mary Phagan. Following a trumped-up trial and last-minute reprieve from the governor, Frank was pulled from prison and lynched by loyal sons of the post-Confederate South. Not your typical musical theater fodder, which counted against its popularity 25 years ago. But now, perhaps, <em>Parade</em>’s time has come. At least, as presented here, with Platt not only selling tickets but giving a searing knockout of a performance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/03/16/parade-an-american-tragedy-stunningly-musicalized/\">[<em>Read Bob Verini’s </em>★★★★★  <em>review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>Unlike with many quick transfers from non-profits, director Michael Arden and his entire production team seem to have taken the time and effort to think things through. This is immediately apparent in Dane Laffrey’s scenic production; the central, raised acting platform remains, as much of the key action takes place up there. But without the onstage orchestra claiming acreage, there is space to spread out the actors and free up the dancers. (Beneath the stage platform, it is revealed in a nice touch at the finale, is a layer of Georgia red clay.) The projections by Sven Ortel, too, have enhanced power. The “landmark marker” prominent at City Center as the audience entered — which spelled out, in advance, the salient fact that the apparently innocent Frank was lynched — is no longer in evidence.</p>\n<p>Arden’s staging includes numerous episodes in which the principal players seem to be surrounded by the swirling maelstrom of the ensemble; this was likely the director’s concept from the beginning, although it was not conducive to the limited stage area and rehearsal time at City Center. Arden takes what was good before and enhances it. The same can be said for the choreography, which seems intriguingly developed from the bare bones of what was there. Last November, the choreography was credited to “Cree Grant.” Now, the program lists “Lauren Yalango-Grant and Christopher Cree Grant.” In any case, the combination of Arden, the two Grants, and music director/conductor Tom Murray bring full value to the power of Brown’s masterful but underappreciated score.</p>\n<p>There is a slightly smaller orchestra here than at City Center, with 24 pieces reduced to 17. But Murray’s band is considerably more impactful now that it has been removed from City Center’s on-stage platform. There, the sound dissipated into the fly space above the stage. Placed in the pit of the Jacobs (formerly Royale), the music rings out and across the auditorium. What’s more, the orchestra pit has been restored in front of — rather than beneath — the stage. That is, the back wall of the pit descends from the front wall of the proscenium. The producers lose 40 or so top-priced seats in this manner, yes, which is why most current Broadway orchestras are hidden from view (and direct hearing). The results fully pay off. And those 17 pieces are plenty; they’d be hard pressed to fit more into the Jacobs pit.</p>\n<p>Ben Platt remains the raison d’être of the production; if the Broadway transfer was predicated on the hunch that the former Evan Hansen would prove a ticket-selling draw, the sales thus far seem to bear this out. Platt — in adult shoes, as it were — proves himself an adept musical theater (and dramatic) actor. Relative newcomer Micaela Diamond was the welcome surprise at City Center; the 23-year-old handily carried the difficult and somewhat treacherous role of Lucile Frank, the passive wife who — when hope is lost in the second act — grabs the narrative and, thanks to composer Brown, the stage. If Diamond was an instant success last November, the intervening months have given her time to add assurance to talent and bring out heretofore hidden facets of the role of Lucile. She is very good indeed. Brown, along with his co-orchestrator, the late Don Sebesky, well understand the massive power of two people singing out at the top of their lungs over crashing cymbals. Platt and Diamond do precisely this, in “This Is Not Over Yet,” and the power crackles throughout the house.</p>\n<p>The cast is mostly the same as City Center, with many players resuming their roles. Among those standing out are Sean Allan Krill as the governor; Paul Alexander Nolan and Manoel Felciano as villainous politicos;  Jay Armstrong Johnson as the muckracking reporter; Jake Pederson as a teenaged suitor; and Alex Joseph Grayson as the ex-con and likely murderer. Erin Rose Doyle, as the victim with the white balloon, has an enhanced presence due to some new staging; and the factory girl trio (Sophia Manicone, Emily Rose DeMartino, and Ashlyn Maddox) remains highly effective.</p>\n<p>But the star of the show, even more than Platt and Diamond, is composer/lyricist Brown. Broadway has never heard anything quite like the startling Trial Sequence which brings down the first act curtain. Brown combines 10 distinct musical sections of astonishingly divergent style, tone, and emotional temperature, building to wildly unbridled hysteria. In the quarter-century since writing <em>Parade</em> at the age of 24, he has had several Broadway opportunities (namely <em>13</em>, <em>The Bridges of Madison Country</em>, <em>Honeymoon in Vegas</em>, and <em>Mr. Saturday Night</em>). All of these musicals, including the original <em>Parade</em>, had disappointing and ultimately unsuccessful runs. This new <em>Parade </em>seems likely to finally give Brown the artistic and commercial success he has well earned over the years.</p>\n<p><strong>Parade opened March 16, 2023, at the Bernard B.

Photo by Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Parade </em>has triumphantly marched back. The 1999 <em>succès d&#8217;estime </em>by Alfred Uhry and Jason Robert Brown, directed by co-conceiver Harold Prince, won writing Tonys but little favor from a public taken aback by the application of song and dance to a real-life turn-of-the-last-century nightmare: the trial, conviction, and eventual lynching of Jewish businessman Leo Frank for the murder of adolescent factory worker Mary Phagan. Over the last 25 years, we&#8217;ve become more used to musicals handling difficult subject matter, and our current red state/blue state polarization has perhaps made us readier to explore the historical roots of that divide. In any event, Michael Arden&#8217;s acclaimed 2022 concert staging at New York City Center now arrives on Broadway as welcome as it is provocative.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Producing <em>Parade</em> requires finding a balance between its two parallel narratives, lightly connected by the theme of loyalty. Of central interest is the gradual transformation of a marriage of convenience into that of true partnership, and Ben Platt slides easily into the role of the accused, a fussy transplanted Brooklynite contemptuous of the vulgarian Southerners he&#8217;s surrounded by and fighting, in his mind, a solo battle. The heavy lifting goes to Micaela Diamond as unappreciated wife Lucille Frank, the railroading of whose husband brings out enough unexpected toughness to confront authority in search of justice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/03/16/parade-ben-platt-turns-provocative-musical-into-surefire-hit/\">[<em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★  <em>review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The process by which the scales drop from Leo&#8217;s eyes is told by Brown in song, and beautifully executed here. Platt&#8217;s insistent vibrato, so ubiquitous in his signature <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> power ballads, serves him well in transitioning from passionate self-righteousness to the recognition that this woman means everything to him. And Diamond evokes all the delicacy and strength needed for the bitter, despairing &#8220;Do It Alone, Leo&#8221; down to the Franks&#8217; climactic discovery of missed opportunity in &#8220;All the Wasted Time.&#8221; Barbara Cook was our premier interpreter of character in song, and I can&#8217;t help but think she would be proud of Diamond&#8217;s continuing in that tradition.</p>\n<p>At the same time, there&#8217;s a societal indictment to be filed, in terms of the part played in this travesty of justice by Lucille&#8217;s fellow Georgians. Uhry — long our Bard of the strains between that part of the country and Judaism, in his celebrated <em>Driving Miss Daisy </em>and underrated <em>The Last Night of Ballyhoo — </em>locates their prejudices in the steadfast loyalty to a long-vanished (if it ever existed) Southern ideal, introduced in the chilling opening chorale &#8220;The Old Red Hills of Home&#8221; and woven in and out of Brown&#8217;s score thereafter, along with samples of &#8220;Dixie&#8221; and &#8220;Camptown Races.&#8221; Honor requires that the sons and daughters of the Confederacy always be in the right; in this mindset, women are to be venerated and outsiders reviled. So if the young girls at the pencil factory say their manager trifled with them, they&#8217;re unquestionably believed. And if prosecutor Hugh Dorsey (Paul Alexander Nolan) sees homicide in the so-called bulging eyes of the Jew Frank, then no other suspects need be considered. The groupthink has spoken.</p>\n<p>It would be easy to portray the citizens of Marietta and Atlanta as a more or less faceless mob, and I&#8217;ve seen them so staged. But perhaps because of his own acting career, Arden has been masterly at infusing ensemble roles with vivid life in his revivals of <em>Spring Awakening </em>and <em>Once on This Island. </em>He outdoes himself here, permitting every cast member to make a strong impression beginning with conscience-driven Governor Slaton (Sean Allan Krill) and his loyal wife, Sally (Stacie Bono), a relationship in deft contrast to the Franks&#8217; chaos. The flirtation of Frankie Epps (Jake Pedersen) with poor Mary Phagan (Erin Rose Doyle) is a sweet preamble to the tragedy to follow.</p>\n<p>Housekeeper Minnie McKnight (Danielle Lee Greaves) practically keens in grief over her false testimony damning Leo, while Jim Conley (Alex Joseph Grayson) swaggers through his in two stunning tours-de-force, first in court (&#8220;That&#8217;s What He Said&#8221;) and later on a chain gang in the implacable call-and-response &#8220;Feel the Rain Fall.&#8221; For their part, the Slatons&#8217; house servants, Angela (Courtnee Carter) and Riley, (Douglas Lyons) make the most of their scathing Act Two opener about the &#8220;A Ramblin&#8217; and a Rollin'&#8221; coming up because of a little white girl&#8217;s murder, too aware that nothing much would be happening had Mary Phagan looked like them. The piece&#8217;s villains — Nolan; Manoel Felciano&#8217;s crusading bigot; Jay Armstrong Johnson&#8217;s bibulous reporter — can&#8217;t do much outside of their stock functions, but they at least sidestep moustache-twirling menace while reinforcing the notion of people trapped within their environment&#8217;s expectations.</p>\n<p>That environment is inescapable, in fact, thanks to the production&#8217;s singular visual motif, vintage black-and-white photos marshaled by designer Sven Ortel onto a vast video wall, not unlike those immersive rooms in which you meander through Van Gogh&#8217;s paintings. Each historical character is identified and pictured when those playing them first appear, along with scenes of all the story&#8217;s actual locations. If Dane Laffrey&#8217;s scenic contribution is somewhat cluttered around the central playing platform, the eye-pleasing projections consistently unify the action and ground us in the storytelling&#8217;s veracity. We&#8217;re never permitted to distance ourselves from the prejudice and blind hatred that tribalism fosters. And thank God for that, because when we forget past injustices we&#8217;re doomed to repeat them.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Parade opened March 16, 2023, at the Bernard B.

Photo: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Nora Helmer, in the person of Jessica Chastain, sits on the bare stage of the Hudson Theatre, in a bare chair, and observes her surroundings. Audience members take their seats, finding Chastain—or is it Nora, before the action of the play starts?—observing them as they remove their coats. Round and round she goes on a turntable, readjusting her gaze to the newcomers again and again, observing all (and one hopes the production has a chiropractor on staff, given her uncomfortable slump). This being Broadway 2023, the star is confronted with a barrage of smartphones flashing, filming, and selfie-ing; so much for audience decorum.</p>\n<p>Chastain silently observes as her castmates, one by one, slip on in the darkness and grab chairs of their own. Once director Jamie Lloyd launches from the preshow into Amy Herzog’s new adaptation of Ibsen’s <em>A Doll’s House</em>, Chastain’s Nora continues to observe the action surrounding her: a true doll—or “Birdie,” as husband Torvald (Arian Moayed) repeatedly addresses her. While Ibsen’s Nora traditionally starts the proceedings talking about Christmas decorations, the “little bird’s” first words here—in Herzog’s streamlined but very much to the point adaptation—are, and I quote, “tweet, tweet, tweet.”</p>\n<p>Not only is Nora stuck in the middle of it all, observing, but Lloyd keeps her mostly rooted in that chair through the entire play—until she gets up and leaves husband-children-and-existence to storm out into the night, with what an 1899 London drama critic called “the door slam heard around the world.” Those words ring true well more than a century later; that drama critic, a young George Bernard Shaw, had a way with words.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/03/09/a-dolls-house-ibsen-made-too-trendy-for-words/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★☆☆☆  <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Which we only bring up because the bare stage that confronts us at the Hudson might leave viewers familiar with Ibsen’s play sitting and wondering how on earth Lloyd is going to have Nora slam that legendary door—without anything save the rear wall of the stage in sight!</p>\n<p>How does <em>A Doll’s House</em> fare without all that scenery, without the walls that usually define this doll’s (Nora’s) house and figuratively crush her. Lloyd and lighting designer Jon Clark manage to do so highly effectively, framing the scenes in various rectangles of light. Clark’s work is especially stand-out; two late scenes between Nora and Krogstad make stunning use of overpowering silhouettes, to the extent that they could even startle old Dr. Caligari. If the scenery by Soutra Gilmour (of <em>&amp; Juliet</em> and the recent <em>Merrily We Roll Along</em>) is all but invisible to the eye, she remains a key collaborator with a key contribution. Rarely has a lighting bridge played such an integral role in the staging of a play.</p>\n<p>The lack of trappings serves to focus our attention on the dialogue. Herzog has trimmed the play of excessive dramaturgy without losing Ibsen’s effectiveness, handily getting us out of the theatre in less than two hours instead of what typically approaches three. Sure, the play—which still takes place in 1879—now has 21st century dialogue that is, presumably, not strictly translated from old Henrik. (Nora to Dr. Rank: “I’m just bursting to say—<em>fuck it all</em>.”) Even so, Herzog seems true to the original intent while refreshing and enlivening the proceedings.</p>\n<p>Chastain is quite good in the role, with a caveat discussed below. She is abetted by two especially strong performances. Michael Patrick Thornton, who was one of the only compelling aspects of the recent Daniel Craig <em>Macbeth</em>, commands the stage as Dr. Rank, with special resonance as he addresses his character’s fatal illness. Okieriete Onaodowan, who essayed the twin roles of Hercules Mulligan and James Madison in the original cast of <em>Hamilton</em>, makes a Krogstad to contend with. Chastain’s Nora, and the play, come alive in her scenes with these subordinate characters. The action is dampened, alas, by the performance of Moayed. Yes, Torvald is the weakest of the central characters surrounding our heroine, but that doesn’t justify a weak performance. Moayed dissipates the tension during the key final exchange that literally drives Nora out of her cage.</p>\n<p>The cast is completed by Jesmille Darbouze as a subdued Kristine and Tasha Lawrence as the nanny. Lloyd sees fit to present the play without the three children called for by Ibsen (and included in Herzog’s script, for that matter). This is somewhat understandable, in that it would be admittedly difficult to seamlessly bring the kids on and off and on and off in the confines of the stark, scenery-less production. But the emotional pain of Nora’s ultimate sacrifice of her children seems lessened by their corporeal absence, with disembodied voices over the loudspeaker only enhancing the problem.</p>\n<p>Chastain is altogether admirable and will perhaps be in the running for additional accolades to place beside her 2022 Oscar for <em>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</em>. It’s heartening to see the Juilliard-trained actor’s commitment to bringing this production to Broadway. (Intended for London’s Playhouse in 2020, it was displaced by the pandemic.) But, a constantly revived play such as <em>A Doll’s House</em> carries a built-in test for a star. Two of the most compelling Ibsen performances New York has seen over the recent past were Janet McTeer’s Tony-winning Nora in 1997 and the decidedly different but equally dynamic Nora of Hattie Morahan at BAM in 2014. Chastain’s Nora works perfectly well at the Hudson, but it is unlikely to enter into the discussion. Comparisons are unfair, cold and uncalled for, yes; but after watching Chastain’s <em>Doll’s House</em>, I’d jump at the chance to revisit McTeer or Morahan.</p>\n<p>When the time finally arrives for Nora to slam that door with no door in sight, Lloyd and Gilmour have a stunningly abrupt solution which will likely leave you agape. Nothing Mr. Ibsen would have or could have imagined; but for Herzog’s adaptation, and for the 2023 audience at the Hudson off Times Square, it is a jolt that indeed honors—and contemporizes—the playwright’s door slam heard round the world.</p>\n<p><strong>A Doll&#8217;s House opened March 9, 2023, at the Hudson Theatre and runs through June 10.

Foster</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If you’ve lived in New York City for 20 years or so, walking down the street can easily turn into a trip down memory lane. We all have a favorite bar that’s long since closed, a shop we used to frequent, a restaurant where we were regulars. Personally, I’m still mourning the loss of Rocky’s, an old-school red-sauce joint on the corner of Spring and Mulberry; it closed more than 10 years ago, but I still remember the <em>pomodoro</em> sauce that I could never replicate, no matter how hard I tried.</p>\n<p><em>Cornelia Street</em>—the new musical at the Atlantic Theater’s Stage 2—is aimed squarely at the do-you-remember audience: longtime New Yorkers who lose a little piece of themselves each time their favorite hangout is replaced by a Walgreens. A collaboration between playwright/Atlantic vet Simon Stephens (2011’s <em>Bluebird</em>, 2012’s <em>Harper Regan</em>, 2017’s <em>On the Shore of the Wide World</em>) and songwriter Mark Eitzel, the piece is full of good intentions. Unfortunately, it’s also full of grim, virtually indistinguishable songs, predictable lyrics, and off-putting, vaguely drawn characters.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/02/14/cornelia-street-not-yet-a-destination-musical/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Jacob—played by two-time Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz, in a blustery, big-voiced, perfectly pitched performance—is the chef at Marty’s Café, a small West Village restaurant that’s struggling with gentrification and a booming real estate market. (You’ll find yourself thinking of the bar-restaurant-performance space Cornelia Street Café, which closed in 2018 after 41 years, but really, this could be any mom-and-pop NYC eatery.) Business isn’t exactly booming at Marty’s. The place has one regular diner, John (Ben Rosenfield), and two regular drinkers—William (George Abud), a mean-as-a-snake cab driver/drug dealer, and Sarah (Mary Beth Peil, always a joy), an eccentric former opera singer and onetime Studio 54 regular who’s now kind of a surrogate grandmother to Jacob’s teenage daughter, Patti (Lena Pepe). There’s one server/bartender, Philip (Esteban Andres Cruz), who’s really an actor. About midway through the first act—after William sings the cryptic “Magic Trick” (“Gotta have money/ Gotta scratch your itch/ Also hunger’s a bitch/ Thank god I’m not hungry or old”)—Jacob’s stepdaughter, Misty (Gizel Jiménez) bursts in looking like something out of <em>Cabaret</em>, threatening to torch the place. Cut to the next scene, a few weeks later, and she’s calmly setting tables and wiping down the bar (a gorgeous creation by set designer Scott Pask).</p>\n<p>From the first scene, the owner, Marty (Kevyn Morrow), bickers with Jacob about his pricey ingredients such as Iberico ham and Palacios chorizo; it’s clear that Jacob is the chef. So why make Butz chop a bunch of parsley during the first song? Was anyone else worried he was going to cut off a fingertip? (And what chef preps parsley in the dining room, anyway?) But back to the songs, only one of which sounded truly musically distinct to me—Patti’s hard-charging teen-angst rant “You Do Nothing.” It’s also the only number that emerges organically; she’s pissed at her dad, she’s lashing out at Marty, <em>of course</em> she channels all of those big feelings into a song. Otherwise, it’s impossible not to wonder: Would <em>Cornelia Street </em>be better as a play? Especially when you hear lyrics such as “I have hundreds of shoes/ I like cigarettes and booze,” “And in life you must act/ There’s no turning back,” and “If there’s a chance/ I’m gonna take it/ And if there’s a chance/ I’m gonna make it” (that one even gets repeated).</p>\n<p>Consider this: The character who makes the biggest impression is the only one without a song. Daniel McCourt (founding Atlantic company member Jordan Lage)—an old friend of Jacob’s who’s now a real estate mogul and, fingers crossed, the money Marty’s Café so desperately needs—barrels in wearing his running gear and musing about grief. Then he quickly and neatly destroys Jacob’s dreams. “The property value ’round Bleecker? The whole of the West Village? Absolutely no way. It’s done. We’re done. It’s over. Red Hook looks good. Bushwick. Bits of Queens,” Daniel says. It’s just not a smart investment. “The problem with a city that is built on newness is that it is always in a state of nostalgia because everything is always disappearing.” Old pal Daniel also drops a few hints about Jacob’s past. In one scene, Stephens—a sharp writer whose plays also include <em>Heisenberg</em> and the Tony-winning <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em>—says more about the main character and the changing face of New York City than he and Eitzel do the entire show.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cornelia Street</em> opened Feb. 14, 2023, at the Atlantic Stage 2, and runs through March 5.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1992 photographer Larry Sultan published <em>Pictures From Home</em>, a collection, with accompanying comments, involving his parents, Irving and Jean. It was his idea to create a sociological study of the family from his own up-close-and-very personal experience. He’d been assiduously pursuing the project for almost a decade.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He believed that photographs of Irving and Jean – he appears in none of them – would transcend mere snapshots and imply more about the complex dynamics of the contemporary family unit. Recording the immediate, he’d delve more deeply into an expansive look at family mythology. The result has  been highly regarded ever since, his intentions understood and respected.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would be interesting to know what photographer Sultan, who died in 2009, would make of Sharr White’s <em>Pictures From Home</em>, a stage adaptation of the book, complete with projections (by 59 Productions) of Sultan’s photographs and various Sultan home movies of Irv, Jean and the three Sultan sons when much younger.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/02/09/pictures-from-home-a-fuzzy-photograph-themed-memory-play/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playwright White (<em>The True</em>, <em>The Other Place</em>) sees the intermissionless work as a live, in-person explanation and explication of Sultan’s volume that the photographer himself (Danny Burstein) as well as Irving (Nathan Lane) and Jean (Zoë Wanamaker) are giving the audience.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout it, Larry reiterates the motive for the project. The word “project” is so often reiterated that eventually it acquires the weight of lead bricks dropped all over the set that Michael Yeargan has modeled on the elder Sultans’ San Fernando Valley home with its sloped high ceiling, green-and-white floral-patterned upholstery and glass doors leading to a garden.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, although Sharr honors Sultan’s long-defined reason for sometimes catching Irv and Jean off-guard and sometimes posing them, what he eventually conveys – this cannot be his intention – is something quite a bit removed from what he thinks he’s telling us.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, intermittently he captures and displays the truth of a marriage’s ups-and-downs –and the love that genuinely binds it &#8212; but for almost all the duration, he more closely presents an amalgamation of <em>Death of a Salesman</em> spun as <em>Death of a West Coast Salesman</em> and an update of the early Don Ameche-Frances Langford radio-then-television sitcom, <em>The Bickersons</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This transpires as Irv and Jean argue increasingly until the yelling becomes numbing. Nonetheless, the badgering is almost a calming relief when compared to Irv and Larry having at each other. Irv, once a successful Schick Razor Company salesman covering a wide swath of California, was suddenly dismissed and hasn’t worked in years. He’s become extremely frustrated at doing little else than tending to his partially viewed garden.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For his part, Larry keeps after his father to understand the import of a nebulous enterprise. He’s relentless for so long that the vaunted project begins to lose any seeming value. Rather, it takes on the shape of a son’s narrow-minded attack on his dad. Watching the forays during Larry’s usually twice-monthly visits, spectators can’t be blamed for thinking they aren’t so much watching an artist pursuing a goal as getting a lengthy peek at a son doggedly acting out a rampaging Oedipal Complex.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not too long after <em>Pictures From Home</em> gets underway, it turns boring and then abusive to the patrons. Then, if this is the California answer to Arthur Miller’s classic drama, it becomes a piece to which much attention need not be paid.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The modicum of attention that might be paid is due to venerable actors Lane, Burstein and Wanamaker. (Lane is top-billed, but Burstein gets the last and therefore most prominent of the separate curtain bows.) Dominating as each can be, they’re hampered by Sharr’s script and Sher’s acquiescing direction.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lane consistently harangues. Burstein consistently hounds. While both are strong doing the Sharr-Sher bidding, the sound of one note repeating takes over. Wanamaker &#8212; who on entrance might make ticket buyers remember Estelle Getty &#8212; comes off best, as hot real estate broker Jean, serving as a calming influence on her husband and son.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intermittently, some attention-pulling incidents emerge. In an early home movie moment, Irv is caught teaching Larry how to jump with the help of a hula hoop prop. The jumping-through-a-hoop metaphor was surely not intended at the time, yet it’s there to be appreciated.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funnily enough (or perhaps not funnily enough), Larry’s pressuring Irv to jump through a truly metaphorical hoop occurs on several occasions, not the least of which when Larry prods a resisting Irv to pose uncomfortably at an easel, as if giving one of his instructive lectures to an aspiring Schick razor force.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sultan’s cue, Sharr does hit one or two attention-hopeful turns at the final minutes. Nice try – even moving try – but too late to redeem the proceeding stretches. Sultan’s <em>Pictures From Home</em> retains the upper hand on Sharr’s <em>Pictures From Home</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Pictures from Home opened February 9, 2023 at Studio 54 and runs through April 30.

Photo credit: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the new play based on Larry Sultan’s acclaimed photo memoir <em>Pictures from Home</em>, a photographer is arguing with his father about the significance of old home movies depicting the family’s years-ago move from Brooklyn to California.</p>\n<p>“It’s like this extraordinary myth, unfolding in front of you,” Larry says to his father, Irv. “I would even say that it’s the most convincing representation of the myth of the West and the Garden that I’ve ever seen.”</p>\n<p>“<em>The myth of the West and the Garden</em>?” an incredulous Irv responds. He then asks his wife Jean, “Can you imagine what it would be like going to a party with Larry and his friends? They all stand around talking this way while you look for an open window to jump out of.”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2023/02/09/pictures-from-home-family-drama-not-fully-developed/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>It’s a funny line, and it’s made even funnier by being delivered by Nathan Lane, managing to turn expressions of irritation into comic arias of near operatic proportions. It also sums up the essential theme of the play, namely the subjective nature of art and how it may or may not reflect reality. If Sharr White’s comic drama <em>Pictures From Home</em> ultimately doesn’t manage to explore that idea in a fully satisfying manner, the play nonetheless emerges as a moving and amusing portrait of an adult son desperately trying to connect with his parents and in a way keep them alive forever through his photography.</p>\n<p>An uncharacteristically clean-shaven Danny Burstein plays Larry, who periodically leaves his family in the Bay Area to travel to his parents’ tract home in the San Fernando Valley. He’s working on his book (which was published to great acclaim in 1992), documenting his parents’ lives via photographs, interviews, and stills from old home movies. Although his mother (Zoe Wanamker) seems perfectly amenable to the lengthy art project, especially since it means she gets to see Larry more often, his father Irv thinks that Larry is merely indulging himself in what he can only perceive as a hobby.</p>\n<p>As we see pictures from the actual book projected in giant-sized fashion, Larry and Irv, and occasionally Jean, debate each other over family history and the photographs which, to Irv’s eye, don’t always tell the truth. He’s particularly irked by one of Danny’s favorites, a shot of him in his later years sleeping on a couch, his aged vulnerability all too apparent. The picture clashes with Irv’s image of himself as a self-made man who ascended to the position of vice-president of sales at the Schick razor company.</p>\n<p>Their bickering becomes redundant over the course of the play’s intermissionless 105 minutes, due to the playwright’s inability to provide a cohesive dramatic structure to the piece. Much of it is certainly relatable to any adult dealing with aging parents, but after a while the arguments about such things as the parents plan to retire to Palm Desert, California feel boringly banal, like you’re eavesdropping on the private conversations of a family you barely know.</p>\n<p>That the evening slickly if ploddingly directed by Bartlett Sher proves entertaining anyway is largely due to the formidable talents of its estimable cast, although the casting proves problematic. Lane and Burstein are so close in age that it’s hard to accept them as father and son, even if this is meant to be a memory play and Lane is outfitted with a suitable gray wig. And while showing the book’s photographs of the actual parents works beautifully onstage, it only enhances the difference between Lane and the real Irv, who looks much more physically commanding and handsome. A similarly bewigged Wanamaker seems closer to her real-life counterpart, but she tends to recede into the background, frequently wandering on and offstage without given nearly enough to do.</p>\n<p>Burstein finds touching depths of emotion as the son struggling to connect with his irascible father, and Wanamaker has the occasional chance to shine, especially in a scene in which Larry tearfully reveals his fear of losing her. Lane, as usual, delivers an outstanding performance, mining riotous humor from nearly every line and bit of physical business, such as Irv unconsciously adopting a stiff, unnatural pose every time Larry aims the camera at him. Lane is an actor who can make being funny seem as natural as breathing, but here he also powerfully reveals his character’s underlying anger and bitterness as he feels his mortality creeping up on him.</p>\n<p><em>Pictures from Home</em> proves less artful than the photo book that inspired it, but the universality of its themes and the power of its performances make it pack an emotional punch nonetheless. It would make even more of an impact if it had been housed in a more suitable theater. (Memo to Broadway producers: Studio 54 <em>is not</em> an appropriate venue for small-scale, intimate dramas.)</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Pictures from Home opened February 9, 2023 at Studio 54 and runs through April 30.

Photo credit: Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As his latest theatrical effort once again demonstrates, Anthony McCarten never met a historical figure he didn’t like. The playwright/screenwriter has previously written works about such real-life figures as Freddie Mercury (<em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>), Winston Churchill (<em>The Darkest Hour</em>), Stephen Hawking (<em>The Theory of</em> <em>Everything</em>), and Whitney Houston (the upcoming bio-pic <em>I Wanna Dance with Somebody</em>). He’s particularly fond of presenting notable personages interacting with each other; Pope Benedict and Pope Francis in <em>The Two Popes</em>, Neil Diamond and his younger self in <em>A Beautiful Noise</em>, and now Andy Warhol and Jean-Michael Basquiat in <em>The Collaboration</em>, receiving its Broadway premiere after previously being presented at London’s Young Vic. McCarten’s next work involves the friendship between Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. You begin to worry that at the rate he’s going, he’ll run out of famous people to write about.</p>\n<p>These films and plays have varied in quality, but they generally present juicy opportunities for notable actors to show off their accent skills while donning fun costumes and elaborate make-up. It’s no accident that they frequently find themselves accepting awards. There’s something about actors playing famous people that seems to excite performers and viewers alike.</p>\n<p>That <em>frisson</em> becomes evident as soon as stars Paul Bettany and Jeremy Pope make their entrances, with a whippet-thin Bettany wearing Warhol’s red glasses and blonde wig and Pope sporting Basquiat’s seemingly electrified dreadlocks that seem to stand straight up in the air. If the actors wind up winning awards for their performances, they damn well better mention wig designer Tommy Kurzman in their acceptance speeches.</p>\n<p>The play’s high-concept conceit is to imagine the interactions between the two artists when they collaborated for several years in the 1980s at the behest of their mutual Swiss dealer Bruno Bischofberger (Erik Jensen). (It actually began as a three-way collaboration, with Italian painter Francesco Clemente, but then the production would have had to hire another actor.)</p>\n<p>“Warhol versus Basquiat!” Bruno says to Warhol as part of his sales pitch. “Versus?” replies a skeptical Warhol. “Gee, you make it sound so macho, like a contest.” The exchange certainly resonates, since the publicity for the resulting exhibition featured the two artists in a boxing match-style pose.</p>\n<p>It’s an example of the on-the-nose dialogue illustrating both the playwright’s research skills and his tendency to emphasize points with which many audience members will be familiar. Your enjoyment of <em>The Collaboration</em>, as with many of McCarten’s works, will prove directly proportional to how much you already know about the subject matter. It’s a sort of intellectual pretension, like audience members at foreign films who make sure to laugh before everyone can read the subtitles. At several points, Bettany’s Warhol describes his itinerary, making sure to include exactly how much he paid for cab fare, etc. You get the joke if you’re read Warhol’s diaries, which read as if they were written for an IRS audit.</p>\n<p>The play’s conflict stems from the very different personalities and career statuses of the two artists. Warhol has become insecure and fearful, as a result of both his declining sales and the severe physical injuries he suffered when he was shot by Valerie Solanas (no points for guessing that Bettany will take off his shirt to reveal horrific scars). He’s also become a sort of mass-market art manufacturer, having not actually done any actual painting in decades. “You mean, like <em>paint </em>together? With <em>brushes</em>?” Warhol asks Bruno in a horrified tone.</p>\n<p>Basquiat, on the other hand, is a star on the rise, and is all too aware of it. He’s also disdainful of Warhol, considering him “old hat.”</p>\n<p>“Does anyone really care about Warhol anymore?” Basquiat asks. “All that fag silk screen stuff? Marilyns, Elvis’, soup cans? He’s not a real artist anymore.”</p>\n<p>Cue the next scene set at Warhol’s studio, where we indeed see those prints of Marilyn, Elvis and Campbell’s Soup cans on the wall. (See what I mean about the on-the-nose dialogue?) We watch as the two iconic artists kibbitz together while they awkwardly work out their creative and personality differences, as if we were flies on a very famous wall. The play starts to feel like one of those old Dick Cavett shows in which the wily host would interview two wildly disparate famous people simultaneously and let the fireworks fly.</p>\n<p>As if sensing that the evening requires more in the way of a plot, McCarten throws in some dramatic developments in the second act, including the unexpected arrival of Basquiat’s ex-girlfriend Maya (Krysta Rodriguez) at his studio while Warhol is alone waiting for him. There’s also the news of the severe beating and ultimate death at the hands of the police of Basquiat’s friend and fellow graffiti artist Michael Stewart, which leads the distraught Basquiat to shoot up again. But somehow, the more that goes on, the less substantial the play feels.</p>\n<p>Though the writing is a letdown, <em>The Collaboration</em> nonetheless proves entertaining, thanks to the colorful figures at its center and the superb acting. Bettany had the harder assignment of not caricaturing Warhol, even though by that point Warhol had already become a caricature of himself. He handles the task beautifully, avoiding excessively overt imitation and somehow managing to convey Warhol’s underlying Andrew Warhola. Pope ­— as much a star on the rise as the character he’s portraying, thanks to his Tony-nominated work in <em>Choir Boy</em> and <em>Ain’t Too Proud</em> and his acclaimed starring role in the film <em>The Inspection</em> — delivers a rivetingly physical, live-wire turn, exuding restless energy and speaking in a high-pitched voice that sounds like Michael Jackson. The two actors’ mesmerizing turns, soon to be repeated in a film adaptation of the play, are, as the old saying goes, worth the price of admission alone.</p>\n<p>Director Kwame Kwei-Armah provides some illuminating atmospheric touches, including projections of footage of NYC from the period and a film montage at intermission depicting the two characters performing various activities together. Less felicitous is the use of an onstage DJ playing disco music at deafening volume prior to the performance. It might have been a good idea at the Young Vic, but considering the average age of the Manhattan Theatre Club subscriber it borders on elder abuse.</p>\n<p><strong>The Collaboration opened December 20, 2022, at Samuel J.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p><br />Though <em>Between Riverside and Crazy</em> has received two New York City productions—its premiere at the Atlantic in 2014, followed by a quick reprise at Second Stage in 2015—it’s not surprising that Stephen Adly Guirgis’ Pulitzer Prize winner finally found its way to Broadway, where it just opened at the Hayes Theater. The New York City–set play is definitely Guirgis’ funniest. It’s a dysfunctional family drama, centering on former beat cop Walter “Pops” Washington (Stephen McKinley Henderson) and his extended family: his parolee son, Junior (Oscar-, Emmy-, and Grammy-winning rapper Common); Junior’s belly shirt–and–booty short–wearing girlfriend, Lulu (Rosal Colón), a sunny but dim-witted girl; and his felon friend Oswaldo (Victor Almanzar), a tightly wound recovering drug addict. And you can never have too many dysfunctional family dramas. How else are we supposed to feel better about our own families?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Plus, it’s about time that Guirgis, an off-Broadway fixture in the 2000s and 2010s, got another Broadway production; his first, and only, was 2011’s <em>The Motherfucker With the Hat</em>, featuring comedian Chris Rock and one of the best titles ever. Guirgis’ titles, incidentally, are generally pretty amazing. His last play was a sprawling 19-character epic set in a women’s halfway house, <em>Halfway Bitches Go Straight to Heaven</em>. Two of his best: <em>Jesus Hopped the A Train</em>, which goes inside Rikers Island; and <em>Our Lady of 121st Street</em>, which involves the death of a nun and the mysterious disappearance of her dead body. So if you haven&#8217;t yet caught up with this <span class=\"ex-sent  first-child has-aq sents\"><span class=\"mw_t_wi\">quintessentially</span></span> New York playwright, <em>Between Riverside and Crazy</em> is an excellent introduction to Guirgis’ work.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Riverside of <em>Between Riverside and Crazy</em> refers to Riverside Drive, where Walter lives in a run-down but palatial rent-controlled three-bedroom apartment. Now that Walter’s wife, Delores, has passed, Junior, Lulu, and Oswaldo have taken up residence there; Lulu and Oswaldo have even taken to calling him dad. The paint may be peeling, the wallpaper may be faded, but the pre-war details—think crown molding and glass-block walls—are impressive. (Walt Spangler’s revolving set is a stunner.) The price for all of this? Take a deep breath, my fellow New Yorkers: $1,500/month. No wonder the landlord wants Pops out of there. “I’m a ex-cop, war veteran, senior citizen with a legal rent-control lease from 1978 and I never pay late—I wish they would try to fuck with me,” he says.</p>\r\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/12/19/between-riverside-and-crazy-stephen-adly-guirgis-pulitzer-winner-goes-bway/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>He’s also a man who’s spent the last eight years embroiled in a civil suit with the city after he was shot while off-duty by another cop—a white cop, who allegedly used a racial slur while firing. “That’s an unsubstantiated allegation, Walter,” says his former partner, Detective O’Connor (Elizabeth Canavan, a veteran of multiple Guirgis plays). She and her fiancé, the brass-kissing Lieutenant Caro (Michael Rispoli), have dinner and reminisce with Walter. She shows off her pricey Tiffany engagement ring, the spoils of Dave’s poker-playing prowess. “I’m no jeweler, but this looks like some serious Audrey Hepburn–Cartier–Kim Kardashian–shit right here,” says Walter approvingly. The three commiserate about “that pretentious guinea windbag,” as Dave calls him, Giuliani. “Like he ain’t the son of a two-bit Sing Sing ex-con from East Flatbush.… And I won’t even get into him sitting in the Yankee dugout. The audacity, wearing the friggin’ uniform like he’s Joe Pepitone with a toupee—the jerk.” (Did Guirgis have any idea how well that section would age?) But now the two cops mean business: They want Walter to settle the lawsuit. Walter wants them to F off.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With each successive scene, Guirgis peels away layers, and we learn more about Walter: He basically drinks from morning to night. There’s more to his shooting story than we thought. And he has a real mean streak toward the end—truly avaricious and petty. Yet we’re rooting for him despite each disturbing discovery. Henderson, an exceptional stage actor who’s perhaps best known for his roles in August Wilson plays, gives a bravura performance—all the more impressive considering he’s seated for most of his scenes. In his dalliance with the Church Lady (Liza Colón-Zayas, another Guirgis vet)—which features the wildest passing of the Communion wafer you’ll ever see—he’s confined to a wheelchair; and he’s hooked up to an IV and bedridden for an uncharacteristically restrained confessional with Junior. Judging by the entrance applause, Common is this production’s biggest draw, and the neophyte stage actor seems to still be finding his footing. But he’s sweet and subtly charming in a rooftop scene with Colón, and powerful in the aforementioned muted emotional exchange with Henderson. Guirgis gives his characters plenty of R-rated barbs and razor-sharp banter, but those smaller, low-key moments reveal <em>Riverside</em>’s bruised, battered heart.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Between Riverside and Crazy</em></strong><strong> opened Dec. 19, 2022, at the Hayes Theater and runs through Feb. 19, 2023.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are so many reasons to admire and respect—even love—Stephen Adly Guirgis’ <em>Between Riverside and Crazy</em>  that it’s almost a challenge to know where to start. But not quite. The pressing place is with a play that moves to Broadway from its initial off-Broadway run with the 2015 Pulitzer Prize now attached to it as well as so many other laurels that listing them would take too much space from other huzzahs</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retired policeman Walter (Stephen McKinley Henderson, more of him later) rules as Pops from a wheelchair left in his Riverside Drive, Manhattan kitchen after his wife Delores died. His roost isn’t what many would consider a candidate for the Good Housekeeping Award. Son Junior (Common), twice an ex-con and still dealing daily in purloined goods, is <em>in situ</em> with rent girlfriend Lulu (Rosal Colón). Also present is hyperkinetic permanent guest Oswaldo (Victor Almanzar), another one with prison stripes in his past.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Guirgis sets his brimming work in motion—and with marvelously manipulated humor—he may spend a few more minutes than necessary establishing the hectic household goings-on that allow Walter to dominate all exchanges with the quickly deflating remark.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/12/19/between-riverside-and-crazy-wild-and-wonderful-new-york-story/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once introing the crazy Riverside habitués, however, Guirgis moves bluntly to his real concern. Walter’s former police force partner, Detective O’Connor (Elizabeth Canavan), arrives with fiancé Lieutenant Caro (Michael Rispoli). They drop in for old time’s sake and for new time’s sake as well. Their true purpose is to convince Walter he needs to stop fighting a settlement with the city over an ugly incident that prompted his premature retirement.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Describing it may qualify as a spoiler, but here goes: Walter, not in uniform and obstreperous at an after-hours bar, was shot six times by a rookie cop some years earlier. Since then, Walter has been holding out for more money than the actual circumstances may warrant.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing more needs be said about the plot, other than that Church Lady (Liza Colón-Zayas) drops in to revitalize Walter in her own seductive manner. It’s the drama and comedy Guirgis wrings from it that explains why the Pulitzer committee, not always a reliable source, got it right this time. And there’s the no-prisoners-taken (pun intended) dialogue, during which the line “Even cops hate cops” lands with resonance.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, the Pulitzer and Guirgis’ delectable, damning dialogue only add more nods to the fact that he may not be as recognized and savored as he should be. The author of this and, among others, <em>Jesus Hopped the A Train</em>, <em>Our Lady of 121st Street</em>,<em> The Mothef**ker With the Hat</em>, and <em>Halfway Bitches Go Straight to Heaven</em> has by now established himself as one of the country’s major playwrights.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who else involved with <em>Between Riverside and Crazy </em>deserves those greatly earned kudos? How about Henderson, one of Broadway’s and off Broadway’s longtime reliable character actors? Guirgis has handed him a role that makes his abilities undeniable.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Walter, Henderson has a part that gives him wide opportunities to keep his gifts on non-stop display. There’s a persistent quality in the player, something at his core that always confirms the quiet but unquestionable truth in whomever he’s playing.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And what of director Austin Pendleton, arguably the habitually busiest member of the New York City theater community? Last on Broadway stealing scenes in Tracy Letts’ <em>The Minutes</em>, he blithely and boldly returns as the <em>Between Riverside and Crazy </em>director. (Besides acting and directing, Pendleton is a playwright and acting teacher. Does he ever have any spare time? If he does, he probably spends it seeing a play.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Guirgis packs so much to be unpacked in his scripts—the drama, the humor, much of it intricately simultaneous—Pendleton must unleash and restrain the actors not just from minute to minute but from second to second. He doesn’t miss a beat. He doesn’t miss any of the potential nuances within a beat.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neither under his firm hand do any of the supporting actors. Perhaps Pendleton’s directorial request once he’s chosen his ensemble and has complete trust in them is to tell them to do what they do and feel confident doing it. Most likely, he says more, but knows how, as they interact, to shift focus nimbly. His is masterful directing.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Between Riverside and Crazy</em> looks handsome on Walt Spangler’s turntable set with its tidy kitchen and its dated glass-fronted cabinets, its living room featuring a ’tis-the-season Christmas tree (for the earlier sequences), its cramped bedroom, and a stage-left metal-railing roof balcony. Costumer Alexis Forte and lighting designer Keith Parham match the first-rate production demands.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sound designer Ryan Rumery supplies the Chi-Lites “Have You Seen Her?” that Guirgis has Walter listen to in grieved remembrance. Rumery also composes a series of ominous chords that get the audience slightly on edge before each of the two acts begins.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly: Although an argument can be made that all art is political, Guirgis doesn’t usually go that route overtly. He does indulge here in an attack on one currently embroiled political figure. No name will be mentioned, but a hint is that Guirgis hasn’t the authority to disbar the man but every right to dismiss him naughtily. It’s one more reason to cheer the much-lauded playwright.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Between Riverside and Crazy </strong><strong>opened December 19, 2022 at the Helen Hayes Theater </strong><strong>and runs through February 19, 2023.

Cooper in Ain&#8217;t No Mo&#8217;. Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Premiering at the Public Theater in 2019, <em>Ain’t No Mo’</em> nabbed well-deserved critical acclaim as a seriously funny look at aspects of contemporary Black American society. The comedy won audiences, too, enjoying a nearly two month-long stint at the Public’s 299-seat Newman stage.</p>\n<p>“One very smart, slick show that deserves a longer run,” <a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/03/27/aint-no-mo-a-sharply-satirical-study-in-black-manners-and-matters/\">I wrote about <em>Ain’t No Mo’</em>  back then</a>.</p>\n<p>What I admired then still applies, since Jordan E. Cooper’s satirical play and its sharp staging have not changed substantially in the move uptown to the 1,000-seat Belasco Theatre, where the show bowed on December 1.</p>\n<p>Many critics again applauded its wicked charms. Both of my New York Stage Review colleagues endorsed the production with five stars. When I caught the show again on Wednesday, the lusty audience reaction appeared to be overwhelmingly positive.</p>\n<p>The trouble is that Broadway customers are not buying into it.</p>\n<p>Last week the show played to only 47% of the Belasco’s potential capacity. <em>Ain’t No Mo’</em> is slated to shutter after Sunday’s matinee. Check that: as we go to press, the run has been extended to Friday, December 23.</p>\n<p>What happened? A combination of long-recognized forces can be blamed. More than ever the Broadway menu caters to the tourist and family crowds, which tend to favor 1. Musicals; 2. Recognizable stars; 3. Stories/shows that people already know. <em>Ain’t No Mo’</em> strikes out on all three counts.</p>\n<p>Then between its sophisticated issues and rough language, <em>Ain’t No Mo’</em> is an adults-only event, so forget the kiddies.</p>\n<p>Since Broadway has returned to post-pandemic business, more productions than usual have been about the Black experience. Among the dozen straight plays currently running, half of them involve Black themes and stories. So without going into the whys of it, lately they have been competing for an audience.</p>\n<p>Just because <em>Ain’t No Mo’</em> is trenchantly written and makes significant points about race and racism in their many varieties – arguably the number one topic of our American times – does not guarantee that people want to buy it. And generally speaking, ticket prices are ridiculous (although that&#8217;s a sad song everyone sings).</p>\n<p>Taking a long view of things, a worthy play that exits too soon on Broadway is what’s known as a “Beautiful Loser” and the venerable Belasco has briefly sheltered any number of such lovelies over its 115-year history.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, with a six-member cast and relatively modest scenic demands, <em>Ain’t No Mo’</em> looks like a piece that will become popular among regional companies, so audiences elsewhere will get the chance to appreciate its prickly satirical pleasures. Hopefully the obviously gifted author is readying other works in his creative pipeline and at least this showcase is likely to garner him future opportunities. In the meantime, Broadway is a poorer place for losing such a beauty. You might want to make a quick trip to the Belasco, at that.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Ain&#8217;t No Mo&#8217; </b>opened December 1, 2022, at the Belasco Theatre and runs through December 23.

Photo credit: Marc J. Franklin</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Since <em>Some Like It Hot </em>begins brash from its opening moments – a big-band intro to a sprawling nightclub dance caught in mid-debauch – I’ll kick off by brashly asserting that it’s a freakin’ joy, one of the most <em>confident</em> of Broadway musicals since&#8230;  well, since <em>Hairspray, </em>with a score by the same gifted team of Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman. Like <em>Hairspray</em>, the new show is filled top to bottom with skilled pros, many of whom deserve to become instant headliners with this appearance. None of them ever doubts their own ability to dazzle, and they all barrel on through to do just that. If you’re a sucker for fast-paced glamour executed in high style, this is the one for you.</p>\n<p>Many on The Street, with memories of 1972’s grim <em>Sugar </em>and an even grimmer 2002 revision that toured under the original movie title, doubted that a successful musicalization of Billy Wilder’s 1959 comedy classic was possible, let alone necessary. But where earlier attempts merely recycled the movie with new songs grafted on, what’s on display at the Shubert is a through-and-through makeover.</p>\n<p>The original foundation remains: Two male musicians (Christian Borle and J. Harrison Ghee), witnesses to Chicago gang murders, hide out in an all-girl swing band on the road. But rethought characters, altered motivations and changed plot points mean that fans of the film will still be surprised along the way. More significantly, librettists Matthew López and Amber Ruffin are likely, I think, to sidestep the heat that <em>Tootsie</em> and <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em> took, to name two recent guys-in-dresses tuners seen as clumsily handling the demands of contemporary sexual politics.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/12/11/some-like-it-hot-old-fashioned-musical-comedy-to-a-fault/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>On film, Jack Lemmon’s wickedly horny Jerry-turned-Daphne squirms in gowns and heels, while Tony Curtis’s Joe takes his Josephine getup in stride, discarding it only to take up a Cary Grant impersonation that will seduce the band’s lead singer, the inimitable Marilyn Monroe as sad, daft Sugar Kane. But leering Lotharios playing fast and loose with their dames, and gross laughs induced at the expense of transvestism, simply won’t pass muster in 2022. Neither will an alcoholic child-woman numbed by the search for someone to watch over her. Nuh-uh.</p>\n<p>The solution, to the males’ problem at least, is deftly achieved by assigning both Lemmon’s oafishness <em>and</em> Curtis’s pushy narcissism to Borle’s Joe. The butt of jokes for being aged and unattractive, “Josephine” (that is, Joe the lech) will be made to learn that decency and good fellowship mean more in life than reckless ambition. Meanwhile, Ghee’s Jerry becomes the down-to-earth, contemplative one – surprisingly comfortable in ever more elaborate gowns, eventually accepting the inner female he’s possessed all along. “I feel like I fit in,” Jerry muses. “These girls <em>get </em>me.”</p>\n<p>None of this revision comes across as self-consciously “woke” (hate that term). It simply is what it is: human and touching and real, particularly in the hands of such fine performers. Borle has been a character-man VIP in many lesser shows for ages; you can sense his appetite for taking center stage, and he makes the most of it. And Ghee is simply amazing, droll and understated yet poignant as well. Our stars are made to be talented dancers, so “The Tip Tap Twins” get to sparkle away from the bandstand, becoming “The Tip Tap Trio” when Sugar (Adrianna Hicks) reveals a pair of happy feet as well.</p>\n<p>Speaking of whom, the authors have said this revamped heroine is meant to evoke the likes of Lena Horne and Billie Holiday, Black superstars struggling to make it in a largely segregated era. Sounds good on paper, but little of it shows up on stage; the legendary Monroe vulnerability is replaced by conventional musical comedy spunk. Sugar feels less <em>essential</em>, somehow, in this retelling.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Hicks gets the heft she merits in the score if not the book. Failed romances with jazz musicians are mourned in the moody “A Darker Shade of Blue,” and a little girl’s dreams of Hollywood fame animate perhaps the show’s best number, “At the Old Majestic Nickel Matinee.” If Shaiman and Wittman’s work impresses as less varied than <em>Hairspray</em>’s, it could be because there’s less period pastiche to lean into. But their lyrics (especially in list songs like “You Can’t Have Me”) sparkle with rhyme, and Shaiman’s melodies are catchy as ever. If you can get the title tune out of your head after a couple of choruses, you’re better than me.</p>\n<p>The comedy is in equally good hands with accomplished writer/improviser Ruffin, plus López, who had already navigated the drag-show world in <em>The Legend of Georgia McBride. </em>(The brilliant <em>The Inheritance</em> wasn’t a lot of laughs, so who knew he had such an acute funny bone?) Both know how to layer comedy scenes for impact. Borle and <em>Funny or Die </em>doyen Joe Farrell get explicit program credit for “additional material,” which I take to mean jokes, and while many land, even those that don’t are sold with gusto.</p>\n<p>For instance, scatting champeen NaTasha Yvette Williams’s doesn’t have notably hilarious lines as Sweet Sue, long-suffering leader of the Society Syncopators. But she plants her feet apart with Eve Arden-ish sidelong glances, and every aside is received with an explosion of laughter. Both Williams, and Kevin Del Aguila as an ebullient, rubberlegged Osgood Fielding (Daphne’s super-wealthy inamorato), give the kind of performances that make you cheer every appearance, wonder where they’ve been all your life, and look forward eagerly to the next time you see them. They’re that good.</p>\n<p>The hard-working ensemble races through Casey Nicholaw’s propulsive staging and choreography, culminating in a glorious hotel corridor chase, with doors on casters, that must have been a bear to stage. And the physical production is wholly high-gloss, from Gregg Barnes’s extravagantly colorful costumes to Scott Pask’s towering sets that out-Deco Art Deco, under Natasha Katz’s typically evocative lighting. Characters make occasional reference to the collapsed U.S. economy, though it all looks like the Roaring 20s and there’s not an apple seller in sight. Ah, who cares. In this Depression was I depressed? Nowhere near.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\"><b style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">Some Like It Hot </b>opened December 11, 2022, at the Shubert Theatre.

Franklin</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>“Musical comedy, the most glorious words in the English language,” famously declared Broadway producer Julian Marsh in <em>42<sup>nd</sup> Street</em>. It’s a saying that the creators of the new Broadway musical <em>Some Like It Hot</em> have clearly taken to heart. From its opening moments to its last, the show practically wears itself out attempting to pull out all the stops with the sort of theatrical pizzazz designed to wow both musical theater fanatics and tourists alike. If at times the strenuous efforts feel <em>too</em> exhausting, bless their hearts for trying so hard.</p>\n<p>Based on Billy Wilder’s classic 1959 screen comedy starring the immortal trio of Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and Marilyn Monroe, this musical (like the previous adaptation, 1972’s <em>Sugar</em>) delivers a madcap romp concerning two Depression-era male musicians (Christian Borle, J. Harrison Ghee) who pretend to be women after witnessing a gangland murder. Donning drag, they join an all-female band, with farcical and romantic complications ensuing as one of them falls in love with the band’s sultry lead singer, Sugar (Adrianna Hicks).</p>\n<p>Everything about the production feels deliberately old-fashioned, from its pastiche-like score to its elaborate production numbers to its broad, farcical humor. It almost seems designed in a lab, albeit one populated by scientists who grew up listening to vintage Broadway cast albums. That the show works to the extent that it does is a testament to the formidable talents of its creators, including composer/co-lyricist Marc Shaiman and lyricist Scott Wittman (<em>Hairspray</em>, <em>Catch Me if You Can</em>), book writers Matthew Lopez (<em>The</em> <em>Inheritance</em>) and Amber Ruffin (Peacock’s <em>The Amber Ruffin Show</em>), and, perhaps most importantly, director/choreographer Casey Nicholaw, who brings to this fast-paced production the same effervescence and flair he delivered in such shows as the not dissimilar <em>The Drowsy Chaperone.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/12/11/some-like-it-hot-nobodys-perfect-but-this-comes-close/\"><em>Read Bob Verini’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>And yet, it’s hard to escape the feeling that there’s simply not much <em>there</em> there. The show moves like clockwork, delivering extravagant choreography, some terrific performances, and plenty of laughs in its hyper-efficient two-and-a-half hours. But you somehow feel like you’ve seen it all before. Not only in Wilder’s 63-year-old film, which somehow feels far edgier despite this version’s updated attitudes toward sexuality and ethnicity, but also in the countless Broadway musical comedies that have preceded this new adaptation.</p>\n<p>Everyone involved tries hard, very hard, to entertain you, as if hoping to provide some old school Broadway musical comedy relief after the tough years we’ve endured recently. So it’s hard to begrudge their efforts, even if the actual material feels thin. The performers are often very funny, but more often because of the way they punch up the jokes rather than the jokes themselves. Borle has by now proven himself a master at this sort of thing with his work in such shows as <em>Peter and the Starcatcher</em>, <em>Something Rotten!</em> and <em>Spamalot</em>. He works the same magic here, proving hilarious as the wisecracking Joe who transforms into the less than comely Josephine. Equally terrific is NaTasha Yvette Williams, as the perpetually disgruntled bandleader Sweet Sue, and Kevin Del Aguila, who virtually steals the show as the daffy millionaire Osgood who falls in love with Daphne (Ghee), not knowing that she is actually a he. At one point he engages in a frenetic dance to music he hears only in his head, and he’s so damn funny doing it that you start hearing the music yourself. He also manages to turn a harmless line about how “hard” it is to own yachts into one of the show’s funniest moments just by the way he places the emphasis on the word.</p>\n<p>The statuesque Ghee has such a commanding, physically imposing stage presence that Daphne becomes a force of nature even though the character isn’t really given that much to do. The performer, who at one point played Lola on Broadway in <em>Kinky Boots</em>, stops the show with the standout number “You Coulda Knocked Me Over With a Feather,” in which Jerry/Daphne discovers that they are very fulfilled by their new non-binary identity.</p>\n<p>Which leads to one of the more significant aspects of the show, namely its updating of the story with current attitudes that are occasionally presented in heavy-handed fashion: “What do I call you? Jerry? Daphne?” a confused Joe asks his partner. “Either is fine as long as you do it with love and respect,” Daphne replies, cueing inevitable audience applause. We also learn that Osgood was born in Mexico and that his real name is Pedro Francisco Alvarez, a bit of backstory that would have confused Joe E. Lewis, who played the character so memorably in the film.</p>\n<p>The only lead performer who comes up short is Hicks (a recent graduate of <em>Six</em>), who more than delivers the goods vocally in such soaring numbers as “A Darker Shade of Blue” and “Ride Out the Storm” but never exerts the level of sultriness or vulnerability that the role of Sugar demands. It’s no wonder that Borle’s Joe, for all his randiness, seems half-hearted in his attempts to seduce her.</p>\n<p>Shaiman’s music is tuneful enough, with the title number being downright catchy. But the songs never quite take hold, and the lyrics are disappointingly generic rather than displaying the wit the farcical storyline deserves. And while Nicholaw keeps things moving briskly and energetically, whipping the large ensemble into one dynamic production number after another, eventually they begin to feel formulaic. There’s so much tap dancing that you start to wonder if he’s being paid by the tap, and a frenzied chase scene, complete with doors being brought onstage just for the purpose of being slammed, is expertly orchestrated but so reminiscent of Jerome Robbins’ “Bathing Beauty Ballet” from <em>High Button</em> <em>Shoes</em> that his estate should be seeking royalties.</p>\n<p>For the most part, <em>Some Like It Hot</em> succeeds in its aim of simply entertaining its audiences with those two most glorious words in the English language. And for many, that will be more than enough. But it’s hard not to wish that the show could have reached a higher temperature.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Some Like It Hot </b>opened December 11, 2022, at the Shubert Theatre.

Photo: Richard Termine</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“That&#8217;s our general practice,” a college dormitory headmistress crisply replies when she’s accused of routinely examining Black students’ personal belongings. It’s one of many instances of casual, Eisenhower-era racism that energize <em>Ohio State Murders, </em>a 1992 work marking the Broadway debut, at age 91, of much-lauded veteran playwright Adrienne Kennedy. A splendid piece of craftsmanship in its own right, the play is further served by a scintillating turn from another theatrical treasure, six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">It’s a piece of direct address within a realistic context. In the 1990’s, distinguished playwright Suzanne Alexander (McDonald) has been invited back to Columbus to lecture on her work, particularly to identify the source of so much violent imagery in her plays. Her Ohio State experiences in 1949-1951? Not so much of that, Ms. Alexander, if you please. But there are reasons her studies didn’t go as hoped, reasons she is haunted still, reasons impossible to detach from the career that followed.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">To get to the bottom of why this compact piece (75 minutes) hits so hard, it’s necessary to examine the Kennedy aesthetic, which ought to be better known anyway. It might be deemed “autobiographical-ish”: a free mix of genuine memories of 91 years as writer and teacher, and pure fiction. Whether concocting one of her scabrous, surrealistic fantasias of Black life (like her landmark, 1964 Obie-winning <em>Funnyhouse of a Negro</em>, or <em>A Rat’s Mass</em>), or sending her theatrical avatar Suzanne down a rabbit hole of memory as she does here (and in three other “Alexander Plays”), Kennedy lays down no signposts as to what’s “true” and what’s not. It’s the cumulative effect that matters.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">So it’s not especially relevant that the titular crimes visited on Suzanne in the wake of a campus interracial relationship, and that’s all I’ll say, are not part of the Kennedy bio, whereas the shabby treatment by OSU — including expulsion, and a refusal to let her, as a Black woman, major in English — certainly was. If sorting that all out matters to you, save it for the ride home. For the time we’re sitting in the newly-named James Earl Jones Theatre, we are invited to take the measure of the person speaking to us in whole, as a woman of color whose ill use is both a cautionary tale for her sisters, and an indictment of society at large.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Focus on the principal is easy enough considering the prodigious, one might even say legendary, talent who embodies her. I was about to say “impersonates,” but what McDonald pulls off is richer than any mere impersonation. As the aging guest speaker, she begins gracious and demure, with the flutey voice and ready, fluttery laugh that we know as Kennedy’s because an extensive interview with her has been piped through the sound system as a preshow — a bold choice offering the star a lot to live up to.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">As Suzanne’s recollections proceed — roughly chronological, but sometimes jagged or mysterious in Kennedy’s characteristic collage fashion — McDonald shape-shifts into the undergraduate she was and back again, each new revelation mining deeper sources of pain and humiliation. The first syllable of the author’s first name is pronounced to rhyme with “mad,” and rightly so: She (Suzanne/Adrienne) is one angry writer, and the passage of time has done nothing to resolve a lifetime’s worth of abuse, insult and betrayal stemming from skin color and gender.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">What McDonald pulls off so magically is bringing up all this emotion in dribs and drabs, at first reluctantly, then more and more forthrightly as if wrenched out into the air beyond her control. Suzanne has never said her full story aloud before now, she tells us, and McDonald indeed achieves what actors and critics prize as “the illusion of the first time.” She learns more about herself while we do, and progressively gets torn apart all over again. The audience gasps and tears that accompany the performance are honestly earned and, I expect, unforgettable.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_16980\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-16980\" style=\"width: 200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-16980 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Audra-ohio-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Audra-ohio-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Audra-ohio-2.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Audra-ohio-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Audra-ohio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Audra-ohio-2.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-16980\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Audra MacDonald. Photo: Richard Termine</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">A Zoom reading of the play during the pandemic immersed McDonald in the material, and director Kenny Leon has planted her amidst a first-rate physical production. Beowulf Boritt’s set incorporates reality and fancy much as Kennedy does. Suzanne is surrounded by law library volumes, for instance, but the shelves are overhead and askew like cards thrown into the air in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. It’s a snowy day in Columbus, but we see the constant flakes through a gaping gash in the black back wall, the shavings of a consciousness being deconstructed before our eyes. Allen Lee Hughes’ lighting subtly ushers us through mists of pain and memory, with Jeff Sugg’s deftly chosen projections illustrating historical moments.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Four other thesps are brought in to enact brief but key interactions, most notably Bryce Pinkham as the teacher of Thomas Hardy who’s gobsmacked by Suzanne (and Hardy’s Tess has distinct parallels here). But would <em>Ohio State Murders</em> work better as a monologue? I think not. Solo memories are one thing, but recollection alternately bolstered and challenged by witnesses takes on greater heft.

Cooper in Ain&#8217;t No Mo&#8217;. Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>As the first half of the 2022-23 theater season draws to a close, is Jordan E. Cooper’s <em>Ain’t No Mo’</em>  the most outstanding American play of the year? Even though it’s not a traditional play, but more of an out-and-out comedy revue with a devastating undertow?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What gives <em>Ain’t No Mo’ </em>its ineluctable strengths? It’s 27-year-old Cooper’s response to the threat posed by a segment of today’s population, the vocal aggregate calling for the United States to be declared a white Christian nation — and the potential ramifications were such a supremacist goal accomplished.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is <em>Ain’t No Mo’</em> timely at this frightening American moment? You betcha, when a desperate former American president calls for a suspension of the Constitution and at a weird moment where teaching the history of slavery is increasingly discouraged.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/12/05/aint-no-mo-three-centuries-of-oppression-packed-with-pathos-and-laughs/\"><em>Read Sandy MacDonald’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooper imagines that the day has arrived when the racist faction has prevailed and the entire African-American population has been ordered back to Africa. All Blacks are leaving on African American Airlines through Gate 1619, the number denoting, of course, the year the first slaves arrived in the not yet united states.</p>\n<p>Presiding at the gate, as the very last passengers are boarding, is the comically agitated and blonde-bewigged Peaches (Cooper in drag). Peaches serves as something of an interlocutor, appearing between the several sketches the playwright has concocted to address problems considered common to the black community</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first of these — the revue’s introductory turn — takes place in a church presided over by a preacher (Marchánt Davis), who, not unlike Black priests everywhere, expects congregation members to be loudly vocal witnesses.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The day’s sermon is being given November 4, 2008 — in other words, on the election day Barack Obama  becomes the United States’ first Black president. The preacher sees the victory as an opportunity to rally round what, in polite (white?) society, is considered a racial slur.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The preacher exhorts his congregation — and the audience — to repeat, repeat and re-re-repeat the n-word as a sign of a significantly liberating new step for the American Black population.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he does, he makes a few points. One is that the n-word has a different and pejorative meaning for whites, whereas it can be considered differently in the Black community. A second point nailed is that Obama’s election is a promise that the succeeding skits, while eliciting chuckles, yuks, and guffaws, present as a promise soon lurched back like a carrot on a stick.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other sketches, unfolding more currently, include one in which Davis is the fey emcee of a television girl-talk show in which the talkers — as often as not attacking one another – eventually turn on a transracial woman. Another happens in an abortion clinic and, sure thing, addresses the Roe v. Wade decision.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s Cooper tackling prickly contemporary subjects that often affect Blacks more than whites. It’s clear Cooper has much on his fertile mind and won’t rest until he airs it all, more power to him.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A later sequence visits the home of Blacks resisting the expulsion, their plight not so instantly hilarious but, under the comedy’s circumstances, relatable. What they decide won’t be revealed here, but it’s hardly reassuring.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Cooper is ultimately heading involves a brilliant twist that raises <em>Ain’t No Mo’</em> to award-winning spheres. Okay, here’s a spoiler alert but maybe an alert worth the sneak-peek. Playwright Cooper informs spectators that everything Blacks have contributed to this currently benighted nation will also leave on that Gate 1619 last plane.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Placed in the waiting area is a moderately sized black bag entrusted with glitter that Peaches, as the last to board, is to take with her. Contained in it is this country’s entire Black heritage. What Cooper is implying by way of the black bag – and what happens to it, not to be spilled here – is an enormous jolt to the psyche. It’s a piece of indisputable stage artwork.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooper, perhaps best known to audiences for his role on television’s <em>Pose</em>, is the general of this enterprise, but his armed forces are many. Funny as he is from start to finish, so are the supporting cast members, Billed for context reasons, as Passenger #1-#5, they are, in numerical order, Fedna Jacquet, Marchánt Davis, Shannon Matesky, Ebony Marshall-Oliver, and Crystal Lucas-Perry.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t ask for a stand-out. Under Stevie Walker-Webb&#8217;s rat-a-tat direction, they’re all equally accomplished, although Lucas-Perry, until recently John Adams in <em>1776</em>, has quite a showy outburst in a sketch where she’s a prison inmate pressing her reasons for not wanting to be released to the ominous flight.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other major <em>Ain’t No Mo’</em> contributors are Emilio Sosa for marvelously flashy and giggle-inducing costumes, lighting designer Adam Honoré, sound designers Jonathan Deans and Taylor Williams, wig and hair designer Mia M. Neal, and fight and intimacy director Rocío Mendez.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scott Pask is the set designer, doing his usual top-drawer work. His show curtain is an American flag, but it’s not red, blue, and white. It’s red, blue, and black, immediately suggesting the racist depths <em>Ain’t No Mo’</em> will be probing. Later, behind Peaches and her reception counter is a high wall covered with a drop showing the seemingly endless African American Airlines plane the final passengers will fill. And yes, It does pull away for take-off, so that the country&#8217;s Black heritage ain&#8217;t no mo.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a lift-off of such immense implications that any American observer remaining unmoved when it occurs may find it necessary to reevaluate his or her genuine patriotism.</span></p>\n<p><strong><b>Ain&#8217;t No Mo&#8217; </b>opened December 1, 2022, at the Belasco Theatre and runs through December 23.

A hit at the Public Theatre in March 2019, it probably would have arrived even sooner were it not for the Covid hiatus. Either way, author/performer Jordan E. Cooper is now, at 27, on Broadway. His accomplishment is at once formidable and, with any luck, possibly premonitory: Imagine the ongoing contributions he’ll be set to make, should he continue to create at this rate.</p>\n<p>The history which Cooper outlines, in scathing parodic strokes, is grievously slower-paced – though it speeds by in his imaginative precis. He has taken on no less than three centuries of white-on-black racial oppression and channeled it into one main storyline accompanied by illuminating side scenes.</p>\n<p>Cooper leads the way via his own snarky, panicky soliloquies as Peaches, a beleaguered airline attendant charged with shepherding the United States’ entire Black population onto an ultra-jumbo jet in time to catch the “free” – albeit compulsory – Flight  1619 (note that number) to Africa. The time is now – or some not too distant future, given the eroding political climate. A diaspora is underway, only in reverse.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/12/05/aint-no-mo-jordan-e-cooper-writes-a-first-rate-political-comedy-revue/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an ingenious concept, with a structure to match. The play starts with a celebration of sorts: a rousing, upbeat funeral set specifically at 11 PM on November 4, 2008 – the night of Obama’s election.  Playing a honey-tongued, hyper-dramatic preacher officiating at the funeral of “Brother ʼRighttocomplain,ʼ” Marchánt Davis manages to get a good portion of the audience up on their feet to chant a paean that in recent decades has evolved from a hideous racial epithet to a signifier of respect – depending, still, on the speaker. Though discomfiting to some, this participatory exercise feels at once cleansing and energizing.</p>\n<p>A subsequent scene, set in an abortion clinic euphemistically re-labeled a “community center,” has recently acquired an additional tragic resonance, when the original was harrowing enough. Two women (Shannon Matesky and Fedna Jacquet) are waiting for their numbers to be called; it’s suggested, eventually, that the wait line may run to millions. In the interim, they have time to debate the morality of bringing a child into a life certain to encompass poverty, pain, and increased odds of early death. Cooper does not pull his punches.</p>\n<p>Comic relief awaits in the form of a hilarious mock-TV segment, “Real Baby Mamas of the South Side.” In the intimate confines of the Public’s Newman Theatre (a third the size of the cavernous, ornate Belasco), it was easy to catch every ingenious gradation of shade. Slower pacing might help here – but there’s no mistaking the full absurdity of “Rachonda” (Shannon Matesky) claiming to be “transracial.”</p>\n<p>Each of these impactful interpolated scenes would warrant its own play. Cooper is a genius at concision, and his critique of the dominant culture cuts deep. His vision is well served by a top-notch, protean cast: you may be surprised to note that there are only five supplemental actors (denoted as “Passengers”) in addition to Cooper, who stays in character right up to the soul-baring denouement.</p>\n<p>Every single performer is a standout. Particular praise is due Crystal Lucas-Perry for two exceptional portrayals: as “Black,” the feral embodiment of enslavement imprisoned beneath the dining room of a smug haute-bougie family, and as “Blue,” an about-to-be-released convict crushed – and enraged &#8212; by the concrete evidence of her usurped life.</p>\n<p>Cooper proves equally heartbreaking as Peaches, whose brittle competence is slowly eroded by the scope of her task. Having left off laughing, you’ll have ample time to reconsider the tragedies which the play presents so movingly, and which continue to play out all around us.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Ain&#8217;t No Mo&#8217; </b>opened December 1, 2022, at the Belasco Theatre and runs through December 23.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>“There are two types of people in this world,” said Bill Murray in the 1991 Frank Oz–directed film <em>What About Bob?</em> “Those who like Neil Diamond, and those who don’t.”</p>\n<p>Unless you’re part of that first group, frankly, you have no business being in the Broadhurst Theatre for <em>The Neil Diamond Musical: A Beautiful Noise</em>, the unabashed fan-fest that pays homage to the shy Brooklyn boy turned world-famous singer-songwriter who gave us such hits as “America,” “Cracklin’ Rosie,” “Song Sung Blue,” and “Sweet Caroline.” Some theatergoers can hum a song or two; some know all the standards and have a few albums; and some are Diamond Heads who will debate for days over which is his best, 1971’s <em>Stones</em> or 1972’s <em>Hot August Night </em>(my vote goes to the latter, a raw, guts-and-grit live recording from L.A.’s Greek Theatre). Whatever their level of love for the artist sometimes known as the Jewish Elvis, these people want to hear their savior sing. And sing. And sing. The good news is that <em>A Beautiful Noise</em>, directed by Michael Mayer, is more of a concert than <em>MJ</em>, <em>Ain’t Too Proud</em>, <em>The Cher Show</em>, <em>Tina</em>, <em>Summer</em>, <em>Beautiful</em>, <em>Jersey Boys</em>, or any of its bio-musical predecessors. Even better news: Will Swenson (<em>Hair</em>, <em>Priscilla: Queen of the Desert</em>) is sensational as the guitar-strumming, chart-topping, stadium-playing young Diamond. And yes, there <em>is</em> a “Sweet Caroline” singalong.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/12/04/a-beautiful-noise-neil-diamond-on-the-couch/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>“Sweet Caroline” lands right before intermission, and the whole scene is so good (So good! So good! So good!) that this New Yorker almost forgot the song is the anthem for the Boston Red Sox. Book writer and biopic veteran Anthony McCarten (<em>The Theory of Everything</em>, <em>Darkest Hour</em>, <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>), also represented on Broadway this season by the Warhol-Basquiat play <em>The Collaboration</em>, places the songs thoughtfully, and for maximum emotional effect: Diamond’s first live performance is acoustic, the melancholy slow burn “Solitary Man.” As his confidence grows onstage, his numbers get bigger and glitzier. Act 2 opens with the wild, soulful “Brother Love’s Traveling Salvation Show,” featuring the singer in full razzle-dazzle, sequin-and-tassel mode and the chorus shimmying for dear life. Combining “Brooklyn Roads” with “America” is a stroke of genius (though bringing in Neil’s bickering parents between verses dampens the mood). And the existential power ballad “I Am…I Said” gets the spot it deserves, as the 11 o’clock number, where it’s sung by Mark Jacoby as present-day Neil, with Swenson joining in at the end.</p>\n<p>Jacoby’s character is, regrettably, little more than a device—the foundation of the show’s flimsy libretto: Forced into retirement by the onset of Parkinson&#8217;s disease, older Neil is an extremely reluctant, very sulky therapy patient, so his doctor (Linda Powell) uses a book of his song lyrics to get him to open up. Suddenly we’re in the Brill Building, where an awkward young Neil is peddling his tunes to Ellie Greenwich (Bri Sudia). Then we’re in his living room, with him, his wife Jaye (Jessie Fisher), and a gold record. Then we’re at the Bitter End, where he meets Marcia—played by <em>Moulin Rouge!</em> Tony nominee Robyn Hurder, who does more with “Forever in Blue Jeans” than you could ever imagine (choreographer Steven Hoggett gives her a bit of a “Music and the Mirror” moment)—soon to be his wife of 25 years. Neil and the doctor stick around to comment, offer narrative here and there, and provide context. And for some reason, assorted ensemble members (aka The Noise) periodically wander over and hang out next to their overstuffed chairs.</p>\n<p>Diamond himself has been very open about his experiences with psychoanalysis; he even discusses it in a program note. But therapy sessions are inherently rather boring, and some of these exchanges feel more like obstacles to overcome than pathways to memories. Case in point: “I Am…I Said” is a show-stopping moment, but first we need to trudge through a scene dissecting the lyrics.</p>\n<p>Also, as previously mentioned, there is a “Sweet Caroline” singalong. There’s one in “Song Sung Blue” too. But please, for the love of all that’s Holly Holy, do not sing along to “I Am…I Said.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Neil Diamond Musical: A Beautiful Noise</em> opened Dec. 4, 2022, at the Broadhurst Theatre.

Photo credit: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Judging by <em>A Beautiful Noise</em>, the creators of jukebox musicals are getting desperate. Book writer Anthony McCarten would seem to have strong credentials for the assignment, including the screenplays for <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> and the upcoming Whitney Houston biopic <em>I Wanna Dance with Somebody</em> as well as the critically acclaimed play <em>The Collaboration</em>, about Andy Warhol and Jean Michel Basquiat. So he clearly knows his way around pop music and colorful personalities. And yet the best framework he could come up with for this show about Neil Diamond is to have an elderly, depressed pop star reluctantly telling his life story through his songs to his psychotherapist. We should probably be grateful he didn’t also show Diamond preparing for a colonoscopy.</p>\n<p>To be fair, it’s a reasonably intriguing idea to explore Diamond’s apparently morose psyche through his lyrics. It’s obvious that their composer had a dark side, evident even in the sunniest of pop songs. Take “I’m a Believer,” which was a smash hit for The Monkees. Sure, it sounds jaunty when you sing it. But take a closer look at the lyrics: “I thought love was more or less a giving thing/Seems the more I gave the less I got/What’s the use in tryin’, all you get is pain/When I needed sunshine, I got rain.” Then there’s “Shiloh,” about a child who turns to an imaginary friend because he has no real ones, and “Solitary Man,” and “Song Sung Blue,” and, well, you get the idea.</p>\n<p>[<em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s</em> ★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em>]</p>\n<p>The problem is that Diamond, at least as he’s portrayed here, isn’t much fun to spend two-and-a-quarter hours with. Will Swenson and Mark Jacoby, as the younger and older versions respectively, do what they can, with the former obviously having the advantage because he gets to show off the sequined outfits and sing all of the hits. But the more they both mope about the problems of being a rich and famous pop star adored by millions, the more you want to channel your inner Cher, slap them silly, and yell, “Snap out of it!”</p>\n<p>It doesn’t help that as the younger Diamond’s life unfolds, the older version sits along with his shrink on leather chairs on the side of the stage, grimacing in mental anguish and occasionally making acerbic comments. It seems an unnecessary device, since that’s what theater critics are for.</p>\n<p>The real reason for a show like this, of course, is not to do a deep dive into its subject’s psyche but rather to deliver full-throttle versions of the hits that baby boomers, those theatergoers with the most disposable income, grew up hearing. You’ll hear nearly thirty of them in the course of the evening, including the first act closer, “Sweet Caroline,” which inspires the inevitable sing-along that will brand you as a social misfit if you don’t enthusiastically participate. The song, incidentally, is shown as coming to Diamond like some sort of lifesaving, God-given inspiration, roughly akin to Moses receiving the Ten Commandments on the tablets.</p>\n<p>Not knowing the details of Diamond’s life, I assume that this rendition in which he burns through two marriages (he’s now happily married to his third wife), achieves success as a performer despite near-crippling shyness and insecurity, stands up to his first record label which was financed by mob money, and eventually becomes a non-stop touring machine who sacrifices both his and his family’s happiness on the altar of pop stardom, is reasonably close to the truth. But one hopes that it played out far more interestingly in real life. This is the sort of show in which one of the most dramatic scenes concerns a squabble between Diamond and his wife over whether or not to cancel a lunch date with Barbra Streisand. Although, to be fair, Robert Redford was also supposed to be there.</p>\n<p>To say that the musical’s staging by Michael Mayer feels overly literal is an understatement. During “Song Sung Blue,” the audience is bathed in blue light. When Diamond’s marriage to his first wife Jaye (Jessie Fisher) implodes, she sings, “Love on the Rocks.” “Forever in Blue Jeans” features the performers clad in blue jeans. When Diamond’s marriage to his second wife Marcia (a dynamic and sexy Robyn Hurder, nearly stealing the show) ends, we hear “You Don’t Bring Me Flowers.” And in “Sweet Caroline,” during the lyrics “Hands, touching hands/Reaching out, touching me, touching you,” disembodied hands suddenly appear from behind a couch. It makes you relieved Diamond didn’t write “Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick.”</p>\n<p>Those hands, by the way, belong to a ten-member singing and dancing ensemble dubbed “The Beautiful Noise,” composed of an admirably physically and ethnically diverse group of performers. They act as a sort of Greek chorus, constantly popping up whenever it seems least necessary and forced to perform ungainly choreography devised by Steven Hoggett (<em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em>) that lives up to the name of the theater company he co-founded, Frantic Assembly.</p>\n<p>A bewigged Will Swenson doesn’t look much like Diamond, but he deepens his voice effectively enough to sound reasonably like him, although not quite living up to a character’s description, “gravel wrapped in velvet.” You can feel his relief when he finally gets to wear the silly outfits and cut loose in the big production numbers like “Brother Love’s Traveling Salvation Show,” which is a hell of a lot more fun than, say, “Hello Again.” If his approach ultimately feels less like a performance than an inspired bit of karaoke, Swenson still fares better than Jacoby, a wonderful, veteran musical theater performer who here has the unenviable task of moping on stage for two hours before finally getting his turn to shine with a galvanizing rendition of “I Am…I Said.” But by then it feels like too little, too late.</p>\n<p><strong><b>A Beautiful Noise </b>opened December 4, 2022, at the Broadhurst Theatre.

Photo credit: Matthew Murphy, Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 2017 Off-Broadway incarnation of the new musical <em>KPOP</em> opened at a venue just a few blocks away from its current Broadway home at the Circle in the Square. But despite the short distance, much of the show’s impact has been lost along the way. The original production was immersive, with segments of the audience moving from one location to another to witness the aching workloads and personal conflicts of young Korean performers to achieve stardom under the guidance of an ambitious record label. That aspect has been necessarily and understandably lost in the show’s transition to a traditional Broadway theater, albeit the only one featuring in-the-round seating. Unfortunately, much of what made the earlier production interesting has been discarded as well, resulting in a more sanitized, less thematically interesting experience that mainly relies on the propulsive energy of its many musical numbers to fuel the evening. The end result provides a reasonably enjoyable facsimile of K-Pop music, but it’s certainly not the same <em>KPOP</em>.</p>\n<p>To be fair, some elements of the show’s book written by Jason Kim needed changing anyway. Much of the original production dealt with the efforts of the record label to break into an American market unfamiliar with Korean pop. That’s now sadly outdated, as such groups as BTS and Blackpink, among many others, routinely sell out arenas and even stadiums. The immersive angle has been replaced by a new plotline involving a filmmaker (Aubie Merrylees) attempting to shoot a behind-the-scenes documentary about the record label’s acts, with several scenes taking place offstage and shown via video monitors. But the rudimentary plot device feels hackneyed and the use of video has by now come to feel cliched onstage.</p>\n<p>The show never really had in-depth characterizations or a compelling storyline, but it did have an arresting theme, namely the draconian process inflicted on young K-Pop performers that makes the teaching methods used by Motown in its early days seem like summer camp. Those scenes gave the show a powerful edginess very much lacking in this version, and have lost none of their relevancy considering the epidemic of suicides among young K-Pop performers that continues to this day.</p>\n<p>As before, the show features a girl group, RTMIS (Min, Bohyung, Kate Mina Lin, Amy Keum, Julia Abueva), a boy band, F8 (Jiho Kang, John Yi, Joshua Lee, Kevin Woo, Abraham Lim, Eddy Lee, James Kho, Zachary Noah Piser) and a rising solo star, MwE (real-life K-Pop star Luna). There is a vague plotline involving F8’s hostility toward its newest member, Brad (Piser), fueled by his bi-racial background, while we don’t get to know very much about the individual members of RTMIS. The main storyline, such as it is, revolves around MwE, who we see in a series of flashbacks developing from an awkward nine-year-old with no dance skills to a polished star. Eventually she gets into a conflict with her record label’s head honcho, Ruby (Jully Lee), who has become a sort of surrogate mother and who objects to MwE’s romance with a former childhood friend.</p>\n<p>Mainly, the show is an excuse for a series of glossy pop numbers composed by Helen Park and Max Vernon, sung in both Korean and English, that expertly mimic the music and choreography of contemporary K-Pop groups. Accompanied by elaborate lighting and video projections, the peppy songs feature the young performers delivering full-throttle vocals and highly energetic dance routines, choreographed by Jennifer Weber <em>(&amp; Juliet</em>) that are as mechanical-feeling as they are physically impressive.</p>\n<p>Your enjoyment of the evening will depend on your appreciation for this brand of pop music that makes the bubblegum hits of the ‘60s feel like Gregorian chants. Personally, a little of it goes a long way for me, but I’m clearly not the target demographic for the show whose audience featured many younger theatergoers, including children, clearly enjoying themselves.</p>\n<p>As effectively staged by Teddy Bergman<em>, KPOP</em> certainly proves impressive on a technical level. The costumes designed by Clint Ramos are consistently dazzling, and the glitzy musical numbers probably wouldn’t look out of place in Madison Square Garden. Which begs the question: with so many actual K-pop acts now appearing in the area on a regular basis, why not go for the real thing instead of a highly proficient reproduction?</p>\n<p><strong><b>KPOP </b>opened November 27, 2022, at Circle in the Square.

Photo credit: A Christmas Carol Live</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>You might want to leave the kiddies home for the new Broadway production of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. Sure, Dickens’ classic has proven itself to be time-honored children’s entertainment in its untold number of cinematic and theatrical incarnations over the years. But this version, beginning with a deafening sudden noise so startling that you’ll jump out of your seats (you’re welcome for the warning), emphasizes the ghost story at the heart of the tale. This is <em>A Christmas Carol</em> so dark and spooky it would be equally at home during the Halloween season.</p>\n<p>Of course, you may be feeling some <em>A Christmas Carol </em>fatigue, since there was another far more jolly, uplifting version staged by Jack Thorne seen on Broadway just a few years ago. But that rendition required a large cast; in this production presented at Los Angeles’ Geffen Playhouse in 2018 (and also in a filmed version streamed two years later), there’s only one actor onstage.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, that actor is Tony Award-winner Jefferson Mays, who, as he demonstrated in <em>I Am</em> <em>My Own Wife</em> and <em>A Gentleman’s Guide to Murder</em>, isn’t content to play but one character when he can play many more. Here, he plays more than 50 characters while also assuming the role of narrator, and thanks to his acting wizardry, you’re never once confused as to who is who. He changes characterizations at the drop of a hat with subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle manipulations of his voice and body, aided by tremendously effective lighting and sound effects, delivering a virtuosic turn that proves mesmerizing in its actorly skill and intensity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/11/21/a-christmas-carol-jefferson-mays-gift-wraps-charles-dickens-astonishingly-so/\">[<em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>Thanks to the sterling contributions of director Michael Arden (a two-Time Tony nominee for <em>Once on This Island</em> and <em>Spring</em> <em>Awakening</em>), scenic and costume designer Dane Laffrey, lighting designer Ben Stanton, sound designer Joshua D. Reid, and projection designer Lucy Mackinnon, this version of the oft-told tale proves supremely theatrical. When Scrooge revisits his past and remembers a party from his youth, we see a projection of beautifully dressed figures in the background, slightly blurry as if they were spectral presences. For much of the time the action takes place in near-complete darkness, with only simulated candle lighting to illuminate the ghostly goings-on. At other times the set is bathed in red and green, the colors of Christmas. But the main color on display is black, suitable for the overall bleakness of the proceedings.</p>\n<p>Adapted by Mays, Susan Lyons, and Arden from the abridged version of the text that Dickens himself performed many times, this version of the story may at times prove hard to follow for those not familiar with it (although who that would be is hard to imagine). Younger children in particular may have a tough time, as evidenced by the wailing of one tyke at the preview performance whose parents apparently hadn’t bothered to find out specifics before purchasing tickets. And of course, if you’re allergic to one-person shows, this won’t be for you.</p>\n<p>There are also some technical issues. Unless you have decent seats, you may occasionally have trouble making out what’s going on in the darkness, and some of the torrent of heavily accented verbiage may be lost. Personally, I could have done without the insertion of a recorded song by Sufjan Stevens, which jolted me out of the Victorian era mood.</p>\n<p>But those are minor quibbles about the transfixing production with its virtuosic solo performance (another actor, Danny Gardner, appears briefly as “The Spectre”) and dazzling stage wizardry that would give Harry Potter a run for his money. This <em>Christmas Carol</em> may not be the most exuberant or sentimental one you’ve ever encountered, but it will certainly prove one of the most memorable.</p>\n<p><strong>A Christmas Carol opened November 21, 2022, at the Nederlander Theatre and runs through January 1, 2023.

Photo: A Christmas Carol Live</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s comin’ on Christmas, they’re cuttin’ down trees,” Joni Mitchell sings in her wonderful “River,” and then goes on observing that “they’re puttin’ up reindeer, singin’ songs of joy and peace.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She might just as well have included that they’re reading and rereading aloud <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, Charles Dickens’ classic 1843 novella, the full title of which is <em>A Christmas Carol. In Prose. Being a Ghost Story of Christmas.</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surely, a Yuletide doesn’t go by and hasn’t for something like 180 years when someone or, more likely, someones isn’t/aren’t reciting the tale of miserly Ebenezer Scrooge, who, visited by the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future on Christmas Eve, realizes the cruel error of his ways and for the rest of his long life becomes the very spirit of the season.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With not too much arm-twisting needed, Dickens himself is undoubtedly called on annually to recount the tale for the multitudes up there in heaven. And every year new voices are certainly raised in celebration of Dickens’s deathless as well as life-enhancing and endearingly sentimental prose.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year add Jefferson Mays to the ever-lengthening list. Having prepared his version for some time, he’s now brought it to Broadway – and magnificently.  In the beloved story, Scrooge’s nephew encourages the “wiry” old man to keep Christmas joyfully. In reply, the “wretched” money-lover says, “Keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/11/21/a-christmas-carol-jefferson-mays-plays-scrooge-and-everyone-else/\">[<em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mays keeps it in his way, doing so with co-adapters Susan Lyons and Michael Arden, production conceivers Arden and scenic designer Dane Laffrey, director Arden, lighting designer Ben Stanton, sound designer Joshua D. Reid, projection designer Lucy Mackinnon, and hair, wig, and makeup designer Cookie Jordan.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What the endlessly imaginative group has created is a Christmas present so big it wouldn’t even fit under the storys-tall tree in Rockefeller Center. It requires much more capitalization than something like famous <em>Christmas Carol</em>-presenting Simon Callow standing at a lectern. Which is an observation meant to emphasize that the must-see package may not show up everywhere (or anywhere?) other than large houses where pounds and shillings flow.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, even more reason to see Mays’ performance this December (and New Year’s Day), a turn that must rank as highly as any <em>Christmas Carol</em> performances ever offered here.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardly new to soloing, Mays appeared in this outing at Los Angeles’ Geffen Playhouse in 2020 and took home a best actor award. Even more to the point, he first made himself widely known for his 2003 solo performance in Doug Wright’s <em>I Am My Own Wife</em>, winning the Tony once it had transferred from Playwrights Horizons to Broadway.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As vital as he has ever been on stage, perhaps more so – he’s here having left <em>The Music Man </em>revival where he played the much less energetic River City mayor – the benevolent Mays goes about his tireless self-made assignment wearing tradition Victorian businessman garb he never changes.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much else does change, though, as Mays gads about the stage serving Dickens honorably while speaking as Scrooge, as the three chiding spirits, and as everyone else the old chiseler encounters in revisiting his past, present, and possible future.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mays says he voices 50 characters. He’s all over the place, his timbres amusingly vacillating, as furniture comes and leaves on a rarely halting turntable. The moods through which he ventures seem innumerable, though were anyone inclined to take on the task, they probably could be enumerated and thus add weight to the actor’s enthralling accomplishment.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adapters Lyons, Arden, and Mays often focus on longer sequences, each worth the attention. The most convivial occurs when the chastened Scrooge accepts his nephew’s invitation to Christmas dinner, sits down at a beautifully appointed table, and joins the cheerful conversation.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That gleaming table is just one of the many visual treats constantly arriving according to the productions unceasing theatrical magic, (That’s other than the visual and aural treat Mays is throughout.) If there’s a single inspired example – kudos primarily to designer Laffrey? – it’s the representation of a wrought iron fence featuring an open gate to either a cemetery or to the famed pearly ones.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above the gate, there’s a wrought iron greeting – in Latin, of all hardly dead languages. It repeats Tiny Tim’s “God bless us, every one.” It’s incentive enough to cause a grateful reviewer to wish a blessing on this miraculous new presentation of Charles Dickens’ <em>A Christmas Carol</em>.</span></p>\n<p><strong>A Christmas Carol opened November 21, 2022, at the Nederlander Theatre and runs through January 1, 2023.

Photo credit: Carol Rosegg</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the new effort written by David Cale, a young woman makes a trip to Mexico to search for her best friend who’s mysteriously gone missing. While there, she begins a torrid affair with a mysterious Italian stranger who, it turns out, may be connected to her friend’s disappearance. It’s a tale filled with exotic characters and twisty plot turns, and would have made for a terrific film noir back in the day.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, <em>Sandra</em>, now receiving its world premiere at Off-Broadway’s Vineyard Theater, is a one-person play.</p>\n<p>Cale has previously demonstrated a talent for the genre in both his affecting musical theatrical memoir <em>We’re Only Alive for a Short Amount of Time</em> and the comic thriller <em>Harry Clarke</em>, the latter of which offered a dazzling turn by Billy Crudup. But he comes up short in this new piece, which feels overstuffed with plot and lacking in thematic resonance. Despite a game performance by Marjan Neshat (who also recently delivered top-notch turns in the Off-Broadway plays <em>English</em> and <em>Wish You Were Here</em>), <em>Sandra</em> never proves sufficiently arresting.</p>\n<p>Neshat plays the title role of the recently separated, fortysomething Sandra, who owns a café in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights. When her best friend Ethan, a gay composer and pianist, goes missing while on a solo vacation in Puerto Vallarta, the local authorities and the FBI do the bare minimum of investigating. So she impulsively travels there herself like a real-life Nancy Drew, hoping to uncover clues to his whereabouts.</p>\n<p>Sitting at a local bar, she meets Beauford, an elderly gay man with a Southern accent. He is accompanied by a much younger man with long blonde hair who strangely leaves the minute Beauford goes to the bathroom. Beauford tells her that the younger man, whom he just met, revealed a proclivity for placing handwritten messages in bottles and throwing them into the sea.</p>\n<p>After several fruitless days wandering the area, Sandra heads home. Perusing some Mexican newspapers she’s brought along for the flight, she discovers a story about bottles containing messages washing ashore. A photograph of one of them reveals handwriting that she immediately recognizes as Ethan’s.</p>\n<p>And that’s where the story heads south, figuratively as well as literally. It’s such a ridiculous plot development that it’s almost impossible to take the rest of the tale seriously. Sandra immediately heads back to Mexico to search for the man with long blonde hair, and along the way meets the sexy, younger Luca, who has an Italian accent and, as Sandra excitedly tells us repeatedly, a swimmer’s body. They quickly fall into bed together, where he reawakens her sexually after her long, stale marriage. Their romance continues long-distance even after she returns to New York, but she eventually discovers that Luca may not be the innocent college grad student he seems.</p>\n<p>The storyline later becomes even more baroque, involving multiple homicides, the mob, the feds, and Sandra having to enter the Witness Protection Program. While a talented filmmaker might have been able to compensate for the plot incredulities with atmospheric direction and colorful performances, this solo theatrical version, related to us for 80 minutes by a woman onstage occasionally sitting in a chair, just seems ridiculous. And while it becomes apparent that Cale seems to be striving to explore issues relating to self-identity and personal reinvention, they never emerge clearly.</p>\n<p>Director Leigh Silverman does what she can to theatricalize the proceedings with moody lighting and evocative music composed by Matthew Dean Marsh (who also collaborated with Cale on <em>We’re Only</em> <em>Alive</em>). But the burden of carrying the evening falls to Neshat, whose performance proves only intermittently effective. The actress movingly mines her character’s emotional depths when simply relating her story. But she’s also forced to imitate the accents of the various other characters, including Italian, Southern, and Australian, none too convincingly. A case could be made that Sandra is an ordinary person, not a trained actress, so it would be untrue for her to be delivering flawless accent work. But that doesn’t make her any easier to listen to. And none of it makes <em>Sandra</em> easy to believe on any level.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandra opened November 20, 2022, at the Vineyard Theater </strong><strong>and runs through December 18.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Mix the single-artist salute <em>Mamma Mia!</em> with the contempo-pop stylings of <em>Moulin Rouge!</em>; add a healthy dose of the Shakespeare-themed <em>Something Rotten</em>, and a sprinkle of the Renaissance-grrl-powered <em>Six</em>… and you’ve got some idea of what’s in store for you at <em>&amp; Juliet</em>, the candy-colored glitter bomb of a show that just opened at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre.</p>\n<p>But <em>&amp; Juliet</em>—a jukebox musical built around 30 megahits/earworms from Swedish songwriter and super-producer Max Martin (he’s masterminded songs made famous by the Backstreet Boys, ’N Sync, Katy Perry, Britney Spears, Kelly Clarkson, Pink, Jessie J, Demi Lovato, and more)—is very much its own thing in so many wild and wonderful ways.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing (to quote one of Kelly Clarkson’s, and <em>&amp; Juliet’s</em>, biggest hits): Anne Hathaway—William Shakespeare’s wife, of “second-best bed” fame—is a major character. Sure, Shakespeare is too, but Anne has a bit more sway here. She’s the one who persuades her literary legend hubby to give his star-crossed heroine a happier ending. “What if,” she posits, “Juliet didn’t kill herself?” Incidentally, Anne and Will are played by Betsy Wolfe and Stark Sands, respectively, two Broadway vets with Swiss-precision comic timing (they should consider pairing up as Beatrice and Benedick in <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em>).</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/11/17/juliet-shakespeare-reimagined-with-earworm-heavy-pop-hits/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>So Juliet (the dynamite Lorna Courtney, who absolutely slays power-pop songs such as “Since U Been Gone” and “Roar”) lives! But, to paraphrase Britney’s 1998 debut single, her loneliness is killing her. To try to forget about the untimely death of her balcony-climbing beloved—and to avoid getting sent to a nunnery—she escapes to Paris with her fabulous BFF May (Justin David Sullivan), her nurse Angélique (Melanie La Barrie), and her new BFF April, who’s actually just Anne in cooler clothes. Paris is lit: They crash a banging Renaissance ball where Juliet rides a chandelier; May has a moment with the nerdy but cute François (Philippe Arroyo); Angélique has a moment with her gone-but-not-forgotten former flame, François’ father, Lance (Metropolitan Opera alum and <em>South Pacific</em> Tony winner Paulo Szot); and Juliet and François decide to get married just so their parents will leave them alone. Then Shakespeare stirs the pot by bringing Romeo (Ben Jackson Walker, positively electric) back from the grave. Oh, that Shakespeare does love to make a mess of things.</p>\n<p>Descending from the sky in a cloud of smoke wailing on Bon Jovi’s “It’s My Life” (“It’s now or never/ I ain’t gonna live forever”), Romeo is basically a Renaissance rock star: skinny painted-on jeans, chunky black boots, silver biker chains, and a Gucci-esque flouncy pink shirt that screams Harry Styles, plus a badass studded leather moto jacket with MONTAGUE painted atop a dagger-pierced heart. The Elizabethan thrift-store chic costumes by Tony winner Paloma Young (<em>Peter and the Starcatcher</em>)—a fabulous fusion of colorful corsets, tulle, deconstructed doublets, faded denim, rich velvet, baggy sweats, puffy shirts, ruffs, crowns and headpieces, trendy gold paper-clip chains and nameplate necklaces, and one very memorable codpiece—are perfection. And combat boots and sneakers galore, which seem like a necessity considering Jennifer Weber’s intricate hip-hop-heavy choreography (especially the exceptionally cool “Problem/Can’t Feel My Face” mashup in Act 2).</p>\n<p>If we have a quibble or two, it might be that the show is a few minutes too long. (Though, to be fair, that’s a criticism that’s leveled at most of Shakespeare’s plays as well.) And the confetti. So. Much. Confetti. That theater looks like Times Square 10 minutes after New Year’s Eve.</p>\n<p>But <em>&amp; Juliet</em> succeeds where many jukebox musicals don’t: It shoehorns the songs into the script practically seamlessly, a credit to librettist David West Read. As a writer and producer for the hit sitcom <em>Schitt’s Creek</em>, Read—previously represented in New York with the captivating drama <em>The Dream of the Burning Boy</em> (2011) at Roundabout Underground and the blink-and-you-missed-it Broadway porn-industry comedy <em>The Performers</em> (2012)—clearly has an appreciation for all kinds of humor, from wordplay to visual gags to random silliness. Did you ever think you’d see Paulo Szot doing the booty slap on a Broadway stage?</p>\n<p>And brace yourself for the wedding party in Act 2, because the sight of François, Will, Lance, Romeo, and May as a 16th-century boy band harmonizing on “Everybody (Backstreet’s Back”) is enough to make you lose your mind. Or at least laugh until you can’t feel your face.</p>\n<p><strong><em>&amp; Juliet</em> opened Nov. 17, 2022, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre.

Photo credit: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you’re anything like me, you probably haven’t spent a lot of time wondering why Juliet had to die at the conclusion of Shakespeare’s classic <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet</em>. But the creators of the new Broadway musical <em>&amp;</em> <em>Juliet</em> apparently have, resulting in the latest of what seems like an endless torrent of jukebox musicals. Fortunately, this effort featuring dozens of earworm-heavy smash hits by pop composer/producer Max Martin (a name you may not know, but you’ll have no trouble recognizing his songs) and his various collaborators provides the sort of infectious silliness that makes for a very enjoyable evening, provided that you leave your brains at the door.</p>\n<p>Of course, just because a show is frivolous doesn’t mean that it can’t hit you over the head with a message. In this case it’s female empowerment, especially for the teenage Juliet (a powerhouse Lorna Courtney) and Anne Hathaway (Betsy Wolfe charming and funny), Shakespeare’s beleaguered wife who makes it clear at the beginning that she doesn’t care for the ending of her smug husband’s (Stark Sands) new play (nor, for that matter, his eventual bequeathing to her of his “second-best bed”). So she suggests in no uncertain terms that he change it.</p>\n<p>The show’s meta-theatrical conceit imagines that Juliet didn’t kill herself upon finding Romeo dead, but rather lived on to explore new horizons by taking a road trip to Paris, accompanied by her non-binary friend May (Justin David Sullivan). There, she meets and begins a relationship with Francoise (Philippe Arroyo), a young man whose father Lance (Paulo Szot) has ordered him to either get married or enter the military. Although not excited about either option, Francois proposes to Juliet, still on the rebound from her star-crossed relationship with Romeo (Ben Jackson Walker), who (spoiler alert only for those who don’t read the <em>Playbill</em>), turns out to be not so dead after all.</p>\n<p>[<em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s</em> ★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em>]</p>\n<p>As with Shakespeare’s original, the musical abounds with subplots, in this case involving the burgeoning romance between Lance and Juliet’s wisecracking nurse Angelique (a hilarious Melanie Le Barrie); and the sexually confused Francoise finding himself drawn to May.</p>\n<p>Book writer David West Read (<em>Schitt’s Creek</em>) somehow manages the difficult feat of weaving the goofiest of pop songs into the Elizabethan proceedings with almost sublime ingenuity. You’ll find yourself giggling as the middle-aged Lance and Angelique burst into a post-coital rendition of Katy Perry’s “Teenage Dream” and Shakespeare and Anne express their sharp differences of opinion with Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way.” And when the vainglorious Romeo makes his reappearance, how else should he proclaim his revival from the dead but with Bon Jovi’s “It’s My Life?”</p>\n<p>Director Luke Sheppard provides the sort of high-octane, pop concert-style staging that gives the not dissimilar <em>Six</em> a run for its money (although that show is smart enough to last a tight 80 minutes, compared to this one’s overlong two-and-a-half hours), complete with flashy lighting and video effects, a turntable and rising platform. Jennifer Weber’s energetic choreography would prove perfectly suitable for the latest girl group or boy band at Madison Square Garden.</p>\n<p>The show’s terrific music numbers, fueled by high-powered vocals, give it a propulsive energy that’s impossible to resist. Or, as the ensemble puts it in the climactic Justin Timberlake song, “Can’t Stop the Feeling!”</p>\n<p><strong><b>&amp; Juliet </b>opened November 17, 2022, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre.

Photo: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Eighty or so minutes into the 85 minutes of <em>The Old Man &amp; the Pool</em>, Mike Birbiglia politely requests that the audience stop laughing, then pleads with them, and finally <em>demands</em> a moment of respectful silence. No dice, perhaps due to that not-quite-hidden glint in the eye and the ever-present hint of a Huck Finn grin.</p>\n<p>Birbiglia is the stand-up monologist who in 2008 wet his stage feet with the surprisingly delightful <em>Sleepwalk with Me,</em> and whose 2018 celebration of fatherhood, <em>The New One</em>, was notably successful when it played three months at the Cort. If <em>The New One</em> was a heartwarming delight (and it was), <em>The Old Man &amp; the Pool</em> is even—well—deeper.</p>\n<p>A spry and seemingly healthy 44-year old, Birbiglia confesses to a history of serious health issues. Thus we have a rumination on severe obstacles which ought not be funny but, in the author’s telling, are positively side-splitting. Along the way he meanders off into myriad tangents—wrestling, chlorine, chicken parmigiana—which provoke torrents of laughter while always circling back to the matter at hand. All the while he reveals himself to be a first-class stage clown with mastery of both verbal and physical arts.</p>\n<p>[<em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em>]</p>\n<p>Birbiglia is once again guided by director Seth Barrish, this being their fifth solo-show collaboration. Beowulf Boritt has transformed the stage into a blue wash, backed by an aqua-and-white checked panel that curves above Birbiglia like a skateboarder’s ramp and fills the house with a swimming pool-like incandescence (with lighting by Aaron Copp). It’s hard to say what this background is made of, but at one point the actor astonishes us by springing off it like a vertical trampoline.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_16722\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-16722\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-16722 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5505_Mike-Birbiglia-in-The-Old-Man-The-Pool-jump-credit-Emilio-Madrid.jpg?resize=1024%2C722&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"722\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5505_Mike-Birbiglia-in-The-Old-Man-The-Pool-jump-credit-Emilio-Madrid.jpg?resize=1024%2C722&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5505_Mike-Birbiglia-in-The-Old-Man-The-Pool-jump-credit-Emilio-Madrid.jpg?resize=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5505_Mike-Birbiglia-in-The-Old-Man-The-Pool-jump-credit-Emilio-Madrid.jpg?resize=768%2C541&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5505_Mike-Birbiglia-in-The-Old-Man-The-Pool-jump-credit-Emilio-Madrid.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-16722\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mike Birbiglia in The Old Man &amp; the Pool. Photo: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The actor wanders on simply dressed, as if just meandering in from the streets of Brooklyn, which maybe he did. Simple but carefully designed: casual blue with gray Allbirds, revealing a sliver of devilishly red socks. Perhaps one of the simplest costumes Toni-Leslie James (of entertainments as diverse as <em>Angels in America</em> and <em>Paradise Square</em>) has contrived, but perfect for the occasion.</p>\n<p>This is the part of the review where I’d salute the author for standing behind the actor and making every word ring true whilst making sure that each diverse strand was so interwoven as to pay off. Given that Birbiglia himself wrote the play, let’s just say that he makes it look extemporaneously natural while dramaturgically it’s anything but. But how are you going to notice when you’re falling off your seats laughing?</p>\n<p>The author seems to have been influenced, at least titularly, by Ernest Hemingway’s Pulitzer-winning allegorical rumination <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em>. Birbiglia’s play, on the other hand, is an allegorical rumination for <em>our</em> times. While it’s safe to predict <em style=\"border-color: rgba(229,231,235,var(--tw-border-opacity)); --tw-border-opacity: 1; --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-inset: var(--tw-empty, ); --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000;\">The Old Man &amp; the Pool</em> will not cop the Pulitzer, it is way funnier than Hemingway.</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Birbiglia: The Old Man &amp; the Pool opened November 13, 2022, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater and runs through January 15, 2023.

Photo: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>If you didn’t see Mike Birbiglia’s <em>Sleepwalk With Me</em>, which marked his off-Broadway debut in 2008, you can read the collected book of autobiographical comic essays, or listen to the audiobook. You can watch his later shows—<em>My Girlfriend’s Boyfriend</em> (his fantastic valentine to commitment-phobia) and <em>The New One</em> (his unexpectedly emotional ode to parenthood)—on Netflix.</p>\n<p>But if you’re a fan—or simply a fan of story-driven stand-up comedy, not unlike Alex Edelman’s <em>Just for Us</em> (perhaps the best one-person comedy show I’ve ever seen, and produced by Birbiglia)—you should see Birbiglia live. He’s brought his latest show, the terrific <em>The Old Man &amp; the Pool</em>, to the Vivian Beaumont; what the theater lacks in legroom it makes up for with a crowd of Birbiglia-age theatergoers who are trying to reconcile their boomer parents’ fragility with the prospect of their own mortality, and who also likely put off their annual checkups and recommended screenings for fear of receiving some kind of reprimand or bad news. (I’m just spitballing here.)</p>\n<p>After a couple doctor visits where he learned that “these items in the physician’s office that I thought were decorative are quite functional,” Birbiglia was forced, reluctantly, on a path to improve his health. He ultimately settles on swimming—which unearths memories of childhood YMCA visits and musings on the amount of urine in a public pool (apparently there have been studies, and…well…you don’t want to know)—and keeps it up, for a while. Then: “Why do we stop doing the thing we know we should be doing?”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/11/13/the-old-man-the-pool-mike-birbiglia-laps-up-laughs-and-how/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Birbiglia is on tour in the Midwest when his doctor informs him that he has Type 2 diabetes. In fact, he’s on his way to retrieve a pizza delivery from his hotel lobby when he gets the news. “The thing about co-morbidities is that sometimes they team up to form a single morbidity,” he says. Suddenly, pizza is a lot less sexy—if you know Birbiglia’s work, you <em>know</em> how he feels about pizza—and he’s back in the over-chlorinated water at the Brooklyn YMCA. He even gets advice about his diet: “If you haven’t gone to a nutritionist, I’ll save you the trip. They know the same stuff as us.”</p>\n<p>If you’ve never seen Birbiglia, you’ll quickly realize that his comedy is pointed but never cruel; though he mentions his wife, Jenny, and daughter, Oona, frequently, his prime target is himself; his pacing is near-perfect (only one bit, right at the end, runs out of steam); and a left-hook packed with emotion and sincerity often comes when you least expect it. “I feel like we don’t choose what we remember about our own lives,” he says about seeing his father, hospitalized, after an emergency angioplasty, “but what I remember the most about that day is that it was the first time I saw my dad as a person.”</p>\n<p>Why <em>do</em> we stop doing the thing we know we should be doing? Birbiglia never explicitly answers, but we know this: He got back in the pool. So—what’s your pool?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mike Birbiglia: The Old Man &amp; the Pool</em></strong><strong> opened Nov. 13, 2022, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater and runs through Jan. 15, 2023.

Photo by Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>This show is, in a word, a honey. How refreshing to get an unabashedly good-hearted musical that again and again affirms two simple truths: that we’re all more alike than we are different, and that we flourish, rather than wither, in the presence of our differences.</p>\n<p>Ah, but how it came to be; now there’s a tale. Because the source material didn’t necessarily promise the warm good time now gracing the Booth Theater stage.</p>\n<p>There are two <em>Kimberly Akimbo’</em>s, you see: the straight play from 2001, and the current musical, each penned by Pulitzer winner (for <em>Rabbit Hole</em>) David Lindsay-Abaire. Both concern a New Jersey high schooler, Kimberly Levaco (played here by Victoria Clark), whose genetic makeup causes her to age four times as fast as everyone else. In both, the aged-looking teen has just reached her 16th birthday, which is about as old as medical science says she’ll get. Both saddle her with neglectful, narcissistic parents and a deadbeat aunt, who cynically drafts Kimberly into a dangerous check-fraud scheme. Each incarnation of lonely Kimberly harbors dreams of normalcy, tempered by full awareness of how little time she’s got left.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/11/10/kimberly-akimbo-a-doomed-teen-valiantly-seizes-the-day/\"><em>Read Sandy MacDonald’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The five-character play, funny as it is, now seems laced with acid out of another era (and let’s face it, two decades is no small cultural divide). Brutally single-minded in their entitlement and funk, the play’s adults attack each other – and the kids – with enough open hostility to make Edward Albee recoil. There’s not enough room in the Levaco family swear jar for all the coins their four-letter words demand. Though there’s a note of liberation by the play’s end, a chill hangs over the action and dénouement, the kind one associates with Jules Feiffer and even Pinter, or early-career Christopher Durang (to whom Lindsay-Abaire is frequently compared).</p>\n<p>A remarkable alchemy was required to transform this intolerance cavalcade into the luminous celebration of life that&#8217;s setting today’s audiences to weeping and cheers.</p>\n<p>Enter Lindsay-Abaire to take on lyrics as well as libretto, and his composer partner from <em>Shrek, </em>Jeanine Tesori. Their score is an enchanting blend of rhymed fancy and neo-recitative à la <em>Hair’s </em>“Frank Mills.” And a terrific cast has been assembled. But it’s two decisions by the authors and director Jessica Stone – one a matter of subtraction, the other of addition – that merit a lot of credit for this joyous evening.</p>\n<p>First, they’ve given the adults more dimensions, shifting the play’s over-the-top cruelty into something less off-putting, a kind of careless self-absorption. Cranky expectant mother Pattie (Alli Mauzey) is allowed to show a tender side in a gorgeous lullaby, “Father Time.” Husband Buddy (Steven Boyer) remains a boozing, self-pitying blue collar guy, but now played for sheepish comedy. On-the-lam Aunt Debra, who’s truly monstrous in the original play, becomes in the hands of Bonnie Milligan a high-wattage showstopper, belting out confessions of sin and avarice (“How to Wash a Check,” the hilarious act two opener) with no loss of <em>joie de vivre.</em></p>\n<p>Softening the adult characters’ bite – there are many fewer trips to the swear jar – doesn’t diminish the effect on poor Kimberly. If anything her pain is intensified, because now it comes from an authentic emotional base rather than a place of caricature. She chafes at their lack of attention while reeling from the notion that she has disappointed them, and that’s an ambivalence to which most, and maybe all of us can relate.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, whoever came up with the idea of adding a Greek chorus of four high schoolers can accept a special Tony from me. Theirs are more hearts in need: Aaron (Michael Iskander) yearns for Delia (Olivia Elease Hardy), who hungers for Teresa (Nina White), who’s hung up on Martin (Fernell Hogan), who only has eyes for, you guessed it, Aaron. That’s four charming subplots right there, offering comedy relief and movement backup. (The spare but effective choreography is by Danny Mefford.) In the play, Kimberly’s unseen fellow classmates are mentioned as either bullying or ignoring her. With this irrepressible quartet in the house, <em>Kimberly Akimbo</em> becomes something more than a relentless examination of one character’s distress. It encompasses the whole range of experience, elation as well as sadness, in the agonizing process of growing up.</p>\n<p>Victoria Clark’s Kimberly is a far cry from her Tony-winning steely matron in <em>The Light in the Piazza, </em>but no less rich in concentration and subtext. It’s easy to suspend disbelief that this actress of an age is genuinely an adolescent, gawky and uncomfortable, stubbornly staking out her individual identity while quietly conscious of her other-ness. Enter Seth Weedus (Justin Cooley), an equally neglected sad sack, possibly on the spectrum but unfailingly of good cheer. His refusal to see his friend as tainted or strange is a major agent of her taking control of her destiny.</p>\n<p>Clark and Cooley have reaped just praise for their work ever since the Off Broadway premiere last year under the Atlantic Theater Company aegis (where the show copped the New York Drama Critics Circle award). There are few performers whose every entrance, every line provoke audience smiles, and Clark and Cooley are two such, the best double act in town.</p>\n<p>Eschewing power ballads and repeated, explicit assertions of self-doubt and self-worth – I’m looking at you, <em>Dear Evan Hansen </em>– this remarkable pair of performances, and the beautifully modulated show at which they are the center, offer simple yet ringing affirmation that we need to appreciate each other and enjoy the ride, because we only get on this roller coaster once.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Kimberly Akimbo </b>opened November 10, 2022, at the Booth Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Will success spoil <em>Kimberly Akimbo</em>? That concern inevitably accompanied the announcement of the show’s well-deserved transfer to Broadway. Those of us who saw the intimate Atlantic Theatre production a year ago became instant loyalists, reluctant to see this exquisite, peculiar work pumped up for the masses.</p>\n<p>Good news: Everything is bigger and brighter, and lands even better. It’s still a tender, hilarious character study, but playwright David Lindsay-Abaire (the book is based on his 2001 play), composer Jeanine Tesori (<em>Fun Home </em>and more), and director Jessica Stone have tinkered with it cleverly to broaden its appeal.</p>\n<p>Playing the title role in the Atlantic premiere, Victoria Clark came across as rather subdued and depressed – understandably! At sixty-three, she’s charged with portraying a sixteen-year old afflicted with a super-rare condition which has aged her in quadruple time, with a concomitantly accelerated life expectancy. Kimberly’s prognosis means that she looks seventyish and will likely die within the coming year – her first at a new high school, as it happens. Her family had to switch New Jersey towns (yes, that much maligned state is in for a comic drubbing in the opening number) after some kind of fracas, vaguely hinted at, went down in the old one.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/11/10/kimberly-akimbo-the-sweet-musical-treat-we-need-right-now/\"><em>Read Bob Verini’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Whatever! This new kid in school is shy, to be sure, but not as socially awkward as some of her contemporaries (a relative term here). Kimberly finds friends among some fellow dweebs, four of whom are engaged in a teen version of the forest scene in <em>Midsummer Night’s Dream: </em>they comprise a full circle of crushes, each unrequited, for reasons hilariously obvious to us onlookers.</p>\n<p>Kimberly finds herself drawn to the ultimate outsider: Seth (Justin Cooley), a sweet, sincere, tuba-playing, Elvish-speaking devotee of the “puzzleistic arts” who bestows on her the anagrammatic nickname of the title. “I like how you see the world,” she muses, as he laboriously pretzels the letters of her name. &#8220;I like your point of view. A little sly. A little strange. A little bit askew.” Puppyish, filterless (“I thought you were a new lunch lady,” he confesses), Seth courts Kimberly as a potential project partner, proposing that they co-create a presentation about her disease.</p>\n<p>Awkward! Kimberly abreacts at first, but the assignment – plus the growing circle of friends that comes with it – gradually emboldens her to address the rampant dysfunction that infects her home life.</p>\n<p>Kimberly’s father is a beer-chugging alcoholic – never the most promising option for a “comic” role, but Steven Boyer carries it off splendidly, exhibiting just enough of Buddy’s well-intentioned protectiveness (and guilt) to offset the character’s paternal shortcomings.</p>\n<p>Kimberly’s mom is a nightmare – which is to say, a comic motherlode. A flaming narcissist of the hypochondriacal variety, Pattie (Alli Mauzey, blithely offhanded) sports vanity casts on both forearms – to which she manages to add a leg brace. Oh, and she’s very very pregnant. “Kim’s fine,” she insists, ever determined to pull focus. “<em>I’m </em>the the one with problems.” Attendant benefits include the power to wreak untold psychological damage.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there’s a savior of sorts lurking in the wings, or rather, peeking in the window. That’s Kimberly’s larcenous Aunt Debra (ebullient Bonnie Milligan), intent on launching her latest scam from the family basement. “It’s a great opportunity … only a little illegal,” she reassures her reluctant niece. Having spotted the clueless lambs in Kimberly’s circle at school, Debra even has a crew in mind. The kids’ motivation? Show choir outfits don’t come cheap.</p>\n<p>Anyone who saw the initial production probably spent the past year fervently praying that Lindsay-Abaire and Tesori might manage to interpolate a few more solos for Milligan, beyond the show-stopping “Better” (“When opportunity knocks, when possibility calls … you gotta take the reins, break the rules, so you can make your shitty life better!”). As “Belting Bonnie” proved in 2018’s short-lived <em>Head over Heels</em>, Milligan can rock the rafters. I perked up at the Act 2 opener – “How to Wash a Check,” a Rube Goldbergian assembly-line number – but it proves a bit of a fakeout.</p>\n<p>On the plus side: With all the roles judiciously distributed, everyone gets to shine. That Clark sings exquisitely is a given – and if a operatic tone sometimes sneaks into her teenage angst, it comes across like a hint of her senility breaking through. ￼Cooley, now all of eighteen, has grown into and deepened his role. Seth’s lament “The Good Kid” (capped off by a tuba blat) speaks for all the young strivers unheralded at home – a category in which Kimberly also deserves a gold star.</p>\n<p>The second act gets darker, in counterpoint to Kimberly’s growing self-confidence. Treated by her family as if, as a goner, she’s practically out of the picture, she starts to stand up for herself. In what little time is left, she gets proactive on her own behalf. There’s a still, quiet moment toward the play’s end when Kimberly gazes out toward the audience, caught up in some delicious imagining. It’s a look of pure bliss. The whole theatre falls silent: we’re transfixed.</p>\n<p>Is the takeaway message that petty crime pays? It certainly does here. Everyone involved in the show deserves credit for pulling off a delicate balancing act between raucous comedy and staggering pathos. Its many pleasures aside, <em>Kimberly Akimbo </em>helps to advance a new vision of what musicals can be. Abandoning the trite and formulaic, the creators and cast have brought to life a narrative that’s resplendently unique yet capable of striking a universal chord – while sparking the laughter that we all need to get by.</p>\n<p><b>Kimberly Akimbo </b><strong>opened November 10, 2022, at the Booth Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hey, musical chroniclers, here’s this week’s tuner based on – as the now decades-long dictum claims must be – a successful (or successful enough) book, film or play.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s <em>Almost Famous</em>, adapted from the 2000 movie of the same name, written and directed by Cameron Crowe and the recipient of many Oscar and Golden Globe commendations ($47-plus million at the box office, not to be sniffed at).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the transfer, Crowe wrangled the book and lyrics with busy-busy Tom Kitt, who’s supplied lyrics and music, returning from last season’s less than incandescent <em>Flying Over Sunset</em> and <em>The Visitor</em>, yet another movie-plucked item.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/11/03/almost-famous-almost-fabulous-but-flawed/\"><em>Read Sandy MacDonald’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fans of <em>Almost Famous</em> likely recall Crowe’s tale of 15-year-old wannabe journalist and rock fan William Miller receiving a surprising 3,000-word <em>Rolling Stone </em>assignment to follow climbing 1973 metal band Stillwater on a cross-country tour from San Diego to New York City. (The story is somewhat autobiographical, Crowe having been a <em>Rolling Stone </em>contributor at an early age.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fired up, Miller (likable newcomer Casey Likes) leaves behind his severely dubious teacher-mother Elaine (Anika Larsen) and his impending graduation to confront possible corruption (drugs!) by the band members, who, as with most rock band members, are forever on the verge of breaking up.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mentored by real-life figure, rock journal <em>Creem</em>’s much-lauded leading light, Lester Bangs (Rob Colletti, wearing Bangs’ favored “Detroit Sucks” T-shirt), the inordinately naïve William gets caught up with aging groupie Penny Lane (Solea Pfeiffer) and her heartthrob, Stillwater’s master guitarist and married Russell Hammond (Chris Wood).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also on hand and often much too hand-sy are the groupies nicknamed Band-Aid, Sapphire (Katie Ladner), Estrella (Julia Cassandra), and Polexia (Jana Djenne Jackson). <em>Rolling Stone</em>’s real-life Ben Fong-Torres (Matthew C. Yee) puts in a couple showings. (The zine’s Jann Wenner does warrant a mention.)</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any musical maven would have good reason to think something like <em>Almost Famous</em>, which deals with musicians, would be a prime contender for hot-hot musicalization. It may be, but this reworking doesn’t substantiate the promise.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The change in spitfire English director Jeremy Herrin’s production isn’t immediately easy to explain. It appears, however, that the addition of songs (and, often, only parts of Metallica-like outbursts) precludes characters’ full dimensions. As the 29 – count ‘em, 29 – numbers accumulate, it becomes more a question of whom <em>Almost Famous</em> is following.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where’s the focus? Though William, Penny, and Russell do interact (and other figures have their moments), it feels as if the three are skimped, stranded in their own situations. Does William really learn anything on his literal and psychological journey? He and his nagging mom may achieve something of a happy ending, but have they earned it? What’s Penny’s background? Shouldn’t there be more known about Russell?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is an even larger drawback. While top-notch Broadway creators like scenic designer Derek McLane, costumer David Zinn, lighting designer Natasha Katz, and lighting designer Peter Hylenski wage their level-best, the score is not up to par – certainly nowhere near surpassing par.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writer-director Crowe lacks inspiration as a lyricist. Less helpful are Kitt’s melodies. (Hard to know, of course, on which lyrics he and Crowe collaborated.) The composer is building up an impressive Broadway resumé, <em>Next to Normal</em> perhaps his best success so far. But is he contacted and contracted so regularly because he’s sufficiently come through previously?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A couple of insertions stand-out, none of them numbers for the feuding Stillwater four. Those are pastiches, several times begun only to be curtailed partway along. Kitt’s best are Penny’s ballad “Morocco” and another for William, “No Friends.” That one somewhat bafflingly contains a lyric about the singer’s being expected to have, well, no friends. Huh? Beautiful as the melody is, the negative sentiment (Kitt’s? Crowe’s? both?) works against its manifest beauty.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The score’s drawbacks are compounded by a bigger red flag: presentations, mentions and allusions to inspired songs from the rock ‘n’ roll, songbook. The most outstanding is the Elton John-Bernie Taupin “Tiny Dancer,” which Crowe slotted into his film. He uses it here to close the first act. Why William sings it isn’t clear, unless it&#8217;s placed where it is solely because it’s supremely sure-fire.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there’s the character Penny Lane, whose moniker (she was born Lady Goodman), instantly conjures Paul McCartney’s charming Liverpool neighborhood reminiscence. Not only that, but this Penny Lane declares that her favorite song is Joni Mitchell’s mesmerizingly melancholy “River.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counting on its effect, Crowe has her sing “River” snippets when, late in her downward spiral, she’s Quaaluded out on Sapphire’s leave-behinds. A mistake. “River” devotees would rather hear more of Mitchell and less of what’s surrounded it. There also are a few measures of Stevie Wonder’s “Higher Ground,” another tease of something unforgettable.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It needs to be said that as the established songs of tunesmithing brilliance and others moderately serviceable emerge, they’re sung by a cast of first-rate rock belters, led by the likes of Likes, Pfeiffer, and Wood. Patrons are advised not to leave before the curtain-call finale, when each of the gifted ensemble barrels forward to show his or her sizzling stuff.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Penny Lane” is not delivered entirely or partially. So, McCartney’s memorable lyric isn’t heard about the Penny Lane nurse who “though she feels as if she’s in a play, she is anyway.” Crowe’s Penny Lane is in a play, a musical —and not an especially powerful one, at that.</span></p>\n<p><strong><b>Almost Famous </b>opened November 3, 2022, at the Bernard B Jacobs Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Let’s face it: We musical theatre fans are groupies – no disrespect in that designation. We go to see new shows hoping to witness favored performers as they outdo themselves yet again, and also to scout out up-and-comers, whom we’ll then follow just as assiduously.</p>\n<p>Theatre-goers who favor musicals derived from popular movies constitute a subspecies. If one may generalize, they want a product that cleaves pretty closely to the source material, ideally with some original songs and witty dialogue thrown in. Novel twists to the plot? Not so much. Thus, for those of us who attend shows hoping to be ushered through challenging, uncharted situations, these reenactments can be a bit of a bore.</p>\n<p>London-based director Jeremy Herrin does his utmost to pep up this musicalized revenant of the hit 2000 movie. Cameron Crowe, the original author/protagonist (it’s based on his own teenage quest) wrote the book and co-crafted the lyrics with composer Tom Kitt (<em>Next to Normal</em>). They’ve worked in a few amusing allusions to the limitations of pre-internet communications, so there’s that, in terms of novelty. Kudos are also due the skilled contributors who concretize the narrative in 3D: clever, adaptable set by Derek McLane, period (1973) costumes by David Zinn, evocative lighting by Natasha Katz (that thunderstorm!), just-short-of-deafening sound by Peter Hylenski.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/11/03/almost-famous-cameron-crowe-almost-tunes-up-his-2000-hit-flick/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Two Broadway newbies assume the leads. Casey Likes is absolute perfection as “William Miller,” the Crowe-inspired babe-in-the-rock-world-woods. He exudes youthful energy, channeling it into a powerful voice capable of every coloration. In contrast, the casting of Solea Pfeiffer as the community muse (and more) Penny Lane, simply mystifies me. Perhaps Pfeiffer will grow into the role, but on press night the charisma that should infuse the role was nowhere to be found. She’s a competent singer, but as yet that’s as far as it goes. Also, hair designers Campbell Young Associates have done her no favor with an inert mop of long, dirty-looking, mud-brown curls – a look not much prized in the early ’70s. This alpha groupie needs to exude intrinsic, indisputable glamour. Also missing is any sense of the exceptional good-heartedness that supposedly underlies Penny Lane’s allure.</p>\n<p>About that word, <em>groupie. </em>The trio of “Band-Aids” who look up to Lane as their leader, repeatedly protest that they’re in it purely out of love for the music, and not for the shared limelight or – let’s be more honest than they – prestige sex. They do, however, pair off with members of the band – the fictitious “Stillwater” – at every opportunity. They also conspire to initiate William, as a group. William is fifteen – a vulnerable minor, from our evolving modern perspective. The backslaps he earns are also discomfiting.</p>\n<p>All but buried, when it’s a key turning point, is a scene in which the musicians, about to leave town, hand over rights to their bedmates to an incoming band, to settle a gambling debt. This is evidently a major eye-opener for William, but it’s quickly passed over – lost in the shuffle.</p>\n<p>Chris Wood, as the band’s lead singer, skews James Taylorish, in voice and manner as well as looks, but he makes an interesting foil for the band’s egomaniacal lead singer (Drew Gehling, lithe and hilarious). Rob Coletti puts in intermittent appearances as William’s grudging long-distance mentor, Lester Bangs: he nails every withering line.</p>\n<p>As for Anika Larsen as William’s super-strict mother? She’s a professor: she may be old-school, but she’s not dumb. Every appearance leaves one wanting more. Mrs. Miller, the Musical? It’s a thought.</p>\n<div><strong><b>Almost Famous </b>opened November 3, 2022, at the Bernard B Jacobs Theatre.

Photo: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Last year, a dear friend who especially enjoys actor autobiographies gifted me <em>Walking With Ghosts</em>, Gabriel Byrne’s 2021 memoir. It’s a gorgeous, poetic book, garrulous and disarming, visually evocative, and, in the grand tradition of Irish storytelling, as funny as it is wise. I read it on a cross-country flight, and finished long before my plane touched down.</p>\n<p>So it’s not at all surprising that Byrne, a performer with stage presence to spare, would choose to adapt <em>Ghosts</em> into a one-man show, taking it first to his hometown of Dublin, then to Edinburgh and the West End, and now to Broadway for a limited run.</p>\n<p>The actor makes precious few Broadway appearances, which makes <em>Walking With Ghosts</em> event-worthy in itself. And it’s a joy to see him as himself—rather than as, say, a hard-drinking Eugene O’Neill anti-hero. (In 2016, he appeared opposite Jessica Lange in <em>A Long Day’s Journey Into Night</em>; in 2000, he starred in <em>A Moon for the Misbegotten</em> and in 2005, <em>A Touch of the Poet</em>.)</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/10/27/walking-with-ghosts-gabriel-byrne-goes-down-a-dark-memory-lane/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>With his tousled gray-flecked hair, dressed neatly in a jacket, shirt, and sweater vest in cool, complementary shades of blue, Byrne effortlessly charms the audience with tales of wax-like nuns, uncharitable Christian Brothers, and an indulgent granny who fed him forbidden cornflakes and introduced him to the joys of the cinema.</p>\n<p>Yet every engaging, dramatic moment brings many more equally lackluster stretches. For example, Byrne’s description of the all-you-can-eat, all-you-can-play, carnival-style Bicentennial at the Guinness Brewery (where his father made wooden barrels) is so joyous and evocative that we can practically taste the cotton candy and licorice cigarettes. “The day seemed heaven blessed. How to contain the minutes, the hours, the seconds to make them last forever?” (Sinéad McKenna’s lighting does an expert job amping up the joy and darkening the mood as required.) But that section is bookended by dreary visits with scary eyepatch-wearing Mrs. Gordon—“she looked like a wicked old crone from a fairytale”—and a trip to Dublin department store Clery’s to procure fancy First Communion clothes.</p>\n<p>Those mundanities make for welcome breaks in a 200-page book, but in a two-act, one-person show that runs nearly two and a half hours, they play like dull patches. Obviously, no one’s life is packed with thrilling events—not even an award-winning actor’s—nor are we expecting a nonstop, action-packed autobiographical ride. And Byrne shares many heart-piercing tales of tragedy (a priest/mentor became his abuser when he was a seminary student) and hard-earned triumph—he’s now 24+ years sober: “I had admired artists who were legendary boozers and drug addicts. The hell raisers, as they are known. It’s a long illustrious list. They wanted something impossible from the world. Their souls a battleground, for the angels and the devils,” he explains as he recalls a meeting with Richard Burton. Eventually, he concludes, “I was tired of slashing my own soul, and I was sick of the roaring life.”</p>\n<p>But <em>Walking With Ghosts</em> moves in fits and starts, flickering with imagination before ultimately fading away in a ghostlike haze.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Walking With Ghosts</em> opened Oct. 27, 2022, at the Music Box Theatre and runs through November 20.

Photo credit: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>In case you haven’t noticed, memoirs are all the rage these days. People of all stripes seem to have an overwhelming urge to tell their own stories, whether on the printed page or the stage. And sometimes both, as is the case with actor Gabriel Byrne, who has adapted his 2020 book <em>Walking with Ghosts</em> into a solo autobiographical one-person show now playing on Broadway. It follows in the heels of a previous autobiography, 1994’s <em>Pictures in My Head</em>, and a 2008 documentary, <em>Gabriel Byrne: Stories from Home</em>. Clearly, this is an actor who doesn’t always feel the need to hide behind his characters.</p>\n<p>Of course, it helps if you’re a handsome movie and television star with more than 70 films to your credit, as well as once being labeled by <em>People</em> magazine as one of the “Sexiest Men Alive.” At age 72, Byrne still strikes a dashing figure, speaking in an Irish brogue so soothing and sexy that it should be marketed as an aphrodisiac.</p>\n<p>This is the sort of theatrical memoir for which the term “lyrical” must have been invented. Recounting the story of his early life and only briefly dipping into the sort of show business anecdotes (none of them particularly juicy, alas) for which some gossip-craving theatergoers might be hoping, the piece is so quintessentially Irish that you’ll find yourself craving a Guinness on the way home. Redolent of both James Joyce and Eugene O’Neill, two writers whose work Bryne has performed in his lengthy career, <em>Walking with Ghosts</em> feels far more literary than theatrical.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/10/27/walking-with-ghosts-gabriel-byrnes-book-makes-a-hazy-memory-play/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>That problem becomes apparent from the opening moments of the show, divided into chapters that must have been easily digestible on the page but feel affected here. Byrne begins his tale thusly: “One night, I had this dream. And in the dream it was a summer’s day. I was standing in an orchard, overlooking the streets and the fields of Dublin, where I once lived. Everything shimmered and shone in glorious technicolor. The foaming white of the hawthorn, the purple of the lilac, the fields, green and golden, stretching away to the distant hills. For days afterwards, I couldn’t shake this dream, and on an impulse, I came back. Or should I say, I came home.”</p>\n<p>It would be churlish to say that listening to this sort of poetical description is a chore, especially when delivered in the actor’s mellifluous tones, but a little of it goes a long way. And <em>Walking with Ghosts</em> clocks in at nearly two-and-a-half hours, making the evening feel very long indeed.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t help that the material, as sensitive and heartfelt as it is, too often feels mundane. Byrne tells us about one of his first memories, involving waiting as a child for his father to come home and then imploring him to play his favorite game, “Horsey Horsey.” And so it goes, with tales about his first day of school, his first communion, his first time seeing a dead body, and his suffering at the hands of an abusive schoolteacher. His story about going to the movies for the first time, escorted by his kindly grandmother, is a virtual repeat of a scene from Kenneth Branagh’s similarly autobiographical film <em>Belfast</em>.</p>\n<p>Even a harrowing tale about attending a seminary and being sexually molested by a priest feels tragically familiar, although his description of confronting his abuser many years later provides a poignant grace note.</p>\n<p>The show becomes more entertaining in the second half, when Byrne delivers self-deprecating tales about his early career which began when he joined an amateur acting troupe. Much to his delight, he scored a bit part in a television show, only to nearly derail it when he attempted to embellish his character with a backstory, including a limp. He also provides an interesting, if not terribly illuminating, description of an intimate conversation with his idol, Richard Burton, when they were both soused. Which leads, of course, to a harrowing account of his own ultimately successful years long battle with alcoholism.</p>\n<p>Byrne is such a talented performer, displaying a remarkable talent for mimicry as he embodies the various characters, that he manages to make his tales come alive onstage. But you too often feel the actorly polish which ironically results in a distancing effect from the traumatic incidents being related. It doesn’t help that the staging by Lonny Price is self-consciously theatrical to a fault. The lighting and sound effects call attention to themselves rather than drawing us in; if Byrne describes walking through a revolving door, rest assured that you’ll be treated to the sound of it loudly whooshing.</p>\n<p>As an actor, Byrne tends towards the serious side in his roles (he once even played Satan, in a bad Arnold Schwarzenegger movie). He has the sort of face that makes brooding seem alluring. So it came as a surprise that the most real moment in the soul-baring show involved him comically berating the old television sitcom <em>The Brady Bunch</em>, of all things, complete with a sarcastic imitation of its typically inane dialogue. Byrne, seemingly delighted by his own performance, broke himself up, momentarily alleviating the evening’s torrent of gloomy self-reflection. Or maybe it was just more expert acting.</p>\n<p><strong>Walking with Ghosts opened October 27, 2022, at the Music Box Theatre and runs through November 20.

Photo: Marc J. Franklin</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Reviving a classic the caliber of Suzan-Lork Parks’ <em>Topdog/Underdog, </em>which deserved and won a Pulitzer Prize in 2001, is a bit like a high-stakes version of three-card monte. There are so many ways that the contributing elements, no matter how distinguished the contributors, could surface to throw the game. In this production, every single aspect turns up a winner.</p>\n<p>Parks’ script is deracinated by design. There are no particulars as to place or time, beyond ”Here” and “Now.” A thirtyish pair of brothers – Lincoln (Corey Hawkins) and Booth (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), supposedly named by their father as a sick joke – are living on the sharp edge of poverty. Set designer Arnulfo Maldonado has placed them in a cramped, unpleasant room, surrounded by cascades of satin stage curtains &#8212; as if to suggest that, although there is luxury to be found all around these two, it has not and will not ever fall into their hands.</p>\n<p>As the curtain rises (only in part), we encounter Booth practicing three-card monte moves. He’s got the patter, the attitude, but there’s something lacking. Though not clumsy, he doesn’t entrance. It’s not until minutes before the final curtain that we’ll see his elder, Lincoln, ace these moves.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/10/20/topdog-underdog-watch-it-close-watch-it-close-now/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em> ★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Lincoln, snapping out of an incremental alcoholic stupor, is hypnotic, a master, but – spooked off the street game by a casualty involving an accomplice – he has sworn off using his skill: “I don’t touch thuh cards no more,” he keeps telling 3-Card (Booth’s newly chosen, aspirational name).</p>\n<p>Sibling rivalry starts ratcheting up from the get-go, even if the brothers have their moments of mutual appreciation – when, for instance, Booth boosts fancy suits for the both of them, the better to impress the ladies. (Costume designer Dede Ayite gets credit for the fly styling.) Looking slick, Booth heads out in search of the “amazing” Grace, his intended (also, more realistically, his disdainful ex). With no one to court, and no money to devote to the chase, Lincoln strips down again, to practice the skill that is supporting both men. Lincoln plays Abe Lincoln (in whiteface) at a local arcade, where fun-seekers pay to “assassinate” him. Good luck trying to imagine a more humiliating trade – but it gets worse. His employers have been hinting that they might replace him with a wax dummy. Lincoln, the real live one, figures he’d better work on his death-throe theatrics.</p>\n<p>Peppered throughout the brothers’ cramped cohabitation, necessitated by Lincoln’s poor pay (despite a strong work ethic) and Booth’s contempt for work (he feels owed), are allusions to long-ago family traumas. These stories could be fabricated – the brothers do seem determined to outdo each another with shockers – but they could just as easily be true. We’re given to believe that they probably are.</p>\n<p>The new stars have huge shoes to fill.  The 2001 premiere, directed by George C. Wolfe, starred Jeffrey Wright and Don Cheadle (replaced by Mos Def when the play transferred from the Public to Broadway). Though I didn’t see that production, to my enduring regret, I can’t imagine a better pairing than the current one, under Kenny Leon’s deft direction. The actors even achieve a striking physical transformation in the course of the play. The one-upmanship that the brothers practice ranges from subtle to overt. As their fortunes start to reverse in counterpoint, it appears as if they’re gradually exchanging life forces. Booth starts to look haggard, as Link acquires a youthful clarity and purposefulness.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take a Chekhovian scholar to observe that a gun has been onstage, at the ready and frequently referred to, throughout both acts. I won’t spoil the ending, except to say that it elicited a piercing collective scream on press night. You’ll need to be there yourself, on the edge of your seat, to feel the full impact.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Topdog/Underdog</em></strong><strong> opened Oct. 20, 2022, at the Golden Theatre, and runs through Jan. 15, 2023.

Photo: Marc J. Franklin</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>It’s Cain versus Abel, brother versus brother, nature versus nurture, dealer versus mark in Suzan-Lori Parks’ power punch of a play <em>Topdog/Underdog</em>, now receiving a formidable revival 20 years after its Broadway premiere and Pulitzer Prize win.</p>\n<p>Did Parks’ modern-day Greek tragedy always reach out and grab the audience like Kenny Leon’s production—starring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (an Emmy winner for HBO’s <em>Watchmen</em>) and Corey Hawkins (<em>Six Degrees of Separation</em> on Broadway, <em>In the Heights</em> on screen)—does today? The choice of the Golden, one of the smallest Broadway houses with only 800 or so seats, certainly helps. (Two decades ago, the play did get lost in the much larger Ambassador, though it certainly felt at home in its off-Broadway premiere at the Public Theater.) And Arnulfo Maldonado brings all the walls in closer with his wonderfully grotty set, a single run-down room that can barely contain these two grown men let alone their outsize personalities.</p>\n<p>Abdul-Mateen and Hawkins play, respectively, brothers named Booth and Lincoln. (The names were apparently their father’s idea of a joke.) They were dealt a bad hand: Their parents deserted them when they were teenagers, leaving them each with $500 cash (their “inheritance,” as the siblings call it). Booth now decides that Three-card Monte is his true calling; he even declares that he’s changing his name to 3-Card.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/10/20/topdog-underdog-keep-your-eye-on-the-winner-but-which/\"><em>Read Sandy MacDonald’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Booth—sorry, 3-Card!—lacks the gift for the game. When he throws the cards, he knows the talk: “Watch me close watch me close now: who-see-thuh-red-card-who-see-thuh-red-card? I-see-thuh-red-card. Thuh-red-card-is-thuh-winner. Pick-thuh-red-card-you-pick-uh-winner. Pick-uh-black-card-you-pick-uh-loser.” But he pauses and stumbles, working clumsily, knocking a card out of place here and there. He’s like a dancer who keeps looking at his feet. Lincoln, meanwhile, moves his hands with an almost balletic grace. You can’t learn that level of skill; you’re born with it. “Lean in close and watch me now…” he whispers. You can practically feel the entire theater lean in to watch an artist at work.</p>\n<p>Not that Booth—3-Card!—doesn’t have skills: He is a master shoplifter. Suits, sneakers, belts, ties, crystal, champagne, even a folding room screen. How the heck did he get out of the store with <em>that</em>? That is impressive. But it’s not a living. And that’s why Booth—3-Card wants to team up with his big bro: “You would throw the cards and I’d be yr Stickman. The one in the crowd who looks like just an innocent passerby, who looks like just another player.… I’d be the one who brings in the crowd, I’d be the one who makes them want to put they money down, you do yr moves and I do mines.”</p>\n<p>But Lincoln gave up that hustle long ago, and he’s reluctant to leave his job playing Honest Abe at an arcade. It’s easy work, and so what if he has to wear whiteface and pretend to get assassinated over and over every day? His younger brother is not only unimpressed by the gig, but he’s also creeped out by the costume: “I dont like you wearing that bullshit, that shit that bull that disguise that getup that motherdisfuckinguise anywhere in the vicinity of my humble abode.”</p>\n<p>The Lincoln-Booth implications might seem too heavy-handed, or the ending too obvious from the start; if you know anything about our 16th president, you know what’s going to happen. The gun that pops up in the opening scene gives you a pretty good clue as well. Yet the dialogue between the two men positively crackles throughout, and the interplay between Abdul-Mateen and Hawkins—both edgy, raw, hilarious, and real—is razor-sharp. And while it’s clear which is the Topdog and which is the Underdog, you’ll note that they do subtly swap roles throughout the evening. Side note: Is <em>Topdog/Underdog</em> Parks’ best play? Arguably yes. Some might say her wrenching 1996 drama <em>Venus</em>, though I’d pick 2014’s Civil War–set epic <em>Father Comes Home From the Wars (Parts 1, 2 &amp; 3)</em>.</p>\n<p>The production could move a bit quicker. But at least there’s terrific transitional music to cover a couple curiously long scene breaks. Props to sound designer Justin Ellington: All the music in the show is sensational—Nipsey Hussle’s “Grinding All My Life” is an especially good selection—and the pre-show soundtrack is full of bangers. For those of us who love these things, there’s even a curated playlist on Spotify.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Topdog/Underdog</em></strong><strong> opened Oct. 20, 2022, at the Golden Theatre, and runs through Jan. 15, 2023.

Jackson and John David Washington in The Piano Lesson. Photo credit: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The past literally comes back to haunt the characters in Wilson’s Pulitzer-Prize winning drama <em>The Piano Lesson</em>, concerning the lingering emotional scars of slavery on a Pittsburgh family in the 1930s. While the ghost of a white slaveowner figures prominently in the storyline, it’s the majestic piano sitting in the family’s living room that dominates the proceedings. Featuring intricate wooden carvings of the slaves for whom it was once traded, the musical instrument evokes a history of bloody cruelty. The play is now receiving a powerful if imperfect Broadway revival featuring a stellar cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Danielle Brooks, and John David Washington as Boy Willie, the role that Jackson originated in the original Yale Rep production.</p>\n<p>The action, set in 1936, begins with the arrival of sharecropper Boy Willie (Washington, in the role originated by Jackson in the 1987 Yale Rep production) to the Pittsburgh home of Willie’s uncle, Doaker (Jackson). Willie co-owns the piano with his widowed sister Berniece (Danielle Brooks, <em>The Color</em> <em>Purple</em>), who lives there with her 11-year-old daughter (Jurnee Swan). He demands to take the piano and sell it, hoping to use the proceeds to buy the land on which their grandfather previously worked as a slave. Berniece, however, has no interest in dispensing with a vital family heirloom despite its ugly associations.</p>\n<p>“If Berniece doesn’t want to sell the piano, I’m gonna cut it in half and sell my half!” Boy Willie tells his uncle, who respects his niece’s wishes.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/10/13/the-piano-lesson-a-starry-but-off-key-rendition/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em> ★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Boy Willie has returned to his family home from the Deep South, accompanied by his friend Lymon (Ray Fisher), a wide-eyed country boy eager to meet a beautiful city girl. They’ve arrived with a truckload of watermelons to sell, after which Willie intends to get rid of the piano, which stubbornly refuses to be lifted by the two men.</p>\n<p>Whether or not to preserve the legacy of the past, however horrific, is the compelling theme of this elemental drama which showcases Wilson’s prodigious gifts for poetical dialogue and richly drawn characterizations. It’s filled with emotionally resonant moments, the quieter of which are the best rendered in this production. Perhaps the highlight is the scene in which the eager Lymon, newly clad in a resplendent if far too small silk suit and fancy shoes that he’s purchased from Doaker’s comically blustery brother Wining Boy (Michael Potts, terrific), nearly manages to break down Berniece’s emotional defenses by gifting her with a bottle of fancy perfume. Brooks and Fisher play the delicate scene perfectly, thoroughly winning over the audience which practically swoons.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the production falters in its more explosive moments, with Washington, apparently making his stage acting debut, maintaining such a high energy and decibel level throughout that his unmodulated performance becomes monotonous. Boy Willie is supposed to be the volcanic center of the drama, but here he comes across as more irritating than a force of nature.</p>\n<p>As if to compensate, his co-stars underplay to perfection. Jackson, not always known for subtlety, keeps himself thoroughly reined-in, and only seems more authoritative as a result. Fisher practically steals the show with his amusingly naïve Lymon, garnering big laughs in the scene when he first tries on that ill-fitting suit and too-small shoes. Brooks is similarly restrained, conveying her character’s decency and self-determination with an utter lack of histrionics. Trai Byers and April Matthis make strong impressions as Berniece’s preacher suitor and a woman Boy Willie brings home for an assignation.</p>\n<p>Richardson, an extremely talented actress here making her directorial debut, reveals her inexperience in the revival’s pacing issues and an overreliance on spooky sound and lighting effects and projections that threaten to become silly, especially in the show’s climactic moments. More effective is Beowulf Boritt’s two-level set, which literally depicts the schisms of the household, and the elaborately carved piano, practically a character itself.</p>\n<p>The production still manages to be highly effective, thanks to the brilliance of Wilson’s writing and the many first-rate performances. But the revival’s unevenness makes it pale in comparison to the 1990 original Broadway production and the superb revival staged by Off-Broadway’s Signature Theatre Company a decade ago.</p>\n<div><strong>The Piano Lesson opened October 13, 2022, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre and runs through January 15, 2023.

Jackson in The Piano Lesson. Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The heart and soul and hurt of the Pulitzer Prize–winning <em>The Piano Lesson</em>—which just opened on Broadway in an ambitious but discordant new revival—can be found in one long and winding story toward the end of Act 1. Even if you’ve seen August Wilson’s play, or know the tale of the intricately carved instrument on which essentially the entire piece rests, hearing it inevitably leaves you emotionally bruised and battered.</p>\n<p>The piano now sits in the Pittsburgh home of de facto family patriarch Doaker Charles (Samuel L. Jackson), who lives with his niece, Berniece (<em>The Color Purple</em>’s Danielle Brooks, magnificent), and her 11-year-old daughter, Maretha (Jurnee Swan or Nadia Daniel). Technically it belonged to the Sutter family—because years and years ago, so did the Charleses. Robert Sutter wanted to buy his wife, Miss Ophelia, a wedding gift. “He ain’t had no money. But he had some niggers,” explains Doaker. Sutter traded “one full grown and one half grown,” Doaker’s grandmother, also named Berniece, and his father, age 9, for the piano, and his wife was thrilled. Until she started missing her servants. When Miss Ophelia took sick, Sutter summoned Doaker’s master woodworker grandfather, Willie Boy, and asked him to carve the slaves’ images onto the piano. He did all that and more, carving generations of the family’s history onto that wooden upright: Berniece; their son, Doaker’s father; his own parents, Mama Esther and Boy Charles; births, deaths, marriages, arrivals, departures…Sutter wasn’t pleased, but Miss Ophelia was. As Doaker says, “Now she had her piano and her niggers too.”</p>\n<p>After emancipation, the piano became an obsession for Doaker’s brother Boy Charles. “Say it was the story of our whole family and as long as Sutter had it…he had us. Say we was still in slavery,” he reasons. So Doaker and his brother Wining Boy (a scene-stealing Michael Potts, recently seen in the Netflix <em>Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom</em>) liberated it from Sutter’s house on Independence Day, 1911. As for Boy Charles, he was burned to death in a train boxcar.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/10/13/the-piano-lesson-a-star-studded-revival-of-august-wilsons-pulitzer-prize-winning-drama/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>It’s a shattering story, and Jackson—who has decades of history with <em>The Piano Lesson</em> (he played Boy Willie in the 1987 premiere at Yale Rep)—elevates it to something of a sermon. We’re completely rapt, and by the end, we see the piano for what it really is: the embodiment of three generations of family history, and the physical representation of their slave narrative.</p>\n<p>The history of the piano is also a slow-burning but still-intense moment of what has up until then been a slightly frenetic production. It starts, really, with the first scene, when Berniece’s brother, Boy Willie (John David Washington), bursts in at 5 a.m. He’s just arrived from down South with his pal Lymon (Ray Fisher) and a truckload of watermelons to sell. But his real motive is selling the piano to buy some farmland—and not just any land, but the Sutter land that the Charles family worked, first as slaves and then as sharecroppers. “Berniece ain’t gonna sell that piano,” his uncle Doaker tells him repeatedly. But Boy Willie is not hearing it. The blood that was shed for that piano? “All that’s in the past,” he sniffs. Berniece won’t play it, but she certainly won’t part with it: “Money can’t buy what that piano cost,” she says.</p>\n<p>Boy Willie is, by definition, insolent and impetuous, and Washington—so captivating as an undercover cop in Spike Lee’s Oscar-winning drama <em>BlacKkKlansman</em>—captures both with ease, and has presence to spare. Unfortunately, he’s also pretty much at full volume, and full speed, from the jump. To be fair, Charles S. Dutton’s performance at Yale Rep and on Broadway received some of the same criticism—too big, too loud, too fast. And if Boy Willie didn’t drive at 55 mph, the play could easily be 20 minutes longer. That’s how massive the part is. One suspects, however, that Washington will be dynamite in the Netflix <em>Piano Lesson</em> adaptation.</p>\n<p>And then there’s the matter of the ghost, which seems to have arrived along with Boy Willie and has a hold on the piano. Wilson worked supernatural references or elements into many of his 10 Century Cycle plays (think of the 300-plus–year–old conjurer/visionary Aunt Ester), but only the 1910s-set <em>Joe Turner’s Come and Gone</em> and the 1930s-set <em>Piano Lesson</em> require actual onstage apparitions. Without giving too much away: Director LaTanya Richardson Jackson—who actually was featured in the very fine 2009 Broadway revival of <em>Joe Turner</em>—favors a more literal manifestation. Unfortunately, what should be a very powerful moment between Berniece and the piano ultimately gets overshadowed. Exorcisms are tricky business; that’s always confounded even the most ardent admirers of the play.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Piano Lesson</em> opened Oct. 13, 2022, at the Barrymore Theatre and runs through Jan. 15, 2023.

Photo credit: Joan Marcus.</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Watching the new Broadway revival of <em>Death of a Salesman</em> is like witnessing a battle to the death between Arthur Miller’s enduring classic and the directorial conceits constantly threatening to undermine it. By the end of the overlong evening, <em>Salesman</em> has thankfully won out, as it almost always does. But just barely.</p>\n<p>That’s due to both the brilliance of this great American drama and the powerful lead performances by Wendell Pierce (<em>The Wire</em>) and Sharon D Clarke (<em>Caroline, or Change</em>), who also starred as Willy and Linda Loman in this production’s London incarnation. Thanks to their sterling work, the play’s deeply felt humanism still manages to shine through brightly.</p>\n<p>It’s touch and go, however, since director Miranda Cromwell (who co-directed in London with Marianne Elliott) seems intent on imposing theatrical stylizations that call more attention to her contributions than the text. This starts from the very beginning, when a musician strumming a guitar strolls onstage to accompany several of the actors singing. In the climactic scene set at Willy Loman’s grave, Linda and Biff (Khris Davis) break out into a gospel song, accompanied by the sounds of a choir. At other points in the show, Willy sings a jaunty blues number, and his brother Ben, seen in Willy’s hallucinations, launches into a rendition of the Gershwins’ “They Can’t Take That Away from Me.” It’s enough to make you think you’re watching <em>Death</em> <em>of a Salesman: The Musical</em>.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/10/09/death-of-a-salesman-wendell-pierce-and-sharon-d-clarke-bring-classic-to-broadway/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>All of these additions, and more, make the already lengthy play feel even longer. Adding insult to injury, the production utilizes enough nightmarish lighting and sound effects to service a Halloween haunted house attraction. And during the flashback scenes, the actors repeatedly freeze in place as we hear the sounds of cameras clicking. (I don’t know about you, but my memories aren’t filled with paparazzi).</p>\n<p>Then there’s the depiction of Ben, Willy’s older brother who supposedly walked into the jungle at age 17 and emerged rich four years later. Andre De Shields has apparently been directed to perform the role as if he’s still playing Hermes in <em>Hadestown</em>. Clad in an all-white suit, sparkly shoes and enough bling on his fingers to make the Kardashians envious, De Shields preens rather than acts and proves thoroughly jarring whenever he’s onstage.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the sensitive matter that the Lomans are all played by Black actors. Nothing wrong with that in this age of color-blind casting, but the fact that most of the other actors are Caucasian adds a subtext that Miller obviously never intended. When Willy asks his boss Howard (Blake DeLong) if he can work at the home office rather than go on the road, the young man humiliates him in a manner far harsher than the way the scene is customarily played, making it hard for us not to think that racial prejudice factors into his hostility. Perfectly credible, but nothing to do with the play as written.</p>\n<p>Everything in the production seems pitched over the top, including Willy’s declining mental condition, which here feels more like full-blown dementia than merely a man defeated by life who is losing his grip. The flashback scene in which Willy is discovered by Biff (Khris Davis) to be in a hotel room with another woman (Lynn Hawley) is bizarrely played for laughs, with the woman loudly cackling in demented fashion. Throughout the evening, the actors frequently shout their lines, as if not trusting us to appreciate the dialogue.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a shame, because Pierce and Clarke deliver tremendous performances that keep us emotionally engaged despite the production’s gimmicks. The former uses his Everyman quality to deliver a Willy who is achingly vulnerable, making us care deeply about him despite his misguided bluster, while the latter brings a fierceness to Linda that makes her despair at her husband’s needless death all the more moving. As Biff and Happy, Davis and McKinley Belcher III are less revelatory, but they nonetheless hit all the right notes, while several of the supporting players make vivid impressions.</p>\n<p>In the hands of great lead actors, such as it is here, <em>Death of a Salesman</em> still proves devastating with its Greek tragedy-like power. That is, if a director knows enough to stay out of its way.</p>\n<p><strong>Death of a Salesman opened October 9, 2022, at the Hudson Theatre and runs through January 15, 2023.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The highlight of my last London theatre trip, in 2019, was the Marianne Elliott/Amanda Cromwell production of Arthur Miller’s <em>Death of a Salesman</em> at the Young Vic. With Wendell Pierce and Sharon D Clarke in the leading roles, this was <a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/07/02/from-london-an-exceptional-death-of-a-salesman-and-a-haunting-hunt/\">a great production of a great play</a>, presenting the playwright’s unchanged words as new, alive, and enhanced for our times.</p>\n<p>The production has now come to Broadway’s Hudson, down the street from where Willy Loman first trundled those heavy sample cases in 1949. American actor Pierce (<em>The Wire</em>, <em>Suits</em>) and the British Clarke (<em>Caroline, or Change</em>) remain on hand, giving substantially the same performances as in those pre-pandemic days. But this <em>Salesman</em> seems not to have weathered the three years so well, losing a substantial slice of effectiveness on its journey from the Thames to the Hudson.</p>\n<p>Co-directors Elliott (<em>War Horse</em>, <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog at Night-Time</em>) and Cromwell (Elliott’s associate director on <em>Angels in America</em> and <em>Company</em>) did not envisage a radical rewrite of Miller. Rather, they retained the author’s time (1949) and place (Brooklyn) but chose to cast the Loman family with actors who are Black. Not a case of color-blind casting, mind you; but one in which this particular family lives and interacts with Willy’s traditionally white neighbors and employer. (In the first Broadway revival of the play, starring George C. Scott back in 1975, the neighbors of the white Lomans were performed by black actors—at the time a racially significant statement by Scott, who also directed.)</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/10/09/death-of-a-salesman-arthur-millers-classic-drama-needlessly-embellished/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Pierce’s performance and this production, mind you, fully support what Miller wrote. There seem to be only a few minor textual changes; the football-playing Biff Loman is angling for a scholarship to UCLA, for example, rather than the then-restricted University of Virginia. But unlike with some recent Broadway productions—such as last season’s <em>Company</em> (from Elliott) and this week’s <em>1776</em>—there is no modernistic tinkering, thank you very much.</p>\n<p>The tragedy of Willy Loman remains. What possible future is there for a protean salesman who has lost his ability to sell, his means of living, his purpose <em>for</em> living? Only the death of the salesman. In Miller’s telling, and in the present production, there is nothing racial about it. Pierce’s Willy Loman, simply put, is Miller’s Willy Loman. One expects that the playwright would enthusiastically recognize this performance, which fully expresses the universality and greatness of his play.</p>\n<p>But this production has undergone a significant sea change on its way across the Atlantic. The two leading players are imported from London, as are the design elements. Much of the overall impact, though, is diminished. The direction is now credited solely to Cromwell, without any mention of the formerly top-billed Elliott. (The pair shared an Olivier Award for the 2019 production.) Whether this is a case of the latter stepping aside to encourage her former assistant or something more pointed is unknown; Elliott’s production company remains one of the lead producers of the enterprise. Let it also be noted that the scenery by Anna Fleischle, of <em>Hangmen</em>, was considerably more striking at the Young Vic than on what seems to be the narrower playing space at the Hudson.</p>\n<p>The present production starts as strongly as before, with Willy (Pierce) trodding home—under the weight of those two iconic suitcases—from his aborted selling trip while Linda (Clarke) desperately tries to rescue him from despair. As the discussion shifts upstairs to the bedroom of the angry Biff (Khris Davis) and the hapless Happy (McKinley Belcher III), the drama’s spell wavers; at least it did for this viewer. Pierce and Clarke are firmly rooted in the play. The two younger actors, though, seem to be acting out of their own experience, far away from the world of their stage parents.</p>\n<p>This becomes even more disruptive issue with other performers, as for example André de Shields. What’s the third leading role in <em>Salesman</em>, anyway? Certainly not Ben, the barely-remembered older brother who wanders through Willy’s challenged memory. Here we have the celebrated de Shields, of <em>Ain’t Misbehavin’</em> and <em>Hadestown</em>. The recent Tony winner sashays through the play with rings on his fingers—eight of them, glistening with phony diamonds—and sequins on his toe shoes. While there is nothing blatantly incorrect in this portrayal, it does not—and perhaps cannot—be the Ben whom Pierce’s Willy sees in his meandering memories. At the Young Vic, the entire exceptional cast seemed of a piece. Here, too many of the actors seem to have been working, with sole director Cromwell, in a different rehearsal room than Pierce and Clarke.</p>\n<p>It is not until late in the three-hour ten-minute evening that this <em>Salesman</em> finally starts to crackle the way the entire performance did in London. Specifically, in the office scene in which Willy—on the final afternoon of his life—encounters neighbor Charley (Delaney Williams) and his lawyer-son Bernard (Stephen Stocking). But that’s an especially long time to wait through otherwise intermittent high spots.</p>\n<p>Great plays—and while the designation of “great” is variable, <em>Death of a Salesman</em> undeniably is just that—are likely to hold up in production, from year to decade to century. Match a great play with great performers and a pitch-perfect production, and you are likely to leave the theatre in wonder at just what the playwright wrought.</p>\n<p>That was the case, for this viewer, with the productions headed by George C. Scott in 1975; Dustin Hoffman in 1984; Brian Dennehy in 1999; Philip Seymour Hoffman in 2012; and most decidedly with Pierce and Clarke at the Old Vic in 2019. But not yesterday at the Hudson, where there is a good though not exceptional production of Miller’s great play on display.</p>\n<p><strong>Death of a Salesman opened October 9, 2022, at the Hudson Theatre and runs through January 15, 2023.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><em>1776</em>, winner of the 1969 Best Musical Tony Award, has returned to Broadway in what might be termed a revival with a difference. It has become common for new productions of old musicals—especially infrequently-revived old musicals with long-deceased authors—to be offered with alterations in tone, material, and sometimes intent. This is often done under the assumption that most viewers won’t know the difference. Not so in the case of this <em>1776</em>, which has been directed by Jeffrey L. Page and Diane Paulus, and imported by the Roundabout from Paulus’s American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge. We are told and specifically requested to keep in mind that—and I quote—“the cast includes multiple representations of race, ethnicity, and gender; they identify as female, transgender and nonbinary.”</p>\n<p>With such an explicit disclaimer, we are faced with not only the usual question (is it any good?) but also: Is the show enhanced—or diminished—by the presumably necessary conceptual alterations? Has this team of creators, in the absence of songwriter Sherman Edwards and bookwriter Peter Stone, successfully implemented such changes? And at base, is this revised <em>1776</em> as effective as the original 1969 production, the 1972 motion picture, the 1997 Broadway revival (produced by the Roundabout), or the production you remember in your high school auditorium?</p>\n<p>The answer, at least from my seat at the American Airlines Theatre, is a distinctly qualified “kind of.”</p>\n<p>The cast of characters consists of 20 signers of the Declaration of Independence; two lower-class support staff; and one mud-besplattered courier trudging in with battlefield dispatches from the unseen General Washington. The only female characters are two future first ladies, Abigail Adams and Martha Jefferson. (Off-topic footnote: A third female role, Prudence the prostitute—who cavorted with Ben Franklin in a New Brunswick whorehouse song-and-dance—was cut during the tryout before the original production reached Broadway. While the actress lost the prospect of her Broadway debut, <em>1776</em> producer Stuart Ostrow soon thereafter produced a new musical written by her young songwriter/husband: <em>Pippin</em>.)</p>\n<p>Under then-prevailing Broadway conditions, these historically based white male roles were written for and in the original production cast with white males. The theatrical world, which is not always at the forefront of enlightenment, has long since discarded such traditional and repressive thinking, at least to some extent. This all-female, transgender, and nonbinary <em>1776</em> goes full-throttle, certainly, and more power to the performers who here receive opportunities (and jobs) for which they prove themselves thoroughly capable. One wonders whether under such a concept, the traditionally female roles of Abigail and Martha might logically have been cast with performers who identify as male; but that’s a question for another day.</p>\n<p>The attractions of this new <em>1776</em> are multiple, mostly in the area of the talent onstage. Any production must rise or fall on the shoulders of the portrayals of John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Ben Franklin, those three Founding Fathers. (A term that, perhaps, should at this point be cashiered?) Crystal Lucas-Perry grabs hold of the stage with Stone’s artful opening monologue: “I have come to the conclusion that one useless man is called a disgrace”—(considerable laughter)—“that two are called a law-firm”—(more laughter)—“and that three or more become a Congress.” Lucas-Perry, who is scheduled to leave this production on October 23, presents the “obnoxious and disliked” Adams with high-octane flair, never letting down.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth A. Davis makes a fine Jefferson, one who, in the exuberant song “He Plays the Violin” does indeed play the violin. (You might remember Davis from the musical <em>Once</em>, in which she fiddled with such ferocity—while playing the small role of the heroine’s friend—that she earned herself a Tony nomination.) This Jefferson, mind you, is in an advanced state of pregnancy. A pointed directorial choice? They have, after all, added to the proceedings a cowering/snarling slave (Sally Hemmings?) lurking around Jefferson’s bedroom; but the pregnancy seems to be more biological than conceptual.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_16194\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-16194\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-16194\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1010-Elizabeth-A.-Davis-Patrena-Murray-Crystal-Lucas-Perry-in-1776.-Photo-by-Joan-Marcus-2022.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1010-Elizabeth-A.-Davis-Patrena-Murray-Crystal-Lucas-Perry-in-1776.-Photo-by-Joan-Marcus-2022.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1010-Elizabeth-A.-Davis-Patrena-Murray-Crystal-Lucas-Perry-in-1776.-Photo-by-Joan-Marcus-2022.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1010-Elizabeth-A.-Davis-Patrena-Murray-Crystal-Lucas-Perry-in-1776.-Photo-by-Joan-Marcus-2022.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1010-Elizabeth-A.-Davis-Patrena-Murray-Crystal-Lucas-Perry-in-1776.-Photo-by-Joan-Marcus-2022.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1010-Elizabeth-A.-Davis-Patrena-Murray-Crystal-Lucas-Perry-in-1776.-Photo-by-Joan-Marcus-2022.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-16194\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Elizabeth A. Davis, Patrena Murray, and Crystal Lucas-Perry in 1776. Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>If Lucas-Perry and Davis ably support this production of <em>1776</em>, you might say that Patrena Murray <em>is</em> Ben Franklin. A pure delight in the role, she would likely fit right into any <em>1776</em> production regardless of the casting conceit. As would Carolee Carmello, as the laceratingly obstructive John Dickinson of Pennsylvania. Carmello appeared in Roundabout’s superior 1997 revival, where she was cast more traditionally as Abigail Adams. While she did characteristically well on that occasion, she seems to be having a helluva lot more fun here. Also standing out are Joanna Glushak, as the rum-quaffing Hopkins of Rhode Island; Sara Porkalob, as the pro-slavery Routledge of South Carolina; Eryn LeCroy, doubling as Martha Jefferson and Dr. Hall of Georgia; and Shawna Hamic, as the rambunctious Richard Henry Lee of Virginia.</p>\n<p>Countering these assets is the staging. Nuance and subtlety have been discarded in favor of a brash, bold, hit-’em-on-the-head presentation. <em>1776</em> was written as a protest musical mixing a strong anti-Vietnam message with a bitter view of then-President Nixon and his administration, the successful implementation of which contributed to the musical’s resounding success. “Momma Look Sharp,” an outspoken folk-tinged pacifist dirge which stands out as a quiet change-of-pace moment in this relatively explosive musical, is here handed over to a stage full of black-cloaked, keening mothers. Effective? Kind of— but more effective than the authors’ image of a lonely corpse lying forgotten in the tall grass in the meadow by the red maple tree?</p>\n<p>The use of a vast montage of up-to-the-minute news footage suggests that the directors feel their audience won’t understand ideas if you don’t show them video. They even incorporate a flag-waving olde-South tableaux featuring “Dixie,” a song that was not written until 80 years after the Revolution. Yes, I suppose, we get the point. And while we certainly agree with sentiments—borrowed from the writings of Abigail Adams—presented in the newly inserted dialogue about the tyranny of men fomenting a rebellion of woman, this comes across as a provocative broadside tacked onto the proceedings but instantly abandoned.</p>\n<p>At the same time, two key elements in the original script are altogether ignored. The authors specifically call for the use of “a large day-by-day wall calendar,” which serves as a constant visible pressure-cooker deadline as the days flash by through June; how will these incessantly bickering men ever agree by Independence Day? Even more crucial is the original ending, calling for the tolling of church bells as the Declaration is signed. The bells, though, turn discordant and deafening as if to suggest that even after achieving independence, all was—and still is—not well in the Land of the Free. In place of which, we get a stage full of singers standing before what look like rum barrels singing “Is Anybody There?” And do we really need that slave auction ballet they have tacked onto the already sufficiently explicit “Molasses to Rum”?</p>\n<p>None of these alterations enhance <em>1776</em>; what’s more, Page and Paulus push the running time, which in 1969 was a shade over two intermissionless hours, closer to three. This is no favor to the material, or the audience either.</p>\n<p><strong>1776 opened October 6, 2022, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through January 8, 2023.

Photo: Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>First, a moment of appreciation and celebration: Two years ago, there wasn’t a blessed thing on Broadway. Now, within a matter of weeks, four Pulitzer Prize–winning plays will mark their opening nights: Martyna Majok’s <em>Cost of Living</em>, August Wilson’s <em>The Piano Lesson</em>, Arthur Miller’s <em>Death of a Salesman</em>, and Suzan-Lori Parks’ <em>Topdog/Underdog</em>. A fifth, Stephen Adly Guirgis’ <em>Between Riverside and Crazy</em>, will arrive on Broadway later this season. In a time when producers are scrambling to think of ways to bring new, younger, and uninitiated audiences to the theater, how encouraging is it that their solution isn’t big, brassy musical revivals or more screen-to-stage adaptations, but rather American plays?</p>\n<p>And these plays aren’t exactly all sunshine and lollipops. Majok’s <em>Cost of Living—</em>which just opened at Manhattan Theatre Club’s Friedman Theatre—is an unadorned, unsympathetic, bleakly and blackly comic portrait of four people struggling to form various kinds of human connection: handsome Princeton grad student John (Gregg Mozgala), who has cerebral palsy, and his bartender-by-night caretaker, Jess (Kara Young, a 2022 Tony nominee for Lynn Nottage’s <em>Clyde’s</em>); whip-smart Ani (the fabulously funny Katy Sullivan), a recent double amputee, and her well-meaning ne’er-do-well ex-hubby, Eddie (David Zayas).</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/10/03/cost-of-living-martyna-majoks-pulitzer-prize-winning-drama-makes-its-broadway-debut/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s</em> ★★★★☆<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The ever-versatile Young, who this summer made a splash as Viola in the Classical Theatre of Harlem’s terrific outdoor <em>Twelfth Night</em>, proves an excellent comic sparring partner for Mozgala, who revels in his character’s caustic wit. (And, it must be said, in his unimpeachable sense of style. That aubergine cashmere sweater!) Both Young and Zayas are new to <em>Cost of Living</em>—Mozgala and Sullivan played their parts in the 2017 MTC off-Broadway production, and in the play’s 2016 premiere at the Williamstown Theatre Festival—yet their roles feel lived-in; there’s a natural, easy, even electric chemistry on display. At one point, Eddie is helping give Ani a bath, and he mimes playing a classical piano piece on her arm. <em>Chemistry</em>.</p>\n<p>Zayas—who you might recognize from Labyrinth Theater Co. productions such as <em>Jesus Hopped the A Train</em>, <em>In Arabia We’d All Be Kings</em>, and <em>Our Lady of 121st Street</em>—has perhaps the toughest role. He’s charged with setting the scene, if you will, with a lengthy speech to start the show: an extended rumination on and reminiscence of Ani. “I’ve done nothin but love the fuck outta this woman for two decades and a year almost.” A blue-collar Bayonne guy in a hipster Brooklyn bar, completely unmoored and swimming in a sense of loss, the former truck driver is drowning his sorrows in seltzer and spilling his proverbial guts to an unseen stranger. “We’re all of us, in motels, on the road to somewhere we ain’t at yet and that makes us feel feelings. Roads are dark and America’s long.” (Note the line of glass liquor bottles on the bar, gleaming like a New York City skyline—a chic, subtle touch by set designer Wilson Chin.) At that moment, we don’t know where the play is going—like Eddie, we’re on the road to somewhere—but he’s pulled us in via Majok’s lyrical, almost magical monologue.</p>\n<p>After that, we’ll follow these beautiful, messy characters just about anywhere…even to a slightly unbelievable head-scratcher of a final scene. But Eddie said it best: “The shit that happens is not to be understood.” I suspect that is what we will remember of <em>Cost of Living</em> 20 years from now. “The shit that happens to you is Not To Be Understood.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cost of Living</em> opened October 3, 2022, at the Friedman Theatre runs through November 6.

Photo Credit: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Martyna Majok’s Pulitzer Prize winning drama has fortunately been given a chance to achieve greater exposure after its limited 2017 run at Off-Broadway’s Manhattan Theatre Club. Currently playing on Broadway in a partially recast version produced by the same organization, <em>Cost of Living</em> has lost none of its emotional power and poignancy. Although dealing largely with the difficulties of two physically disabled characters, this is really a beautifully observed play about the human condition in general.</p>\n<p>The playwright’s bracing lack of sentimentality or political correctness in dealing with her sensitive subject matter is vividly illustrated in an early scene in which a young female caregiver, Jess (Kara Young, recent Tony nominee for <em>Clyde’s</em>) first meets her prospective new employer, an obviously wealthy Princeton graduate student, John (Gregg Mozgala), who is confined to a wheelchair due to cerebral palsy. When she admits that she’s never before worked with the “differently-abled,” John reacts in irritated fashion.</p>\n<p>“Don’t call it that,” he snaps. “It’s fucking retarded.”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/10/03/cost-of-living-worth-the-steep-emotional-investment/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Those characters’ stories are intertwined with those of Eddie (David Zayas, Showtime’s <em>Dexter</em>), an unemployed truck driver who hasn’t been able to work because of a DUI conviction, and his sharp-tongued ex-wife Ani (Katy Sullivan, who won a Theatre World Award for the previous production), a quadriplegic as a result of a car accident. We’re introduced to Eddie in the play’s opening scene, in which he delivers a monologue revealing that Ani has died and that he’s been receiving mysterious text messages apparently sent from her phone.</p>\n<p>That most of the rest of the play consists of flashbacks reveal its lack of structural cohesiveness, no doubt because it was written in stages, expanded from a previously produced one-act. The chronology can be confusing, and the final scene feels a bit tacked-on. But those are minor flaws considering that its dialogue and situations resonate with emotional truth about loneliness, financial desperation and the vulnerability of disabled people forced to rely on others to assist them with basic human needs. The last element is strikingly illustrated in intimate scenes in which Jess bathes John, each revealing no self-consciousness about his nudity, and Eddie attends to <span data-scayt_word=\"Ani\" data-scaytid=\"16\">Ani</span> in the bathtub. The latter episode also provides the play’s most harrowing moment, one that elicits gasps from the audience.</p>\n<p>Under the astute direction of Jo Bonney, the production remains largely the same as it was Off-Broadway. Mozgala, who in real life has a less severe form of cerebral palsy than his character’s, and Sullivan, a bilateral above-the-knee amputee and record-setting Paralympic athlete, superbly repeat their roles, delivering bracing portrayals that never once beg for sympathy. When John reveals himself to be self-absorbedly insensitive to Jess’ feelings and Ani treats her ex-husband with brusque irritation even as he lovingly tends to her, it reminds us that their characters are defined by more than their physical challenges. The two newcomers to the cast are equally affecting; Zayas, who effortlessly projects decency, proves deeply sympathetic as a man who becomes haunted by the loss of everything that was important to him, while the endlessly charismatic Young delivers a live-wire portrayal that mines laughs and pathos in equal measure. Each of these performer’s sterling work should be well remembered at Tony Award time.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost of Living opened October 3, 2022, at Samuel J. Friedman Theatre and runs through November 6.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Tom Stoppard, who started his dramatic excursions in 1966 with a somewhat skewed representation of the royal court of Elsinore and has over the decades traversed the worlds of academia, arcadia, and absurdia, has now examined the undiscovered country of his own hidden heritage. Consider <em>Leopoldstadt</em> Stoppard’s very own and very personal <em>Roots</em> a là Viennese. Given the playwright’s unparalleled knack for devising sturdily dramatic enigmatic conundrums, it is heartening to report that he has once and again outdone himself.</p>\n<p>Stoppard begins his melting-pot tale at the very fin de siècle, just days before the beginning of the last century. “Like the curtain going up on something,” one character enthuses, while the professorial Ludwig Jakobovicz (Brandon Uranowitz) notes that “new centuries just depend on when you start counting.” The extended clan—and it is extended indeed, calling for a stage-filling company of 38, many portraying multiple characters—is nothing if not assimilated. Even so, it is pointed out that no matter how high one of their community might rise—neighborhood contemporaries cited include Freud, Klimt, and the recently-converted Mahler (“another Christian still wet from his baptism)”—ultimately, “he can’t not be a Jew.” Stoppard needn’t add, but does, that “in the end, if it doesn’t catch up on him, it will catch up on his children.” Welcome to the 20th century.</p>\n<p>The action takes place not in Leopoldstadt—a ghettoized neighborhood of Vienna, the name mentioned with derision by these members of the Austrian bourgeoisie—but in a grand manse off the Ringstrasse. It is quite clear from the opening moments, when the <em>kinder </em>top their massive Christmas tree with a star of David, just where this tale is heading. The story culminates a half-century later, by which point survivors are few.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/10/02/leopoldstadt-tom-stoppard-at-his-absolute-autobiographical-best/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The family is so interwoven that you almost need a scorecard to track them. They include matriarch Emilia (Betsy Aidem) and her grown children: Hermann (David Krumholtz), who controls the family business, and Eva (Caissie Levy). Central to the play are Hermann’s Catholic wife Gretl (Faye Castelow) and Eva’s husband Ludwig; you might well consider Ludwig to be the moral center of the group, while Gretl sits on the immoral edge. Also on hand are Ludwig’s sisters, Hannah (Colleen Litchfield) and Wilma (Jenna Augen), and Wilma’s gentile physician-husband Ernst (Aaron Neil).</p>\n<p>Prominent among their collective progeny are Jacob (Seth Numrich), Nellie (Tedra Millan), Hermine (Eden Epstein), and Rosa (Augen); plus, at the play’s searing climax, survivors Leo (Arty Froushan) and Nathan (Uranowitz). Standing out among outsiders are banker Otto (Japhet Balaban) and Brit journalist Percy (Numrich), both of whom marry daughters; the rakish dragoon Fritz (Froushan), who plays two key scenes in the 1900 section; and an antagonistic visitor to the flat who brings destruction to all, listed in the cast simply as Civilian (Corey Brill).</p>\n<p>Clearly, this subject and this play are intensely personal to the playwright: the character Leopold Rosenbaum—who escapes Vienna at the age of 8 and Anglicizes himself into a successful writer called Leonard Chamberlain—is surely patterned on the author, whose own Jewish heritage was long cloaked from him. But Stoppard (née Tomáš Sträussler) was born in Czechoslovakia, not Austria; he is almost a decade younger than the fictional Leo/Leonard; and as a toddler his mother escaped not to London but to Singapore and then Darjeeling (India). Even so, this long obscured exhumation of family ghosts and guilt had a belated effect on the playwright, bringing forth this admittedly non-Stoppard-like but exceptional play.</p>\n<p>The expansive action unfolds in five extended sections over a swift two and a quarter hours. The management has wisely excised the intermission that punctuated the play in its 2020 London premiere (just before the intrusion of that pandemic). Stoppard seems to have also slightly trimmed the proceedings for Broadway, culminating in an extended-but-manageable single act. You’re likely to be so grippingly involved in the emotional storm that you won’t notice when they rush past the two-hour mark.</p>\n<p>It could be said, and some viewers might well say, that it is at times difficult to keep track of just who’s who and married to whom. The playwright could indeed have arranged matters so that all familial relations are reinforced; but that would come at the expense of the swift pace. (This viewer found Stoppard’s <em>The</em> <em>Coast of Utopia </em>enthralling, but the playwright <em>did</em> take nine hours to weave that particular tale.) <em>Leopoldstadt</em> begins with the matriarch paging through the family photo album, striving to remember the names of some of those faded ancestors staring out from the pages. Loss of identity and actual existence are, indeed, part of Stoppard’s lesson on this occasion.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_16117\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-16117\" style=\"width: 624px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-16117 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/new-leop-tree.jpg?resize=624%2C429&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/new-leop-tree.jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/new-leop-tree.jpg?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-16117\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: Leopoldstadtplay.com</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The performers are uniformly excellent. Uranowitz stands out from beginning (as mathematician Ludwig) to end (as his equally mathematical great-nephew Nathan). Krumholtz is equally adept as the conflicted family breadwinner, while Castelow impresses as the out-of-place trophy wife who models for Klimt and nearly disrupts the household. Uranowitz, Augen, and Froushan do stunning work in the play’s shattering final scene. (Augen and Froushan, along with Castelow and Neil, played these roles in London.) That said, the stage is filled with too many worthy performances to individually cite.</p>\n<p>The production is fluidly staged by Patrick Marber, director of the 2018 revival of Stoppard’s <em>Travesties</em> and author of <em>Closer</em>. The grand family living room, designed by Richard Hudson (<em>The Lion King</em>), thins out as the decades pass until little remains other than that massive grand piano. The costumes by Brigitte Reiffenstuel aptly reflect the changing times and family fortunes. Strong contributions also come from lighting designer Neil Austin and sound designer/composer Adam Cork.</p>\n<p>Given its size, scope, and length, <em>Leopoldstadt</em> marks a brave and daring enterprise from leading West End producer Sonia Friedman (<em>The Ferryman</em>, <em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em>, <em>The Inheritance</em>) with a raft of producing partners. Like <em>The Ferryman</em> and <em>The Inheritance</em>, <em>Leopoldstadt</em> is brilliant, memorable, and dynamic, warranting an immediate visit to the Longacre.</p>\n<p>Stoppard’s large stage family is torn asunder over a half-century, violently wrenched apart by time and the times. Even so, the disparate strands of the Merz-Jakobovicz clan remain tied together as if by unseen, but ever, durable cords. Or, as Stoppard’s mathematician explains it, a cat’s cradle of invisible string with knots which remain inviolate.</p>\n<p><strong>Leopoldstadt opened October 2, 2022, at the Longacre Theatre and runs through July 2, 2023.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not a play about me” Tom Stoppard has said, referring to <em>Leopoldstadt</em>, which had a January 2020 London bow. He’s also stated that it’s his last play, although he’s apparently having second thoughts now.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it is or isn’t, it’s added to his list of astonishing works – <em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</em>, <em>Travesties</em>, <em>The Real Thing</em>, <em>The Invention of Love,</em> <em>Rock ‘n’ Roll</em>, <em>The Hard Problem</em>, to name a few. It undeniably ranks, perhaps with <em>Arcadia</em> and <em>The Coast of Utopia</em>, as his most exhilarating, most comprehensive, most serious accomplishment.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s also his most autobiographical work, or, taking him at his clarifying word, it’s close enough to being about someone very like the man born Tomáš <span title=\"Czech-language text\"><span lang=\"cs\">Sträussler </span></span>in Zlin, Czechoslovakia to Jewish parents. After his widowed mother, Martha, traveled widely with him and his brother, he was raised in England from age eight.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/10/02/leopoldstadt-stoppard-examines-his-roots-in-extraordinary-fashion/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His mother married Ken Stoppard, a military man whose surname the incipient playwright took on. (Ever the man with an advanced skill at British wordplay, Stoppard has labeled himself “a bounced Czech.”) And Stoppard’s Jewish beginnings were suppressed by his mother, perhaps in part because his stepfather harbored anti-Semitic sentiments.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specific details of Stoppard’s past aren’t incorporated into <em>Leopoldstadt</em>. Instead, he imagines the sizable Merz and Jakobovicz families who regard themselves as non-practicing Jews comfortably assimilated in an upscale section of 1899 Vienna, that isn’t the more Jewish-centric Leopoldstadt quarter.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The family members are intermarried, businessman Hermann Merz has a gentile wife Gretl (Faye Castelow). Ludwig Jakobovicz (Brandon Uranowitz) is a leading mathematician. They’re all celebrating Christmas, even as Young Jacob (Joshua Satine at the performance I saw) is placing a Jewish star atop the Christmas tree. The gesture is, of course, a shining metaphor for the spiritual conflicts with which Stoppard is so intricately dealing.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While holiday cheer noisily abounds, Stoppard eventually narrows his focus on a debate Hermann and Ludwig are formidably waging. The former insists that the endlessly wandering Jews have at last found a long-sought permanent home in welcoming Vienna, while the latter adamantly contends otherwise, Zionist Theodor Herzl being repeatedly invoked.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the following explosive, and deeply emotionally moving <em>Leopoldstadt</em> parts, Stoppard backs Ludwig’s beliefs about how tenuous a grip Jews have on their position in any society. What he’s considering profoundly is the oppressive weight of history.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expanding on those dark views, Stoppard skips to 1900, where Gretl philanders with Fritz (Arty Froushan) a Jew-hating dragoon. Eventually, there’s a far-reaching aftermath to their affair. Constantly raveling and unraveling his ingenious plot, Stoppard jumps over World War I to 1924 where young Jacob is now a cynical former soldier (Seth Numrich), and Cousin Hermine (Eden Epstein) a flapper with an ill-advised eye for Aryan banker Otto (Japhet Balaban).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, Stoppard moves to November 8, 1938 (Kristallnacht), where the current Merz-Jakobovicz generations, hoping they’re safe under Hitler’s advances, brutally learn they are not. Citizen (Corey Brill), an official who enjoys humiliating Jews, arrives.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Stoppard’s final scene, it’s 1955, when only three Merz-Jakobovicz family members have survived the false Vienna 1899 promise. (No one today should miss the signal to 2022 anti-Semitism.) Rosa (Jenna Augen), has for some time created a Manhattan life as a Freudian analyst, whereas Nathan (Uranowitz again, nailing the production’s stand-out performance) is an understandably bitter, accusatory man.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third is Leo (Froushan again and like the entire cast, excellent). He’s the Stoppard-like figure but hasn’t written plays or screenplays, only two amusing books that “caught on.” He resembles Stoppard in that he has grown up with no more than the vague sense that he was born, if not raised, Jewish.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relatives Rosa, Nathan, and Leo are in the Merz apartment (altered throughout the play’s action by designer Richard Hudson) for the express purpose of the former two wising up the latter to his Jewish heritage. As Nathan sharply informs the resistant Leo, “No one is born eight years old.” The succinct comment and a further revelation from his childhood awaken Leo to his entire past, just before Stoppard creates a final tableau that rivals every denouement in the annals of modern playwrighting history.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So yes, Stoppard’s play is more autobiographical than he wants to delineate. Perhaps that’s due to his wanting the nine-scene, intermisssionless 130-minute play to be seen not simply through a personal lens but as the cat’s cradle of a manuscript it is as it scrolls grimly through the decades. (Ludwig plays cat’s cradle several time with the children, the game becoming another symbol of time’s tricks).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Patrick Marber – a reliable Stoppard collaborator these years – works wonders with his 30-plus cast members (some original London cast players, some new to the piece) as he  does with costumer Brigitte Reiffenstuel, lighting designer Neal Austin, sound and clever original music designer Adam Cork, projection designer Isaac Madge, and certainly the Campbell Young Associates wig, hair and makeup designers.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Broadway transfer Stoppard and Marber have trimmed the London version. At least one episode –1924 – has undergone a weakened sea change. One or two other sequences – not 1938 or 1955 – are delivered more broadly than required.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps, there’s another explanation for Stoppard’s demurral – purely speculative on a reviewer’s part. Among many Holocaust survivors, no matter where they were during World War II, a strain of survival guilt persists. Could it be that Stoppard (born 1937) has composed <em>Leopoldstadt</em> from that depth? Just wondering.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Leopoldstadt opened October 2, 2022, at the Longacre Theatre and runs through July 2, 2023.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>When taking a story from the page to the stage, things usually go one of two ways: Use the book as a blueprint and create an entirely new experience (e.g., <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em>; or, at the more extreme end, anything by Elevator Repair Service); or follow the novel to the letter.</p>\n<p>Matthew Spangler’s absorbing adaptation of Khaled Hosseini’s <em>The Kite Runner</em>, which just opened on Broadway, chooses the latter—and, let’s be honest, more commercially viable—approach. Why mess with a beloved No. 1 <em>New York Times</em> best seller that’s sold millions upon millions of copies worldwide?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/07/21/the-kite-runner-the-best-selling-novel-soars-sky-high-on-stage/\">[<em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆<em>&nbsp;review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>If you know the book, you could practically follow along as you watch the show; that’s how faithful Spangler’s version is to Hosseini’s original. Even the opening and closing lines are the same. (And if you don’t know it, don’t worry. Judging by all the surprising audience reactions at my matinee—gasps, sighs of disbelief and relief, applause—many theatergoers weren’t familiar with the twists and turns.)</p>\n<p>We first meet our ever-present narrator, Amir (Amir Arison, who just wrapped a nine-season run on NBC’s <em>The Blacklist</em>), at age 38, in his adopted hometown of San Francisco in 2001; he then takes us back to 1975 in Kabul, Afghanistan, where he was born and raised and watched John Wayne movies with the best kite runner he’d ever known, Hassan (Eric Sirakian, speaking volumes even in his character’s quietest moments). “I spent the first twelve years of my life playing with Hassan, but back then, I never really thought of him as a friend,” Amir says. “I was Pashtun, he was Hazara. I was Sunni, he was Shia-a. Nothing was ever going to change that. But we were kids who had learned to crawl together, and nothing was going to change that either.” Hassan and his father, Ali (Evan Zes) may have lived in a mud servants’ shack, but Amir’s father, Baba (an exceptional Faran Tahir), treated them like family.</p>\n<p>Everyone talks about stories in <em>The Kite Runner</em>. Because Hassan cannot read (“That Hassan would grow up illiterate like most servants was decided the minute he was born,” explains Amir), Amir read the Persian epic <em>Shahnamah</em> to him; Hassan especially liked the tragic tale of “Rostam and Sohrab”—so much that he eventually names his son Sohrab (Sirakian in a natural and excellent bit of double-casting). Amir fails miserably at sports, so turns to short-story writing, and as a preteen he pens a beautiful fable about a magic cup and a man whose tears turn to pearls. When Amir meets Soraya (Azita Ghanizada), the woman he’ll eventually marry, she has her nose buried in <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. “Sad stories make good books,” she comments. Her father, General Taheri (Houshang Touzie), looks down on Amir’s ambition of becoming a writer. “Ah. A storyteller,” he sniffs. “Well, people need stories too, to divert them at difficult times like this.”</p>\n<p>Inevitably, <em>The Kite Runner</em> gets dragged down by all of those stories—not to mention by Amir’s constant narration. Arison can be a little stiff in those stand-still-and-reflect-on-something-monumental sections; he really comes alive when he’s channeling that goofy 12-year-old, playing games and climbing trees with Hassan. Did we mention he never leaves the stage through any of this? The big kite-fighting tournament; an unspeakable act of bullying and cowardice; a life-changing riff between Amir and Hassan; the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan; Amir’s and Baba’s arrivals at a Pakistan refugee camp; their applications for asylum in America and arrival in San Francisco; Baba’s worship of the vocally anti-Russia Ronald Reagan (cue audience applause); Amir’s matriculation at San Jose State; their setup at a local flea market, where Amir meets Soraya; a phone call from Baba’s oldest friend, Rahim Khan (Dariush Kashani); Amir’s 2001 trip to Pakistan to see him, and a subsequent trip back to an unrecognizable Kabul… that’s <em>a lot</em> to cover in two hours and 40 minutes. You can practically hear the pages turning from scene to scene.</p>\n<p>Director Giles Croft, who also helmed the hit U.K. production, moves things along rather well on a smartly sparse set (carpets and crates are just about the only adornments you’ll spot). And the gifted tabla artist Salar Nader, onstage throughout the entire show, provides dramatic accompaniment in just the right spots.</p>\n<p>One curious directorial choice: The second act features a silhouetted reenactment of a cold-blooded killing behind a curtain, which produces an incongruous puppet-show effect. Perhaps it’s an effort to interrupt the constant, sometimes draggy, narration, but in that case, telling us that the Taliban shot someone in the back of the head in the street would be dramatic enough.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Kite Runner</em> opened July 21, 2022, and runs through Oct. 30 at the Hayes Theater.

Photo: Joan Marcus</p>\n<p>After a short while checking into <em>The Kite Runner </em>book sales, the best I could ascertain was that Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini had amassed 38 million books sold for at least two of his works.</p>\n<p>That’s a lotta novels, and from the overwhelmingly favorable response to them, it’s a safe bet there’ll be no end of ticket buyers for Matthew Spangler’s <em>Kite Runner </em>stage adaptation, no matter how well or not well he’s done it. But breathe easy. He’s done it extremely well. In London, audiences have repeatedly turned out in the last few years for initial and revived productions. Now <em>The Kite Runner </em>has traveled to Manhattan for eager-beaver adorers to revel in it. When it’s run its for two-and-three-quarter-hours course, they’ll instantly stand and ovate, much as if it’s the winning kite in a heavy-weight tournament.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/07/21/the-kite-runner-khaled-hosseinis-literary-sensation-beguiles-broadway/\">[<em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>For those who don’t know the plot—there may be some who show up in audiences—let it be known that the rich and privileged Amir (Amir Arison) and servant and phenomenal kite-runner-slingshot-sharpshooter Hassan (Eric Sirakian) grow up as best friends. That’s when Amir isn’t bullied by equally well-heeled and brass-knuckled Assef (Amir Malaklou)—then the intimidated 12-year-old denies his close pal, as New Testament Peter does.</p>\n<p>Hosseini’s impassioned tale of betrayal, guilt, redemption, and father-son alienation kicks in when, hoping to impress his father, Baba (Faran Tahir), Amir contrives to win a kite contest but runs afoul in the ugly aftermath. Searching for the suddenly missing Hassen, who’s run to locate the loser’s blue kite, Amir comes on Assef tormenting the ever-loyal pal. Rather than confront a taunting wise guy, Amir runs in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>Leaving Hassen to humiliating treatment, Amir allows his most important bond to weaken and in time appear to dissolve. The remainder of Hosseini’s 371-page book follows Amir and Baba leaving Russian-invaded, Farsi-speaking Kabul without Hassan and his dad, Ali (Evan Zes). They emigrate to the United States and San Francisco, where Amir meets and marries Afghan émigré Soraya (Azita Ghanizada), and then thrives as the successful fiction writer he always hoped to be.</p>\n<p>That’s until he hears from Rahim Khan (Dariush Kashani), a family friend who’s been on to Amir’s compromising behavior all along. The wise man tells Amir he has an important obligation. He must find the now-deceased Hassan’s abandoned son, Sohrab (Sirakian doubling), who’s somewhere in a Kabul orphanage. This involves Amir’s learning some bitter truths about himself and Hassan before he sets out on an adventure that forces him to discover who he’s been, who he currently is, and who he wants to be.</p>\n<p>On a relatively spare, adaptable Barney George set often lighted darkly by Charles Balfour, playwright Spangler respectfully repeats large hunks of Hosseini’s prose. Running a kite-string’s-length of emotions, Arison narrates entire conversations and descriptions precisely as Amir delivers them in the first-person text.</p>\n<p>For the most part, Hosseini’s devoted readers won’t feel cheated of the book to which they’re so steadfastly attached. Also, patrons new to <em>The Kite Runner </em>will have no trouble taking in the eminently absorbing and grave odyssey, even, incidentally, as they’re filled in on the Taliban-ridden Afghanistan of today. (Hosseini has been quoted as saying he’s done some romanticizing but not much.)</p>\n<p>During the last third of these proceedings, Spangler skims past a few significant <em>Kite Runner </em>sequences, such as Amir’s reactions on his return to the now decimated Kabul. There’s also no mention of his own lengthy recovery from a surgery-requiring beating he takes from Assef while trying to reclaim Sohrab. Earlier, Spangler glosses over Amir’s often compulsive need to tease the illiterate Hassan, further establishing himself as a spoiled kid already prone to questionable conduct.</p>\n<p>And now a few needed comments about kites as a sine qua non production element: In the relatively low-ceiled Helen Hayes Theater, anything close to actual kite-flying is, of course, impossible. From time to time, actors in the 13-member ensemble carry on kites and wave them about, but aside from a few William Simpson projections showing kites greeting the sky, Arison must mime Amir’s kite manipulation. He brings it off nicely. (The 2007 Paramount film takes care of the kite-flying magnificently, as does a reader’s imagination.)</p>\n<p>As scrupulously directed by Giles Croft, the actors consistently enliven Hosseini and Spangler. The early Amir-Hassan camaraderie is winning as carried out by Arison and Sirakian. The Amir-Assef encounters are chilly. The eventual brawl, fight-directed by Philip D’Orléans, is frightening. Tahir keenly balances the love and disdain Baba feels for his disappointing son. Ghanizada’s Soraya is properly loving. Zes is persuasive as both the obsequious Ali and a volatile Pakistani driver, Farid. Adding to the production effectiveness is musician and arranger Salar Nader.</p>\n<p>A last word on adapter Spangler: He assiduously retains Hossein’s final two-word sentence. It’s certainly among the best concluding utterances in literary annals. Sincere condolences to the spectator who isn’t greatly moved by it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Kite Runner</em> opened July 21, 2022, and runs through Oct. 30 at the Hayes Theater.

The question: Is it possible for a musical to be too clever?</p>\n<p>Rest easy, Sondheim acolytes. Nowhere in this column will it even be implied that the much-missed late lyricist-composer was anything less than an undisputed genius. It may, however, be suggested and/or implied that Sondheim and Lapine can stand &#8212; and withstand &#8212; the occasional critical observation.</p>\n<p>So, let’s get to the neatly crafted nuts and bolts of <em>Into the Woods</em>, now transferred to Broadway from its recently acclaimed Encores! series outing. Sondheim and Lapine introduce a Narrator (David Patrick Kelly) who summons fairytale figures Cinderella (Phillipa Soo), her Stepmother (Nancy Opel) and nasty stepsisters Lucinda (Ta’Nika Gibson) and Florinda (Brooke Ishibashi) as well as Prince Charming (Gavin Creel).</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/05/06/into-the-woods-sondheim-leads-encores-out-of-darkness/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s</em><em>&nbsp;</em>★★★★☆&nbsp; <em>review of the original Encores production here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The Narrator commandeers long golden-braided Rapunzel (Alysia Velez) with her scheming mother-Witch (Patina Miller) and devoted Prince (Joshua Henry). He buttonholes Jack (Cole Thompson) of the beanstalk with worried mom (Aymee Garcia) and cow Milky White (Cameron Johnson the handler, at the performance I saw). He welcomes Little Red Ridinghood (Julia Lester) with Wolf (Creel doubling) and eventually indigestible Grannie (Annie Golden).</p>\n<p>The bunch of them then jauntily interact with each other as well as with a childless Baker (Brian D’Arcy James) and the Baker’s Wife (Sara Bareilles). [Note: in this day of sudden cast illnesses, D&#8217;Arcy James &#8212; who appeared at the press performance attended &#8212; was unable to perform at the official opening.] All are gathered in the Sondheim-Lapine real (and, of course, symbolic) woods to dispatch the bundle of messages the creators have incorporated on various cogent and potent subjects.</p>\n<p>The songsmith and bookwriter want to look at what makes a family a family and, alternatively, what alienates families. They’re intrigued by the same mistakes mythic characters make that humans make, misjudgments that get them into deep trouble. The creators are dabbling with ethics and morals &#8212; dispensing moral lessons, as fairytales tend to do. They focus on what children may learn on the theory that even if children don’t obey, they will listen.</p>\n<p>Kidding around with this confection of childhood favorites, they do take impudent liberties. Little Red Ridinghood is a glutton with an especially sweet tooth. (It’s funny that after eating so much she gets eaten.) Prince Charming, a womanizer, insists he was raised to be charming, not sincere. Jack is an unfortunately gullible lad, easily talked out of his beloved Milky White by the Baker, who needs the sweet beast to complete a task the Witch has set as payment for lifting a never-to-be-parents curse.</p>\n<p>This disparately wild bunch &#8212; each of the actors superb at what they do, as directed by the superlative Lear deBessonet and choreographed by agile Lorin Latarro &#8212; gambol around a David Rockwell set, featuring a wood consisting of thick birch trees. At the first-act finale each of them has by hook or crook achieved his or her determined goal. They’re all set to live happily ever after.</p>\n<p>But not so fast! This is Sondheim. This is Lapine. These two are not known as happy-end fellows. They’ll do their best to see that the happy ends achieved in the first part don’t sustain. (FYI: the second act of <em>The Fantasticks&nbsp;</em>has the same reversal.)</p>\n<p>So’s not to sully their reputation as realists, Sondheim and Lapine snatch back that happiness. To terrorize their startled woods denizens, they let loose a real (and, needless to say, symbolic) Giant wife (Golden again) of the Giant whom Jack previously slew to obtain his golden egg and golden harp.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in the process of maintaining their realist bona fides, Sondheim and Lapine prove to be &#8212; see initial query above &#8212; too clever. Or perhaps not clever enough. Extended and awkward dramatics eventually land with a thud that’s the equivalent of the lady giant’s thud, as supplied by sound designers Scott Lehrer and Alex Neumann and represented by a large-scale pair of wired high-heeled pumps.</p>\n<p>But then, of all things, Sondheim sentimentally reverses himself on the happily-ever-after denial with one of his most treasured songs, the reassuring “No One is Alone.” Really? Is everyone who’d like to be reassured by the sentiment truly reassured?</p>\n<p>Again, though, this is Sondheim and he’s packed a passel of dillies into his score, the encompassing title ditty not the least of them. Just about every other item is up to his vaunted standards &#8212; “Agony” for the two Princes, “It Takes Two” for the Baker and Wife, Jack’s haunting “Giants in the Sky,” the ensemble “Ever After.”</p>\n<p>Throughout, there’s Sondheim’s nimble rhyming &#8212; he finds a rhyme for “palette” in “carnality” &#8212; so much so that again (see above), his cleverness begins to wear. He’s always had a pronounced case of rhyme-itis. Sometimes with rhymes he doesn’t stop but has a crop that pop, pop, pop, a well-stocked shop of rhymes to drop, ker-plop, ker-plop. A listener wants to shout, “Enough already.”</p>\n<p>Still, this <em>Into the Woods&nbsp;</em>revival is eminently worth seeing, for perhaps an unusual additional reason. When I attended, the audience cheered every first-act song long and loud. Why such jubilation? Perhaps because the fave-rave musical is one of the most popular high schools attractions going. Could be the packed St. James auditorium is chockablock with former <em>Into the Woods </em>schooldays players who know the score backwards and forwards and are cheering it for old time’s sake. There are worse recommendations for joining them.</p>\n<p><strong>Into the Woods opened July 10, 2022, at the St. James Theatre and runs through August 21.

Sanders in Girl From the North Country. Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Bob Dylan introduced his formidable  “Like a Rolling Stone” in the <em>Highway 61 Revisited </em>album. Before the nervy, propulsive outburst reaches an impassioned finish, it repeats a question in a few variations, “How does it feel to be on your own with no direction home, like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone?”</p>\n<p>If any question lies at the black-hole core of Conor McPherson’s <em>Girl From the North Country </em>&#8212; which regularly plucks chunks from the Dylan songbook for miraculous effect &#8212; it’s a question about the unalterable pronouncement that everyone travels alone through life with no direction home. Samuel Beckett would recognize the sentiment and likely agree.</p>\n<p>Supporting his thesis, McPherson focuses on Thanksgiving 1934 in Duluth, Minnesota. where the current inhabitants of Nick Laine’s (Jay O. Sanders) boarding house are trying their existential best to make something of the present and the future &#8212; without any noticeable glimmer of success. This is the Depression, and are McPherson’s people depressed! (That the unique tuner feels uncomfortably timely, if far from uplifting, needs mentioning. Immeasurably uplifting is the high quality of the writing and production.)</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most prominent member of the playwright’s extraordinarily motley collection is Elizabeth Laine (Mare Winningham), Nick’s wife, who’s in the throes of madness. Caring for her constantly isn’t so much the frustrated Nick but son Gene (Colin Bates), a perpetual loser, and adopted daughter Marianne (Kimber Elayne Sprawl), a Black girl now of marriageable age but unwilling to respond to the advances of 70-year-old Mr. Perry (Tom Nelis).</p>\n<p>Nick’s agitated resting-place is only a stop in the Depression’s middle years for everyone present &#8212; from an out-of-business businessman (Craig Bierko), with angry wife (Luba Mason) and mentally challenged son (Todd Almond), to a former hotshot boxer (Austin Scott), just escaped from prison. Nick’s only solace is Mrs. Neilson (Jeannette Bayardelle), who fills the dual role of boarder/extra-marital-affair partner.</p>\n<p>McPherson, his own skillful director, has his accomplished actors constantly swarming set/costume designer Rae Smith’s often impressively cluttered stage in her properly shabby period costumes as they clutch invisible frayed tethers until all but maybe two of those tethers break irreparably.</p>\n<p>Sometimes singly, often forming groups around a single mic stand, often breaking into dance routines (Lucy Hind, the movement director), they deliver parts of 22 Dylan songs (one co-written with Jacques Levy, one co-written with Robert Hunter). Marco Paguia conducts with admirable determination; Simon Baker sees to the exquisite sound.</p>\n<p>The use of Dylan’s vaunted, wide-ranging catalog calls for discussion. Normally, in today’s proliferation of jukebox musicals &#8212; someone’s hit songs woven (awkwardly) into a story (biographical, more often than not) &#8212; a property like <em>Girl From the North Country </em>would be designated just that: yet another jukebox musical. (The Dylan catalog has already weathered one of those: Twyla Tharp’s 2006 dance musical, <em>The Times They Are A-Changin&#8217;</em>, with 35 previews, 28 performances.)</p>\n<p>In this case McPherson offers something more than a great, big, flashing Broadway jukebox. The pungent, poignant Dylan shards are incorporated not necessarily as tied directly to the emotions the band of lost souls are feeling but more as an oblique comment on the characters’ states of mind.</p>\n<p>It could be that McPherson’s using Dylan snippets of varying lengths in a dramatic setting goes some persuasive way towards explaining why the songwriter/performer was awarded the 2016 Nobel Prize. His lyrics, certainly as reprised here, are that trenchant, that ground-breaking, that toying-with-time, that literary.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that <em>Girl From the North Country </em>opened pre-pandemic at the Public Theater. The Broadway opening was March 5, 2020, followed by an almost immediate Covid-19 shutdown. It reopened April 29, 2022, confirming this reviewer’s belief that the property is the best musical &#8212; jukebox or no &#8212; of the past three years.</p>\n<p>For musical lovers wondering if it’s worth seeing &#8212; or reseeing &#8212; by the announced June 19 closing date: Don’t think twice, it’s so all right.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Girl from the North Country opened March 5, 2020 at the Belasco Theatre and runs through June 19.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Shakespeare’s plays generally fall into three genres: comedy, history, and tragedy. Some historians like to add a fourth—romance, or tragicomedy. And then there are the problem plays, but that’s a whole other, well, problem.</p>\n<p>Inevitably there’s crossover; <em>Richard II</em> and <em>III</em>, for instance, are history plays that come off as tragedies. But there’s never been any doubt about <em>Macbeth</em>, a cautionary tale of a man brought down by his own bloody ambition—if not Shakespeare’s greatest tragedy, then certainly in his top three alongside <em>Hamlet</em> and <em>King Lear</em>. Until now: The much-anticipated Sam Gold–directed Broadway production of <em>Macbeth</em>, which just opened at the Longacre Theatre, appears to be a comedy.</p>\n<p>The laughter starts during the warmup. (Apparently Shakespeare needs an opening act.) Michael Patrick Thompson—who plays Lennox, in addition to one of Macbeth’s hatchet men—comes out to talk about King James I and his obsession with the occult as a sort of preface to the Bard’s most supernatural play. He also goads the audience into saying, or at least mouthing, “Macbeth.” Fun! Now let’s go play with some witches.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/29/macbeth-loud-sound-intermittent-fury-signifying-nothing/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★☆☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>After Macbeth (stage and screen vet Daniel Craig, who seems strangely disoriented) and Banquo (<em>Hadestown</em> Tony nominee Amber Gray, in an inspired bit of casting) run into the weird sisters (Phillip James Brannon, Maria Dizzia, Bobbi MacKenzie) and hear their prophesies—they say Macbeth will be king, and that Banquo’s children will be kings—his wheels start turning. Macbeth comments when King Duncan (Paul Lazar) anoints son Malcolm (Asia Kate Dillon) his successor: “The Prince of Cumberland!” Craig’s Macbeth is incredulous rather than introspective, turning to the audience with a do-you-believe-this-crap expression. Laughter, inevitably, ensues.</p>\n<p>You know what else is funny? Regicide! After he knocks off Duncan, Macbeth comes back, proclaims “I have done the deed,” and tosses down the daggers like a toddler who’s tired of his toys. Then he and Lady Macbeth (a divine Ruth Negga, who was a spectacular <a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2020/02/10/hamlet-the-stars-the-thing/\">Hamlet</a> at St. Ann’s Warehouse in 2020) start bickering like a couple on a CBS sitcom, and he pounds a Miller Lite. Scottish royals…they’re just like us.</p>\n<p>Fair warning for anyone bothered by the sight of blood shooting across the stage: You might want to cover your eyes. This production certainly goes for the gore. A curious choice, considering the dramaturgical note in the program (it prepares the audience for “minimal scenery,” “no major scene changes,” and double- and triple-casting): “This simplicity and flexibility, in which the play’s language carries most of the narrative and expressive weight, enables a high level of imaginative participation.” Yet Gold—who previously helmed <em>King Lear</em>, <em>Othello</em>, and <em>Hamlet</em>—turns Duncan’s stabbing, usually an offstage moment, into something out of <em>Psycho</em>, complete with horror-movie lighting and chilling sound effects.</p>\n<p>Deep down, Macbeth is not a cold-blooded killer. He has to give himself two soliloquy pep talks before he can bring himself to do it (“If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well/ It were done quickly” and “Is this a dagger which I see before me…”). That’s why he makes such a mess of the murder that his wife so meticulously planned. But now he’s slashing the guy like something out of <em>Halloween</em>.</p>\n<p>Seeing so much violence mid-play also robs us of the cathartic climax, when the “hellhound” is finally destroyed by Macduff (Grantham Coleman)—the only one who can bring him down, because he “was from his mother’s womb/ Untimely ripp’d” (Shakespeare speak for a C-section).</p>\n<p>Gold actually has something else in mind for the end; we won’t reveal the specifics, other than to say it’s more restorative than the usual <em>Macbeth</em> closer. And that it involves a song by Gaelynn Lea, whose intriguing original music underscores the entire production. It’s lovely, but—yet again—tonally simply wrong.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Macbeth</em> opened April 28, 2022, at the Longacre Theatre and runs through July 10.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>For the 2021-22 Theater Record:</p>\n<p>William Shakespeare’s shortest tragedy, <em>The Tragedy of Macbeth</em>, was revived in late April. Sam Gold was the director and apparently intended the production to take on the look of a first-week rehearsal. If that was indeed his goal, he reached it.</p>\n<p>Daniel Craig and Ruth Negga assumed the roles of, respectively, the title figure and Lady Macbeth. Intermittently, they appeared to be trying out some of the more tense emotions they would display in a finished production—Negga more so than Craig.</p>\n<p>Twelve actors completed the ensemble, several of them emoting somewhat—Paul Lazar as Duncan and the Porter, Grantham Coleman as MacDuff, Amber  Gray as Banquo (addressed with the use of she-her-hers pronouns). The rest delivered Shakespeare’s dialog as if still learning their assigned lines. Some seemed amused to be mouthing Shakespeare’s words. More than one of the male performers spoke Shakespeare’s grave iambic pentameters with their hands in their trouser pockets.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/29/macbeth-have-you-heard-the-one-about-the-scottish-play/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Christine Jones designed the set with its black upstage brick wall on which were many marching black L-shaped pipes. Otherwise, the only furnishings were the occasional table and the occasional chair. A table downstage right was adorned with a bowl meant to serve as a witches cauldron. Other items represented the witches’ brew ingredients. Pete Sarafin was credited with organizing production props.</p>\n<p>Suttirat Larlarb designed the costumes, the fanciest for Lady Macbeth, an array of black pieces and some of other tasteful colors for Macbeth. The rest of the cast members wore what could have convincingly passed for their own rehearsal clothes. Jane Cox designed the lighting which served its purpose, although she indulged in more flamboyant effects during the sequence when Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane. Sound designer Mikaal Sulaimon collaborated with Jones for that segment. The projection designer was Jeanette Ol-Suk Yew. Gaelynn Lea supplied original music.</p>\n<p>Sam Pinkleton was credited as movement director, David S. Leong as violence director. It was unclear which staged the Macbeth-MacDuff battlefield encounter, evidently a production highlight. Perhaps both had a hand in the strenuous mano a mano. (No intimacy director was billed.)</p>\n<p>Patrick Daly was the executive producer. The first of the myriad additional producers was Barbara Broccoli of the Broccoli family, producers of the James Bond series for which Craig had only recently completed his final appearance as the beloved spy.</p>\n<p>Michael Sexton and Ayanna Thompson were credited as dramaturgy and text consultants. It isn’t specified that they oversaw some of the text departures, but possibly they okayed the Porter’s new first words, which in this production were “Oh, shit.” Not long after that comment, the Porter said, “There’s a shitload of people here.” Sexton and Thompson may have also put the stamp of approval on the rounds of boos cast members chanted early on. Likely, it was not these consultants but director Gold who had Macbeth entering at one moment with a beer can from which he speedily quaffed. Probably, it was also Gold who had one character give others the finger.</p>\n<p>Among critical response, one reviewer—okay, <em>this</em> reviewer—called the production “a disgrace” and said, “Classic works don’t need the modern-dress approach that nowadays is a shabby cliché.” He averred, paraphrasing Shakespeare, “Playing the play’s the thing.”</p>\n<p><strong><b>Macbeth </b>opened April 28, 2022 at the Longacre Theater </strong><strong>and runs through August 14.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Veteran comic Buddy Young, Jr, the central character played by Billy Crystal in <em>Mr. Saturday Night</em>, has more than his share of catchphrases. There&#8217;s &#8220;Don&#8217;t get me started,&#8221; which he used to say to his audience when he had his own prime-time television show. There&#8217;s &#8220;Hurt them,&#8221; which he repeats to himself as a mantra before going onstage. And most often, there&#8217;s &#8220;See what I did there?&#8221; which he slyly asks friends and family members every time he throws in an unexpected joke. Unfortunately, what this new musical version of Crystal&#8217;s not-so-successful 1992 film needs is less catchphrases and more memorable songs.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe we&#8217;re living through a conservation crisis, when so much familiar material is recycled into generic Broadway musicals. Crystal, who had a triumph on Broadway with his Tony Award-winning autobiographical solo show <em>700 Sundays</em>, obviously has a soft spot for this tale about a washed-up comedian still desperate to make people laugh. He directed and starred in the film, which he co-wrote with Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel of <em>Splash</em>, <em>Parenthood</em>, <em>City Slickers</em> and <em>A League of Their Own</em> fame. He and the veteran comedy writers have reunited for this new musicalization, which also features David Paymer, repeating the role of Buddy&#8217;s aggrieved brother and business manager that won him an Oscar nomination. But there&#8217;s nothing about the musical that displays a reason for being, other than to showcase its star&#8217;s extraordinary comic chops.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/27/mr-saturday-night-billy-crystal-musicalized-vehicle-runs-smoothly-enough/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Not that it&#8217;s necessarily a <em>bad</em> reason. Crystal, a direct stylistic descendant of the legendary Borscht Belt comedians who so clearly inspired him, has the sort of pitch-perfect timing and delivery that can make practically any joke funny. This show has plenty of them, a non-stop barrage of hilarious one-liners, many of them defiantly politically incorrect (but not <em>too</em> offensive) that will have audiences of a certain age and (dare I say it?) a certain ethnicity, laughing non-stop.</p>\n<p>The problem is that the jokes inevitably give way to formulaic dramatic scenes, many involving Buddy&#8217;s strained relationship with his grown daughter (Shoshana Bean). Even worse, they give way to songs, way too many songs, with music by Jason Robert Brown and lyrics by Amanda Green, that repeatedly stop the show. Not in a good way, mind you, but rather dead in its tracks. Imagine Bob Hope singing &#8220;Thanks for the Memory&#8221; not at the end of his stand-up act but rather every 7-10 minutes throughout, and you get the idea.</p>\n<p>Crystal and his writing collaborators have done their best to make the original story more palatable to Broadway audiences, softening the central character into less of an obnoxious jerk than he was onscreen. But everyone involved seems to be doing too much heavy lifting: Crystal, carrying the weight of the show on his shoulders (it&#8217;s hard to imagine anyone else playing the role); Paymer, who really can&#8217;t sing, but has deadpan perfected to an art form; Bean, saddled with weak material; Randy Graff,  wonderfully appealing as Buddy&#8217;s wife; Chasten Harmon, in the thankless role of Buddy&#8217;s new young agent whose name he keeps forgetting (one of the weaker running gags); and Jordan Gelber, Brian Gonzalez and Mylinda Hull, heroically faced with the task of playing what seems like dozens of supporting characters and scoring laughs throughout.</p>\n<p>The original movie ran an overlong 119 minutes, and the show is even longer — two hours and forty-five minutes, a running time more suited to musicals about French revolutions and opera house-haunting phantoms. Brown, working more in his <em>Honeymoon in Vegas</em> than <em>Bridges of Madison Country </em>style, has contributed 17 songs, absolutely none of which are memorable, and which aren&#8217;t helped by the stars&#8217; voices (serviceable at best) or the wan arrangements for the orchestra numbering a mere six musicians. Green&#8217;s lyrics are occasionally amusing, but lean too heavily on such Yiddish-infused rhymes as &#8220;My opening act was Eddie Fisher/Now I should take advice from this pisher?&#8221; and &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s acting like an asshole/Yet somehow it turns out to be my fault/Oy gevalt!&#8221; (If this show had commercials, they would be for Manischewitz.)</p>\n<p>But, and it&#8217;s a very big but, none of this will matter to Crystal fans, as everyone should be. The 74-year-old performer displays the vitality of someone half his age, his energy fueled by the waves of audience laughter cascading over the footlights. It&#8217;s a treat to see him up close and personal as he works his tuchus off (the Yiddishisms prove infectious) to entertain us. <em>Mr. Saturday Night</em> would prove an absolute triumph for him…as long as you eliminated the plot, the supporting characters, and the musical numbers.</p>\n<p>You see what I did there?</p>\n<div><strong><b>Mr. Saturday Night </b>opened April 27, 2022 at the Nederlander Theatre</strong><strong>.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>If you like Billy Crystal as well as a Mount Everest of one-liners, you’ll love <em>Mr. Saturday Night</em>. It’s the new tuner run up from the comedian’s 1992 hit movie by the film’s screenwriters Lowell Ganz, Babaloo Mandell and Crystal himself, with Jason Robert Brown adding music and Amanda Green adding lyrics.</p>\n<p>If you like Billy Crystal—he’s tremendously hard not to like—but aren’t so certain about one-liners fired at you non-stop, you might have trouble with <em>Mr. Saturday Night</em>. It’s as if the authors think the only way to communicate in life is to top everything uttered with a gag. If every one of the gags landed, you might be more forgiving. Every one doesn’t, and remember that the word “gag” has more than one meaning.</p>\n<p>Crystal—in a role he created on “A Comic’s Line,” the 1984 HBO special—and a crowd of seven deft players are retelling the tale of Buddy Young, Jr. who had his own top-10 Saturday Night boobtube variety show in the 1950s. A hot, also hot-tempered, fellow then, he’s fallen on hard times by 1994, when the action, with many flashbacks, begins.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/27/mr-saturday-night-broadway-musical-borscht-belt-style/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Reduced to playing nursing homes and the like on afternoons, he’s abiding a home life with devoted but worried wife Elaine (Randy Graff) and angry daughter Susan (Shoshana Bean). He’s estranged from brother and longtime manager Stan (David Paymer nicely repeating the role that earned him an Oscar nomination).</p>\n<p>Buddy is propelled from his doldrums when he sees himself declared dead in one of those Oscar memorial segments. Making an understanding fuss, he’s promptly interviewed on the <em>Today </em>show, waxes one-liner-heavy and, as a result, is wooed by a talent agency.</p>\n<p>In comes Annie Wells (Chasten Harmon), a young agent who knows less about comedy than you’d think an agent should. Though initially mocked by Buddy, she decides to believe in his future. Predictably, she runs into trouble when joke-mongering Buddy screws up a barrage of chances. That’s until director Larry Myerson, who’s admired Buddy from boyhood, approaches his idol with a movie role all but tailored for him.</p>\n<p>Here’s where <em>Mr. Saturday Night</em>, directed by the forever clever John Rando, takes on important meaning. That’s to say, the heated Buddy Young family doings start feeling extraneous when Ganz, Mandel, and Crystal get to the heart of their piece; looking unflinchingly at a man who’s ruined his life by having made it all about him.</p>\n<p>But they have done a bit of a flinch, as if confident about their jokes but uncertain about going dramatic. To keep the one-liners pop-pop-popping so Crystal is assured his laughs (even Paymer’s Stan and Graff’s Elaine have their share), the bookwriters stall the skinny on why Buddy lost his “Coleman Comedy Hour.” Finally letting the audience in on it, they pivot to their protagonist’s little-King-Lear-like behavior.</p>\n<p>And is Crystal ready for the challenge! Always a strong actor but perhaps underrated due to his grand comic flair (get him back to the Oscars, please), he grabs the script’s meat as if it’s prime rib steak. He nails the movie audition, although the authors can’t resist a little twist before the foreseeable result.</p>\n<p>To underline Crystal’s powers the colorful Brown and Green have written “Any Man But Me.” Though more than vocally acceptable throughout. the show’s star (no understudy listed) brings this eleven o’clock number off with expanding fortitude. He delivers it as if this final quarter of the musical is the one he’s truly pleased to be headlining. Is it going too far to suggest Crystal might someday make a terrific Uncle Vanya?</p>\n<p>It would be unfair to suggest that <em>Mr. Saturday Night </em>is any less than amiable start to finish, not only for a focal figure who has the audience eating out of his hand but for the other seven—and for Ellenore Scott’s jaunty choreography. Paymer has Stan well in hand. Graff, always marvelous, is present much of the time as a likable foil but shows her strength in the “Until Now” duet with Crystal and in the mock-sultry “Tahiti.” Though Bean is given ditties as if she’s there and so ought to have a song or two, she makes them count. Harmon shows off in the Buddy Young Jr.-taunting “What If I Said?”</p>\n<p>Jordan Gelber, Brian Gonzales, and Mylinda Hull take on any number of comic-relief parts as well as the lively “We’re Live” opener and “What’s Playin’ at the Movies?” where they get to sport Paul Tazewell and Sky Switser’s movie-house refreshment counter outfits (hotdog, et cetera). Also enlivening the goings-on are the easily workable Scott Pask sets, Kenneth Posner lights, Kai Harada sound, and Jeff Suggs videos and projections.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, along with the one-liners, bookwriters Crystal, Ganz and Mandel often indulge in a current trend that stretches the word “current” into something threateningly never-ending. When not immediately locating a chuckle or guffaw, they drop in a “fuck” or “shit.” Maybe the piddling ploy is such a handy fall back because enough patrons go for it.</p>\n<p>Fewer of those would be a help, but please no less of Crystal. He’s so assured—in the perhaps forgotten manner of George Burns and George Jessel—he compensates sufficiently to make himself Mr. Every Night of the Week.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Mr. Saturday Night </b>opened April 27, 2022 at the Nederlander Theatre</strong><strong>.

Photo: Paul Kolnik</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>It would require a spoiler alert if I quoted the first word spoken in Selina Fillinger’s <em>POTUS, OR BEHIND EVERY GREAT DUMBASS ARE SEVEN WOMEN TRYING TO KEEP HIM ALIVE</em>. It’s an obscenity and implies that what’s likely to follow will be at the same expanded vocabulary level.</p>\n<p>Low-low-low level? Some would say so. Watching <em>POTUS</em>, however, I must report—many will agree with me— that the comedy is just about the funniest to split sides on Broadway this comedy-short season or, let’s be even more enthusiastic, any number of seasons past. At least that can be said of the 45-minute-or-so first act. The second act is a story for a much later couple of paragraphs.</p>\n<p>For now, we’re sticking with the first act, which takes place in the White House and has Chief of Staff Harriet (Julie White) cannonading the initial expletive to inner circle and equally expletive-outfitted staff member Jean (Suzy Nakamura). They’re discombobulated because foul-mouthed POTUS has unleashed the word Harriet is repeating—or a version of it—in front of a few visiting dignitaries. Harriet and Jean need to clean things up before their chief executive-with-no-language-filter addresses a women’s group later in the day.</p>\n<p>For those wondering which of the previous 45 POTUSes Fillinger is ribbing, the obvious choice—described pointedly in some dialog—has to be Donald J. You-know-who.  Nevertheless, it could be others, too, no?</p>\n<p>Among Fillinger’s colorful characters is Dusty (Julianna Hough), a White House newcomer newly arrived on the presidential jet and practiced at the art of fellatio as well as at various posterior services. “Are you by any chance into weird ass play?” she’s asked. Gleefully answering that she is, she’s ready to put her talents to work, even as she’s pregnant with POTUS’ child.</p>\n<p>In a succession of scenes unfolding as set designer Beowolf Boritt’s gorgeous, generally triangular rooms turn, Flotus Margaret (Vanessa Williams) is introduced. She’s fightin’ mad but together as all get-out as she’s updated on things by staff drudge Stephanie (Rachel Dratch). This is just before an interview with White House reporter Chris (Lilli Cooper), who’s in search of a scoop and only barely realizing it’s right in front of her.</p>\n<p>After very little time passes, Bernadette (Lea DeLaria), a convict on self-declared leave, shoulders in, wearing an eye-challenging camouflage outfit, Not only is she Harriet’s drug-dealing sister ready to ply her trade as well as Jean’s estranged lover, she’s on site to have POTUS sign her pardon. She’s not prepared to take no for an answer.</p>\n<p>The seven sisters, as if Sabine women out for revenge, vie with one another, exponentially expanding complications. As they do, Fillinger is looking to decimate Great White Way hilarity records. (She’s likely already breaking the vulgarity glass ceiling.) As the at-sword’s-point encounters mount, they women are frustrated but hardly lost for dirty words or actions. When recriminations peak, Chris picks up a marble suffragist bust and hurls it.</p>\n<p>A dire consequence results, the full detailing of which would require another spoiler alert. So, no spoiler-alerting here. What happens and how a truncated object is revealed in a doorway gets the first-act curtain descending to thunderous laughs. So much so that I’d wager a sense of “boffo comedy smash” is filling some audience assessments.</p>\n<p>Then, I regret to say, the second act begins—and kinda goes nowhere. Much of it is taken up with how to handle the truncated object as it’s hauled around in a large bin. The nonplussed women—I avoid the word “hysterical”—race through Boritt’s faster-turning rooms and under Sonoyo Nishikawa’s lights while playwright Fillinger fails to hit on a genuinely workable plot.</p>\n<p>She  gets laughs from some of the situations, many calling for all actors to be present. She still flounders until after filling up another approximately 45 minutes, she lines up the cast and supplies a last black-out-inducing curtain line.</p>\n<p>What has indisputably been established throughout both acts is that the seven cast members are each worth whatever salary they’re getting and more. Each, as cleverly dressed by Linda Cho, deserves a separate order-of-appearance rave: White for her unmitigated fury, Nakamura for her dignified uppityness, Dratch for her vague otherworldliness (especially when calling attention to her covered nipples), Williams for her dignified but no-nonsense great lady, Cooper for her sneakiness, Hough for her unabashed cheer, DeLaria for her never-abating brazenness.</p>\n<p>Susan Stroman, apparently on leave from musicals, directs. She’s so creative at this song-and-dance-less assignment that the leave is likely to be extended. She never falters at keeping the stage lively. That goes for the stretches where the Fillinger script stalls. Yes, Stroman lovers, she does slip in a brief dance routine or two.</p>\n<p>Back to Fillinger’s last line: Though lame-sounding as a finale, it does indicate in no uncertain words something about women power. As feminist as anything recently proclaimed, the statement insists on women as the unquestioned equal of men, equal in whatever task considered—equal surely in mastering the use of four-letter words and their longer ilk.</p>\n<p>It’s even possible to imagine men leaving the <em>POTUS</em> word spray more embarrassed than women at what they’ve just heard. Isn’t that saying something about Fillinger and her mouth-y friends in today’s fragile we’re-all-equal society?</p>\n<p><strong><b>POTUS </b>opened April 27, 2022 at the Shubert Theater </strong><strong>and runs through August 14.

Jackson, and his motley but magical protagonist Usher, have chosen to write about what they <em>want to </em>know: namely, the key to identity; the answer to the age-old riddle of human consciousness. It’s like the kid sang in <em>A Chorus Line, </em>“Who am I, anyway? / Am I my resumé?,” but more profound.</p>\n<p>The 2019 Pulitzer Prize winner is making its overdue, pandemic-postponed Broadway debut, having premiered under the aegis of Playwrights Horizons and Page 73 Productions (NYC) and Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company (Washington, D.C.). Its reemergence allows the theatergoing public to become aware of what a really unusual bird this show is, detailing the efforts of an overweight, Black, gay theater usher named Usher, to pen a musical about an overweight, Black, gay theater usher who is attempting to write a musical about an overweight, Black…. Strange enough loop for you, so far?</p>\n<p>What <em>is</em> a “strange loop,” anyway? Permit me to do some of the heavy lifting, ‘cause I had to look it up too. Popularized by cognitive scientist and philosopher Douglas Hofstadter (as well as the title of a Liz Phair song Jackson says he was enamored of), it’s the notion that any really complex system—be it a language, a musical form like a fugue, or yes, the human brain—has the ability to observe itself: to refer to itself, to loop back onto itself. Think of those crazy M.C. Escher prints of people or staircases impossibly rising up or down. Closer to home, there’s the title sequence of the sitcom <em>Modern Family, </em>where each TV monitor finds itself deeper and deeper within the one before.</p>\n<p>Psychologically speaking, I suppose one could oversimplify the unraveling of somebody’s personal “eternal golden braid” (the subtitle of a Hofstadter tome) as a merely tedious display of navel-gazing. But Usher’s self-exploration is engaging and even endearing, not some narcissistic routine. That’s partly because he’s intensely likeable, as embodied by Jaquel Spivey in his first professional gig out of college. Stepping into the acclaimed shoes of Larry Owens, who can be heard on the Off-Broadway cast album, Spivey takes command of the stage (and our hearts) and never lets go. He embodies all of Usher’s insecurities, while letting us glimpse the germ of self-actualization within.</p>\n<p>Seeking sexual encounters he expects will humiliate him, he throws himself into them anyway. Furious at his belittling, bigoted, Bible-thumping family back home, he keeps returning their calls and keeps trying. And he’s exactly the kind of genial people-person you’d want to approach for assistance in a theater lobby, even though you know he just loathes his job. The role has all those dualities wrapped into it and then some, and Spivey exercises effortless control over every one.</p>\n<p>Usher&#8217;s a people-person in another sense. He has six strands of “golden braid” working on him at all times: an ensemble of “Thoughts,” who alternately hector, insult, question, and discourage him. I see them as the Self-Sabotage Sextet, or in Jackson&#8217;s lexicon, &#8220;Usher&#8217;s perceptions of reality, inside and out.&#8221; Now hilariously, later terrifyingly, they represent all the negativity we battle, often transforming into the fantasies that never come to good, or the real-life friends and families who often as not disappoint. What a marvelous ensemble director Stephen Brackett has marshalled, choreographed smoothly by Raja Feather Kelly in <em>his </em>Broadway bow. Each Thought/reality perception is a distinct type and master of accents, and they meld like an improv company that’s been working together for ages.</p>\n<p>It feels unfair to single any out, and all get their moments to shine. But I was particularly taken by L Morgan Lee as the one sympathetic soul to come to Usher’s aid, funnily enough during intermission at <em>Lion King. </em>“Life your life and tell your story in exactly the same way: truthfully and without fear!,” she sings. “Despite those who wish you would disappear / Find joy inside your life while you’re still here.”</p>\n<p>Such positivity will sit well among audience members who may otherwise be uncomfortable with the super-raw language and sexually-charged situations, all far more common to Off-Off-Broadway lofts than the likes of the venerable Lyceum. I suspect the music—often repetitious, with hints of Philip Glass—will not be to everyone’s taste, and <em>A Strange Loop</em> is a particularly loud show, its rapid-fire lyrical wordplay hard to make out. (Director Brackett could do more to sharpen the focus so that we could see, more often, who&#8217;s singing what as an aid to comprehension.)</p>\n<p>Yet there’s a shape and balance to this remarkable work which set it above most conventional musical entertainment. Following multiple musical vignettes of Usher’s sad sack Manhattan life, we are treated to a blistering satire of the oeuvre of billionaire entrepreneur Tyler Perry, for whose trafficking in stereotypes, and benign bigotry, Usher (and clearly Jackson) have no use. Cajoled by his money-hungry family to enter the Perry orbit, Usher executes a one-man distillation of a typical “chitlin&#8217; circuit” script, doing all the voices. This speech is a tour de force destined to win acting scholarships for countless young thesps of color, for decades to come.</p>\n<p>In its wake, there’s a wake. Usher’s mind and the action shift to a full-scale visit with the family, on the occasion of the funeral of a beloved young man who has died of AIDS. The event unleashes all of our protagonist’s fury (and Jackson’s most ambitious music), as he lashes out at the “loved ones” who failed to support him in his journey as “one lone Black gay boy who chose to turn his back on the Lord.” Brutal stuff.</p>\n<p>And yet by the end he’s still standing. Still hoping. Still struggling with the pronoun “I,” yet resigned to the fact that our “I” is all any of us have got. So why not make the most of it?</p>\n<p><strong><b>A Strange Loop </b>opened April 24, 2022, at the Lyceum Theatre.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>I have seen many fine productions of Thornton Wilder’s <em>The Skin of Our Teeth. </em>But I can say without hesitation that the current revival at Lincoln Center’s Vivian Beaumont Theater, under the direction of Lileana Blain-Cruz, is the most creative, most emotionally connected, and most urgent staging of the 1943 Pulitzer Prize winner I have ever encountered, or hope to encounter.</p>\n<p>Written during World War II’s early days, when an Allied triumph over the Axis was far from certain and may even have been in doubt, <em>Skin </em>went out on a limb to suggest that the triumph of Right was foreordained. Inevitable. Even more significantly, it dared to do so largely through the medium of chaotic comedy, of the sort Olsen and Johnson had brought to Broadway in low vehicles like <em>Hellzapoppin</em> and <em>Sons o’ Fun. </em>Those comics had chorus girls jumping into patrons’ laps, or the repeated plaintive wail “Chloe! Chloe!,” or a man wandering the aisles with a potted tree that kept getting bigger and bigger. In a similar, fourth-wall-breaking way, the stage manager of <em>Skin </em>steps out to announce that five cast members are out with food poisoning, to be replaced with ringers. Another character asks the audience to hand up its chairs for burning, in order to hold back the encroaching glaciers of the new ice age.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/25/the-skin-of-our-teeth-its-so-extra/\">[<em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>More about those glaciers in a second. The point is that, as an irreverent, rollicking tribute to optimism, <em>The Skin of Our Teeth </em>is always most of the moment when things are looking bleakest in the world and there seems little to laugh about. Thornton Wilder, meet 2022.</p>\n<p>Each of the three acts centers on the Antrobus family of Excelsior, N.J.: father George, an inventor (he came up with the wheel and the lever); mother Maggie (a homebody, and the inventor of the apron); spoiled daughter Gladys; and moody son Henry, who gets mad when anyone mentions his real name (Cain) or his role in the death of elder brother Abel. Throw in Lily Sabina the maid, with echoes of Lilith and the Sabine women, and you have not-so-subtle allusions tying the fate of humanity from the Bible to the present day.</p>\n<p>Act One, always the most sprightly, has the family battling intense cold (cf. those glaciers down from Canada). The family pets, a dinosaur and a mammoth, are larger-than-life puppets, genetic ancestors of Joey in the Beaumont’s <em>War Horse </em>with the ability to murmur, &#8220;I&#8217;m cold.&#8221; The moment when they’re banished to certain outdoor death, to make room for refugee humans, carries genuine poignance</p>\n<p>Act Two shifts to Atlantic City—America’s Sodom and Gomorrah—during the 5,000th annual convention of the Fraternal Order of Humans, which just elected George its president. Sabina has become a beauty pageant contestant, bringing out her Lilith side and threatening George’s marriage. Then an ear-splitting hurricane warning promises, you guessed it, the Flood, and it’s left to the Antrobuses to sail off with two of every creature.</p>\n<p>Lincoln Center takes its one intermission here, with time to reflect on the excellences thus far: the puppetry for sure, credited to James Ortiz; Adam Rigg’s flashy yet seedy boardwalk setting; spectacular sound effects from Palmer Hefferan; and the sturdy performances by the principals, notably Gabby Beans as Sabina. That part has to carry both acts on her slim shoulders, and in 1943 the larger-than-life diva Tallulah Bankhead triumphed, director Elia Kazan having cast her famously against type. Beans, in her Broadway debut, is an Eartha Kitt rather than a Tallulah: seductive and sensible by turns, a tiger who can turn pussycat at will. I don’t know whether a leading role in a Lincoln Center revival can carry the oomph necessary to be a star-maker, but I have a hunch Beans’ future star status is pretty secure.</p>\n<p>Still, the test of the play is Act Three, with its drastic tonal shift to grief. The Antrobus home and the landscape have been razed. A war, likely civil, has just ended; you can practically smell the decay of burning flesh through Yi Zhao’s dramatic, hazy lighting. Father and son have fought on opposite sides, George with the regular army, Henry/Cain with the defeated insurgents, and there must be a reckoning. And here’s where the already fine performances reach their peak. James Vincent Meredith’s George, cluelessly avuncular in Act One, then randy in Act Two, rises to the mournful level of Biblical patriarch as he takes his son’s sins unto himself. The malevolence of Julian Robertson, as Henry, is transformed suddenly into sorrow and shame. Roslyn Ruff’s matriarch, unbowed throughout, becomes downright majestic here, bringing along Paige Gilbert’s now-glowing Gladys, who has given birth and is thus the true holder of the future&#8217;s promise. The pageant of the citizenry returning home from the wars, trudging up the burnt hills against the back wall stage right to stage left, is something I will never forget: a tableau of weary defeat, to be sure, but one of indomitability as well. And when Beans’ Sabina begins Act One all over again—in rags this time—we feel the uplift. This is where we, and humanity itself, came in.</p>\n<p>Blain-Cruz’s command of all the play’s elements, from physical scope to character intimacy, never falters. (I really look forward to what else she has in store in her Lincoln Center leadership role.) And here I realize, with some surprise, that up to now I have had absolutely no need to mention what to many will be this production’s signal innovation, the entirely non-Caucasian cast of 28.</p>\n<p>Not that the multicultural emphasis is meaningless. Of course people of color have had a particularly tough time of it across the entire human comedy, and the redoubtable playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins <em>(An</em> <em>Octoroon</em>) has been enlisted to tweak Wilder’s script accordingly. (When great past philosophers are cited, for instance, a quote by Plato has been replaced by a stinging passage from bell hooks.) And of course it’s a cause for celebration that so many actors of color are given such a prominent showcase. That <em>shouldn’t</em> be remarkable, and the hope is that, going forward, it will be routine.</p>\n<p>But what’s fascinating to discover is that the casting approach serves to make <em>The Skin of Our Teeth </em>more universal, rather than more specific or even more parochial. Identification with the Antrobuses proves to be a piece of cake, regardless of race or ethnicity, as long as the roles are played as superbly as they are here. This casting coup serves notice that we are, indeed, one family of man.</p>\n<p><strong>The Skin of Our Teeth opened April 25, 2022, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater and runs through May 29.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Go big or go home. Thornton Wilder certainly did with his Pulitzer Prize–winning 1942 play <em>The Skin of Our Teeth</em>, which follows a single family through an ice age, flood, and war—centuries upon centuries of epic catastrophes—only to begin the cycle all over again.</p>\n<p>Directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz, Lincoln Center Theater’s swing-for-the-fences revival is appropriately grand, starting with Adam Rigg’s sprawling, stunningly detailed sets. And just wait until the dinosaur and woolly mammoth puppets—designed by James Ortiz (<em>The Woodsman</em>)—make their entrances. (It’s a good thing those guys go extinct after Act One, because they’re total scene-stealers.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/25/the-skin-of-our-teeth-we-will-survive/\">[<em>Read Bob Verini’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>The first act turns the chaos of an impending ice age into a farce: Melodramatic maid/Greek chorus/lifelong pessimist Sabina (Gabby Beans, giving major Eartha Kitt vibes) and her feather duster are working overtime in the velvet-and tapestry-laden Excelsior, N.J., living room of a “typical American family,” as it’s described on the kitschy 1950s-style opening newsreel footage. George Antrobus (James Vincent Meredith) is the inventor of the wheel; his wife, Maggie (Roslyn Ruff), is a model homemaker and mother; daughter Gladys (Paige Gilbert) recites line-perfect poetry; and son Henry (Julian Robertson)… well, for heaven’s sake, just keep the slingshot away from Henry. As if the threat of freezing to death weren’t bad enough, the Antrobus living room is suddenly filled with a group of refugees—Moses, Homer, a group of Muses, and more—seeking warmth, coffee, and sandwiches. “Oh, I see what this part of the play means now! This means refugees,” says Sabina, dropping the servant schtick and reverting to the character of Latasha, aka the actress <em>playing</em> Sabina. “Don’t take this play serious. The world’s not coming to an end. You know it’s not. People exaggerate! That ice-business—why, it was a long, long time ago.”</p>\n<p>Incidentally, Latasha has quite a few opinions about this play, and she stops to share them whenever she darn well feels like it. “Oh—why can’t we have plays like we used to have—<em>South Pacific</em>, and <em>Vanya and Sonya and Masha and Spike</em>, and <em>Bootycandy</em>!—good entertainment with a message you can take home with you?” she sighs. The updated theatrical references, and additional judiciously placed contemporary material, are courtesy of Branden Jacobs-Jenkins (whose drama <em>War</em>, directed by Blain-Cruz, played at LCT3 in 2016).</p>\n<p>Thankfully, the entire planet doesn’t turn into a massive iceberg, so Act Two moves to Atlantic City in the 1920s—naturally. Between the sex in the cabana, the giant slide at the back of the stage, and the dance break, the boardwalk is the place to be. Even Sabina is there, posing as a French-accented beauty queen while secretly scheming to steal George from his wife of 5,000 (yes, 5,000) years. Amid all that chaos and choreography—props to whoever decided to blare Chlöe’s body-positivity anthem “Have Mercy”—a fortune teller (Tony winner Priscilla Lopez, looking gorgeous but in sore need of some amplification) tries to warn our hero of the next impending disaster: torrents of rain. “Antrobus! Take these animals into that boat with you,” she instructs. “All of them—two of each kind.”</p>\n<p><em>The Skin of Our Teeth</em> is <em>a lot</em>. The time-hopping, the Biblical allusions, the meteorological madness. The newsreels, the play-within-a-play, the abrupt tonal shifts. And it only gets loopier after intermission, when the audience learns that a bunch of the actors have food poisoning (never eat moldy lemon meringue pie, people) and will be replaced by four crew members. But that’s when also the play gets very real, and we find ourselves in the Antrobus home, or what’s left of it anyway. Gladys and Mrs. Antrobus have been living underground, and father and son have been fighting—but not together.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to see that <em>Skin</em> premiered in 1942, in the thick of World War II. Despite all the tragedy Wilder flung at his characters, he created a family that persevered, starting anew after each calamitous event. It’s a work of unyielding optimism in the face of incessant defeat. “Oh, the world’s an awful place,” sighs Sabina, who consoles herself by going to the movies “every now and then.” Her fellow theatergoers can  commiserate.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Skin of Our Teeth</em> opened April 25, 2022, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater and runs through May 29.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Paging all musical comedy fans. Have I got news for you! It turns out that after all the running off at the mouth about the much-publicized <em>Funny Girl </em>revival, Barbra Streisand isn’t the only one who can shake up a Broadway auditorium playing Fanny Brice. Beanie Feldstein also has the abundant charisma and the chutzpah.</p>\n<p>But because comparisons are thought odious, I’ll avoid them. And not because I didn’t see Streisand nail the role. I did—more than once, including one performance where she walked through the part, as she was often reputed to do. Moreover, I even listened to Brice herself as radio’s Baby Snooks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/24/funny-girl-fanny-is-funny-but-funny-is-flat/\">[<em>Read Bob Verini’s </em>★★☆☆☆<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>So, for the length of this review, I’m plunking down in Feldstein’s corner. She strides on stage with full confidence to sit at a dressing table where Brice is about to reflect on her life. In no time flat, she’s back in Brooklyn as the young Great White Way wannabe. She‘s already convinced her name should be in lights, and in a tearing hurry it is—in the Ziegfeld Follies, no less.</p>\n<p>Feldstein remains in tight control—director Michael Mayer certainly helps greatly—as Brice is romanced by Nick Arnstein (Ramin Karimloo) and spends the rest of the several years this tuner covers (approximately 1910-1921) raising daughter Francis Arnstein and dealing with the on-again-mostly-off-again luck her businessman-gambler hubby faces.</p>\n<p>A large spoonful of a talent, Feldstein just about has under her belt (pun on singing style intended) the comedy, the drama, and, most important, the Jule Styne-Bob Merrill score conducted by Michael Rafter. She’s mastered the slick Ellenore Scott choreography whenever it kicks up its heels. Yes, she just about does have it all in hand. As the run extends, she’s certain to eliminate the “just about” part.</p>\n<p>If she’s now using her appealing raisin-pudding face to up the ante on Fanny’s 36 expressions, she’ll likely tame the occasional mugging and return to the 36 looks lyricist Merrill assigns her. She already has down pat Brice’s frustration with and anxiety about Nick.</p>\n<p>No question Feldstein has the voice. She nails “I’m the Greatest Star” as well as “Don’t Rain on My Parade” (two versions of the same emotional fortitude). There’s also fragility to her vocals, which she handles slyly. For this revisal (Harvey Fierstein fidgeting with the original Isobel Lennart script), she brings touching emotion to the interpolated “You’re a Funny Girl,” which Styne and Merrill added to the <em>Funny Girl </em>flick. Her version of “People”—keeping in mind that comparisons are odious—is admirably touching.</p>\n<p>As the focus on any <em>Funny Girl </em>return will be Fanny’s impersonator, it’s also necessary to stress that Mayer’s production is strong in all its toplined players. Karimloo has no trouble looking the woman-wooer and wow-er. With just the right tincture of playboy sleaze, he sings accordingly. He and Feldstein guarantee that “You Are Woman, I Am Man” is the laff riot it’s intended to be. Karimloo is also handed &#8220;Temporary Arrangement,” a ditty cut from the original production, which has the unfortunate look of a temporary arrangement.</p>\n<p>Jane Lynch as Fanny’s supportive mother Rose pulls off her turns with completely winning efficiency—as do her poker-playing yente pals Mrs. Strakosh (Toni Dibuono) and Mrs. Meeker (Debra Cardona). Never mind that the tall, lean Lynch and the short, plump Feldstein don’t exacttly resemble a likely mother-daughter combo. As Brice’s tap-dancing pal Eddie Ryan, Jared Grimes uses his fleet feet to steal more than one scene. Peter Francis James is suave and flinty as Ziegfeld.</p>\n<p>Musical partisans know well that there’s a high craft level easily attained when Broadway experts go to work. No exception here. Along with Susan Hilferty’s fab period costumes come Kevin Adams’ frequently proscenium-clinging traveling lights, Brian Ronan’s immaculate sound, and the Campbell Young Associates wigs.</p>\n<p>It may be that due to the lack of depth at the August Wilson Theatre stage, set designer David Zinn doesn’t have the opportunity to meet the grandiosity Florenz Ziegfeld always promised. Nevertheless, he does much, much more than his level best.</p>\n<p>There’s no shame in <em>Funny Girl </em>not attaining full classic musical-comedy status. Original producer Ray Stark mounted it as a vehicle in honor of his wife’s famous mother. His wife? Francis Arnstein Stark. So, In light of entertainment value offered—and despite a second-act drama dip—it’s an acceptable version of most musical bios. (Remember: The trouble caused by a gambling playboy was established in <em>Show Boat, </em>in which innocent Magnolia Hawks meets, marries, and becomes estranged from gambler Gaylord Ravenal<em>.</em>)</p>\n<p>During the <em>Funny Girl</em> first act, there’s an unfortunate lapse. The extravaganza “His Love Makes Me Beautiful” is introduced as a ballad by a tenor (Daniel Beeman), but it’s really the set-up for a sight gag. Fair enough that director Mayer and choreographer Scott want to build on the fun, but the resulting ensemble routine is bumpily flat.</p>\n<p>The Act Two “Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat dance, which Styne and Merrill surely saw as a World War I response, is OK and gives Feldstein another opportunity to cavort with comic flair. (Incidentally, Brice was in the 1910 and 1911 Follies and not again until 1921.)</p>\n<p>Okay, though <em>Funny Girl</em> has its share of soft spots, not to say torn spots, it can boast about its new star, if not yet superstar. Throughout the two acts music is often heard as underscoring. Prominently recurring is the twice repeated four-note Nicky Arnstein motif: “Nicky Arnstein, Nicky Arnstein.”  As of this revival, those notes might have exiting customers happily thinking “Beanie Feldstein, Beanie Feldstein.”</p>\n<p><strong><b>Funny Girl </b>opened April 24, 2022, at the August Wilson Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>In bringing back <em>Funny Girl, </em>Beanie Feldstein and director Michael Mayer seem admirably determined to make us forget both Barbra Streisand and the 1968 film of her 1964 Broadway hit. (Streisand turns 80 today on opening night, as it happens, which may not be the surest way to put her out of mind.)</p>\n<p>Granted, Feldstein is a less than stellar singer. She’s a <em>careful </em>singer, which is to say, a dutifully trained one who’s straining not to flub, hoping we’ll tolerate the lack of brio needed to sell the likes of “People” and “The Music That Makes Me Dance.” Well, Fanny Brice, the now-largely-forgotten subject of this musical bio, was no belter either. When she took on a ballad she got by with sincerity, and when Feldstein taps into the emotion of Jule Styne’s melodies and Bob Merrill’s lyrics, she does just fine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/24/funny-girl-beanie-feldstein-easy-peasy-proves-shes-a-funny-girl/\">[<em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>Taking their cue from the real Fanny as well as the title, Feldstein and Mayer lean into their subject’s long suit, her comedy skill. They push Brice&#8217;s mugging, self-deprecating ad libs, and <em>Yiddische </em>inflections further than Streisand ever did. And since Feldstein is a gifted comedian (as we learned from the movie <em>Booksmart</em>), much of the humor lands. She unabashedly makes use of her plus size, while ignoring that her <em>punim </em>is hardly as crooked as dialogue and lyrics suggest. Just as a Cyrano needs no nose to prompt his inner torment—thank you, Peter Dinklage and James McAvoy—I daresay a Fanny Brice can use anything at her disposal to underline her outsider status, as she famously puts it, “a bagel on a plate of onion rolls.”</p>\n<p>Feldstein wrings some new twists on the big Ziegfeld number in act one, &#8220;His Love Makes Me Beautiful.&#8221; She still puts the pregnancy pillow under the wedding gown, but tosses in some more gags that add to the fun. Later, in “Rat-a-Tat-Tat&#8221; (not used in the movie, so it&#8217;s fresh), her gleeful stereotyping of “Private Schvartz from Rockavay” may push the boundaries of 2022 taste criteria, but is <em>exactly</em> in tune with the pre-Depression theatrical era, and shows us, for that moment, <em>exactly </em>why Brice was such a beloved, successful attraction.</p>\n<p>But that’s pretty much all to be said for the production, which goes all-in on a Ziegfeld Follies episodic quality and rhythm that, however diverting, shortchanges its story.</p>\n<p>Isobel Lennart’s original libretto was always derivative and thin, but at least it possesses a coherent central premise. Confident on stage, Fanny offstage is so insecure as to be instantly dazzled by her first “ruffled shirt,” gambler Nick Arnstein (Ramin Karimloo, who has no trouble dazzling anyone, in or out of shirt). Inadvertently she smothers the guy, such that he elects to turn to crime in order to forge his own stake in life. He gets caught, goes to prison, and finally turns his back on the prison that is her love. Bloodied but unbowed, she survives. Essentially it’s a knockoff of Lennart’s Ruth Etting biopic <em>Love Me or Leave Me, </em>with Nicky doing both the loving and the leaving. But as a spine on which to hang the numbers and set pieces, it’s serviceable enough.</p>\n<p>Unsatisfied with mere serviceability, fans have long dreamed of someone’s “fixing” the book. But Harvey Fierstein’s revision, tinkering with lines in Act One and including somewhat heavier alterations in Act Two, doesn’t amount to a fix. Indeed, the through-line gets ever more lost in Mayer’s attempt to throw everything at the audience in a louder-faster-funnier cavalcade, out of the evident hope we’ll be constantly diverted and not notice there’s precious little going on.</p>\n<p>David Zinn’s set is dominated by a giant brick cylinder—a turret, really, with non-practical windows; you&#8217;d not be surprised to see Rapunzel&#8217;s hair fall from it. It sits menacingly and distractingly stage center, periodically opening to reveal this scene or that dance but with no visual connection to the rest of the stage space. Ellenore Scott’s choreography is exuberant, lit within an inch of its life by Kevin Adams, who makes sure we don’t miss a seam of Susan Hilferty’s eye-popping (and, to my eye, period-respectful) costumes. But it’s all in-your-face, lacking variety and nuance. Along the way, interest in the central character and her story dries up. Minor characters have to keep reminding us what Fanny and Nick are doing, or how much time has elapsed.</p>\n<p>The principals are ill-served by songs and scenes framed like vaudeville turns. Karimloo and Feldstein are light on romantic chemistry anyway, and shoving slapstick into “You Are Woman, I Am Man” further diminishes it. (Performers&#8217; bios often operate on the tedious assumption that stars behave offstage exactly as they behave on.) A jazzy interpolated number out of the Styne-Merrill trunk, “Temporary Arrangement,” has Nick and some chorus boys dancing out his frustrations, redundantly and not credibly. Jane Lynch (Mama Brice) and her poker playing cronies, played by Toni DiBuono and Debra Cardona, have been directed to blast their punch lines face front, grinning the while, so droll quips (whether Lennart&#8217;s or Fierstein&#8217;s) don&#8217;t get the laughs they deserve.</p>\n<p>Jared Grimes is in a particularly unhappy situation as Eddie Ryan, Fanny’s early mentor. The effort to expand his role amounts to one scene in which, in less than two minutes, he proposes dating Fanny, she shoots him down, and they decide to remain Just Friends. Grimes’ tap prowess is shown off in a couple of marvelous turns (tap choreography credited to Ayodele Casel), evoking the spirit of the great John W. Bubbles, a Brice contemporary. <em>This </em>Eddie should be a Ziegfeld headliner too, but he just goes back to being Fanny&#8217;s sounding board and exposition provider, sneering periodically at Nick in a lame attempt at character conflict. If anyone was out to “fix” <em>Funny Girl</em>, they might have started with Eddie.</p>\n<p>But at all comes down to Fanny Brice, who deserves better, just as the audience deserves to know her better. She was one strong lady, as all stars must be, not a wilting cutie-poo. From the outset she&#8217;s built up as a hopeful who&#8217;s already paid a lot of dues, in stock and amateur contests. Yet no sooner does she get through telling us she thinks she&#8217;s &#8220;The Greatest Star,&#8221; than she stumbles into her debut at Tom Keeney&#8217;s (Martin Moran) crummy Brooklyn burlesque house with paralyzing stage fright. It&#8217;s a witless cliché, and a counterproductive one. If Fanny sailed onto those boards with total confidence in selling &#8220;Cornet Man,&#8221; we might start to believe she&#8217;s the unique talent who could impress a Ziegfeld (Peter Francis James). And thereafter we might buy that she&#8217;ll let nothing stand in her way, and that she&#8217;s the sort of iron lady capable of berating her husband for missing her opening night. Feldstein fights &#8220;the cutes&#8221; throughout her performance, but she can&#8217;t do it alone.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t seem the work of the Michael Mayer who so carefully shaped every cast member and moment into a seamless <em>Spring Awakening </em>ensemble. It rather reflects the Mayer of the 2011 <em>On a Clear Day You Can See Forever </em>revival<em>, </em>another problematic mid-&#8217;60s musical whose hoped-for redemption was undone by a cluttered staging, and a production idea insufficiently thought through.</p>\n<p><strong>Funny<b> Girl </b>opened April 24, 2022, at the August Wilson Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>After witnessing boiling-oil burns, point-blank executions, and dead cats, we’ve come to expect a certain amount of violence in a Martin McDonagh play. (See: <em>The Beauty Queen of Leenane</em>, <em>The Pillowman</em>, <em>The Lieutenant of Inishmore</em>, and more.)</p>\n<p>Yes, a couple of corpses pop up in his latest, <em>Hangmen</em>, now on Broadway after an extended pandemic delay following its <a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/02/05/stage-review-learning-the-ropes/\">2018 run at the Atlantic</a>. What’s most surprising are all the penis jokes.</p>\n<p>Years ago, hangman Harry (David Threlfall, best remembered from Broadway’s <em>Nicholas Nickleby</em> and as the patriarch Frank Gallagher in the original U.K. <em>Shameless</em> series) got his stuttering assistant, Syd (Andy Nyman), canned over a remark about, as Harry says, “the private parts” of a dead Manchester gangster. Huffs Syd: “I didn’t expect to have cocks thrown in me face.” (It made quite an impression: “It were enormous!” says Syd. “It weren’t just long, it were wide…”) How does McDonagh get so much mileage from the word <em>cock</em>? To his credit, he gets even more mileage out of the very common <em>hung</em>-versus-<em>hanged</em> mix-up. And who doesn’t love a good grammar joke?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/21/hangmen-gallows-humor-literally/\"><em>[Read Frank Scheck’s ★★★★☆ review here.]</em></a></p>\n<p>The first New York production of <em>Hangmen</em> had a creepier aura; this one—slickly directed by Matthew Dunster—leans more heavily into comedy, capitalizing on Threlfall’s purposely pompous puffed-chest, poker-faced delivery of the most wonderfully absurd lines. On the electric chair: “I’m told when that goes wrong they come out sizzling like a bloody steak! No thank you! I’ll have my executions without the need for fried onions if it’s all the same to you. Yank claptrap!” On the guillotine: “Guillotine’s quick but guillotine’s messy and French.” And don’t get him started on his rival, “Albert bloody Pierrepoint,” arguably the country’s most famous hangman, who apparently hung all the Nazis: “I’d’ve been happy to hang some Germans, I’d’ve been chuffed. I never liked them before the war, let alone during. The accent alone…”</p>\n<p>Now that hanging has been abolished (the year is 1965), Harry is running a pub in Oldham, outside Manchester, with his gin-drinking, cigarette-smoking wife, Alice (<em>End of the Rainbow</em>’s Tracie Bennett), and their painfully shy but phenomenally sweet daughter, Shirley (the phenomenally sweet but extremely fast-talking Gaby French), aka “our Shirley.” Their only customers seem to be the too-chatty Bill (Richard Hollis); the near-deaf Arthur (John Horton); Charlie (Ryan Pope), who spends most of his time repeating everything for Arthur’s benefit; and Inspector Fry (Jeremy Crutchley), who probably spends more time than he should at the local. “I don’t even like the pints here, but they’ve got a hangman,” he muses to no one in particular. Which probably explains why Pierrepoint (John Hodgkinson) owns a pub as well.</p>\n<p>The trouble starts when a stranger—the initially intriguing but later menacing Mooney (Alfie Allen, Emmy-nominated for his breakout role as Theon Greyjoy in <em>Game of Thrones</em>)—comes in for a pint and befriends Shirley. One minute the pair are discussing footballers, nuns, and paraplegics, and suddenly they’ve taken an extremely awkward turn into the seaside, sand, and swimsuits. Mind you, our Shirley is only 15 years old.</p>\n<p>Is Mooney a pervert? A murderer? Or just a really strange chap who likes to wind people up? We’ll never know. On all of those subjects, the clever McDonagh leaves the audience, you’ll pardon the pun, hanging.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hangmen</em> opened April 21, 2022, at the Golden Theatre and runs through June 18.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The run-down, old-fashioned pub providing the main setting for Martin McDonagh&#8217;s new play may not be the ideal place to grab a pint. More than one patron describes the overly warm libations as &#8220;smelling like piss.&#8221; It also attracts a disreputable clientele, including one patron who may or may not be a psychopathic criminal. But one thing&#8217;s for sure: you can definitely hang out there.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because the bar happens to be owned by Harry Wade (David Threlfall), formerly England&#8217;s most famous hangman before he was unceremoniously cast out of his job when the death penalty was abolished. Well, actually England&#8217;s second most famous hangman, since he&#8217;s dwarfed both in reputation and the number of hangings by the celebrated (real-life figure) Albert Pierrepoint.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/21/hangmen-martin-mcdonaghs-slick-comedy-finally-arrives-on-broadway/\"><em>[Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s ★★★★☆ review here.]</em></a></p>\n<p><em>Hangman</em> begins with a flashback, set in 1963, in which we see Harry still efficiently plying his trade. A prisoner (Josh Goulding) struggles vigorously against his fate, loudly proclaiming his innocence and, much to Harry&#8217;s annoyance, his chagrin at not being executed by Pierrepoint. But nothing stops Harry from getting on with the business at hand (the explicitly staged scene is not for the squeamish) and then hurrying out for breakfast. &#8220;I&#8217;m fucking starved,&#8221; he proclaims.</p>\n<p>The rest of the play, originally seen at London&#8217;s Royal Court Theatre, takes place two years later, when Harry is running his pub in Northern England with the help of his wife Alice (Tracie Bennett). The place attracts its share of regulars, including Bill (Richard Hollis), Charlie (Ryan Pope) and the hard-of-hearing Arthur (John Horton). The other patrons include Clegg (Owen Campbell), a journalist there to interview Harry upon the occasion of the death penalty&#8217;s abolition, and Inspector Fry (Jeremy Crutchley), a local policeman.</p>\n<p>The play&#8217;s events are set in motion with the arrival of Mooney (Alfie Allen, <em>Game of Thrones</em>), a modishly dressed young man who exudes, as even he will admit, an air of menace. He&#8217;s come inquiring about a room for rent above the pub, but alienates Alice with his hair-trigger temper, manifested when he erupts into a vicious tirade when she has the temerity to actually contact his references. He also strikes up a flirtation with the couple&#8217;s naïve 15-year-old daughter, Shirley (Gaby French, outstanding), and invites her to join him on an outing.</p>\n<p>Shirley soon goes missing, with Mooney intimating to his friend Syd (Andy Nyman) that he&#8217;s kidnapped her to get revenge on Harry and that her life is hanging by a thread. Which makes his later decision to return to Harry&#8217;s pub as if nothing had happened all the more dangerous. Harry, it turns out, hasn&#8217;t lost his taste for his former profession.</p>\n<p>Mixing pitch black comedy with genuine terror, <em>Hangman</em> reveals McDonagh at his most technically accomplished, although not his most profound. Overlong at nearly two-and-a-half hours, the play feels like an extended episode of <em>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</em>, complete with twist ending. Despite its longueurs, however, it&#8217;s wonderfully entertaining, thanks to the playwright&#8217;s gift for acerbically funny and ever-surprising dialogue, the superb performances by its well-honed ensemble, and Matthew Dunster&#8217;s marvelous staging that fully immerses you in the morbidly funny proceedings. Anna Fleischle&#8217;s set design, featuring inventive use of the overhead space, is a stunner. While the first act drags at times, the second barrels along at breakneck pace, the highlight being the unexpected arrival of Pierrepoint himself (John Hodgkinson, stealing the show in just a few minutes), who makes clear his intense unhappiness at the way Harry spoke about him in his interview.</p>\n<p>Because of some recasting, the play doesn&#8217;t quite have the impact that it did in the 2018 staging at Off-Broadway&#8217;s Atlantic Theater Company. Threlfall isn&#8217;t as engaging as Mark Addy, who mined greater humor as the prideful Harry, and Allen doesn&#8217;t exude nearly the same degree of danger as Johnny Flynn, coming across as more petulant than menacing. And do the Northern English accents have to be <em>so </em>authentic that a good percentage of the dialogue is undiscernible? Nonetheless, <em>Hangman</em> remains a wickedly perverse delight for theatergoers possessing the stomach and fortitude to go along for the ride.</p>\n<div><strong>Hangmen </strong><strong>opened April 21, 2022, at the Golden Theatre and </strong><strong>runs through June 18.

The revival of Ntozake Shange’s 1976 <em>for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf </em>is stunning in every aspect. Stunning, you ask? Hasn’t the word long since frayed and deserved consigning to the critic&#8217;s trash bin?</p>\n<p>Yes, but Shange’s 90-minute collection of poems performed by seven women, each in a designated color (Shange undoubtedly means the pun) returns the adjective to its high-wattage definition. Director-choreographer Camille A. Brown’s production stuns the daylights out of you.</p>\n<p>Myung Hee Cho’s set is stunning, featuring five large panels, three of them suspended, and dramatically brightened or darkened by Jiyoun Chang’s lights in colors that match Shange’s scheme for the characters. Justin Ellington’s sound is stunning. And the persisting original music, by Martha Redbone and Aaron Whitby, is stunning.</p>\n<p>But most stunning, of course, is the text (the slash in the title tips that poetry is about to flow). Every bit as stunning are the cast members and director Brown, who has turned Shange’s work into a dance piece as well as a theater piece. Doing so in her best stage outing in a relatively short local career, she has enhanced the <em>for colored girls </em>value.</p>\n<p>The opening and closing sequences in which the women repeatedly raise their arms in united triumph are enough to lift the performance to a spirited and spiritual level. At another moment, Brown has the seven players circle each other while making the familiar “I love you” sign: pinky up with index finger and thump forming the letter L.</p>\n<p>That demonstration of joy and community is one of several times before the concluding arm-raises that are at odds with the prevailing burden of Shange’s theatrical essay on perpetual sorrows in Black women’s lives. The sorriest? At least as expressed here: men.</p>\n<p>Speaking of being sorry about men, Lady in Blue (Stacey Sargeant) talks harshly about the innumerable times men who’ve wronged her sidle up to say they’re sorry. She wants none of it. Lady in Green (Okwui Okpokwasili) declaims about her “stuff,&#8221; how it has been appropriated by a scurrilous man (men?), and how her stuff (listeners can decide what her stuff is) remains hers to keep or to offer when she and she alone decides to offer it.</p>\n<p>Almost as an 11 o’clock turn, Lady in Red (Kenita R. Miller) tells the story of Crystal, whose violent man, attempting to force her into a marriage she considers impossible, commits a stunning—yes, stunning—crime. This one is a gasp-getter. Another point to make about it: Just about every Shange poem spoken is in the first person. Crystal’s saga is no exception.</p>\n<p>Shange brings up—compulsively, it seems—any number of subjects afflicting Black women’s lives: rape and all women&#8217;s lives, abortion, you name it, she gets on to it. Beside outpourings from the Ladies in Blue, Green, and Red, there are Lady in Orange (Amara Granderson), Lady in Brown (Tendayi Kuumba), Lady in Purple (Alexandria Wailes, who signs and speaks), and Lady in Yellow (D. Woods). Under Ellington’s kaleidoscopic lights they each throw off their own lights. Woods’ Lady in Yellow dances as if she’s a tornado tearing up the territory.</p>\n<p>Throughout Shange’s propulsive outpourings, lines regularly sting and/or amuse. Such as, “You gave it up in a buick?” Such as, “A friend is hard to press charges against/ if you know him you must have wanted it.” Such as, regarding a first Black male idol, “I never counted George Washington carver/ cuz I didn’t like peanuts.” Such as, ”I usedta live in the world/ then i moved to HARLEM.” Such as, “I had convinced/ myself colored girls had no right to sorrow.” Such as, “we deal wit emotion too much/ so why don’t we go ahead &amp; be white then.”</p>\n<p>As for this <em>for colored girls </em>revival, questions are being tossed about as to whether the play is dated— as they are with other revivals this season. The answer—as with most of those other revivals—is of the would-that-it-were sort.</p>\n<p>As I watched <em>for colored girls</em>, it occurred to me that it would make sense to pair it on a bill with an important play from earlier this season: Keenan Scott II’s <em>Thoughts of a Colored Man</em>, which could be deemed seething of an answer play.</p>\n<p>Scott&#8217;s play isn’t exactly a rebuttal to Shange, but it does trigger a funny, perhaps pertinent story about how Black women and Black men regard each other: During <em>for colored girls</em>&#8216; initial 1976 run, I wrote  an article for the <em>Village Voice </em>about how Broadway long-runs stay in shape. Interviewing a <em>for colored girls </em>cast member then, I learned she and the other actors noticed that each night of the week had taken on a different audience personality. As I recall, she said Wednesday was the night when attending Black men complained the most vociferously about how they were represented.</p>\n<p>Will this <em>for colored girls who consider suicide/when the rainbow is enuf </em>prompt the same different nightly responses? It absolutely should have the same full audiences every night as it does its terrific, uh, stuff.</p>\n<p><strong><b>for colored girls </b>opened April 20, 2022, at the Booth Theater </strong><strong>and runs through June 5.

Photo: Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The Manhattan Theatre Club couldn’t have scheduled the revival of Paula Vogel’s 1998 Pulitzer-Prize-winning <em>How I Learned to Drive </em>because they mystically sensed the arrival would coincide with a surge of skewed concentration on pedophilia. Nobody is that prescient.</p>\n<p>Neither producers Lynne Meadows nor Barry Grove &#8212; with Daryl Roth and Cody Lassen in association with the play’s original producer Vineyard Theatre &#8212; could have foreseen that just as the opening approached, Republican senators would make pedophilia the reprehensible theme of the Ketanji Brown Jackson Supreme Court confirmation hearing.</p>\n<p>They surely couldn’t have imagined that QAnon enchantress Marjorie Taylor Green, perpetual foot-in-mouth Ted Cruz, and suspected adolescent sex-trafficker Matt Gaetz would poison national air with their subsequent pedophilia accusations.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/19/how-i-learned-to-drive-costly-lessons-in-paula-vogels-pulitzer-winner/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Yet, here as an antidote to the current national affliction is, once again, Vogel’s wise <em>How I Learned to Drive</em>. In 90 minutes she views pedophilia with an overarching nuance that deserves to have an effect in the United States. Unfortunately, in the currently Dis-United States, nuance is rarely recognized and less often appreciated.</p>\n<p>So here is <em>How I Learned to Drive </em>with no less than its 1997 top players Mary Louise Parker and David Morse as respectively Li’l Bit and her Uncle Peck (as well as the returning Johanna Day). Again, they’re directed with superb finesse by Mark Brokaw. The newcomers are Allysa May Gold and Chris Myers as Vogel&#8217;s so-called Greek Chorus (in the longtime drama professor’s sly bow to Greek tragedy).</p>\n<p>Here’s the same Li’l Bit, whose Uncle Peck claims he’s loved her since he first held her as an infant. He’s allowed his illicit love to increase for 17 years and counting. Here’s the same Li’l Bit who knows there’s something “wrong” with what’s steadily transpiring between her and Peck but confesses, “I was sixteen or so before I realized that pedophilia did not mean people who loved to bicycle.”</p>\n<p>As Li’ Bit narrates her compulsive backward glance to 1969 and a few following years, Vogel depicts a pedophile’s process possibly more defined today than it was some years ago: grooming. Peck, who’s also fighting alcoholism, might be considered the poster boy for groomers. He goes about his compulsive task with disclaimers. He insists he’ll go no further showing affection than Li’l Bit wants. Then, he’ll ask instantly if going further is what she does want.</p>\n<p>He’s devious, but Vogel doesn’t restrict the questionable behavior to the chief groomer. In an early sequence, her grandmother and grandfather (Gold and Myers assuming those roles) jabber about Li’l Bit’s physical changes. Much sizable bra talk is bandied, even as Li’l Bit’s announces she wants an education, and Grandfather snarls, “Shakespeare is really going to help you in life.”</p>\n<p>Had Vogel simply gone on about Peck and family in an atmosphere where pedophilia forebodingly thrives, she might have presented a meaningful portrait of sexual and incestuous abuse but no more. That’s where her brilliance shifts into fourth gear &#8212; or, in dramaturgical terms, even fifth or sixth gear.</p>\n<p>That’s where her <em>How I Learned to Drive </em>title takes on a literal and metaphorical weight. While Peck increasingly and insidiously puts the moves on Li’l Bit, he also teaches her the rudiments and fine points of driving. He insists on her driving safely, always controlling the wheel with both hands, the right hand at three o’clock, the left hand at nine o’clock.</p>\n<p>In appealing ways, he contributes positively and lastingly on Li’l Bit’s life, so much so that she comes to value the accomplishments made under Peck’s tutelage. To enforce the good influence the uncle has on the young, Vogel gives him a monolog (how does Li’l Bit know about it?) in which Peck instructs (the unseen) Cousin Bobby in a sportsman’s fondness for fishing. When Bobby lands a Pompano but doesn’t want to kill it, Peck sets it free and assures Bobby crying is perfectly acceptable.</p>\n<p>There, too, Peck makes it difficult to charge the obsessed fellow outright. Vogel does, however, commit one error. While watching the proceedings, observers may wonder whether, despite the loose family atmosphere, no one notices what’s going on with Li’l Bit and Peck. The Greek Chorus does once, suggesting something off-kilter is occurring. But the observation is never followed up, as seems likely it would be.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, what seems a potential red flag registers as small in the context of Vogel’s otherwise smart, often comic (!) writing. In particular, Day steps into designer Mark McCullough’s spotlight on several occasions to discuss drinking etiquette. Doing so, she gets progressively inebriated.</p>\n<p>Vogel and producers also know on what side of the acting and directing their bread is buttered. Twenty-five years later and on Rachel Hauck’s attractively economical set, Parker remains the 17-year-old (and then some) she was then. Remarkable! Her version of innocence assailed and fighting back is acting at a zenith. Morse’s driven Peck, woefully at odds with a man’s instincts for civility, matches Parker. In their many appearances, Gold, Myers, and especially Day during her imbibing moments prove their worth.</p>\n<p>With an abundant playwright’s sophistication, Vogel has contributed to comprehending the fathomless complexities of human behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>How I Learned to Drive opened April 19, 2022, at Samuel J.

Photo: Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>When Paula Vogel&#8217;s Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>How I Learned to Drive</em> first opened off-Broadway back in 1997, the term &#8220;grooming&#8221; was still most often used to suggest tending to one&#8217;s appearance and hygiene—or to those of one&#8217;s pet. Times have changed, of course, and if the play itself seems prophetic in retrospect, its Broadway premiere—in a production featuring original stars Mary-Louise Parker and David Morse, and helmed by original director Mark Brokaw—comes, alas, a bit late.</p>\n<p>Since #MeToo became a hash tag, condemnations of predatory male behavior have exploded in every facet of media and entertainment, from personal accounts to editorials and documentaries pegged to specific celebrity predators. In the past few weeks alone, Netflix introduced one series tracing a particularly notorious case, <em>Jimmy Savile: A British Horror Story</em>—a chilling depiction of how the beloved BBC radio and television personality was revealed as a serial pedophile after his death—and another, <em>Anatomy of A Scandal</em>, also inspired by events across the Atlantic.</p>\n<p><em>Drive</em>, in contrast, is very much an American horror story, and its overdue arrival does not diminish Vogel&#8217;s achievement, or the painful potency of this staging—though the latter takes the form of a slow-burning ache more than a sharp sting. Alternately moving forward and backward in time, the playwright follows the twisted, tortured relationship between Parker&#8217;s Li&#8217;l Bit and her Uncle Peck, Morse&#8217;s character, who begins harboring an unhealthy interest in his niece before she even reaches her teens.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/19/how-i-learned-to-drive-paula-vogels-pulitzer-prize-winner-returns-in-highest-gear/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>As Peck is also literally Li&#8217;l Bit&#8217;s driving instructor, Vogel uses sly automotive metaphors to shift (no pun intended) from scene to scene; they&#8217;re delivered by a “Greek chorus” of three actors who also juggle parts ranging from Li&#8217;l Bit’s teenage friends to her grandparents, mother, and aunt. If these supporting characters evoke stereotypes—the nerdy boy at the school dance, the old lady who&#8217;s been with one man since she was 14 but thinks she has them all figured out—they provide wry context for the troubled journey in focus, and are adroitly played by Johanna Day, Alyssa May Gold, and Chris Myers.</p>\n<p>Having Gold and Myers in particular portray a range of ages benefits a production in which the leading actors are both 25 years older than they were when they introduced their roles. Vogel&#8217;s canny structure isn&#8217;t rigidly naturalistic, though, and Brokaw&#8217;s approach is lean enough to almost suggest a concert staging, framed by Rachel Hauck&#8217;s minimal set design.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t hurt, of course, that Parker is that rare actress who has aged gracefully while remaining astonishingly well-preserved, or that her performance mines both the sardonic humor that Vogel weaves through this harrowing portrait and the vulnerability underlying Li&#8217;l Bit&#8217;s precocity. Morse, similarly, shows us the humanity simultaneously burning beneath and masking Peck&#8217;s monstrous behavior, while performing in a lower key: His voice low and soft, his manner sensitive and sometimes halting, the actor reveals his character as at once dangerously manipulative and deeply conflicted, loathsome and pitiable.</p>\n<p>While there is no excuse for the lasting damage that Peck wreaks on Li&#8217;l Bit, Vogel points out that such men seldom appear in the world as they do in news articles; it&#8217;s precisely by fitting in that they&#8217;re able to do such irreparable harm. It&#8217;s a valuable reminder, and however familiar the subject matter of <em>How I Learned To Drive</em> may now seem, the play and this production will haunt you.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>How I Learned to Drive opened April 19, 2022, at Samuel J.

Photo: Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Tracy Letts&#8217; new play proves the definition of a &#8220;slow burn.&#8221; Most of the running time in <em>The Minutes</em> is concerned with the minutia of a city council meeting in the nondescript town of Red Cherry, located somewhere in the Midwest. Before the meeting officially begins, the eleven members make small talk, some of it about the recent death of the mother of one of its newest members, Mr. Peel (Noah Reid, <em>Schitt&#8217;s Creek</em>), which caused him to miss the last one. As it commences, they proceed to debate such topics as building a new accessible fountain in the town square and the proper disposal of dozens of bicycles recovered by the police. Mr. Peel seems mostly concerned that the minutes of the last meeting, during which one of the members, Mr. Carp, was unceremoniously removed from the council, are not available.</p>\n<p>Doesn&#8217;t exactly sound riveting, right? Sure, there are amusing moments along the way, many of them provided by the ramblings of the longest-serving council member, the aptly named Mr. Oldfield (stage and screen veteran Austin Pendleton, hilariously stealing the show). There&#8217;s also the nonsensical proposal of Mr. Blake (K. Todd Freeman), the council&#8217;s sole African-American, for the town to create a &#8220;Lincoln Smackdown&#8221; in which a mixed-martial artist dressed as Honest Abe would take on all comers in a steel cage match.</p>\n<p>But the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright has more weighty things on his mind, as hinted by the dark and stormy night in which the proceedings take place. The often-heated discussions are frequently interrupted by the sounds of torrential rain and thunder, the lights frequently flickering ominously. He also has a major stylistic surprise up his sleeve; by the 90-minute play&#8217;s end, it has become something entirely different.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/17/the-minutes-so-much-promise-so-little-payoff/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Audience mileage will vary on the play which transforms itself from a satirical comedy about small-town bureaucracy to a dark vision of historical revisionism and collective guilt. Lett&#8217;s audacious conceit doesn&#8217;t fully work in its lengthy build-up and abrupt transition to surrealism. But it&#8217;s nonetheless a bracing and fascinating attempt to wrestle with deep moral themes.</p>\n<p>Previously seen at Steppenwolf, the play has been superbly staged by Anna D. Shapiro (<em>August: Osage</em> <em>County</em>), who has assembled a crack ensemble who at times seem almost overqualified for their roles. Letts himself plays the town&#8217;s mayor who presides over the meeting with equal measures of gentility and ill-concealed impatience. Jessie Mueller, best known for her acclaimed turns in the musicals <em>Waitress</em>, <em>Carousel </em>and <em>Beautiful: The Carole King Musical</em>, assumes the decidedly non-singing role of the meeting&#8217;s records-keeper who mutters &#8220;my bad&#8221; after repeatedly calling out the name of the removed council member (you keep hoping she&#8217;ll burst into song). Ian Barford, Cliff Chamberlain, Danny McCarthy, Sally Murphy and Jeff Still, all making vivid impressions, form the rest of the ensemble.</p>\n<p>You get a hint at the strangeness to come when, in the middle of the meeting, the members, except for the newcomer Mr. Peel, spontaneously perform an elaborate reenactment of the 1872 &#8220;Battle at Mackie Creek,&#8221; the victory over bloodthirsty Indians that has defined the town ever since. But, as we eventually learn, that local history, as well as the town&#8217;s name, is built on a web of lies.</p>\n<p>Letts inserts sly social commentary into the seemingly mundane dialogue, as when Mr. Oldfield, attempting to recall when he first heard of the legendary battle, comments, &#8220;Church, I think, or school. I can&#8217;t tell the difference.&#8221; He also hits the play&#8217;s thematic nail on its head when the mayor chillingly declares, &#8220;History is a verb.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>The Minutes</em> doesn&#8217;t fully live up to its considerable ambitions, and would probably be more effective in a smaller venue than Studio 54, more commonly a home for musicals. But it&#8217;s the kind of serious work that provokes passionate debate and will linger in your memory. How often do we see that on Broadway?</p>\n<p><strong>The Minutes opened April 17, 2021, at Studio 54 and runs through July 24.

Photo: Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The newest play from <em>August: Osage County</em> Tony and Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts, <em>The Minutes</em> lasts only 90. And in that hour and a half, it tackles local politics, revisionist history, and quite possibly murder.</p>\n<p>But first, the men of the Big Cherry city council—Mr. Blake (K. Todd Freeman) and Mr. Hanratty (Danny McCarthy, recently seen as Bridget Everett’s shifty brother-in-law on HBO’s <em>Somebody Somewhere</em>), to be specific—must debate the words <em>impaired</em> versus <em>disabled</em> versus <em>handicapped</em>. Then they need to discuss the meaning of <em>semantics</em> versus <em>nomenclature</em>.</p>\n<p>The 39-year council veteran, Mr. Oldfield—played by actor, director, and ever-so-sly scene stealer Austin Pendleton—announces that he’d like to talk about parking. Wait! Everyone needs to weigh in on whether or not this actually qualifies as an announcement. “Announcing what you’d like to talk about is not an announcement, any more than announcing that you’re going to the bathroom,” Mayor Superba (played by Letts), uh, announces.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/17/the-minutes-daring-in-both-style-and-substance/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Then Ms. Innes (Blair Brown) wants to read a statement, essentially a rah-rah declaration of support for the annual Big Cherry Heritage Festival. (Don’t miss this almost throwaway line: “Sure, over the years, we’ve had our dust-ups and differences, tete-a-tetes over policy, clashes of personalities, to say nothing of a certain rape and subsequent abortion, but that’s all water under the bridge.”)</p>\n<p>Small minds continue to clash over assorted small-town issues: Hanratty is proposing an accessible redesign of the city’s central fountain. Sniffs Mr. Breeding (Cliff Chamberlain): “I don’t know that normal people should have to suffer an onerous tax burden just so your sister can wheel up to a fountain.” Unfortunately, the project’s only other supporter is newcomer Mr. Peel (<em>Schitt’s Creek</em>’s Noah Reid). Far more popular—believe it or not—is Blake’s “Lincoln Smackdown” idea, which involves a cage match between a challenger and a mixed martial artist dressed as the 16th president. Gushes Innes: “I love Abraham Lincoln. And violence.”</p>\n<p><em>The Minutes</em> seems to comprise nothing more than a collection of quirky characters—the heavily medicated Ms. Matz (Sally Murphy), who hand-squeezes her own grapefruit juice mid-meeting, might be the nuttiest of the mixed nuts—until Peel keeps picking at the topic of last week’s missing minutes like the proverbial scab. Then Letts spins his satire into something of a black comedy—involving Big Cherry’s lavishly embroidered origin story, which the council members reenact with great gusto—and <em>The Minutes</em> spins entirely out of control.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Letts is making a statement about whitewashing American history, but he hauls out an entirely new character—the heretofore absent but much-discussed Mr. Carp (<em>Linda Vista</em>’s Ian Barford)—to do it, yielding less a moment of enlightenment and more of a screed. As for the mystifying ritualistic ending…perhaps Oldfield says it best. “Now friends, I fully expect you’re going to throw me on the floor and kick me in the face,” he says, “but I assure you I have no idea what is happening.” The feeling, regrettably, is mutual.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Minutes</em></strong><strong> opened April 17, 2022, at Studio 54 and runs through July 24.

Photo: Richard Termine</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a reason that David Mamet&#8217;s <em>American Buffalo</em> has been performed innumerable times since its 1975 premiere. This drama about a trio of low-level hustlers offers a smorgasbord of acting opportunities for its three male leads, and with its central character Teach, a histrionic role to rival Mama Rose in <em>Gypsy</em>. Except that Teach doesn&#8217;t deliver a showstopping 11:00 number, but rather a veritable aria of four-letter words.</p>\n<p>The current Broadway revival seems designed to showcase Sam Rockwell, who has often played fast-talking, dim-witted and often racist characters in his illustrious career, as exemplified by his Oscar-winning turn in <em>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</em>. The role of Teach seems tailor-made for him, much as it did for Al Pacino decades earlier, and, not surprisingly, he kills in the part. But what makes this production so successful — unlike its previous, mediocre Broadway revival in 2008, starring John Leguizamo, Cedric the Entertainer and Haley Joel Osment, which only lasted a week — is that his co-stars are equally up to the challenge.</p>\n<p>Laurence Fishburne&#8217;s portrayal of Donny, the larcenous junk-shop owner who sets in motion an ill-conceived plot to burglarize the home of a coin collector, is the strongest I&#8217;ve ever seen (and I&#8217;ve seen a lot). His Donny is not just a friend and foil to Teach, but a complexly enigmatic figure simmering with a rage only barely concealed by his surface geniality. Throughout the evening, Fishburne uses his richly deep voice and imposing physicality to cannily restrained effect, which makes his violent eruption near the play&#8217;s end, when Donny goes after Teach with violent ferocity, all the more frightening. And his cowering in fear every time a police car cruises by the shop all the more pathetic.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/14/american-buffalo-david-mamets-classic-retains-its-classic-status/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆  <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Bobby, the young junkie who acts as a go-fer for the other men and who repeatedly shows up asking for money, is a thinly written character by comparison. But Darren Criss, more used to being a Broadway musical leading man with his previous turns in <em>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</em> and <em>How to Succeed in Business</em>, does extremely well with the role, suppressing his heartthrob looks with a hangdog physicality and strangulated demeanor. As he previously demonstrated with his Emmy-winning turn in TV&#8217;s <em>The Assassination of</em> <em>Gianni Versace</em>, he&#8217;s got serious dramatic acting chops, and his decision to further develop them with this supporting turn proves wise.</p>\n<p>Rockwell plays Teach with the requisite live-wire intensity that we&#8217;ve come to expect, and doesn&#8217;t disappoint. He&#8217;s also often hilariously funny, cutting a ridiculous-looking figure in his horrendous, period-appropriate plaid polyester pants, lavender shirt and Members Only jacket. He amusingly leans into Teach&#8217;s ineptitude at crime, shrugging off Donny&#8217;s question about how he plans to get into the house they intend to rob. &#8220;There&#8217;s always something,&#8221; he says blithely. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see when we get there.&#8221; By contrast, he takes his position in the world very seriously, serving as a symbol of the pursuit of the American dream that is all too often fruitless. &#8220;I&#8217;m a businessman,&#8221; Teach asserts with no trace of irony. &#8220;I&#8217;m here to do business.&#8221; And business, as Mamet has shown us time and time again, is a matter of dog eats dog.</p>\n<p>Director Neil Pepe, the longtime artistic director of Atlantic Theater Company who has frequently collaborated with Mamet, proves fully attuned with the playwright&#8217;s rhythms with his taut, fast-paced staging. There are times when the production veers too heavily into the play&#8217;s humor at the expense of its menace, but it&#8217;s consistently engrossing and the actors display an ease and comfort with the material for which he obviously deserves much credit.</p>\n<p><em>American Buffalo</em> offers a feast not only for its performers, but also its set designers. Scott Pask has seized the opportunity with gusto, providing a richly tacky setting so laden with bric-a-brac, including many objects suspended overhead, that every thrift shop and Goodwill store in town must surely be stripped bare.</p>\n<p>Mamet himself hasn&#8217;t done this production any favors with his devolution into reactionary conservatism, as demonstrated by his recent Fox News interview in which he declared that &#8220;teachers, are inclined, particularly men, because men are predators, to pedophilia.&#8221; He also appeared on <em>Real Time</em> <em>with Bill Maher</em>, where the host asked him about his assertion in his new book that it was the Left, not the Right, that had attempted a coup. Mamet unconvincingly responded that he had &#8220;misspoke&#8221; and urged readers to &#8220;skip page 2,&#8221; as if he had made a drunken outburst at a party rather than committing his views to print. There will be some, no doubt, who will choose to avoid seeing Mamet&#8217;s plays due to his current viewpoints.</p>\n<p>But that shouldn&#8217;t stop anyone from seeing this superbly acted production of one of his most important plays. As with Richard Wagner and T.S. Eliott, among a depressingly large number of others, one has to separate the artist from his work.</p>\n<p><strong>Am</strong><strong>erican Buffalo </strong><strong>opened April 14, 2022, at the Circle in the Square and </strong><strong>runs through July 10.

Photo: Marc Brenner</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>If you’ve ever wanted to see 900 people hold their collective breath, get thee to the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Harvey Theater and wait—just wait—for the balcony scene in the Jamie Lloyd Company’s sizzling <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>.</p>\n<p>“I love you, I need you, I want you, I go to sleep thinking about you and wake up with your voice winding through my head,” begins our intrepid hero, Cyrano (James McAvoy). He’s wooing his beloved Roxane (Evelyn Miller) under cover of night—and technically in the voice of her beloved Christian (Eben Figueiredo)—but he’s speaking from the depths of his about-to-be-shattered heart. “I burn myself alive for you, I worship you, I strip you, I clothe you, I do up the tiniest buttons at your sleeve.… all I can say is I want ― I want ― I want ―” Cyrano has never been so hot.</p>\n<p>Of course, there’s actually no balcony to speak of in this barest-of-the-bare-essentials British import production. Nor are there any swords, foppish white plumes, or frilly 17th-century French fashion (as in <em>Betrayal</em>, also directed by Jamie Lloyd, designer Soutra Gilmour sticks to contemporary clothing in cool blues and grays). All the props have pretty much been dispensed with. And that includes The Nose. “When you first see it you say to yourself NO! ―/ that is a party-trick ― take it off, Cyrano,” says Madame Ragueneau (Michele Austin), attempting to describe the magnitude of the man’s deformity. “You expect him to reach up and somehow unscrew it./ But the damage is done: he can never undo it.” So yes…you’ll just have to imagine that McAvoy is in possession of the humongous, hideous schnoz everyone on stage can’t stop talking about.</p>\n<p>In previous productions—including one that Lloyd directed on Broadway in 2012 starring Douglas Hodge (a far more traditional version)—Cyrano has garnered more pity than admiration, despite his skilled swordplay and wordsmithery. Yet here, as soon as McAvoy’s Cyrano, in a well-worn T-shirt and shit-kicker boots, barrels onstage to destroy Valvert (Nari Blair-Mangat) in a rap battle–style “rapier lesson,” we are completely won over by Cyrano’s I’ll-fight-anyone-in-this-room attitude, not to mention his unbridled passion for poetry. Later, he goes off to fight 100 men who are about to descend on his F-the-establishment scribe pal Lignière (Nima Taleghani)—“I’ll give those hundred men a lesson/ in free-speech and the writer’s right to self-expression,” he insists—and emerges with barely a scratch. Making his New York stage debut, McAvoy—who previously partnered with Lloyd in <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>The Ruling Class</em>, and <em>Three Days of Rain</em>—is dominant from the jump, spitting rhymes like a mad-genius slam poet on speed.</p>\n<p>And it’s not only the physical production that’s stripped down. Lloyd stages many of the scenes with the actors facing front—almost concert-style—with military-precision blocking. It’s low-key and unfussy, and puts the spotlight squarely on the verse. (The very free, and very accessible, adaptation of Rostand’s text is by playwright Martin Crimp.) In case you were confused about the star of the show, just read the phrase on the back wall: “I love words, that’s all.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em></strong><strong> opened April 14, 2022, at the BAM Harvey Theater and runs through May 22.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Imagine a low-energy version of Cirque du Soleil accompanied by visual projections reminiscent of an overly busy screensaver, and you have some idea of the new theatrical adaptation of <em>The Little Prince</em>. Based on the classic 1943 novella by Antoine de Saint-Exupery that has long captivated readers young and old alike (its charms have always been lost on me), this French production arrives for a limited Broadway engagement after previous runs in Paris, Sydney and Dubai.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read the source material and thought, &#8220;What this material really needs is interpretive dance,&#8221; then this is the show for you. Librettist/co-director Chris Mouron, who also serves as narrator, recites excerpts from the book, including lines of dialogue from many of its characters, while an ensemble of dancers, aerialists, and acrobats go through their unexciting paces. The not-so-magical results will bring you back to your childhood, assuming you spent much of your childhood napping.</p>\n<p>The production&#8217;s international travels seem appropriate, since audiences of every nationality are bound to be confused while watching it. Even if you&#8217;re familiar with the book, you&#8217;ll be unlikely to follow the abstract proceedings which feature many of the performers being lifted overhead, as if they were desperately attempting to escape the theater&#8217;s confines. It doesn&#8217;t help that green-haired narrator Mouron speaks in such a thick and cloying French accent that it becomes necessary to read the projected captions presented on both sides of the stage. Finally, a Broadway show that promotes reading!</p>\n<p>Devotees of the book, involving the titular character (Lionel Zalachas) relating a series of allegory-laden, philosophical stories to a desert-stranded aviator (Aurelien Bednarek), will recognize many of the whimsical episodes involving such figures as The Rose (Laurisse Sulty), The King (Joan Bertrand), The Vain Man (Antony Cesar), The Drunkard (Marie Menuge), and The Snake (Srilata Ray), the last played so memorably by Bob Fosse in Stanley Donen&#8217;s equally misbegotten 1974 film musical adaptation of the book.</p>\n<p>But almost none of the message-laden tales register, thanks to the blandly similar, abstract manner in which they&#8217;re presented. The modern-style dances created by director/choreographer Anne Tournie, mainly consisting of duets or solos, never make much of an impression, and the acrobatics and aerial work, while competent, pale in comparison to those seen in the much grander-scaled Cirque du Soleil extravaganzas. Peggy Housset&#8217;s costumes are suitably colorful, but perversely so often hide much of the performers&#8217; bodies that there are times when you feel you&#8217;re watching a puppet show.</p>\n<p>As for the trippy digital visuals projected on both the rear and floor of the stage, suffice it to say that they would presumably seem far more impressive if augmented by hallucinogenics. The sickly sweet, pre-recorded music (hey, live musicians cost money) composed by Terry Truck seems designed for people who think Yanni is too cutting-edge. There are a couple of songs, both sung in French, presumably so the few Parisians in attendance will feel at home.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to say for whom the show is intended. Children, the presumed target audience, are likely to be bored out of their minds (thankfully, there&#8217;s an intermission to provide them the opportunity to vent), while baffled adults will find their stamina tested by the 110-minute running time which seems to go on forever. The overblown but underwhelming production seems lost in the vast Broadway Theatre, but probably would have seemed right at home in the intimate New Victory.</p>\n<p>There will be some, no doubt, who will find the proceedings magical and transporting. After all, lava lamps were once all the rage.</p>\n<p><strong>The Little Prince </strong><strong>opened April 11, 2022, at the Broadway Theatre and </strong><strong>runs through August 14.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The odd thing about the eccentric but engaging <em>Birthday Candles</em>—one of many odd things about Noah Haidle’s new play, now on Broadway at the American Airlines Theatre—is that no one ever eats any cake.</p>\n<p>Ernestine Ashworth (<em>Will &amp; Grace</em> star Debra Messing) spends the entire show making her signature birthday cake: dutifully cracking eggs, leveling flour and baking powder, measuring milk and vanilla, creaming butter and sugar, and so on. Eventually, she brings the finished product out of the oven—it smells heavenly!—and she dumps it into the trash. Don’t be surprised when you hear gasps throughout the audience. That’s how invested theatergoers are in the creation of this confection.</p>\n<p>We watch Ernestine age from 17 to 107—through marriage, parenthood, grandparenthood, and beyond—marking every birthday with from-scratch Golden Yellow Butter Cake. At age 17, the “recipe” isn’t very important to Ernestine. “Atoms left over from creation,” says her mother, Alice (Susannah Flood). Sighs Ernestine: “Stardust. The machinery of the cosmos…” She’s much more concerned with prepping for her <em>King Lear</em>—sorry<em>, Queen Lear</em>, “a feminist interpretation”—audition. “Because if Donna Kaplan gets the lead in another school play I’ll die.” Spoiler: Ernestine does not die. Long live the queen.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/10/birthday-candles-casts-a-dim-theatrical-flame/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The following year, while Ernestine is making that very cake, she refuses an invite to the prom from Kenneth (<em>Veronica Mars</em>’ Enrico Colantoni), and accepts one from Matt (John Earl Jelks), her eventual husband. Many years later, that’s when her son Billy (Christopher Livingston) brings home his jumpy future wife Joan (Crystal Finn, in a roaringly funny Broadway debut), who ends up hyperventilating into a utensil crock after an embarrassing remark about Finish Me Off nail polish. (Incidentally, Haidle could have quite a side hustle naming nail lacquer. A few of his gems: Bang the Dream; Oops Not There, Senator; Yes, Right There, Madame Secretary.) The kitchen—on her birthday—is also where Ernestine holds her first granddaughter, and her first great-granddaughter. Does anything significant happen to this woman outside of the kitchen—or on any other day of the year?</p>\n<p>There might be life beyond the walls of Ernestine’s expansive Grand Rapids, Michigan, kitchen, but <em>Birthday Candles</em> isn’t interested in it. (Your first clue that <em>Birthday Candles</em> doesn’t take place in the real world as we know it comes from Christine Jones’ fantastical set: pots and pans, musical instruments, stuffed animals, and assorted bric-a-brac hanging from above—a lifetime of memories scattered across the sky like stardust.) Haidle has a bit of a knack for creating alternate universes in his plays. His 2005 pitch-black comedy <em>Mr. Marmalade</em> centered on a precocious 4-year-old girl and her hard-drinking, coke-snorting imaginary friend. His 2016 <em>Smokefall</em> set an entire scene between two chatty fetuses in utero. A woman aging 90 years in 90 minutes actually seems a bit ordinary by comparison. And perhaps because there’s so much to cram in—again, 90 years in 90 minutes—Ernestine only grows older; she doesn’t really <em>grow</em>.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, whether she’s wearing a ribbon in her hair and bouncing around the room as teenage Ernestine or slouchy knee-high stockings and shuffling slowly about as nonagenarian Ernestine, Messing is an absolute delight. And she’s beautifully matched with Colantoni, a total charmer as the geeky boy next door and later the geeky geezer next door. You might say they take the cake.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Birthday Candles</em></strong><strong> opened April 10, 2022, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through May 29.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Listening to the cacophony of sniffles and laughs that emanated from the audience at the American Airlines Theatre, it was hard not to think of that famous line from Noel Coward&#8217;s <em>Private</em> <em>Lives</em>: &#8220;Extraordinary how potent cheap music is.&#8221; Substitute &#8220;playwriting&#8221; for &#8220;music,&#8221; and you have some idea of the manipulative hokiness of <em>Birthday Candles</em>.</p>\n<p>This play by Noah Haidle (<em>Mr. Marmalade</em>, <em>Smokefall</em>) receiving its New York premiere by the Roundabout Theatre Company, is less indebted to Coward, however, than Thornton Wilder. Like Wilder&#8217;s one-act <em>The Long Christmas</em> <em>Dinner</em>, <em>Birthday Candles</em> spans 90 years and concerns several generations of a family. And like his <em>Our</em> <em>Town</em>, it deals with existential issues of lives both well-lived and not.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Haidle&#8217;s dramedy lacks the bracing acerbity marking Wilder&#8217;s plays, which are too often erroneously labeled as treacly and sentimental. As we watch its central character, Ernestine (Debra Messing) age from 17 to 107, we&#8217;re more often reminded of life&#8217;s banality than its specialness. When she declares as a headstrong teenager, &#8220;I&#8217;m a rebel against the universe!&#8221; you find yourself counting the minutes until her dreams are thwarted.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/10/birthday-candles-a-quirky-time-hopping-rom-com/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★☆☆ </a><em>review here.</em>]</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no shortage of significant events occurring in the evening&#8217;s fast-paced but paradoxically slow-moving 90 minutes. Characters fall in love, get married, have children and grandchildren, become infirm, and die. Hopes and ambitions are both realized and abandoned, and joy and tragedy are doled out in fairly equal amounts. The one constant is that the scenes always take place on Ernestine&#8217;s birthdays, during which she resolutely bakes a cake, and that all the action occurs in the expansive kitchen of her family home in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>\n<p>For all the baking going on, however, <em>Birthday Candles</em> remains stubbornly half-baked. Other than the obvious platitudes about the inevitability of change and loss the more life goes on, there are none of the insights that would make you sit up and take notice. There&#8217;s a shallowness to the proceedings that give the evening the feel of an attenuated variety show sketch. The dialogue rarely rises above the pedestrian, and the running gags, such as a character repeatedly sneaking up on Ernestine until she emits a started scream, get old as fast as the characters.</p>\n<p>The passage of time, signified by the periodic sound of a bell, is often cleverly rendered via props and costumes. With the exception of Messing and Enrico Colantoni (<em>Veronica Mars</em>) — the latter playing Kenneth, a neighbor of Ernestine&#8217;s who pines for her for decades — the rest of the ensemble (John Earl Jenks, Crystal Finn, Susannah Flood, Christopher Livingston) skillfully embody multiple roles, often changing characters or ages from one moment to the next.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why Messing wanted to star in the play. She&#8217;s onstage for the entire running time, and effectively conveys her character&#8217;s aging solely through body language and vocal changes. The actress delivers a winning performance, with her innate charm and comic chops, not to mention the audience goodwill she&#8217;s generated over the years on <em>Will and Grace</em>, putting the audience firmly in her camp. Colantoni generates laughs and pathos in equal amounts as the haplessly lovelorn Kenneth, and Finn stands out as Ernestine&#8217;s daughter Joan, among other characters. Special mention must also be made of the onstage goldfish who virtuosically represents Ernestine&#8217;s dozens of fish over the years and who receives its own curtain call.</p>\n<p>Christine Jones&#8217; homey kitchen set feels properly lived in, and the whimsical assemblage of various objects suspended overhead provides a nice cosmic touch. John Gromada&#8217;s ethereal sound design and Kate Hapgood&#8217;s delicate music add to the overall <em>Twilight Zone</em> effect without being too heavy-handed.</p>\n<p>For many, <em>Birthday Candles</em> will no doubt prove deeply moving, especially since it inevitably deals with so many relatable issues for both young and old. And if I&#8217;m being honest, there were moments that got to me as well, proving that there&#8217;s still something resembling a heart beneath this curmudgeonly exterior. But then, I&#8217;ve always found cheap music extraordinarily potent.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Birthday Candles </b>opened April 10, 2022, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through May 29.

(Photo: Joan Marcus)</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot can change in nearly 20 years. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Me Out</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Richard Greenberg’s imaginative comic tragedy about the fallout after a top-of-the-world baseball player casually decides to announce he’s gay, debuted on Broadway in February 2003. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bowers v. Hardwick</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the 1986 Supreme Court decision finding no right to private sex acts between same-sex partners, was still the law of the land. Nowhere in the United States could same-sex couples legally marry. And no active player in any of the big four American pro sports leagues had ever come out as gay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, a lot can change: By the time </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Me Out</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> closed at the Walter Kerr eleven and a half months later, the Supreme Court had found, in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lawrence v. Texas</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a right to private sexual activity. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts had determined that its state constitution guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry. Later, in 2015, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obergefell v. Hodges </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made same-sex marriage legal nationwide. And yet, as of today, in America’s big four pro sports leagues there have been two out gay players—one, the NBA’s Jason Collins, retired one season after coming out; the other, the NFL’s Carl Nassib, was released a few weeks ago by the L.A. Raiders. Which means that, right now, there are once again no active gay players in any of the four big pro sports leagues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some ways, not a lot has changed in nearly 20 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is not great for the arc of the moral universe (which in any case feels these days to be nearly collapsing in on itself). But it is good news for the excellent revival of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Me Out</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that opened tonight at the Hayes, where Greenberg’s work somewhat surprisingly feels just as of-the-moment today as it did almost two decades ago.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/04/take-me-out-a-solid-three-bagger/\">Read Bob Verini’s ★★★★☆ review here.</a>]</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Me Out</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> debuted in Bloombergian, prosperous, post-9/11 New York, when things were looking up and the Yankees had won four out of five World Series at the tail end of the 1990s. The team was led then by shortstop Derek Jeter, handsome, disciplined, well-mannered, biracial, superhuman, beloved. Greenberg’s flight of fancy was to consider that someone just like Jeter—someone to whom everything came naturally, to whom the normal laws of gravity seem not to apply—might see it as no big deal to tell the world, and his teammates, that he’s gay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, when the Jeter-like Darren Lemming (Jesse Williams, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grey’s Anatomy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> star) outs himself, he sets himself and his team, the Yankee-like Empires, on an inexorably tragic path.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tale is narrated by the “intellectual” teammate, Kippy Sunderstrum (now played by Bill Heck), and has a second quasi-narrator in Mason Marzac (Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who needs no introduction), the nebbishy gay business manager who’s been assigned to Darren’s account and, charmed by this newly gay hero, suddenly falls in love with the sport of baseball. The clubhouse is rounded out by a roster of archetypes, plus a stalwart skipper, who ends up being not quite as noble as he at first seems. There’s also Darren’s best friend, a player on a rival team, Davey (Brandon J. Dirden) who happens to be a religious family man, who inadvertently sets the pending crisis in motion and who, inevitably, suffers most for it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Greenberg’s script remains as sharp and funny as it was 20 years ago, full of both quippy one-liners and wise monologues on the meanings of life and baseball. Ferguson gives an extraordinary performance as Marzac, wracked with awkwardness, thrilled to be star-adjacent, tearing through those philosophical monologues. As narrator-intellectual Kippy, Adams is equally strong, the even-keeled, avuncular center of the plot’s chaos. Williams is the production’s weak link, playing a cipher but with such cool affect as to drain this allegedly magnetic center-field star of any real charisma.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(A side note on Williams’ who&#8217;s-who bio: A recurring joke of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Me Out </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is that Darren considers himself nearly God. Williams describes himself as an “actor/director/entrepreneur and activist” who “is among the most impactful entrepreneurial faces in tech today” who “<em>famously</em> accepted the BET Humanitarian Award in 2016” [italics mine], and I can’t tell if this is a character-embodying parody.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scott Ellis’s staging is brisk and effective, David Rockwell’s sets impressionistically evoke Yankee Stadium, and Bray Poor’s sound design plays amusingly with the sounds of the ballpark. The nude shower scenes remain, as they must, both to force theatergoers to confront the locker-room anxiety at the center of the paucity of out gay athletes and also because even a nonprofit&#8217;s gotta put butts in the seats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two decades later, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Me Out</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in some places shows itself a bit flabby. It’s never clear why Darren and Davey were ever best friends; they don’t much seem to like each other. When Darren’s entire personality is to float apart and above, it’s strange that he’d be so undone by the up-from-the-minors bigot who insults him. And the two-and-a-half hour runtime can, by its end, feel somewhat overlong, although that’s what happens when you include two different narrators (Kippy as the straight insider, to talk baseball; Mason as the gay outsider—and presumed authorial stand-in—to wax admiring and whimsical). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it’s still relevant, still visceral, and still crackerjack entertainment.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Take Me Out </strong><strong>opened April 4, 2022, </strong><strong>reopened October 27 at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre and runs through January 29, 2023.

Adams in Take Me Out. Photo by Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>To my knowledge, in the 20 years since <em>Take Me Out </em>won the Best Play Tony, no active major league baseball player has come out of the closet. Certainly not one on the superstar level of Darren Lemming, All-Star center fielder for the fabled New York Empires, whose personal revelation is the inciting incident for what Richard Greenberg’s characters keep calling a whole lot of &#8220;mess.” The absence of that particular cultural shift in real life means that in a central sense, the work has in no way dated.</p>\n<p>Yet Greenberg&#8217;s biggest popular hit is much more than speculative fiction about fallout over a megastar’s sexuality. What’s truly impressive is the number, variety and depth of variations on the theme of personal identity that the author manages to coherently weave into his tale, most of which are successfully realized in Scott Ellis’ revival at the Helen Hayes Theater under the aegis of Second Stage.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/04/04/take-me-out-two-decades-later-and-still-swinging/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>There’s the phenom of the “pheenom,” the individual of godlike accomplishment (a comparison Darren and others make numerous times). Greenberg recognizes the dangers of extreme narcissism, when a gifted individual starts to believe their own press. (For instance, displays of ill-advised machismo on an awards show, or the announcement in a political campaign that one could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing voters.) Jesse Williams, the assured <em>Gray’s Anatomy </em>star making his Broadway debut as Darren, recognizes the peril as well, executing an absolutely smashing transformation from a larger-than-life, remote icon to a lonely little – yes, little – figure, suddenly aware that his choices have left him bereft of intimacy, with only his World Series rings to keep him warm.</p>\n<p>In that vein, Greenberg explores friendship in its many forms, particularly workplace friendship: To what extent have those thrust together by their livelihood, truly bonded? And in such possibly makeshift relationships, what is owed by one party to the other? These questions lead to a moral dilemma for Kippy (now played by Bill Heck), the Empires’ shortstop and resident team intellectual (translation: he’s read some books). Jesse Tyler Ferguson plays the key role of Mason Marzac, the gay accountant and baseball-phobe who becomes an ardent convert. Greenberg has spoken at length about his own late-in-life baseball passion, and you can feel that in the historical anecdotes and metaphorical perspectives that cascade from Mason throughout the evening. The role dovetails nicely with Ferguson’s sitcom Mitchell Pritchett, professional at work and bumbling at home. And though the droll Denis O’Hare owned the part (and a Tony) back when, the bubbly Ferguson is sweet where O’Hare was dry and makes it his own.</p>\n<p>It’s not surprising that the author of <em>Eastern Standard </em>– the first Broadway play I can remember taking on the rich/poor divide with incisiveness and wit – should have class issues on his mind, especially considering the amount of baseball talent that emerges from the poverty spectrum. Enter the utterly inarticulate, boorish, racist Shane Mungitt (Michael Oberholtzer), up from Double A Utica with a wicked fastball promising to save the Empires’ season, and a wicked mouth making him Darren’s inadvertent but inevitable antagonist. Oberholtzer is a revelation in this part. He finds multiple variations in Shane’s thick-minded cluelessness, and you can see him go to pieces by inches (paralleling Williams’ disintegration, come to think of it). At its lowest ebb, the role could devolve into sheer shouting, but this actor turns it into a heartbreaking crescendo of grief. Amazing work.</p>\n<p>Director Ellis keeps all the thematic balls in the air at a peppy pace, but with some loss of edge. A strong emphasis on humor means that moments that could be fraught are tamped down. The players’ ragging, for instance, feels much less authentically mean than in Joe Mantello’s original (which itself fell short of the All-Star sniping in the 1973 movie classic <em>Bang the Drum Slowly</em>). Antagonism of, and toward, the non-native born players (Julian Cihi, Hiram Delgado, and Eduardo Ramos) gets lost in the shuffle.</p>\n<p>Most crucially, the climactic standoff between Darren and Davey Battle (Brandon J. Dirden), his staunchly Christian best friend, is undercut by the conception of Davey as a jaunty hail-fellow, rather than as a star of equal intensity who seethes because he’s on a worse team. On past evidence Dirden can play anything, and probably the intent was to highlight the about-face when he rears back Biblically to condemn Darren as, in his words, “a pervert.” But the expected electric shock when preacher confronts pervert sputters; it’s too big of a leap.</p>\n<p>Ellis places most of the play’s gut punches – notably the two act breaks, though the second intermission is omitted – in the capably Expressionist fists of set designer David Rockwell and lighting designer Kenneth Posner. The momentary effects are achieved but curiously seem unearned, out of scale somehow to the human confrontations. More seamless is Mikaal Sulaiman’s stellar sound design, layering cheers and gasps so you can’t separate the recorded ones from the live.</p>\n<p>And isn’t that how it should be? Ellis and Greenberg evidently share the belief that baseball is the most democratic of pastimes, perhaps even more so than theater, where a commonality of values often reigns. At the stadium, wealthy and strapped, left and right, white-collar and blue- come together in a celebration of teamwork and individual skill, and this play exploring individual identity knows that the group identity of “fan” unites us. It almost makes a trip to the Helen Hayes a requirement in these polarized times.</p>\n<p><strong>Take Me Out </strong><strong>opened April 4, 2022, </strong><strong>reopened October 27 at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre and runs through January 29, 2023.

Photo: Kevin Berne</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Imagine that the Jets and the Sharks had all been buddies, and that dance at the gym had been defined by their camaraderie. That&#8217;s the vibe in &#8220;Turn My Life Around,&#8221; one of several thrilling production numbers that Bill T. Jones has choreographed for <em>Paradise Square</em>, a new musical that has thus far gotten more press for backstage drama, much of it stemming from a lead producer who has done time for fraud.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, attention can now be paid to Jones—sure to be a fierce competitor this awards season, in a category that has already seen its share of fabulous work—and some of his lavishly talented collaborators, among them leading actress Joaquina Kalukango, bound to be a top contender in that field as well.</p>\n<p><em>Square</em> is set during the Civil War in the Five Points district of lower New York, where Irish immigrants then mingled with free but destitute Black citizens in bars, gambling houses and other establishments where more respectable folk of both races would not dare be seen, even as they indulged in similar pastimes. Nelly O&#8217;Brien, Kalukango&#8217;s character, runs a popular watering hole, and has forged her own interracial family: Her white husband, Willie, is an Irish police officer, whose sister Annie is married to Samuel Jacob Lewis, a Black reverend who acts as the local stationmaster, sheltering runaway slaves seeking freedom via the Underground Railroad.</p>\n<p>When Willie goes off to fight for the Union, two young men show up in need of refuge. One is an escaped slave, whom Samuel &#8220;baptizes&#8221; Washington Henry; the other is Annie and Willie&#8217;s nephew, Owen Duignan, who is fleeing a country still reeling from the Great Famine. Washington and Owen become roommates and appear to be developing a friendship that, like so many of the relationships surrounding them, transcends differences in skin color and experience.</p>\n<p>All of this open-mindedness and good will are threatened, however, when the first federal conscription law is passed, requiring young men in the North to sign up for military service—unless they can pay their way out. Then the denizens of Five Points find themselves in a situation not unlike our own national quandary in recent years, in which the racially oppressed and the socio-economically downtrodden are turned against each other—with the wealthy and powerful poised to benefit, both politically and in their pocketbooks.</p>\n<p>Librettists Christina Anderson, Craig Lucas and Larry Kirwan and director Moisés Kaufman can paint this dynamic with a heavy hand. Aside from the struggling Irish, for instance, the white characters emerge as cartoon villains. John Dossett brings admirable diligence to one such tyrant, while Jacob Fishel plays a down-on-his-luck musician who is revealed in a plot twist as a once-beloved (if overrated) songwriter whose historical contributions to music have been overshadowed by his racism.</p>\n<p>But Kaufman, with ample support from Jones, also culls bravura performances. If Chilina Kennedy&#8217;s Annie is overwrought—I found myself wondering how the actress is going to get through eight shows a week bellowing her lines as she does—the other principals express their characters&#8217; frustration and yearning compellingly, particularly when singing or dancing. Working with step dance veterans and innovators Garrett Coleman and Jason Oremus (both featured dancers as well, though Oremus is out until mid-April due to an injury), Jones draws on both Irish and African traditions to exhilarating and gorgeously lyrical effect. Sidney DuPont and A.J. Shively, who respectively play Washington and Owen, each get physical star turns—Shively&#8217;s long legs are so agile that you may gasp when he first lifts them—though ensemble members all get opportunities to shine, individually and as a collective.</p>\n<p>While Jason Howland&#8217;s score, with lyrics by Nathan Tysen and Masi Asare and additional music by Kirwan, isn&#8217;t instantly memorable, supple-voiced cast members such as DuPont and Gabrielle McClinton, who plays Washington&#8217;s love interest, milk its more soulful nuances. Kalukango, who sang in 2015&#8217;s stunning revival of <em>The Color Purple</em> before earning a Tony nomination in <em>Slave Play</em>, reminds us what a superb vocalist and musical actress she is. Her rendering of the eleven o&#8217;clock number &#8220;Let It Burn,&#8221; building from shimmering melancholy to a defiant belt, is a master class on how to stop a show cold without resorting to melisma fits or other ostentatious gimmicks—and stop the show it did, earning a sustained standing ovation at a recent preview.</p>\n<p>The resilience demonstrated by Kalukango&#8217;s character and others in <em>Paradise Square</em> seems fitting in a show that might have been prematurely written off as the latest big musical that couldn&#8217;t. Instead, at a time when original stories and scores are becoming increasingly rare in such Broadway fare, the production delivers both a surge of energy and a flicker of hope.</p>\n<div><strong><b>Paradise Square </b>opened April 3, 2022, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre.

(Photo: Joan Marcus)</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fairly early in the endless first playlet of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plaza Suite</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Neil Simon comedy now in revival at the Hudson Theatre, the annoyed executive Sam Nash is showing off his new dental implants to his unhappy wife, Karen. “You don’t think they’re too white, do you?” he asks. “Do they look too white to you?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The line jumps out, because, yes, Sam, 50-odd years after its Broadway debut, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plaza Suite</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is definitely too white.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/03/28/plaza-suite-not-worth-asking-for-a-late-check-out/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em><em>★★★☆☆ review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t mean that purely in the ethnic composition of its characters. With certainly notable exceptions, nearly all theater from before the last few decades is about white people, which means nearly all revivals are. And, sure, there are actors of color working here. (One was an understudy, Cesar J. Rosado, stepping in for some minor characters at the performance I saw.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plaza Suite</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feels remarkably, almost obliviously, a product of its era, full of jokes about the demolition of the Savoy Plaza (across the street, where the General Motors Building now stands), secretarial hanky-panky, and lecherous producers jetting in from The Coast. It reflects a different world, a different New York, and even a different Broadway, and it’s hard to think of one good reason why it should have been revived.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it’s easy to see two reasons: Its stars, Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The acting couple has appeared on stage together only once before—for a four-month stint in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when Broderick returned to the lead role. Announced in late 2019, you could see why this pairing seemed so delicious: proud New Yorkers, married for nearly 25 years, playing three different New York couples in three state-of-marriage vignettes, crafted by an iconic New York playwright. They’re even directed by another New York actor, their friend John Benjamin Hickey, in his Broadway directorial debut.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as Broderick should have learned from his painfully unfunny post-</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Producers</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> turn in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Odd Couple</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, hoary old Neil Simon shtick does not age well. Paired then with his other famous partner, Nathan Lane, the jokes didn’t land and the two divorced men drove no one crazy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plaza Suite</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Simon considers relationships by showing us three pairings, each one checked into Suite 719 of the famed grand hotel. (No word on whether that room still exists after the 2008 renovation that turned most of the building into condos for oligarchs.) The first couple, Sam and Karen, have been married for 23 or 24 years and aren’t holding up well. In the second, a Jersey-born Hollywood poobah returns to New York and tries to spark a romance, or at least a one-night stand, with his high-school sweetheart. And in the final one, Roy and Norma Hubley try desperately to get their daughter, Mimsey, to unlock the bathroom door and head downstairs for her wedding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Broderick and Parker have worked for many years on stage and screen, but, generally speaking, Broderick is today known as the stage actor of the couple, with two Tony Awards, while Parker is the TV star. And yet it’s Parker who acquits herself best through this trio of one-acts, reminding us that she is a gifted physical performer, as good with the broad strokes of sell-it-to-the-back-row vaudevillian comedy as she is in HBO closeup. Broderick, on the other hand, seems almost miscast in the first two segments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in the third, when the two actors become the desperate Hubleys, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plaza Suite</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> finally hits its stride. (This was true, apparently, even 54 years ago, when </span><a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/02/15/79934412.html?pageNumber=49\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clive Barnes wrote in the Times</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that “the evening, after a slow start with the first [farce], warms up with the second and ends with an all-stops-out, grandstand finish with the third.”) Finally, Broderick’s slow burn has its fitting subject, Parker’s mugging and timing pays off (as does Jane Greenwood’s outrageous mother-of-the-bride costume for it), and even John Lee Beaty’s characteristically sumptuous, applause-earning set gets in on the action, as beds are hopped upon, chairs are nearly thrown, and Mr. Hubley may or may not careen down seven stories of the Plaza’s facade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, Mimsey does leave the bathroom, and Simon’s story has a more-or-less happy ending. Thanks to the well-executed face of this final section, so does the experience of watching it. But, like Mimsey in that bathroom, it’s not quite clear why we’re even doing this in the first place.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Plaza Suite </strong><strong>opened March 27, 2022, at the Hudson Theatre and </strong><strong>runs through June 26.

This triptych of one-act comedies probably seemed old-fashioned upon its original 1968 Broadway production, and certainly comes across that way in the stilted 1971 film version starring Walter Matthau. But major-league performers demand star vehicles, creaky as they may be, in the often-mistaken belief that they can bring them back to life through sheer star power.</p>\n<p>Hence the new production of Simon&#8217;s play, starring real-life husband and wife Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker in the roles originally played onstage by the formidable George C. Scott and Maureen Stapleton. Unfortunately, these likable actors only intermittently infuse comic dynamism into the dated work which needed a firmer directorial stamp than the one applied by actor John Benjamin Hickey, here making his Broadway staging debut. When a Neil Simon play gets its biggest laugh by unveiling a character&#8217;s garish plaid pants, you know that something&#8217;s not working.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/03/28/plaza-suite-feels-like-very-old-times/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>All three plays, which take place in 1968/1969, are set in Room 719 at New York&#8217;s venerable Plaza Hotel. The evening begins with the serio-comic <em>Visitor from Mamaroneck</em>, in which a long-married couple, Karen (Parker) and Sam (Broderick), are spending the night. Karen thinks she&#8217;s there to celebrate the couple&#8217;s 23<sup>rd</sup> or 24<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary — it&#8217;s a subject of debate between them — in the same room where they spent their honeymoon. Except, according to Sam, it&#8217;s not the same room, which provides a hint of the domestic discord soon to be unveiled.</p>\n<p>Sam, who&#8217;s only there because their house is being painted, makes it immediately clear that he has to work that night, offering to buy Karen a ticket to a Broadway show so she can entertain herself. But she suspects, quite rightly, that he&#8217;s having an affair with his much younger secretary (Molly Ransom). The resulting charged encounter reveals that the marriage is indeed on its last legs.</p>\n<p>The play reveals Simon working in a darker, more serious tone that he would soon expand upon with such works as <em>The Gingerbread Lady</em> and <em>The Prisoner of Second Avenue</em>, albeit still featuring many of the comic one-liners that had become his trademark. But it mainly falls flat here, due to seriously sluggish pacing and Broderick&#8217;s stodgy performance as a vain, pompous businessman. Parker gives it her all, garnering laughs with her character&#8217;s rueful asides and generating pathos with her character&#8217;s middle-aged vulnerability. But her strenuous efforts are mostly for naught.</p>\n<p>The second act&#8217;s two short comedies work better, thanks to their strictly humorous approach. But <em>Visitor from Hollywood</em> has aged badly with its sketch-like depiction of the reunion of two high-school sweethearts many years later. Jesse (Broderick) has gone on to become a big-shot movie producer, living in Humphrey Bogart&#8217;s old house and currently in town to line up Lee Marvin to star in his next project. Muriel, by contrast, is a bored New Jersey housewife with three kids who has eagerly kept up with Jesse&#8217;s movie career and has come to see him in the hotel for a quick visit. Jesse clearly has his mind bent on seduction, asking the hotel operator to hold all calls and attempting to ply Muriel with alcohol immediately upon her arrival. She&#8217;s resistant to his advances at first, but it&#8217;s soon clear from her eager inquiries about his life in Hollywood and his famous friends that she&#8217;s wavering in her fidelity. Again, Broderick proves unconvincing as an alpha male type, leaving Parker to do the heavy lifting with her perfectly timed comic delivery and energetic physicality. But what might have seemed ribald fun in the late &#8217;60s now comes across as more than a little creepy in the MeToo era.</p>\n<p><em>Visitor from Forest Hills</em> goes for pure farce with its depiction of a middle-aged couple&#8217;s efforts to coax their daughter Mimsey (Ranson) out of the bathroom in which she&#8217;s locked herself just as her wedding ceremony downstairs is about to start. Although silly to the extreme, the sketch scores the desired laughs, with Broderick finally mustering some raucous energy to match his co-star and happily engaging in such physical comedy as fruitlessly attempting to knock down a door with his body and getting drenched by a thunderstorm while walking precariously on a seventh-story ledge.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the production — given a lavish stamp with John Lee Beatty&#8217;s elegant set, Jane Greenwood&#8217;s period-perfect costumes, Tom Watson&#8217;s amusingly elaborate wigs, and Marc Shaiman&#8217;s original music — merely accentuates the fact that Simon&#8217;s brand of humor has aged badly. Broderick and Parker&#8217;s star power may bring in crowds willing to pay top dollar to see them in person, but it&#8217;s more a victory of marketing than theatricality.</p>\n<div><strong>Plaza Suite </strong><strong>opened March 27, 2022, at the Hudson Theatre and </strong><strong>runs through June 26.

Photo: David Andrako</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tony Bennett, when asked his so-called “second career” as a painter and visual artist, has said, “It’s funny, I sing two or three nights a week, but I paint six or seven hours every day, yet people always describe me as a singer who occasionally paints instead of the other way around.” Isaac Mizrahi probably actually spends more time in his first career as a designer and fashion entrepreneur (not to mention as a snippy television commentator on the subject) but his more recent role as a singing entertainer is entirely an entity unto itself.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Case in point, I had never heard Mr. Mizrahi’s name before he began appearing at the Carlyle a few years ago, yet I’m perfectly willing to anoint him as one of the most enjoyable singer-entertainers of the current moment. His greatest asset is not his voice—which on its own is nothing special—but his comic timing is terrific, and, even better, his stage personality is even larger than the oversized chiffon gardenia in his lapel.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Better still is his excellent back-up band led by pianist Ben Waltzer, with two trumpeters, Benny Benack III and Bruce Harris (the latter playing a Dizzy Gillespie-style horn with upturned bell), bassist Neal Miner, and percussionists Joe Perri and Joe Strasser.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He opened by essentially deconstructing the iconic Judy Garland-Barbara Streisand medley of “Get Happy” and “Happy Days Are Here Again” into its two individual songs, the first with its distinctive rhythmic patterns (the tom-tom pattern in the bridge, the signature stop-time breaks throughout—although I was surprised by the use of the hard bop anthem “Sidewinder” as a countermelody), the second which he accurately introduced as “a dirge about happiness.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some numbers were from songwriters we’re long accustomed to hearing in the Carlyle, though the choices were unexpected: Cy Coleman’s “You Wanna Bet” (the original lyric for the melody that became the title song of <em>Sweet Charity</em> and itself a kind of variation on “I’ve Got Your Number” from <em>Little Me</em>) and Sondheim’s “One More Kiss,” a surprisingly straightforward and unironic waltz written from <em>Follies</em>. He also reprised his lyrical update of “You’re The Top” from 2019, now with even newer items in Cole Porter’s iconic list lyric (ie, rhyming “Miley Cyrus” with “coronavirus”) and steadily rising modulations between chorus (of which there were at least five, I lost count).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He also introduced some more contemporary composers we’re not used to hearing in the Madison Avenue songbook shrine, like Brian Wilson, vis-à-vis an original lyric to the title instrumental of the classic Beach Boys album “Pet Sounds.” Taking Mr. Wilson at his word, Mr. Mizrahi sings of his love for dogs and cats and incorporates bow-wows and meows.  Here, as well as Billie Eilish’s “Everything I Wanted” and Alicia Keys’s “Girl on Fire,” Mr. Waltzer’s arrangements perform the unusual trick of making traditional acoustic horns approximate electronic instruments, resulting in some arrestingly unusual sonic textures.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mr. Mizrahi may not have the sheer vocal chops of his illustrious Carlyle predecessors Steve Tyrell and the late Bobby Short, but like them he succeeds in turning a performance into a private party, with witty, engaging banter that’s at once topical and timeless, political and personal. There’s a lot more that could be said, but to quote Mr. Mizrahi: “Brevity is the soul of wit—and lingerie.”</p>\n<div class=\"adL\"><strong>Isaac Mizrahi opened March 1, 2022, at Café Carlyle and runs through March 12.

Foster</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever attempted to learn a foreign language in a classroom setting, you know that the process can be frustrating, repetitious and often tedious.</p>\n<p>Sanaz Toosi&#8217;s play <em>English</em>, now receiving its world premiere at Atlantic Theater Company, conveys that experience all too well.</p>\n<p>Set in Karaj, Iran in 2008, the play depicts the efforts of four adult Iranians — three women and one man, ranging in age from 18 to 54 — to study for TOEFL, or Test of English as a Foreign Language, under the tutelage of their instructor Marjan (Marjan Heshat), who spent several years living in England. As they go through their various exercises, which include throwing a ball to each other while shouting out English words for things that are green or that you find in a kitchen, we gradually learn small details about their lives, motivations and feelings about learning a new language.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/02/22/english-playwright-sanaz-toossi-looks-at-language-in-so-many-wise-words/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>But not enough. The play remains stubbornly undramatic, lacking any narrative propulsion and sadly bereft of the details that would make the characters or situations interesting. Eventually, a few small plot strands emerge: a mild flirtation between Marjan and a significantly younger male student, Omid (Hadi Tabbal), who already seems to speak English surprisingly well; another student&#8217;s (Tala Ashe) inability to lessen her very strong accent, which prompts Omid to condescendingly refer to her as &#8220;Borat&#8221;; and the fruitless efforts of the oldest student in the class, Roya (Pooya Mogseni), to connect with her grown son living in America who seems to be ignoring her frequent phone calls.</p>\n<p>The young Iranian-American playwright (who also has another play, <em>Wish You Were Here</em>, premiering in April at Playwrights Horizons) seems to be interested in exploring how language affects our cultural identities. But even that promising theme feels barely addressed, and the jokes about such things as cinematic romantic comedies starring Julia Roberts prove mildly amusing at best. Cheap laughs involving the students&#8217; verbal mistakes abound. Every once in a while, there&#8217;s a resonant line of dialogue, as when one of the students comments that &#8220;English does not want to be poetry, like Farsi,&#8221; but then another rote teaching exercise begins and one&#8217;s interest quickly wanes.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t help that the dialogue, almost all actually spoken in English, alternates between English and Farsi, making it sometimes hard to tell whether the characters are speaking in their native language or the one they&#8217;re trying to learn (when speaking English, their accents disappear). And that&#8217;s when you can make the lines out; despite the theater&#8217;s intimacy, the soft-spoken performers frequently fail to make themselves heard.</p>\n<p>Director Knud Adams has staged the piece for minimum impact, making the production&#8217;s glacially paced, 105 intermissionless minutes feel much longer. Then there&#8217;s the strange design choice of an utterly unnecessary revolving set, complete with pillars, guaranteeing that at some point nearly everyone in the audience will have a partially obstructed view. Presumably this was intended to provide different views of the actors, but it would have been much simpler, not to mention cheaper, if they had simply moved seats once in a while.</p>\n<p>Other than the aforementioned vocal projection problems, the performers are not to be faulted. They make the most of their thinly drawn characters, with Tabbal delivering a charming performance as the male student harboring secrets and Neshat affecting as the teacher who finds herself questioning her values. But their efforts are not enough to prevent you from desperately wanting to cut this class.</p>\n<p><strong>English opened February 22, 2022 at the Linda Gross Theater and runs through March 20.

Andrew Cuomo went on TV every afternoon to counterprogram the White House and present the case that a New York asshole can just as easily be a force for good.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, and more happily, Hugh Jackman is bringing Professor Harold Hill’s showmanship and Think System to Broadway, where he beguilingly fulfills a similar task by showing that a spellbinder can sometimes hoodwink his marks into the best versions of themselves, that charm and smarm can be employed to fleece but not embitter us, and that sometimes mass delusion can make us all better, happier people.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/02/11/the-music-man-hugh-jackman-sutton-foster-band-together-okay/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proudly old-fashioned new production of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Music Man</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that opened at the Winter Garden Theatre last night is proof that trouble isn’t the only word to start with a T, capital or otherwise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terrific comes to mind. And, curiously enough, timely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This revival has been in the works seemingly forever. Scott Rudin’s name is no longer associated with it, but it remains very much a Rudin production: big stars, big production, big marketing. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music Man</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> signage went up on the gargantuan Winter Garden marquee very early in the pandemic—the previous tenant, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beetlejuice</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, closed in the Halcyon early-March days of 2020—and its advertising has been, Rudinishly, everywhere. Did we realize two years ago just how necessary we’d find a reminder that a flimflam artist can be fun? (I suppose we did, but who remembers two years ago.) Now, post-January 6, post-“legitimate political discourse,” with a post-vaccine never-ending virus and a post-</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stare decisis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Supreme Court, it’s lovely to be reminded of an easier time, a simpler time, a time when the grifts were merely monetary, not existential.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So let’s look back, it says, and let’s have fun. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Music Man</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is about a traveling salesman and con artist who comes to a small Iowa city in 1912 to work his scam of selling musical instruments but along the way falls for the town, and especially its librarian, and in the end changes everyone for the better, himself very much included.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The charming Jackman plays the salesman, who goes by Prof. Hill, and the beloved (if somewhat underutilized) Sutton Foster is the librarian, Marion. They are aided by a supporting cast of Broadway greats nearly sufficient to staff a mansion on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gilded Age</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. (When you’ve got Jefferson Mays as the consistently befuddled Mayor Shinn and Jayne Houdyshell as his hilariously preening wife, Eulalie Mackechnie Shinn, plus Shuler Hensley as Hill’s good-natured henchman, who even needs a movie-star leading man?) And arguably even better is the ensemble of teen and kid singers and dancers enlisted as the children of River City, especially the winsome Benjamin Pajak as young Winthrop and the fleet-footed Gino Cosculluela as the misunderstood ruffian Tommy Djilas, both in their Broadway debuts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The revival is directed by Jerry Zaks and choreographed by Warren Carlyle, and it works very much in the tradition of their last smash-hit partnership, Rudin’s 2020 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hello, Dolly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It is a blockbuster staging of a blockbuster classic, this one with a let’s-put-on-a-show patina that echoes its smalltown 1912 setting. (Santo Loquasto’s homespun, painted-on-board sets would fit nicely into the River City High School Gymnasium.) Zaks is in his element, and he milks the material for all its worth; Carlyle’s high-stepped, big-smiled, occasionally acrobatic dances feel nearly pulled from MGM Technicolor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is even a small, simple, hilarious bit of shoestring staging leading into “Wells Fargo Wagon” that brings the house down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watching the show, you’re reminded quickly of what a near-perfect script Meredith Willson created for his 1958 classic. It’s smoothly, efficiently crafted, and it’s both sweetly and cleverly funny. His score ranges from the soaring ballad “Till There Was You” to the brassy show-stopper “Seventy-Six Trombones,&#8221; with other, smaller immortal numbers along the way, like “Goodnight, My Someone” and “Gary, Indiana.” The are also so many goofily loveable patter songs that it’s a surprise one show can contain them all: “Iowa Stubborn,” “Marian the Librarian,” “Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little,” even the controversial “Shipoopi,” here rewritten for a more contemporary dating sensibility and neither noticeably better nor worse for it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But all those wonderful novelty songs aside (and I confess a weakness for novelty songs), the reason </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Music Man</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> works so well—any </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music Man</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but especially this delightfully cast and staged version—is because of that heart of gold. It’s about a changing world—the iconic, trainbound opening number “Rock City” is ultimately a lament for a disappearing smalltown America, for a time when you had to know the territory—and an argument for the power of shared dreams and shared joy. Harold Hill never really teaches the kids to play music, but, by the final scene, everyone is so enthralled to the dream that they’re thrilled by their kids’ feeble attempts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a scam with a happy ending—which, granted, is perhaps as likely as a boys band that never learns to play music. But, still, we can dream, too.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Meredith Willson, asked to define what musical comedy meant to him, once replied—in good humor—that it’s “nothing except good old garden variety entertainment.”</p>\n<p>In <em>The Music Man—</em>for which he wrote music, lyrics, and book—he gifted the world with a musical comedy that is hardly of the “good old garden variety,” the proof being that <em>The Music Man </em>won the 1958 Best Musical Tony over no less than <em>West Side Story </em>and received five other Tonys (compared to two for the competing Bernstein/Sondheim/Robbins musical).</p>\n<p>Now, as probably the most anticipated musical of the 2022 season, comes a revival billed as <em>Meredith Willson’s The Music Man</em>. In the current redo, it can’t be said that this return is of the day-to-day garden variety, not as directed by Jerry Zaks and choreographed by Warren Carlyle, reunited from their recent <em>Hello, Dolly! </em>triumph.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/02/11/the-music-man-the-wells-fargo-wagon-delivers-the-con-artist-we-need/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it doesn’t quite rise to blue-ribbon garden-show winner. Putting a finger on exactly why the plucky tale of a flim-flam man awakening joy in a quiet Iowa town doesn’t ring all bells isn’t easy. To some extent, though, it has to do with Hugh Jackman billed in big letters above the title and Sutton Foster billed in equally big letters immediately below the title.</p>\n<p>Jackman is back in a big, brash Broadway book musical for the first time since he was electrifying ticket buyers as Australian songwriter and cabaret whiz Peter Allen in <em>The Boy From Oz. </em>Here he’s iconic Harold Hill, primed to convince these River City yokels that he can turn their children into a John Philip Sousa-like band when he himself can’t play a note on a trombone, cornet, clarinet or flute. (Amazingly enough, in his early days, the classically trained Willson did play the flute with Sousa’s contingent.)</p>\n<p>Perhaps seeking to differentiate himself from previous Harold Hills—and with director Zaks’ agreement—Jackman seems to underplay the self-proclaimed music man’s foxy guile. The decision has the effect of softening Hill’s initial deviousness.</p>\n<p>There’s no denying that Jackman throws himself into the dancing Carlyle has him do with Foster and the large chorus of dancers, featuring the athletic Gino Cosculluela. Jackman&#8217;s even learned to tap dance and merrily shows off the newly acquired skill in the breathtaking final number. Yet, it remains that his Harold Hill could use some of the fire he lit in <em>The Boy From Oz </em>and has repeatedly spread as <em>Wolverine</em>.</p>\n<p>Foster—back from London where she knocked those theatergoers for a loop with her Reno Sweeney in <em>Anything Goes—</em>also appears to have made a questionable choice for Marian the Librarian, the focus of Harold Hill’s increasing romantic interest.</p>\n<p>Though, as written by Willson, Marian Paroo is stand-offish and suspicious of the slick newcomer, she isn’t nasty. But Foster plays her that way. Rather than a woman past her first youth and uncertain of love prospects in the future, this Marian is an offputtingly incipient old maid. That’s until she warms up as if in front of a hearth in Carlyle’s “Shipoopi” number. (Marians in other productions were not included in the routine, but she is here to good purpose and adds to Foster’s strong and sweet singing throughout. And Sutton sure can dance.)</p>\n<p>A big <em>Music Man </em>plus this time around is the roster of Broadway vets on view: the always remarkable Jayne Houdyshell as imperious matron Eulalie MacKecknie Shinn, Jefferson Mays as Hill-dubious Mayor Shinn, Shuler Hensley as longtime Hill buddy Marcellus Washburn, Marie Mullen as kindly Mrs. Paroo, Remy Auberjonois as Hill rival Charlie Cowell, and Eddie Korbich as the tenor in the barbershop quartet.</p>\n<p>Benjamin Pajak gets a paragraph of praise to himself. He’s Marian’s lisping young brother Winthrop Paroo. It may be that the young man, who plays a few notes on a trumpet, is the most unselfconscious member of the cast. Evidently, it all comes natural to him. If there’s a scene-stealer on this stage, he’s it, reviving the old warning against acting with children or dogs.</p>\n<p>On other fronts, Zaks, in his 26th Broadway assignment, does a perfectly acceptable job. There is one glaring letdown. Much is made during the script of the footbridge where River City lovers clandestine themselves. Though never there previously, Marian agrees to meet Harold for a tryst. This is a big deal, and set designer Santo Loquasto complies.</p>\n<p>Okay, there the bridge is, but when Harold and Marion arrive, they don’t step foot on it,  Marian sings the gorgeous “Till There Was You” downstage center, and the bridge remains upstage and waiting. There’s undoubtedly a reason for this predicament, but it’s not reason enough.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Loquasto, he bases the backdrops for his sets on Grant Wood, who, like Willson, is an Iowa boy. Towards the end he replicates Wood’s “Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.” Before that Wood’s “American Gothic” is highlighted. Add to Loquasto’s contributions those of lighting designer Brian MacDevitt and the sound design of Scott Lehrer (and few working in Broadway theaters are better). That amounts to plenty to watch and listen to.</p>\n<p>What’s heard is, of course, Willson’s sometimes corn-fed, if not corny, script; and also his thoroughly marvelous songs. Keep this is mind: The group of musical writers who do music, lyrics, and book includes Noel Coward and Lin-Manuel Miranda. To name another may need going back to Richard Wagner. That, Mr. Willson, is saying something. Many heartfelt thanks.</p>\n<p><strong><b>The Music Man </b>opened February 10, 2022, at the Winter Garden Theatre.

(Photo: Matthew Murphy)</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s always a contradiction embedded in things Michael Jackson. He was the adorable little boy who turned into an adult weirdo. He was the King of Pop and simultaneously a stunted manchild. The magic of the moonwalk is that he slides backward while seeming to step forward. If you’re thinking about being his baby, it don’t matter if you’re black or white. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Befitting this endemic duality, the biomusical </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MJ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which opened tonight at the Neil Simon, arrived in New York on simultaneous waves of both anticipation and apprehension. It has most of the ingredients of a jukebox hit—great songs, iconic dances, a rags-to-riches story—plus a prodigiously talented creative team. But it is also the story of a man with real problems, a man who quite likely committed some heinous crimes—and a man whose estate controls his life story and is involved with the production.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it turns out, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MJ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is both wonderfully fun and predictably blinkered. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/02/01/mj-the-man-in-the-mire/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[<em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★☆☆<em> review here.</em>]</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The latter fact is probably unavoidable. But it’s also deeply awkward. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MJ </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is big and loud; it is joyful and joyous. The music grooves, the dancing glides, the crowd bops. The spectacle is everything you expect. You enjoy Jackson’s work, you see his genius—but you never truly grapple with him as a character, because this hagiography cannot work if it asks you to. Michael Jackson is today a credibly accused child molester, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MJ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> succeeds only if you can ignore that fact. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you can get some brilliant artists to make a musical about your childhood, I highly recommend it,” Alison Bechdel once said about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Home</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Jeanine Tesori-Lisa Kron triumph based on her graphic memoir. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MJ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is made by some of the most brilliant. The bookwriter is Lynn Nottage, who has two Pulitzer Prizes, a Tony nomination, and, this season, the trifecta of a play, a musical, and an opera on Broadway; the director and choreographer is Christopher Wheeldon, who has his own Tony Award and a sterling resume that includes the Royal Ballet, New York City Ballet, and his own transatlantic company, Morphoses/The Wheeldon Company.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their obvious brief, given what’s on stage and the Jackson Estate’s involvement in the production, is to celebrate the good of Michael while ignoring the bad. They deliver impeccably. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nottage built a Pompidou Center script: Its structure is showing, clearly, but that structure does what it needs to, and it elevates the whole to more than the sum of its parts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a convenient setting, rehearsals for Jackson’s Dangerous World Tour in 1992, just before the first formal allegations of child molestation. There is a requisite framing device: An MTV crew on a behind-the-scenes assignment, ready to ask questions where needed and hear confessionals where required. As has become de rigeuer in these types of shows, there is a Big Michael (here called “MJ”), a Medium Michael (he’s “Michael”), and a “Little Michael.” There is a villain, Michael’s taskmaster father, Joseph, who is mean and demanding but, deep down, only because he so badly wants his sons to succeed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael’s first few spoken lines efficiently establish that he’s a creative genius, a perfectionist, and quiet but kind. Other parts of the script are engineered to get points for hinting at controversies without ever addressing them: Dialogue references nonspecific “flack from the media” and “allegations”; “he’s battling demons I don’t understand,” one assistant says. Nottage is a talented architect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wheeldon has similarly delivered a slick, stylized, energized production, with choreography that captures and expands on the classic Jackson flair. His cast delivers exuberant if necessarily not heartfelt performances. Myles Frost, as MJ, perfectly nails the sinewy, slippery Jackson moves and mimics the breathy, naive manner, if not quite capturing the charisma that made Jackson an icon. Tavon Olds-Sample, as Michael, gets to have perhaps the most fun, embodying the middle-period Michael who has achieved global solo stardom but not yet been engulfed by it. And Christian Wilson, playing Little Michael at the performance I saw (he alternates with Walter Russell III), provided the only true jolt of joy in the show: When he first steps forward among his four brothers, you see the transcendent magic of the child star. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MJ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tells Michael’s story—only till 1992, of course—mostly in flashbacks, and the action moves seamlessly from memory to memory. Most of the rest of the cast is doubled: Quentin Earl Darrington, for example, segues back and forth from demanding Joseph to MJ’s supportive tour director, Rob. (A doubled father figure.) Individual performances can get lost in the swirl, although Ayana George as Katherine, Michael’s mother, is a sensational standout.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these performers, in Wheeldon’s hands (and with Paul Tazewell’s perfect costumes, Derek McLane’s sets, and Natasha Katz’s lighting), sell the music and the magic. But they are required to consistently ignore the man behind the curtain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, the dramatic climax comes when rehearsal wraps up and the MTV reporter finally asks Michael some “tough” questions. It’s another moment of hinting at the real issues without really engaging them. Does he sleep in an oxygen chamber? “No! I started that rumor, I thought it would be funny. The chamber was actually to treat my burns. But, that’s not interesting, is it?” Plastic surgery? “This is Hollywood— who hasn’t gotten a new nose?” Bleaching his skin? “I have a skin condition called vitiligo. It has slowly been robbing me of my pigment.” This last part, per news reports of his obituary, is true. But none of these rumors is criminal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s the ultimate contradiction: Jackson was unavoidably a victim. He was also a perpetrator. And </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MJ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a delight—so long as you forget that.</span></p>\n<p><strong><b>MJ </b>opened February 1, 2022, at the Neil Simon Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Any jukebox musical that assumes the form of hagiography, as many do, presents the challenge of competing with fans&#8217; memories of a renowned performer. In the case of <em>MJ</em>, that performer happens to be one of the most preternaturally gifted entertainers of the past century, and those crafting the tribute face no less daunting a task than the actor cast as the star. For as even Michael Jackson&#8217;s most ardent admirers and defenders would have to admit, his life did not lend itself to a portrait nearly as exuberant as his music was.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a credit to everyone involved in <em>MJ</em>, then, that there&#8217;s no shortage of joy here. The catalog, from the buoyant Jackson 5 hits that the superstar fronted as a child prodigy to the pop-soul masterpieces that later filled solo albums such as <em>Off the Wall</em> and the blockbuster <em>Thriller</em>, features ideal showcases for the spectacular talent that director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon has culled. The title role is played by Myles Frost, whose Playbill bio cites his &#8220;preparation and mastery,&#8221; and whose performance does not disappoint. It&#8217;s all there: the gleaming tenor, by turns shivery and siren-like, and piercing falsetto; the elastic limbs and feet, sliding as if on ice, jumping and jerking in bursts that seem at once frenetic and impeccably controlled. (Frost&#8217;s live vocals also benefit from the kind of expert mixing that pop stars enjoy, courtesy of sound designer Gareth Owen.) Frost even has the soft, boyish speaking voice and shy, self-conscious manner down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/02/01/mj-michael-jackson-jukebox-musical-is-very-smooth-somewhat-criminal/\"><em>[Read Jesse Oxfeld&#8217;s ★★★☆☆ review here.]</em></a></p>\n<p>The supporting players appear in up to three or four roles, ranging from Jackson&#8217;s parents and brothers to earlier R&amp;B icons and the dancers and choreographers who inspired his smooth moves. Most turn up as singers and dancers preparing for his tour promoting the 1991 album <em>Dangerous</em>; <em>MJ</em> is set the following year, in a Los Angeles studio, where an MTV crew has arrived to document rehearsals and conduct an interview. Flashbacks tracing Jackson&#8217;s early family life and meteoric rise segue into the present, where Jackson and his colleagues field career pressures, financial concerns and rumors of the superstar&#8217;s increasingly eccentric and self-destructive behavior. The MTV reporter and cameraman hover nearby, eager for a scoop.</p>\n<p>Librettist Lynn Nottage, a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright who did lovely work for the musical <em>The Secret Life of Bees</em>—and who adapted her <em>Intimate Apparel</em> for an opera that just opened off-Broadway—seems to have been stifled by this setup. Whitney Bashor and Gabriel Ruiz, respectively cast as the reporter, Rachel, and cameraman, Alejandro, have particularly thankless tasks, dropping banal questions and observations as they try to get the goods on their elusive subject. &#8220;This is an opportunity we&#8217;re never gonna get again,&#8221; Rachel gushes before diving in, trying to butter up her subject with pearls like, &#8220;Your new album&#8217;s been slaying the charts,&#8221; and, &#8220;I love the old Motown songs.&#8221; When Jackson doesn&#8217;t immediately melt, Alejandro notes, &#8220;I&#8217;m getting the distinct vibe that the King of Pop doesn&#8217;t, like, let a lot of people in.&#8221; Ya think?</p>\n<p>Jackson&#8217;s personal quirks and foibles are hardly ignored here—though conveniently, <em>MJ</em>&#8216;s timeline concludes before accusations arose that the singer was sexually preying on minors. There is a loaded reference to &#8220;allegations&#8221; near the end of Act One, as Jackson is seen at a press conference, fielding questions about plastic surgery and skin bleaching. Nottage&#8217;s book and Frost&#8217;s performance actually make a pretty good case for the theory that Jackson was, rather than an active pedophile, a boy who never grew up, because he wasn&#8217;t allowed to; Quentin Earl Darrington, who plays the concert director, also appears as Joseph Jackson, the star&#8217;s famously abusive father, and there are convincing, even endearing nods to the grown Michael&#8217;s childlike behavior, and more sobering references to his drug abuse.</p>\n<p>Wisely, though, <em>MJ</em> neither defends its subject from the most serious charges against him nor urges us to distinguish between the artist and his art. Like most jukebox fare, it&#8217;s at its most winning when song and dance are in progress—and since Jackson&#8217;s hits always lent themselves to theatrical presentation, and theater and film giants were among his biggest influences, Wheeldon and his company have plenty of room to fly. In one sequence, the ballet-bred choreographer and director pays cool, glistening homage to Fred Astaire, Bob Fosse and the seminal duo the Nicholas Brothers, offering a bit of historical perspective on the restless brilliance captured in other routines. To Nottage&#8217;s credit, <em>MJ</em> also gives due respect to the professional and creative collaborators who figured into Jackson&#8217;s success—chief among them Quincy Jones, a man who should be sainted for his contributions to popular music. Jones is smoothly played by Apollo Levine, who also provides robust singing as soul pioneer Jackie Wilson and Tito Jackson.</p>\n<p>Other standouts in the cast include Ayana George, an equally supple vocalist who adds warmth as Jackson&#8217;s mom, Katherine, and the young actors who play &#8220;Little Michael&#8221; and &#8220;Middle Michael&#8221;: Tavon Olds-Sample, who summons Jackson&#8217;s magic during his teenage and young adult years, and the adorable Christian Wilson, who at the preview I attended sang sweetly and danced nimbly as the boy wonder. (Wilson shares the part with Walter Russell III.) Derek McLane&#8217;s scenic design and Paul Tazewell&#8217;s costumes adroitly summon both the razzle-dazzle of Jackson&#8217;s performances and his less glamorous quests for perfection in art and peace at home.</p>\n<p>When that perfection is evoked—when Frost re-enacts Jackson’s show-stopping performance of &#8220;Billie Jean&#8221; during Motown&#8217;s 25th anniversary celebration, for example—we are reminded what a thriller this artist was. Whatever price he paid, or toll he exacted on others, will no doubt continue to be a source of speculation. Let&#8217;s just hope it&#8217;s not in another musical.</p>\n<div><strong><b>MJ </b>opened February 1, 2022, at the Neil Simon Theatre.
