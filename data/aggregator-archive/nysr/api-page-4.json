Dirden, Phylicia Rashad, and Chanté Adams in Skeleton Crew. Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When it comes to all things Motor City, there’s no better historian—or more passionate advocate—than playwright Dominique Morisseau.</p>\n<p>All of the pieces in her <em>Detroit Project</em> trilogy chronicle pivotal time periods for the city: <em>Paradise Blue</em> in 1949, before the once-vibrant Black Bottom neighborhood was destroyed in the name of so-called urban renewal; <em>Detroit ’67</em> in July 1967, during the Uprising of 1967 (aka the 12th Street Riot and the Detroit Rebellion of 1967); and, now on Broadway at the Friedman Theatre, <em>Skeleton Crew</em>, which takes place in a stamping plant in 2008—not only the peak of the Great Recession but also the implosion of the auto industry.</p>\n<p>If you grew up in or around Detroit, chances are someone in your family had a connection to the auto industry—be it in manufacturing, at a dealership, or at an ad agency. There was a true sense of pride in those jobs—something Morisseau knows and pours into her behind-the-assembly-line drama. “I’m building something that you can see come to life at the end. Got a motor in it and it’s gonna take somebody somewhere,” says Shanita (the excellent Chanté Adams). “Gonna maybe drive some important business man to work. Gonna get some single mama to her son’s football practice. Gonna take a family on they first trip to Cedar Point. Gonna even maybe be somebody’s first time. Who knows? But I like knowing I had a hand in it, you know?” (That feeling is <em>real</em>—even if you aren&#8217;t one of the people pounding out the metal. My mom still remembers Ronald Reagan’s Cadillac coming out of the laboratories in her engineering building. “And I got to sit in it before the president did!” she told me. &#8220;With the assistance of the Secret Service.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/01/26/skeleton-crew-blue-collar-angst-without-much-depth/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Of course, Morisseau’s setting is 2008, so Shanita and her fellow line workers—young hothead Dez (Joshua Boone) and 29-year veteran Faye (Phylicia Rashad)—are living under the constant threat of closure. As they sip coffee, play cards, and philosophize in the break room—impeccably detailed by scenic designer Michael Carnahan, complete with tiny Detroit touches such as a box of Better Made potato chips—they talk about nearby plants that are shuttering. Robberies are happening at all of them—in-demand materials like sheet metal mysteriously going missing—even at their own. Dez sees the writing on the wall and takes out his anger on their supervisor, Reggie (Brandon J. Dirden). Faye, meanwhile, trusts him to do right by his workers. “Can’t define what a man is until he got to take an action,” she says. “You judge him befo’ we even see what the action gonna be. And me—what I know ’bout that man… what I know ’bout his mama and what he’s made of….when it come to where his heart lie, he gonna rise to the occasion.”</p>\n<p>With the exception of casting, director Ruben Santiago-Hudson’s production is virtually the same as the terrific one he helmed in 2016 at the Atlantic Theater Company. (Thankfully, he did bring back performer-choreographer Adesola Osakalumi, whose kinetic movement between scenes illustrates the constant, precision motion of the assembly line.) Rashad is fantastic as the “tough as bricks” Faye, and Dirden—featured in Santiago-Hudson’s gorgeous revivals of August Wilson’s <em>The Piano Lesson</em> (2012) and <em>Jitney</em> (2016), not to mention in <em>Detroit ’67</em> (2013)—is simply spectacular as the buttoned-up Reggie.</p>\n<p>In a dream world, some brave Detroit-born producer would put Morisseau’s entire <em>Detroit Trilogy</em> in rep on Broadway, and we would be able to see them all consecutively, either on multiple nights or in a single day. But for now, if we have to get only one, I’m glad it’s <em>Skeleton Crew</em>, a deftly drawn portrait of skilled workers getting squeezed out of the once-vibrant business that built a state.</p>\n<p>At the top of Act 2, Shanita is prattling on nervously to fill the air, talking about driving in on I-75: “Nobody wants to merge no more. We just gettin’ squished into smaller lanes while they make these promises to fix the freeways and don’t seem like they ever really get fixed.” Ostensibly it’s a rant about traffic, but it seems like Morisseau is talking about much, much more, doesn’t it? “And all I can think anymore is if we just merged, shit would flow so much better.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Skeleton Crew</em></strong><strong> opened Jan. 26, 2022, at Samuel J.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever hung out at a break room at work, you know that generally not very much happens there. People eat snacks, engage in small talk, and generally relax during the few precious minutes they have before resuming their labor. Playwright Dominique Morisseau captures that ambience all too well in her 2016 play now receiving its Broadway premiere courtesy of Manhattan Theatre Club. Stronger on atmosphere than actual drama, <em>Skeleton Crew</em> never proves thematically arresting, although it does earn points for sociological resonance.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because the play – the third entry in Morisseau&#8217;s <em>The Detroit Projects Trilogy</em>, which also includes <em>Detroit &#8217;67</em> and <em>Paradise Blue</em> – takes place at a Motor City automotive plant in 2008, at the height of the Great Recession. So you know that these blue-collar workers are struggling with serious economic issues, including the possibilities of layoffs and the closure of the plant.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not enough to make for satisfying drama. You also need compelling characters and incidents, and dialogue rich enough to keep us fully engaged over the course of two hours. Too often, you feel this play coasting on its milieu, as if presenting the plight of working class people gasping under the weight of economic inequality was enough.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2022/01/26/skeleton-crew-dominique-morisseaus-ode-to-a-shrinking-industry/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em> ★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The characters, all African-American, are Faye (Phylicia Rashad), the hard-edged veteran of the bunch, the workers&#8217; union representative who&#8217;s seen it all and has no compunction about routinely disobeying the &#8220;No Smoking&#8221; signs liberally plastered throughout the room; Dez (Joshua Boone) an ambitious, twentysomething who clearly aspires to a better life and who is revealed early on to secretly carry a gun in his bag; Shanita (Chante Adams, who co-stars with Michael B. Jordan in the recently released film <em>A Journal for</em> <em>Jordan</em>), heavily pregnant and eternally optimistic; and Reggie (Brandon J. Dirden, the stand-out of the cast), the beleaguered foreman who has moved up to a white-collar job but feels torn between satisfying the needs of his workers and the corporate higher-ups.</p>\n<p>The playwright attempts to stir up some dramatic tension with a mystery involving a series of thefts of materials from the plant, but it never amounts to much. There seems to be a blossoming romance between Shanita and Dez, but that too feels underdeveloped. And there&#8217;s a running gag involving Reggie constantly putting up handwritten signs about various workplace rules that wears thin pretty quickly. The play&#8217;s most interesting element proves the complex bond between Faye and Reggie, whose friendship goes back many years.</p>\n<p>The play felt more impactful in its original Off-Broadway production at Atlantic Theater Company, the intimacy of which made you feel more immersed in the action. It seems more than a little lost in its much larger Broadway environs, where the actors often struggle to make themselves heard. Director Ruben Santiago-Hudson doesn&#8217;t do the production any favors with such theatrical flourishes as the use of irrelevant rap songs, video projections and break-dancing appearances by performer/choreographer Adesola Osakalumi between scenes, which only make an already longish-feeling play feel even longer. It&#8217;s hard not to think that the evening would have worked better as a tighter one-act, especially since the intermission accentuates the lack of an engrossing narrative.</p>\n<p>Despite the fine acting by the ensemble, <em>Skeleton Crew</em> proves a well-meaning, respectable play that ultimately underwhelms. Clearly indebted to August Wilson, it lacks the poetry that made his dramas seem to pulsate with inner life.</p>\n<div><strong>Skeleton Crew opened January 26, 2022, at Samuel J.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Though it&#8217;s pretty early in the season, it&#8217;s safe to say you won’t catch a more thrilling five minutes on Broadway than &#8220;Funny Money,&#8221; a number in the second scene of the new musical <em>Flying Over Sunset</em>. The performers are the dazzling triple threat Tony Yazbeck, playing Cary Grant in middle age, and a child wonder named Atticus Ware, playing a ten-year-old Archibald Leach, Grant&#8217;s birth name. It&#8217;s the 1950s, and after taking LSD for the first time, the movie legend and one-time vaudevillian is getting psychically re-acquainted with his much younger self through song and tap dance. The tune is impressively catchy, and the routine, as choreographed by Michelle Dorrance and executed by Yazbeck and Ware, is so exhilarating that you may feel chemically enhanced just watching it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to report that <em>Sunset</em> sustains that high for its roughly two and a half hours, but this long, strange trip—featuring a book by James Lapine, who also directs, music by Tom Kitt and lyrics by Michael Korie—is ultimately an uneven one. The accomplished creators have an ambitious and truly original premise: Grant, author and philosopher Aldous Huxley and multi-tasking social and political player Clare Boothe Luce, who all experimented with psychedelic drugs (Huxley most famously), meet up in a Los Angeles restaurant and hatch a plan to drop acid at Luce&#8217;s swellegant Malibu home.</p>\n<p>[<em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em>]</p>\n<p>In a prologue, &#8220;The Music Plays On&#8221;—another thoroughly arresting number that put Dorrance&#8217;s ingenuity and finesse front and center—the cast members essentially double as musicians, walking in time before the music even starts; Huxley, in what will later emerge as a drug-induced flashback, reconnects with his late wife, Maria, and they segue into a waltz. The pattern will continue, with rhythmic footsteps often amplified by Dan Moses Schreier&#8217;s sound design, which conspires with Beowulf Boritt&#8217;s spare but stunning sets, Bradley King&#8217;s lighting and projections by 59 Productions to create gorgeously hallucinogenic effects. A Botticelli painting suddenly looms on a staircase that appears in a drugstore; neon spheres materialize out of nowhere, one zooming forward in three dimensions; Grant, Huxley and Gerald Heard, the British-born historian who befriended and influenced Huxley, wade further and further into the ocean, until two of them are nearly overwhelmed by an aggressive tide. (The last example isn&#8217;t meant to be a hallucination, though altered judgment plays a role in the adventure.)</p>\n<p>The show is at its most solid before intermission, as we&#8217;re introduced to the leading characters, all three at points in their lives and careers when trying something new, however risky, seems attractive. Grant has just retired, temporarily, from acting, and is hoping that an LSD-toting shrink (the drug was legal at the time) can quickly resolve the sense of unease he would rather not dig into. Huxley, played by the Eton-educated Harry Hadden-Paton—last seen on Broadway as another well-born British intellectual, Henry Higgins, in Bartlett Sher&#8217;s revival of <em>My Fair Lady</em>—is encountering puritanical feedback for his work, and is about to lose his beloved Maria to cancer. Luce, who is given a period-perfect reading by Carmen Cusack, is stuck in a loveless marriage, and ambivalent about her latest appointment, to ambassador to Brazil. All three first get stoned roughly as they did in life.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s when we get to their fictional escapade at Luce&#8217;s beach house that <em>Sunset</em> threatens to go off the rails a bit. An hour is an awfully long time to devote to an acid trip, at least if you&#8217;re not the one taking it, and yet Act Two offers no fewer than ten songs delivered by characters under the influence. One that finds Grant dancing in his mind with Sophia Loren is followed in short order by another in which he declares himself &#8220;a giant penis rocket ship.&#8221; Everyone brings up his or her mother, each story darker than the last; Luce&#8217;s visions are haunted by both her mom and her own daughter, both of whom were killed in car accidents. Lapine, not unsurprisingly, traverses all this with as sharp a wit as could be summoned, and manages some poignant moments too, but&#8230;well, you can only go so far in a penis rocket ship.</p>\n<p>Still, the production is aesthetically transcendent—a sensory feast for the sober that never settles for gratuitous flash, and is as pleasing to listen to as it is to behold. Kitt provides some of his most melodically and harmonically satisfying work to date, and the material is beautifully sung; Yazbeck and Cusack are standouts in this respect, as are Laura Shoop, a graceful, silver-voiced Maria, and Kanisha Marie Feliciano and Michele Ragusa, respectively cast as Luce’s mother and daughter. As Heard, who accompanies the central trio on its psychedelic journey, Robert Sella is tender and sweetly droll, as much a voyeur among larger-than-life figures as he is a guide.</p>\n<p>Several supporting cast members double in smaller roles; Feliciano and Ragusa appear as the Old Testament heroine Judith and her handmaiden when the Botticelli painting suddenly springs to life in one of Huxley’s visions, while Nehal Joshi plays both Grant&#8217;s therapist and the film star&#8217;s father, who terrorizes Grant during his otherwise giddy first trip. If <em>Flying Over Sunset</em> doesn&#8217;t truly take us into the minds or souls of its distinguished subjects, it will likely make you more curious about them—and make you wish that getting high could be more of a spectator sport.</p>\n<p><strong>Flying over Sunset opened December 13, 2021, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater and runs through January 16, 2022.

Photo credit: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Have you ever served as the designated driver for a group of friends who proceeded to get totally wasted and have a great time while you sat around bored? That&#8217;s roughly akin to the experience of watching the new musical written and directed by James Lapine and featuring a score by Tom Kitt (music) and Michael Korie (lyrics). Imagining what might have happened if famed personages Aldous Huxley, Clare Booth Luce, and Cary Grant had taken LSD trips together in the 1950s, the hugely ambitious <em>Flying Over Sunset</em> unfortunately remains stubbornly earthbound.</p>\n<p>The musical receiving its world premiere from Lincoln Center Theater was one of the most eagerly anticipated of the season, for good reasons. Besides the formidable creative team, the lavish production features a killer cast including Harry Hadden-Paton, Carmen Cusack, Tony Yazbeck, and Robert Sella as Gerald Heard, the philosopher/author who guides the trio through their drug-induced trips. Besides, how can you not root for a large-scale Broadway musical not based on a pre-existing property and featuring such an audaciously original concept?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s sad to report, then, that the show from the librettist of such landmark musicals as <em>Sunday in the Park</em> <em>with George</em>, <em>Into the Woods,</em> and <em>Passion</em> is a misfire. A provocative misfire, to be sure, and one that will no doubt have its ardent admirers. But a misfire nonetheless.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/12/13/flying-over-sunset-a-long-strange-beautiful-trip/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Lapine&#8217;s presumed intention was to illustrate how psychedelic drugs can enable its users to explore hard truths about their lives that they would otherwise not have the courage or ability to face. Thus, each of the main characters is shown dealing with personal tragedies while at dramatic crossroads in their lives. Huxley (Hadden-Paton), the author of such books as <em>Brave New World</em> and <em>The Doors of</em> <em>Deception</em>, is grieving the recent loss of his wife Maria (Laura Shoop). Playwright and former congresswoman Luce (Cusack) is haunted by the loss of her mother and teenage daughter in separate car accidents and has just declined a nomination for the ambassadorship to Brazil because of political headwinds. And Grant (Yazbek), still traumatized by his childhood in which his father told him his mother was dead when in fact he had her committed to a mental asylum, has recently announced his retirement from acting.</p>\n<p>Considering its fascinating real-life characters and the theatrical possibilities of depicting hallucinogenic drug trips, <em>Flying Over Sunset</em> proves a surprisingly lackluster affair. Feeling severely attenuated at its nearly three-hour running time, it&#8217;s endlessly talky and repetitive, its second act failing to interestingly expand on the ideas of its first. Essentially, the four major characters get together, exchange arch comments about their lives, and ingest the drug carefully administered by Heard which prompts them to grapple with their personal demons.</p>\n<p>Those demons don&#8217;t prove particularly interesting, and don&#8217;t really lend themselves to musicalization; this is one those shows for which the musical numbers feel extraneous, which would be tolerable if they were more enjoyable. But except for a few exceptions—a rousing tap dance performed by Yazbek and his character&#8217;s younger incarnation Archie Leach (wildly talented 13-year-old performer Atticus Ware), the gorgeous title song, and a soaring 11 o&#8217;clock ballad beautifully sung by Cusack—the music and lyrics make little impression.</p>\n<p>The show&#8217;s attempts at surrealist flights of fancy prove more cringeworthy than transporting. Grant engages in an awkward tango with the object of his desire, Sophia Loren (Emily Pynenburg), who rebuffs his marriage proposal. Luce is reunited with her late mother and daughter, at one point rummaging through some bushes to retrieve the former&#8217;s cut-off leg. And most egregiously, Grant sings a song in which he proclaims, &#8220;I am a giant penis rocket ship!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Director Lapine proves too indulgent of Lapine the librettist, allowing the proceedings to ramble on to the point of tedium. By the time the drug-tripping men go for an ill-advised swim in the ocean which nearly ends in disaster, you&#8217;ve long been desperate for them to sober up.</p>\n<p>The show certainly looks spectacular on the vast Vivian Beaumont stage, with Beowulf Boritt&#8217;s sets, Toni-Leslie James&#8217; costumes, Bradley King&#8217;s lighting and particularly 59 Productions&#8217; projections making striking impressions. On the other hand, the show also looks lost at times, the theater feeling far too large for this character-driven piece which would have benefited from a more intimate production. When the characters periodically clomp around performing the ritualistic stomping devised by choreographer Michelle Dorrance, the effect feels silly rather than haunting.</p>\n<p>The performers do everything possible with their characters, especially the luminous Cusack, but they&#8217;re ultimately undone by the material, which includes Sella being reduced to doing a pratfall and planting his face in Yazbeck&#8217;s posterior for a cheap laugh. And why the talented Yazbeck doesn&#8217;t even make an attempt at impersonating Grant&#8217;s distinctive Mid-Atlantic accent is a question best left unasked.</p>\n<p><strong>Flying over Sunset opened December 13, 2021, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater and runs through January 16, 2022.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Isn’t it remarkable how you can be surrounded by a roomful of people and feel completely, utterly, terrifyingly alone?</p>\n<p>In Marianne Elliott’s pandemic-postponed, gender-bent revival of the Stephen Sondheim marriage-minded musical <em>Company</em>, our hero, the singleton Bobbie (Katrina Lenk)—Bobby ever since the 1970 Harold Prince–directed premiere, until this production’s West End debut in 2018—is “surprised” by all of her closest friends on her 35th birthday: Crammed into her tiny New York apartment, the married couples Sarah (Jennifer Simard) and Harry (Christopher Sieber), Susan (Rashidra Scott) and Peter (Greg Hildreth), Jenny (Nikki Renée Daniels) and David (Christopher Fitzgerald), Jamie (Matt Doyle) and Paul (Etai Benson), and Joanne (Patti LuPone) and Larry (Terence Archie) shower her with pricey gifts (“It cost so much I almost passed out,” jokes Paul) and a cake that seems to have Duracell-powered candles. And even though Bobbie thanks them all—“I am touched”—she looks like she’s about to have her teeth drilled. She’d clearly rather be anywhere else…perhaps cozied up in a chair with the fifth of Maker’s Mark she just pulled out of her purse, or curled up in bed with one of the men she’s seeing: the Dionysian artist-type PJ (Bobby Conte), the sweet but dim flight attendant Andy (Claybourne Elder), and the preppy Theo (Manu Narayan)—each handsome and intriguing in his own right, and none a good long-term prospect for her.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/12/09/company-that-invincible-bunch-reconsidered/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>After the celebratory opening number (“Company,/ Lots of company!/ Life is company!/ Love is company!/ Company!”)—which sounds spectacular thanks to the 14-member orchestra perched above the stage at the Jacobs Theatre—Bobbie earns her escape and heads down the rabbit hole, <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>–style, into scenes with “those good and crazy people,” her “married friends.” Of all the <em>Company</em>s that I’ve seen—the 1995 Roundabout version with Boyd Gaines, the 2002 Kennedy Center production with John Barrowman, the 2007 Tony-winning John Doyle–directed revival starring Raúl Esparza, the 2011 New York Philharmonic production with an all-star cast led by Neil Patrick Harris—this one makes the strongest case for everything taking place in Bobbie’s mind. Some people may see the neon-edged cubicles by Elliott’s frequent collaborator Bunny Christie (<em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em>; <em>People, Places and Things</em>) as limiting, but they’re supremely effective in conveying how we compartmentalize our lives—not to mention the impossibly small size of so many NYC apartments. (Plus, it’s great fun looking for the number 35 in each of the set pieces, like a theatrical <em>Where’s Waldo?</em> You’ll have no trouble finding it in the final scene. The “35” mylar balloons have grown so large they basically fill a whole room in Bobbie’s apartment. Metaphor alert!) And if Christie’s set doesn’t make it crystal-clear, the “Tick Tock” sequence in Act 2 certainly does: Originally conceived by Michael Bennett as a dance for the dynamite Donna McKechnie—and often cut entirely from subsequent productions—the orchestral number is here played as a dream (nightmare?) sequence in which Bobbie envisions herself in various states of cohabitation, marriage, pregnancy, and motherhood with the men in her life. Was it my imagination, or did none of those Bobbies look at all happy?</p>\n<p>This is why changing the main character from Bobby to Bobbie works so well: The character is turning 35. “I mean, what kinds of friends would surprise you on your thirty-fifth birthday?” she asks in the first scene. That’s not such a milestone age for a man. But for a single woman—the pressure is <em>on</em>, especially if she wants to have children. (Unless she can afford to freeze her eggs and undergo subsequent fertility treatments…God bless modern medicine!) This also might be why the current <em>Company</em> will hit women—perhaps unmarried women, specifically—just a little bit harder than men.</p>\n<p>Naturally, there have been a few other character gender swaps as well: The aforementioned eligible bachelors our hero is juggling now sing “You Could Drive a Person Crazy”; it may no longer be an Andrews Sisters–style number, but the three-part harmonies are as groovy as ever. Amy—the reluctant bride who sings “Getting Married Today”—has become Jamie the reluctant groom; Matt Doyle’s take on the warp-speed, tongue-twisting tune is simply marvelous. And Bobbie’s impulse proposal to Jamie (“Marry me! And everybody’ll leave us <em>alone</em>!”) is just as ridiculous as Bobby’s impulse proposal to Amy always was. “It’s just that you have to want to marry <em>some</em>body, not just some<em>body</em>,” Jamie explains gently, leading to Bobbie’s Act 1–ending “Marry Me A Little”—the stop on the road on the way to the show-ending “Being Alive.” Even though she proclaims “I’m ready now,” she’s clearly not: “Love me just enough./ Warm and sweet and easy,/ Just the simple stuff,” she coos. Lenk—a Tony winner for <em>The Band’s Visit</em>—really gets to show her range as an actress in <em>Company</em>.</p>\n<p>One unexpected side effect of the Bobbie transformation: the sudden stinging nature of “The Ladies Who Lunch,” which LuPone shakes and stirs and serves with icy perfection, all to a jazzy beat. These ladies were always sort of ambiguous figures. (Unless you live on the Upper East Side, and then you probably know some women who are “Lounging in their caftans and planning a brunch/ On their own behalf.” But I won’t name any names.) Yet now, Joanne is staring square at Bobbie when she’s singing this verse: “And here’s to the girls who just watch—/ Aren’t they the best?/ When they get depressed, it’s a bottle of scotch/ Plus a little jest.” Okay, Bobbie drinks bourbon, but there’s no question who Joanne means; at that moment, Lenk’s Bobbie is about to crawl underneath the table. (And Joanne continues to needle her later in the scene: “You’re always outside, knocking at the door while everybody is inside dancing at the party.”) Incidentally, LuPone sings the song entirely seated—she doesn’t even need to stand to deliver that punch to the gut.</p>\n<p>After that, you might expect “Being Alive” as a four-alarm fiery power ballad, which is often how you hear it. But that’s not Lenk’s style. Hers is a prayer—she’s on her knees for at least one verse—and a song of surrender. You can hear the vulnerability and fear in her voice, and see the triumph. Sometimes, being alone is exactly where you need to be.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Company</em> opened Dec. 9, 2021, at the Jacobs Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#8220;Imagine the night Shakespeare died,&#8221; the actor David Ganly tweeted on Nov. 26, just after Stephen Sondheim shook off his mortal coil at the age of 91. But if the sudden passing of the man who had been musical theater&#8217;s greatest living composer and lyricist—our greatest living composer and lyricist, period, for my money—should cast a pall over the opening of a revival of 1970&#8217;s groundbreaking <em>Company</em> not two weeks later, you would never have known it witnessing the exuberant mood of the audience attending a recent preview. And that&#8217;s appropriate, because for all the attention paid to his unsparing intelligence and sometimes lacerating wit, Oscar Hammerstein II&#8217;s most famous protégé was also a great documentarian of the wonder and joy in, as one of this show&#8217;s most beloved songs puts it simply, being alive.</p>\n<p>And like Shakespeare—those who would dismiss the comparison as overstated should remember that Sondheim was also likened, on the cover of a national magazine, to God—Sondheim left us with a body of work that will be pored over and reinterpreted as long as there are imaginative directors. One such artist, Marianne Elliott, first presented this <em>Company</em> in London three years ago, to substantial acclaim; the Broadway transfer was originally supposed to open last year, before COVID struck. The primary twist is that Bobby, a charming and attractive bachelor turning 35, is now Bobbie, a charming and attractive bachelorette. And while this central character is still surrounded by married friends—still good and crazy people, as they&#8217;re identified in the title number—their constitution has become more diverse, including one same-sex couple and, as cast here, several interracial unions.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/12/09/company-everybody-rise-for-this-smashing-sondheim-revival/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>None of these pairings seem out of the ordinary today, which is when this <em>Company</em> is set, as we are alerted in the opening number by the presence of smartphones, a conspicuous feature throughout. There can be an element of self-consciousness here, especially in the production numbers, in which Elliott and choreographer Liam Steel have leading lady Katrina Lenk wade through a maze of strutting, jutting bodies, occasionally taking cover in one of the nooks in scenic and costume Bunny Christie&#8217;s ingenious, kinetic set, framed in brilliant neon by Neil Austin&#8217;s lighting. The sense of frantic energy is no doubt meant to underline the pressure facing Bobbie as a single gal approaching her late thirties, which even in 2021 has a biological component; Steel has reimagined &#8220;Tick Tock,&#8221; a sexually charged dance number as staged by Michael Bennett in Harold Prince&#8217;s original production, as an unattached woman&#8217;s dark fever dream of marriage and, particularly, motherhood.</p>\n<p>But the revelations in this <em>Company</em> more often arrive in the less fussy moments, and Lenk is prominent in them. A lissome beauty who, as anyone who caught her in <em>The Band&#8217;s Visit</em> or <em>Indecent</em> could attest, can project both sleek elegance and stark fragility, the actress sings Sondheim&#8217;s songs as they might be performed in an astute cabaret homage, taking occasional liberties with rhythm and phrasing not often heard on Broadway. While her lovely, piquant voice isn&#8217;t as technically virtuosic as that of some other cast members—the ensemble singing here can be glorious, from the all-male trio now delivering &#8220;You Could Drive A Person Crazy&#8221; to the burgeoning (and very funny) feast of &#8220;Getting Married Today&#8221;—her readings of &#8220;Someone Is Waiting,&#8221; &#8220;Marry Me A Little&#8221; and &#8220;Being Alive&#8221; shiver and gleam, caressing the nuances in these accounts of trepidation and yearning.</p>\n<p>There are other star turns, most notably that of Patti LuPone, reprising her role in the U.K. staging (and in a previous one with the New York Philharmonic) as Joanne, whose bone-dry disenchantment LuPone has refined to predictably hilarious effect. Joanne&#8217;s relationship with Bobbie is one of several that has been adapted, meaningfully, to accommodate <em>Company</em>&#8216;s central gender reassignment. There&#8217;s a new tenderness and frisson when Harry (a typically excellent Christopher Sieber) sings &#8220;Sorry-Grateful&#8221; to a woman, and a twist in the tension when our sexy heroine gets stoned with the buttoned-up David and Jenny, respectively played by Christopher Fitzgerald and Nikki Renée Daniels, both endearing. And April, the ditzy flight attendant who was among Bobby&#8217;s conquests, is now Andy, a slice of beefcake served with deadpan comic finesse by Claybourne Elder.</p>\n<p><em>Company&#8217;</em>s other commitment-phobe, Amy, has been reborn as Jamie, a man, still terrified to marry the adoring Paul, played by the adorable Etai Benson. After managing to calm Matt Doyle&#8217;s adroitly hysterical Jamie, Bobbie sings &#8220;Marry Me A Little,&#8221; one of numerous Sondheim fan favorites cut from productions of his shows through the years. &#8220;Keep a tender distance/So we&#8217;ll both be free&#8230;I&#8217;m ready,&#8221; she announces. She isn&#8217;t, quite yet, but she&#8217;s getting there, just as Bobby was, and Elliott and her own company trace that journey with a mix of intuition, invention and heart worthy of its creators.</p>\n<div><strong><b>Company </b>opened December 9, 2021, at the Jacobs Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rob McClure faces a daunting task.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight times a week at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre, he must put on the fat suit and the wig, the granny glasses and the makeup, and play the title role in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mrs. Doubtfire</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It’s not simply that he’s carrying the fate of a multi-million-dollar, years-in-the-making Big Broadway Musical on his prosthetically enhanced shoulders—he is, but that’s the job—it’s that he must also fill a set of falsies memorably incarnated on film by Robin Williams, who was both hilarious and inimitable, and who died by suicide in 2014. Somehow, McClure must recreate that beloved character, deliver a performance that recalls the original (no point in leveraging existing IP, after all, if not to take advantage of that build-in goodwill), and yet make the character his own, all while standing under a towering comedic shadow that’s also tinged with sadness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news, poppets, is that he actually pulls it off.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stage musical take on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mrs. Doubtfire</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which opens tonight at the Sondheim after a less-than-blockbuster tryout in Seattle fully two years ago and a preview period interrupted for 18-plus months by the pandemic, was written by the creators of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something Rotten!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one of the silliest, funniest Broadway musicals in recent memory. It is directed by Jerry Zaks, the four-time Tony-winning master of the old-fashioned musical comedy. (His last major outing was the Bette Midler </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hello, Dolly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; his next on deck is the Hugh Jackman-Sutton Foster </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music Man</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.) It’s got all that good will. And it’s got McClure, who ably pulls off the requisite clowning and the requisite quick shifts to sincerity, and sings and dances his way through innumerable, equally requisite, quick changes of costume. He makes the whole thing work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[</span><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/12/05/mrs-doubtfire-musical-comedy-misfire-from-something-rotten-team/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read David Finkle’s </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">★★☆☆☆</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> review here.</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story centers, as you’ll recall, on the plight of Daniel Hillard (McClure), a won’t-grow-up, happy-go-lucky actor who is the endearingly goofball father of three sweet kids. When Miranda, his wife and a demanding perfectionist (Jenn Gambatese, in a somewhat thankless role), grows tired of his shenanigans and files for divorce, Daniel is denied joint custody because he has neither a job nor a home. Desperate to spend time with the kids, Daniel masquerades as an aged Scottish nanny and gets the job as keeper of his now-ex-wife’s house. Hilarity ensues, as does personal growth, naturally.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The specifics of the story are largely but not entirely the same as in the 1993 movie. Karey Kirkpatrick and John O’Farrell, who wrote the book, and Kirkpatrick and his brother, Wayne, who wrote the songs, update things to account for changing tolerance for jokes about men wearing dresses and gay people being outrageous makeup artists. The script doesn’t rise to the dizzying goofiness of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something Rotten!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but it’s still very funny. The songs aren’t especially memorable, but they’re perfectly enjoyable. And if not all of the plot and character updates quite work, what has ended up on stage is still a very entertaining, very successful, very good time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once it gets going, that is. The necessary introductory exposition is a little clunky, and at first you can’t quite shake the manic-slash-depressive ghost of Williams hovering in the background. But by the third number, “Make Me a Woman”—in which Daniel’s brother, Frank (Brad Oscar, in a role perfect for him), and Frank’s partner, Andre (J. Harrison Ghee, equally amusing), make over Daniel in a rousing, let’s-put-on-a-show fantasia that includes an ensemble of imposters styled as Cher, Donna Summer, Eleanor Roosevelt, Julia Child, Margaret Thatcher, and several other icons—it all clicks into place. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mrs. Doubtfire</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is best in these newly created moments; it’s weakest when it’s too dutifully mirroring the movie. (The “run-by fruiting” line, probably the best known from the film, shows up here, as it must. But this time it’s much more laboriously set up, and it lands less well in a world where drive-by shootings no longer make headlines.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sets by David Korins pay pastel-hued homage to picture-postcard images of San Francisco. (The Hillards are still in that Pacific Heights Victorian, a real estate triumph that has become only more implausible in the intervening 18 years, during which time the internet happened and the Bay Area was transformed.) Catherine Zuber has fun with the costumes. The actors playing the three kids (Analise Scarpaci, Jake Ryan Flynn, and Avery Sell) bring real charm to their roles. And Peter Bartlett manages to stand out as the kooky comic relief of this comedy, as the past-his-prime kids’-show host Daniel eventually replaces.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mrs. Doubtfire</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a silly confection, with a standard-issue heartwarming point. But it works. Which so many screen-to-stage adaptations seem not to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, two and a half years ago, the stage musical version of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tootsie</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> flopped. At least some of the blame was directed at a world more enlightened than the one in which the original movie was made: It had become less funny to watch a man who was kind of an asshole pretend to be a woman in order to take a job shouldn’t have gone to him. That had to have worried this creative team. But </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mrs. Doubtfire</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> avoids that problem because Daniel’s goals are more noble—and because the writers consciously turned Miranda into a more sympathetic character.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s worth noting that those rewrites come from a trio of men. And nowhere does the Playbill note the screenwriters of the hit movie, or the author of the novel on which it was based: Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon, and Anne Fine, three women.</span></p>\n<p><b>Mrs. Doubtfire opened December 5, 2021, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre, and is on hiatus until March 15.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em>, the 1993 Robin Williams box-office nugget with screenplay by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon has been adapted (that’s usually the appropriate word) as a musical comedy by bookwriters Karey Kirkpatrick and John O’Farrell, with music and lyrics by Karey Kirkpatrick and Wayne Kirkpatrick.</p>\n<p>The tuner (using the term loosely) has two elements going for it: 1) its realistic view of one bittersweet consequence that families may face when divorce intervenes; and 2) the always remarkable Rob McClure pulling out multitudinous stops as the title character.</p>\n<p>Otherwise: Good Grief! Here’s a musical comedy that ruthlessly kicks the form back to the 1950s, way back to the era’s second- and third-rate 1950s musical comedies. And get this: The time-travel trip (in two senses of the word) is happening at, of all places, the Stephen Sondheim Theatre.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/12/05/mrs-doubtfire-dad-turns-nanny-comes-to-broadway-manic-charm-intact/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>This <em>Mrs. Doubtfire </em>travesty does follow relatively closely the screenplay wherein Daniel Hillard, a doting but tiresomely hyperkinetic father of precocious children Lydia (Analise Scarpaci), Christopher (Jake Ryan Flynn), and Natalie (Avery Sell) finally tries the patience of wife Miranda (Jenn Gambatese) so severely that she files for divorce.</p>\n<p>And gets it, plus full custody of the children, which means that to see them as regularly as he’d like, Daniel contrives to become their elderly Scottish nanny, Effie Doubtfire. As this, uh, redoubtable figure he must jump through figurative hoops to keep his true identity hidden.</p>\n<p>Although elder daughter Lydia initially resists Mrs. Doubtfire’s often stern charms, she eventually succumbs. So does Miranda, claiming she’s never been so happy in her adult life. Her happiness is further bolstered by tall, muscular Stuart Dunmire (Mark Evans), whom she meets as sole investor in the successful MBody sportswear company she forms as an enterprising single mother. (Partial spoiler: Dunmire is involved in the major change O’Farrell, Karey and Wayne Kirkpatrick make to the screenplay.)</p>\n<p>So far, so good, or would be so far, so good if the adaptors—also involved in the 2015 <em>Something Rotten!</em>—hadn’t expressly signed on to turn the movie into a musical comedy. (Readers are asked to remember that the word “comedy” has been dropped from the category some time back, in line with the “serious musicals” that had become sanctified under Stephen Sondheim, Harold Prince, Fred Ebb, John Kander, William Finn, James Lapine et al.)</p>\n<p>Bookwriters O’Farrell and Karey Kirkpatrick have lifted some of the lame Singer-Dixon jokes for repetition here and added their own, their additions as feeble as what they’ve kept. But it’s not the jokes that are the sizable problem, or the largely unpleasant character Daniel becomes during the lengthy first-act introduction to his marriage-challenging self.</p>\n<p>So, forget the jokes for the moment. What propels any sentient musical comedy or musical comedy lover into the depths of despair as the show evidently must go on is the Karey Kirkpatrick and Wayne Kirkpatrick score. And, it follows, how director Jerry Zaks, choreographer Lorin Latarro, and music supervisor Ethan Popp must do their damnedest to make the whole expensive shebang connect.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the Kirkpatrick brothers understand the musical <em>sine qua non</em>: a musical requires songs. What they apparently haven’t yet twigged to is that the songs should be good. (In all fairness, they’re not alone among many songwriters turning out contemporary musicals.)</p>\n<p>No need to go into a slew of the Kirkpatrick shortcomings. Thus, only one example of an annoying off-rhymed lyric: Tissue/pissed you [off]. (The song, “What the Hell,” is sung by the precocious children). No examples will be offered here of the forgettable songs mostly handed to Daniel/Mrs. Doubtfire, though occasionally assigned to others like Miranda (the valiant Gambatese) and children’s television show host Mr. Jolly (the always affable Peter Bartlett). Almost without exception they lie as dormant as throw rugs.</p>\n<p>The sole exception is sung at the show’s end and is called “As Long as There Is Love.” It’s meant to be the <em>Mrs. Doubtfire </em>jump-out ditty, as if today’s musicals contain such things. Nonetheless, It might catch on or not, according to whether listeners take to it for its sounding like every song of its type even composed, or resist it for the same reason. A few lines of the lyric go: “Just remember what you’ve got/’Cause you’ve really got a lot/If you  start, with a heart/In the right spot.” Nuff said?</p>\n<p>Given this to deal with, the collaborators mentioned above (as well as set designer David Korins, costume designer Catherine Zuber, lighting designer Philip S. Rosenberg, sound designer Brian Ronan, hair designer David Brian Brown, and conductor Zachary Dietz) do their considerable utmost to bring joy and pizzazz to the proceedings.</p>\n<p>Not easy to do when every time there’s the least provocation for an eye-popping-ear-popping number, it’s exploited to the bursting point. There’s a routine in which Mrs. Doubtfire is taught by a squad of chefs to make a meal from scratch. There’s gym number featuring stout-hearted men who lift hand weights. There’s a fashion show during which Miranda’s all-red MBody line is paraded. (Audience members who recall Cecil Beaton’s all-red Coco Chanel-like runway show in <em>Coco </em>might appreciate the reminder.)</p>\n<p>None of the routines seem anything more than greatly inflated. McClure works himself to the finger-elbow-knee-toe-bone from the instant he enters (as a pirate). He’s his own phenomenon. Maybe his greatest achievements are the multiple times he changes in front of the ticket buyers from Daniel to Mrs. Doubtfire and back again and then back again. Still, he also shines via his voice mimicry (a few Donald J. Trump seconds), his spirited terping, and his you-name-it as a reliably inspired performer.</p>\n<p>All of McClure’s versatility operates to some avail but not enough. (Perhaps enough to nail down the 2021-22 Tony nomination for leading actor in a musical.) The producers are lucky to have him but hardly lucky enough to make this <em>Mrs. Doubtfire </em>not come across more like <em>Mrs. Doubt</em>[mis]<em>fire</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Mrs. Doubtfire </b>opened December 5, 2021, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre<b>, and is on hiatus until March 15</b>.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Clyde’s</em>, the new Lynn Nottage play at the Helen Hayes, begins with a cartoon panel-like closeup through a take-out window of a sandwich being garnished. Food—or, rather, the noble sandwich—is very much on the metaphoric menu.</p>\n<p>“Maine lobster,” one character fantasizes, “potato roll gently toasted and buttered with roasted garlic, paprika and cracked pepper with truffle mayo, carmelized fennel and a sprinkle of&#8230;of&#8230;dill.”</p>\n<p>Are you hungry yet?</p>\n<p>The sandwiches—and these kitchen dreamers continually play at conjuring up ultra-tasty-sounding delights while filling less exalted orders rifled through the counter window by the cigarette-smoking dragon of a proprietor—are not sandwiches, per se. They are metaphors for life, specifically the life faced by these ex-cons struggling along the halfway-house treadmill to life outside.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/11/23/clydes-lynn-nottage-cooks-up-a-sharp-kitchen-set-comedy/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Clyde (Uzo Aduba), an ex-con herself, encourages her crew by giving them work at her truck-stop sandwich joint outside Reading, Pennsylvania. She also continually cuts them down, lording her power over them (and, it seems, physically abusing at least one of the men). “Let me tell you something,” she brays at emotionally centered “sensei”-like excon-chef Montrellous (Ron Cephas Jones): “That bitch ass sandwich ain’t gonna change a damn thing.”</p>\n<p>Is change possible for this &#8220;bunch of felons making sandwiches,&#8221; the others being short order cook Rafael (Reza Salazar) and prep chef Leticia (Kara Young)? Is there hope? Not apparently so, at Clyde’s Café. But Nottage is dealing in mystic symbols here, from figurative onstage evidence of fiery hell to the notion of these kitchen prisoners actually “escaping” from the play. Nottage seems to go out of her way to be purposefully imprecise; her intention, perhaps, is to force viewers to think, and consider, and involve themselves.</p>\n<p><em>Clyde’s</em> is something of an upbeat, other-side-of-the-coin companion to Nottage’s brutally riveting <em>Sweat</em>. The playwright devised them simultaneously, on an extended research trip to blue-collar Reading. When violent newcomer to the kitchen Jason (Edmund Donovan)—just out of jail, with threatening prison tats on his face—recounts the crime for which he was incarcerated, he pretty much describes the brutal attack we witnessed in the climactic scene of the earlier play. Both characters, in fact, are named Jason; he here mentions in passing two other <em>Sweat</em> characters.</p>\n<p>Furthering the ties, we find that when <em>Clyde’s</em> was first produced at the Guthrie in 2019—under the title <em>Floyd’s</em>, which seems to have been changed for reasons understandable—the tough-as-nails title character was played by Johanna Day, who was mesmerizing as Jason’s mother in <em>Sweat</em>. Which leads one to wonder just how much Nottage’s play was impacted by the alteration—also understandable—of the race of the domineeringly sadistic sandwich-shop proprietor. Or was this merely a casting choice, given the wide audience which might be attracted by the multiple Emmy-winning Aduba from <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>?</p>\n<p>This leads to what is at present the weak link in the evening: Clyde is the one character, and the one performance, that is less than convincing. Everyone else is—to borrow a word from Nottage&#8217;s kitchen—sublime. Stage veteran Jones, who also has two Emmys on his shelf (for <em>This Is Us</em>), brings impressive strength to the play. Salazar, who has appeared as the bus boy Oscar in multiple productions of <em>Sweat</em>, gives an energetic and affecting performance as the fry cook. Donovan, who played memorably damaged young men in Samuel D. Hunter’s <em>Greater Clements</em> and <em>Lewiston/Clarkson</em>, admirably expresses the barely restrained violence overflowing through Jason.</p>\n<p>That said, the stage radiates with the talent emanating from Kara Young, whom those of you fortunate enough to have seen Stephen Adly Guirgis’s <em>Halfway Bitches Go Straight to Heaven</em> might remember as that play’s poetry-writing abused teenaged ex-prostitute. <em>Clyde’s</em> marks the Broadway debut of Young, and she demonstrates magnetic power throughout.</p>\n<p>Frequent Nottage collaborator Kate Whoriskey (director of <em>Ruined</em> and <em>Sweat</em>) has staged a fine production, with a properly “liminal” set (as specifically called for by the playwright) from set designer Takeshi Kata and properly mystical touches from lighting designer Christopher Akerlind. Jennifer Moeller, meanwhile, gives Aduba an array of startling costumes that might well chasten <em>Diana</em> over at the Longacre. That desperately doomed princess has more actual costume changes than Clyde, yes; but <em>Diana</em> is 40 endless minutes longer than <em>Clyde’s</em>, and several of Moeller’s greasy spoon wardrobe choices are strikingly more eyegrabbing.</p>\n<p>Nottage is in the midst of her own personal uptown theater festival, with no less than three pandemic-delayed items scheduled to open by February 1 (the others being the Lincoln Center Theater opera version of her early play <em>Intimate Apparel</em> and the biomusical <em>MJ</em>). <em>Clyde’s </em>demonstrates that the twice-Pulitzered, MacArthur-winning author remains high among our most accomplished playwrights. And how.</p>\n<p><strong>Clyde&#8217;s opened November 23, 2021 at the Helen Hayes Theater and runs through January 16, 2022.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Given the choice in any restaurant, I will pretty much never opt for a sandwich. Honestly, sandwiches are hard to eat. They’re messy. Just chop everything up in a colorful crunchy salad, please.</p>\n<p>But the way two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Lynn Nottage (<em>Ruined</em>, <em>Sweat</em>) writes about sandwiches in her tempting new slice-of-life comedy, <em>Clyde’s</em>—and the way her characters rhapsodize about them—could bring me around.</p>\n<p>“Bacon, lettuce and…grilled squash on cornbread wit’ molasses butter,” offers Letitia (Kara Young).</p>\n<p>“Vietnamese sandwich, crisp baguette, barbecue pork,” begins Rafael (Reza Salazar). “Cilantro, diced sweet potatoes, a sprinkle of lime and hold for it…horseradish.”</p>\n<p>“Um, grilled skirt steak sautéed in butter, thinly sliced, caramelized onions and peach chutney,” suggests Jason (Edmund Donovan). On…? “A cheddar biscuit? A cheddar biscuit!”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/11/23/clydes-zestfully-tasty-new-play-from-lynn-nottage-with-cilantro-and-dill/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Mouthwatering, right? Though all of their recipes all pale in comparison with this—and every—creation from their coworker Montrellous (<em>This Is Us</em> Emmy winner Ron Cephas Jones, who quietly steals every scene he’s in): “Maine lobster, potato roll gently toasted and buttered with roasted garlic, paprika and cracked pepper with truffle mayo, caramelized fennel and a sprinkle of…of…dill.” When Montrellous starts to talk about sandwiches, time stands still; a majestic light beams down from above, and I swear I could hear angels singing. “Montrellous is a sensei,” Letitia says. “Drops garlic aioli like a realness bomb. He knows what we only wish to know.”</p>\n<p>Kitchen workers Letitia, Rafael, Jason, and their guru, Montrellous, spend their shifts dreaming up the perfect <em>Bon Appétit</em>–ready concoction at a purgatory-like Pennsylvania truck-stop sandwich shop named Clyde’s, run by the mean-as-a-cobra, tough-as-acrylic-nails Clyde (Uzo Aduba, late of TV’s <em>Mrs. America</em> and <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>). They’re all ex-cons—something Clyde, who also did time, uses to beat them into submission whenever she gets the chance. “She might actually be the devil,” muses Jason. And, in fact, she might. Consider the burst of flames she produces periodically.</p>\n<p>Her employees might be out of prison, but while they’re in Clyde’s kitchen, they’re in a prison of a different kind. They’re trying to build themselves up, but damned if Clyde doesn’t tear each of them down at every turn. She laughs at Jason’s sprinkle of Italian parsley—as if truckers are too unrefined to appreciate a garnish. She scoffs at Letitia’s “I’m gonna be a real chef” assertion: “Don’t disappoint me by having aspirations.” She’s almost incensed by a few sentences of media coverage, which Montrellous sees as a major opportunity (“It’s a blurb in a free newspaper that homeless guys use to wipe their asses,” she declares). And she spits nails when Montrellous refuses to put relish on the Manuel Luis Echegoyen, which he explains would “destroy the integrity of the sandwich.” (Gotta say, I’m with Monty on that one. As Letitia says earlier, “respect the recipe.”)</p>\n<p>All of this got me thinking…what kind of sandwich would I invent? And here’s what I landed on: prosciutto di Parma (sliced paper-thin), burrata, baby arugula, roasted peppers (or heirloom tomatoes, if they’re in season), and a balsamic reduction, on a semolina roll. I hope Montrellous would approve.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Clyde’s</em></strong><strong> opened Nov. 23, 2021, at the Helen Hayes Theater and runs through Jan. 16, 2022.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If a Broadway season in which Black playwrights are substantially represented has been a long time coming, the presence of one work is especially overdue. <em>Trouble in Mind</em>, by Alice Childress, the lavishly talented writer of plays and novels—among the latter the young adult classic <em>A Hero Ain&#8217;t Nothin’ but a Sandwich</em>—first premiered off-Broadway in 1955, and was optioned for a Broadway transfer at that time, four years before Lorraine Hansberry became the first Black female dramatist to be produced on the Great White Way. But Childress’s producers wanted certain concessions; <em>Trouble&#8217;</em>s account of a white director trying to stage a play about race relations written by a white man, with white and Black actors, apparently cut a little too close to the bone.</p>\n<p>Sixty-six years later, it may be hard to appreciate how daring Childress was in her time. But Roundabout Theatre Company and director Charles Randolph-Wright have ensured that <em>Trouble</em>’s eloquence and bite remain intact, with an excellent ensemble cast that features both estimable veterans and rising talent. LaChanze leads the company as Wiletta Mayer, an actress of a certain age; she won&#8217;t give a number when asked early in the play, by a considerably older fellow who works as a doorman in the theater where she&#8217;s rehearsing her latest project. Henry, endearingly played by Simon Jones, recognizes Wiletta from seeing her perform more than twenty years ago, and being enchanted by her beauty and her singing, so it&#8217;s immediately established that the character has enjoyed some success and is reasonably well-preserved.</p>\n<p>One could say much more for LaChanze, who will turn sixty in December but could pass for two decades younger, still exuding the kind of intrinsic glamor you can&#8217;t buy in any department store. Of course, Wiletta has had her struggles; as it is soon suggested, she has had to swallow her pride on more than a few occasions—a dilemma that Childress, who was also an actress herself, understood well, and drew on for the play—and there is weariness beneath her sparkling surface. &#8220;White folks can&#8217;t stand unhappy Negroes,&#8221; she warns John Nevins, the eager young actor cast her son, played by a charming Brandon Micheal Hall. &#8220;So laugh, laugh when it ain’t funny it all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/11/18/trouble-in-mind-better-as-theatrical-history-lesson-than-drama/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Suffice it to say that Wiletta will betray her own advice, and deeply regret having given it, as rehearsals get underway for the play within the play, <em>Chaos in Belleville</em>, which follows a young Black man named Job—subtle, huh?—facing a lynch mob in his Southern town. The son of sharecroppers, Job wants the right to vote, and ends up paying the ultimate price. Al Manners, the lump of vanity who is <em>Chaos</em>&#8216;s director, fancies the play progressive, but as the actors begin reading lines, it&#8217;s soon revealed as a laughable melodrama. Wiletta keeps her game face on for a while, dutifully wringing her hands and singing spirituals as the other actors, Black and white, field <em>Chaos</em>&#8216;s stilted dialogue and engage in similarly silly antics. It&#8217;s all pretty funny, until it isn’t—until the condescension and artifice are suddenly too much for Wiletta to bear, and Randolph-Wright adroitly guides his own company through Childress&#8217;s delicate balance of satire and sobering commentary.</p>\n<p>LaChanze is luminous and fierce in the central role, showing us the dignity and warmth that have sustained Wiletta where others might have simply become embittered. Another musical theater stalwart, Chuck Cooper, has a poignant turn as Sheldon Forrester, the veteran actor cast as Job&#8217;s father, whose obsequiousness contrasts with Wiletta&#8217;s rising pique, while Michael Zegen captures Manners&#8217;s unconscious arrogance to almost chilling effect. Don Stephenson and Danielle Campbell deliver deft comic performances as the white cast members, Bill O&#8217;Wray and Judy Sears—respectively, a latently racist character actor and a well-meaning but clueless ingénue—and Jessica Frances Dukes adds more punch as Millie Davis, a Black actress who is older than Judy but younger than Wiletta, and hasn&#8217;t quite arrived at the latter&#8217;s level of frustration, yet.</p>\n<p>The stark, spacious set—designed by Arnulfo Maldonado, making his Broadway debut after doing fine work in other houses—evokes both Wiletta&#8217;s warmer memories and the ghosts of those who have labored before her, under similar or worse circumstances. While <em>Trouble in Mind</em> clearly and potently reflects its era, its enduring freshness speaks to how much progress has yet to be made.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Trouble in Mind </b>opened November 18, 2021, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through January 9, 2022.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If you follow the New York theater scene, you&#8217;re by now well aware of the importance of the Roundabout Theatre Company&#8217;s new production of Alice Childress&#8217; 1955 play <em>Trouble in Mind</em>. This satirical drama about an interracial acting company rehearsing a drama about lynching was first seen Off-Broadway in 1955 to great acclaim. The work was scheduled for a Broadway production but was cancelled when the playwright refused to make changes, including a happy ending, that would make it more palatable for white audiences. Although it has been widely seen across the country in regional theaters, it is only now making its Broadway debut 66 years later.</p>\n<p>In the process, Childress lost the opportunity to become the first Black female playwright to have her work presented on Broadway, with the honor instead going to Lorraine Hansberry, whose <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em> debuted four years later in 1959.</p>\n<p>The play&#8217;s backstory is indeed so compelling that the Roundabout recounts it in a brief pre-show curtain announcement which naturally elicits cheers. And then the play begins, and it doesn&#8217;t take long for cold, hard reality to sink in: <em>Trouble in Mind</em> proves an uneven, problematic work whose history is more powerful than what we see onstage.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/11/18/trouble-in-mind-a-delayed-debut-still-fresh-and-troubling/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Set backstage at a Broadway theater, the play revolves around the rehearsals for a drama entitled &#8220;Chaos in Belleville,&#8221; written by a white playwright and concerning a lynching in a Southern town. The first to arrive is the play&#8217;s star Wiletta Mayer (LaChanze), heading up a company composed of eager newcomer John (Brandon Michael Hall); the highly competitive Millie (Jessica Frances Dukes); the older veteran Sheldon (Chuck Cooper); and two white performers, ingenue Judy (Danielle Campbell) and nervous character actor Bill (Don Stephenson). Tellingly, the play&#8217;s director, Al Manners (Michael Zegen, <em>The Remarkable</em> <em>Mrs. Maisel</em>), stage manager Eddie (Alex Mickiewicz) and even the elderly gofer Henry (stage veteran Simon Jones, nearly unrecognizable under a giant white beard), are white.</p>\n<p>Much of the first act is composed of relatively trivial banter, mostly genial but occasionally hostile, among the company members and director Manners, a young Hollywood hotshot who has very definite, Method Actor-style ideas about how the material should be played. At one point, he even conducts a word association test on a baffled Wiletta, prompting her with such racially charged terms as &#8220;Montgomery,&#8221; &#8220;colored&#8221; and &#8220;lynching.&#8221; She responds by launching into a spiritual song, which thankfully provides one of several opportunities for LaChanze to show off her glorious pipes. (Cooper also gets to unleash his powerful singing voice, but unfortunately all too briefly).</p>\n<p>The conflict between Wiletta and the tyrannical, manipulative Manners forms the heart of the play, eventually leading to an explosive confrontation toward the end in which she rebels against the manner in which she and the other Black performers have to contort themselves to conform to white stereotypes.</p>\n<p>Childress&#8217; themes are compellingly prescient and tragically still relevant, but the ham-fisted way in which they&#8217;re presented here proves frustratingly didactic. The evening starts out in lighthearted, comical fashion, although the laughs are meager at best, with virtually nothing happening plotwise in the first half. Along the way, we&#8217;re presented with laborious scenes from the play-within-a-play, which only further slows things down. The more serious moments, such as Sheldon&#8217;s monologue about witnessing a horrible lynching incident from his youth (strongly delivered by Cooper), and Wiletta finally asserting herself, feel more forced than organic.</p>\n<p>Director Charles Randolph-Wright doesn&#8217;t successfully balance the play&#8217;s comic and dramatic elements, with the result that the evening sometimes feels like a backstage comedy and other times like a polemic on race relations. The performances, too, vary in effectiveness, with the most memorable work coming from the luminous LaChanze, the veteran Cooper, and Dukes, who makes the most of the sardonic Millie.</p>\n<p>From a historical perspective, <em>Trouble in Mind</em> is an important, groundbreaking work. It&#8217;s just a shame that it feels so dated now upon its long belated Broadway premiere.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Trouble in Mind </b>opened November 18, 2021, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through January 9, 2022.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The true key to female empowerment has at long last been revealed: Christian Dior.</p>\n<p>At least, that&#8217;s the apparent message of &#8220;Pretty, Pretty Girl,&#8221; the Act One finale of the long-anticipated—and, thanks to a Netflix preview, already widely mocked—<em>Diana, The Musical</em>. The titular Princess of Wales, finally fed up with the hanky-panky between her husband and his mistress—that&#8217;s Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles, in case you&#8217;ve slept through the past four decades—resolves to wreak revenge by dressing to the nines in a succession of stunning designer threads, upstaging Charles at every turn as he tries to embark on a damage-control tour. What Diana is really doing, librettist and lyricist Joe DiPietro and composer and lyricist David Bryan suggest, is resorting to the only weapon in her arsenal to rebel against the over-scrutinized, under-loved existence that has been forced upon her.</p>\n<p>Of course, the ultimately tragic story of the phenom born Diana Spencer was never that simple, and neither is her enduring appeal to generations of women, who were well-represented at a recent performance, cheering Diana&#8217;s every wardrobe change—and clucking whenever Charles or Camilla said or did something condescending, meaning frequently. The People&#8217;s Princess, as she was dubbed by Tony Blair after her untimely death in 1997, was a forerunner of the kind of oversharing heroine/victims (her daughter-in-law Meghan Markle among them) who have thrived in recent years, evoking empathy in those who might otherwise envy them. Diana inspired a sort of weird twist on schadenfreude: People didn&#8217;t enjoy her suffering, but rather loved her because she suffered—from bulimia, from an unhappy marriage, from the rigidity of the royal family she chose to join, albeit at the tender age of nineteen—and she used the very media that allegedly tormented her to make those troubles plain. She continued to court the press after her divorce, posing for glossy magazine covers, dating the son of a billionaire business magnate and, yes, bravely advocating for a range of worthy causes.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/11/17/diana-the-peoples-princess-surrounded-by-the-wrong-people/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>It should come as no surprise, then, that paparazzi figure prominently in <em>Diana</em>. Cloaked figures wielding cameras like assault rifles pop up and multiply like roaches. Time and again, they engulf the princess, who is winningly played by Jeanna de Waal, a pert, agile actress whose warm, pretty singing voice is well suited to the part. If that voice sometimes seems overamplified, the effect is in sync with the arena-rock bombast sprinkled into Bon Jovi keyboardist Bryan&#8217;s mildly ingratiating score and John Clancy&#8217;s orchestrations. Among Diana&#8217;s many virtues, we are reminded, she was a huge eighties pop fan—not a Bach-loving egghead like her husband. The musical is as heavy on populist clichés as a Republican convention speech: Elites Charles and Camilla, played with admirable sportsmanship by Roe Hartrampf and Erin Davie, cunningly plot his union with the simple, unsuspecting virgin, then fret as the world falls in love with her. &#8220;We should be happy, <em>dahh</em>ling,&#8221; Mrs. Parker-Bowles sniffs at one point. &#8220;We&#8217;ve succeeded beyond our wildest imaginations.&#8221; Surely, it took great restraint for Bryan and DiPietro to not rhyme &#8220;Camilla&#8221; with &#8220;gorilla&#8221; in a song until well into Act Two.</p>\n<p>I could cite a number of even more cringe-worthy lyrics, but why bother? In truth, <em>Diana</em> isn&#8217;t much more insipid than any number of musical hagiographies that have popped up in recent decades, and director Christopher Ashley, to his credit, guides it with a light hand, having fun with the dishier aspects of the story rather than wallowing in the pathos. A scene documenting Diana&#8217;s rapport with AIDS patients is offset by one in which her boy toy James Hewitt turns up, played by a strapping, shirtless Gareth Keegan, bumping and grinding a bit of relief into our heroine&#8217;s dreary lot. Diana&#8217;s butler, Paul Burrell, is a stock character, the dutiful but mischievous servant, but Anthony Murphy plays him with infectious relish.</p>\n<p>Best of all, there is Judy Kaye, doing double duty as Queen Elizabeth II and Barbara Cartland—yes, the romance novelist, installed here as a sort of naughty fairy godmother who periodically advises Diana. Elizabeth, predictably, offers her own wry wisdom, reacting with sympathy and frustration to the foibles and indulgences of the younger royals, as I imagine her real-life counterpart has done for many, many years. Bryan and DiPietro even give her an eleven o&#8217;clock number, &#8220;An Officer&#8217;s Wife&#8221;; it&#8217;s pretty much pure sap, but Kaye invests it with dignity and heart.</p>\n<p>The real star of <em>Diana</em>, though, is the peerless costumer William Ivey Long, who has drawn inspiration from some of the title character&#8217;s favorite designers, and crafted nifty stuff for the whole ensemble. I stopped counting de Waal&#8217;s costume changes before intermission, but suffice it to say that if a Tony Award were handed to the actor who juggled the most in one production, no other trouper would stand a chance this season.</p>\n<p><strong>Diana opened November 17, 2021, at the Longacre Theatre.

Ancillary royals can be selfish, libertine, or profligate—Uncle David, sister Margaret, Californian Harry—but for those who sit on the big chair, well, heavy is the head.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so it seems, in a way, entirely appropriate (if also a touch counterfactual) that the Broadway hagiography about the woman who was once destined to ascend to Elizabeth’s title, if not exactly to her throne—we speak of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the new </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diana: A Musical</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—is, at its best, simply, perfectly dutiful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not good. It is not terrible. It is bloodless, procedural, and, in Christopher Ashley&#8217;s staging, constantly, exhaustingly turned up to 11. It lacks nearly any wit, poetry, or sense of fun—except in the few moments when the tone shifts, briefly and inexplicably, to camp. (The estimable Judy Kaye  doubles as both Diana’s regal mother-in-law and also her over-the-top step-grandmother, the pulpy romance novelist Barbara Cartland, and in the latter role offers most of those few goofy moments.) We appreciate, once again, the many trials, stolen triumphs, and ultimate tragedies of Diana’s life. But watching it all rehashed at the Longacre, we are not especially amused.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/11/17/diana-the-musical-the-princess-and-the-peepers/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em> ★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not for lack of effort. The accomplished young actor Jeanna de Waal is Diana, with this battleship of a production resting on her alternately ruffled or bare shoulders. She confronts the task with the steadfastness it requires, giving it her overbearing all from the very first number. She sings with full force, she stomps around the stage, she punches through a mirror when the script calls for her to demonstrate a propensity toward self harm. (No room for crowd-displeasing bulimia or cutting here.) She never seems especially happy, but she does what is required, which is perhaps the truest portrayal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roe Hartrampf, as her Charles, is a surprisingly handsome cipher, his hand firmly planted in his double-breasted coat pocket. Erin Davie acquits herself well in the thankless role of Camilla, and Gareth Keegan does what he can with James Hewett, Diana’s indiscreet inamorato, which consists entirely of opening the second act shirtless atop a horse, doing his best </span><a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/324537951198\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt Cavenaugh-in-</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Urban Cowboy</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. (The other bit of camp.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But we come, unavoidably, to the script. And the music. And the lyrics. Joe DiPietro and David Bryan wrote </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Memphis, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arguably the worst Best Musical Tony-winner of the 21st century. Here, DiPietro offers a script that rehashes Diana’s well-known story and contains no surprises, except where he fiddles with history. (An example: Asked in a post-engagement television interview whether the royal couple was in love, Charles famously answered, “Whatever ‘in love’ means.” Here, appropriately, there is a song called “Whatever Love Means Anyway.” But the first utterance of the line is, inexplicably, given to the Queen. Which is far less devastating.) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bryan’s music is forgettable pop-rock. And the pair’s lyrics are equally bad, all straightforward declarations, without any poetry, whimsy, or wordplay. Even their high points seem off: Diana’s end-of-Act I moment of conquest is as “pretty, pretty girl, in a pretty pretty dress” (hardly a feminist victory) and her final out-from-Windsor triumph  is “I choose happiness/ I choose a fresh new start/ I choose whatever lies ahead,” when we all know what lies ahead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alas they get little help from their designers: The lights are often blinding (like the paparazzi!), the set is a simple palace fence (like Diana was fenced in!), and while Diana’s gowns nicely reflect the iconic originals, and the woman are generally nicely dressed, the men other than Charles are all in poorly tailored suits, with shirt collars that don’t fit and neckties that are improperly tied. It looks as though William Ivey Long ran through his budget on the </span><a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/401732655152\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">green gown</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span><a href=\"https://people.com/royals/princess-diana-revenge-dress-true-story/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">revenge LBD</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and hit Century 21 for the gents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granted, these creators are starting at a disadvantage. It’s hard to get at emotional truths with famously unemotional characters. Stiff upper lips do not often break into character-revealing song. But rather than attempt a theatrical solution to that problem—a Leading Player to narrate, say, or ghostly former selves to comment on the action—DiPietro and Bryan simply ignore. Elizabeth gets an 11-o’clock change-of-heart number, “An Officer’s Wife,” recalling her young married days with Philip and prompting a tenderhearted willingness to grant Charles and Diana’s divorce. It’s sweet, if we only believed that ol’ Lilibet ever allowed herself a reverie. (Somehow Kaye-as-Elizabeth comes off most like <a href=\"https://www.playbill.com/article/the-verdict-critics-review-first-daughter-suite-musical-at-the-public-theater-com-368364?jwsource=cl\">Mary Testa-as-Barbara Bush</a>.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, if there’s anyone here who is ultimately mysterious and compelling, it’s Camilla. Though Diana’s epithet for her, the Rottweiler, is frequently repeated, the third person in their marriage in fact comes off as a kicked-aside stray. She’s not allowed to marry the love of her life, she tries to stay away but Charles keeps showing up, she stands by, and she waits, and, as we know, she eventually becomes a fine companion to the awkward prince in his old age. She also has perhaps the only good song in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diana</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “I Miss You Most on Sundays,” a pleasant “I want” song that, unlike the rest of the score, actually employs metaphor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s the final indignity, really, that I left </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diana</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> wanting more of Camilla. But that woman, perhaps the most dutiful of all, has a story to tell.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Diana opened November 17, 2021, at the Longacre Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Of all the unlikely bonds in contemporary theater, few have been as strange or as poignant as the one between Noah Gellman, an eight-year old Jewish boy living with his family in Louisiana in 1963, and Caroline Thibodeaux, the family maid, who is middle-aged and Black. Of course, as the latter maintains throughout <em>Caroline, or Change</em>—first produced at the Public Theater in 2003, with a book and lyrics by Tony Kushner and music by Jeanine Tesori— she and Noah are not and cannot be friends; and viewing their relationship through the lens of our current political discourse, with its emphasis on differences in power and privilege, makes this more obvious than ever.</p>\n<p>But <em>Caroline&#8217;</em>s own power, and its beauty—now in evidence in a London-based production brought to Broadway via the Roundabout Theatre Company, under Michael Longhurst&#8217;s direction—lie in how the musical underlines these differences while promoting empathy, and also pointing to our capacity for progress. Inspired by Kushner&#8217;s own background, the story unfolds during another era when racial tension and economic inequality were very much in focus, and the struggles of its key characters—a divorced mother of four, whose life has been defined by poverty and abuse, and a lonely little boy who recently lost his own mom to cancer—are interwoven with those of other men, women, and children, in ways that also bring generational contrasts very much into light.</p>\n<p>Caroline is, as the show&#8217;s title indicates, its central figure, and presents a challenge for any actor. If she could afford a shrink, she would likely be diagnosed with depression, though it&#8217;s questionable to what extent therapy or even medication could benefit a woman who spends her days sealed in a basement, cleaning clothes, and her nights worrying about how to feed and clothe children whose alcoholic father walked out after beating her one time too many. Sharon D Clarke, who earned the second of three Olivier Awards playing the role on the West End, offers an interpretation that is even darker and bleaker than that of the original Caroline, the superb Tonya Pinkins. Solidly built, with a strikingly low speaking voice, Clarke alternately projects stoicism and bitterness to withering effect. Her dryness can be funny, too, particularly in her interaction with the ever-eager Noah, whose own misery and youthful imagination have led him to overestimate his significance to her. At a recent preview, the boy was played by Adam Makké, with plaintive sweetness and his own comic panache. (Gabriel Amoroso and Jaden Myles Waldman also alternate in the role.)</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/27/caroline-or-change-sharon-d-clarke-offers-a-bracing-performance-in-tesori-kushner-musical/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>But when Clarke raises that voice in song, Caroline&#8217;s emotions burst forth in full color. &#8220;Gonna pass me a law that night last longer,&#8221; she sings wearily, then later issues a proclamation that Nat &#8220;King&#8221; Cole &#8220;gotta come over my house&#8230; every night and stroke my soul.&#8221; Caroline is no dreamer, needless to say; she reprimands and fears for her second-eldest child and only daughter, the feisty Emmie—given a piercing voice and a sparkling presence by Samantha Williams—who responds to news of President Kennedy&#8217;s death by telling her mother, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t got no tears to shed for no dead white guy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The &#8220;change&#8221; in the musical&#8217;s title refers in part to the coins that Noah&#8217;s stepmother insists Caroline should keep after finding them in his pants pockets, a demand that hurts Caroline’s pride, and tests the integrity she has sustained in spite of her circumstances. On a larger scale, of course, Kushner is referring to the change that Emmie pines for and represents—change that can come slowly, it is stressed, but that is inevitable. This message is relayed in the show, which is mostly sung-through, by a sort of Greek chorus of inanimate objects: There&#8217;s The Washing Machine, given a fittingly bubbly soprano by Arica Jackson, and Radios 1, 2 and 3—a trio (Nasia Thomas, Nya, and Harper Miles, all excellent) who lend girl-group buoyancy to the Motown influences in Tesori&#8217;s score, which also draws on blues, gospel and, when the Gellmans are in focus, klezmer. Some of the most foreboding musical passages involve The Dryer and The Bus, both embodied by Kevin S. McCallister’s demonic bass-baritone; some of the loveliest ones include The Moon, played by N’Kenge, whose crystalline vocals bring out the classical nuances also in the score as she hovers over Fly Davis&#8217;s lean but vividly embellished set.</p>\n<p>Other notable performances in human roles include Tamika Lawrence&#8217;s warm but nicely understated take on Dotty, Caroline&#8217;s long-suffering friend; John Cariani&#8217;s quietly heartrending portrait of Noah&#8217;s father, Stuart Gellman, a musician who either communicates or avoids communication by playing the clarinet; Caissie Levy&#8217;s sharp, sympathetic portrayal of Noah&#8217;s stepmother, Rose, whose habit of trying too hard while absorbing too little endears her to no one; and Chip Zien&#8217;s funny, ultimately moving turn as Mr. Stopnick, Rose&#8217;s father, a self-styled social justice warrior who gets more than he bargains for when he visits from New York City.</p>\n<p>If there are a few slow-moving moments in Longhurst&#8217;s production, the payoff is big; it&#8217;s unlikely that anyone with a beating heart will leave after Act Two without moist eyes, or at least a lump in the throat. That&#8217;s not because of the sadness in Kushner&#8217;s story, of which there is plenty; it&#8217;s because of the sense of hope that ultimately cuts through it, blazing through the final number. It&#8217;s not easy to juggle despair and exuberance without resorting to sentimentality, and <em>Caroline</em> still manages the task handily.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Caroline, or Change </b>opened October 27, 2021, at Studio 54 and runs through January 9, 2022.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Sharon D Clarke doesn’t quite take the stage of Studio 54, mind you. She is cemented to it—or rather, to the basement laundry room of a house in Lake Charles, Louisiana, with roots as impervious to upheaval as the courthouse statue of “the South’s Defender” that greets us as we file into the theater. Like that oppressive memorial to the vanquished crusaders of the Confederacy, Caroline—the central character in Jeanine Tesori and Tony Kushner’s monumental <em>Caroline, or Change</em>—is entrenched in a place (the deep South) and time (late November 1963) where nothing will, or can, possibly change.</p>\n<p>Except the authors foresee and, historically, know that change was imminent. For Louisiana, for the Nation, and most grudgingly for Caroline. (Bookwriter/lyricist Kushner has a not disinterested connection to the material: He was just then a seven-year-old transplanted New Yorker with a clarinet-playing father living in Lake Charles and being raised by what we now call a housekeeper but was in that particular universe always referred to as “the maid.”)</p>\n<p>The white-uniformed Caroline is, as we say, rooted to that basement, surrounded by the din of the washing machine and the hum of the unseasonable bullfrogs of autumn, until late in the second act. At which point the character takes the stage in a self-lacerating solo (“Lot’s Wife”) that bursts the figurative chains of time and place and musical theater form. And at which point Clarke—who has thus far been a remarkable, intensely controlled presence—breaks through with a searing intensity most welcome after the recent series of societal upheavals. Some of which, mind you, are especially relevant to the theme and content of <em>Caroline, or Change</em>.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/27/caroline-or-change-of-despair-and-hope-and-singing-washing-machines/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Clarke, a Londoner making her Broadway debut, is not exactly an unknown quantity, given her three Olivier Awards. (These include one for her 2018 performance in this role and another for her Linda Loman opposite Wendell Pierce in the Young Vic’s staggering 2019 <em>Death of a Salesman,</em> which fully deserves to be seen on the New York stage). Here, Clarke provides a compelling reason to see Michael Longhurst’s production of the Tesori-Kushner musical, which has been imported with an otherwise local cast.</p>\n<p>Clarke is surrounded by a strong group of supporting players, including John Cariani as the clarinetist father (and offering what appears to be a bravura display of clarinet-playing); Arica Jackson and N’Kenge as, respectively, the Washing Machine and the Moon; Tamika Lawrence as Dotty; and Chip Zien as the fiery socialist New York grandfather. Special mention should be made of Kevin S. McAllister’s rendition of the mournful &#8220;bus&#8221; song. Adam Makké, one of the young actors who alternates as Noah, was excellent at the performance attended. And I was especially impressed by Caissie Levy as the nudgingly needy step-mother Rose. (Levy was seen here as Elsa in the recent <em>Frozen</em>. Back in 2011, she starred with Clarke in the London production of the negligible <em>Ghost</em>, a role that Levy—but not Clarke—repeated on Broadway.)</p>\n<p>Longhurst’s production, along with the choreography by Ann Yee, is somewhat more earthy and musical-comedy-flashy than George C. Wolfe’s delicately ethereal original. The unit set, centering on the basement laundry room, forces parts of the action upstairs—literally—onto a narrow second level. The show is especially strong in the music department, with Tesori’s score played by a fine band under the direction of Joseph Joubert (who, with Rick Bassett and Buryl Red, orchestrated the original production).</p>\n<p>Tesori and Kushner, back in 2004 and with the guiding hand of director-producer Wolfe, were forging a somewhat different form of new American chamber musical. Precisely what they wrought is a discussion for another time. But the original <em>Caroline, or Change</em>, which started at the Public and mounted a brave if quixotic Broadway run at the O’Neill, can be seen as the impetus for a chain of provocative new-style musicals that includes Tesori’s own <em>Fun Home </em>as well as <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> and <em>The Band’s Visit</em>.</p>\n<p>A major change of the times: When viewing the play originally, a large segment of the audience was immediately and fully aware—thanks to dialogue and lyrics clearly telling us that we were in late November of 1963 and change was in the air—precisely what was about to happen, one state and 350 miles away. A portentous signpost to which most of the current audience, alas, seems oblivious.</p>\n<p><strong>Caroline, or Change opened October 27, 2021, at Studio 54 and runs through January 9, 2022.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>To say that there is a kinetic thrill emanating from the stage of the St. James Theatre at present is something of an understatement. What you get in <em>David Byrne&#8217;s American Utopia</em> is a hundred-minute jolt that stays with you long after you’ve exited onto 44th Street.</p>\n<p>Byrne fans will know, presumably, what to expect from the New Wave musician. And yes, he delivers with a premium grade high octane performance. The question, though, is how does <em>American Utopia</em> fare with theatergoers more accustomed to—and comfortable with—what you might call <em>old</em> wave music?</p>\n<p>Like a thousand-watt thunderbolt, bringing a keen appreciation of Byrne and his artistry.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/17/american-utopia-the-joyous-theatrical-concert-we-still-need/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Here we have what is basically a non-theatrical musical revue, steeped in stunning theatricality. A concert performed on what is basically a three-sided rectangle devoid of the merest scenic apparatus, yet filled with eye-popping visuals. A cast consisting of one songwriter plus 11 musicians, without a traditional theater-performer in sight. Yet this is the most energetic, dancing-est Broadway show this side of <em>Moulin Rouge!</em></p>\n<p>Byrne first treaded theatrical waters with the stunning <em>Here Lies Love</em>, which triumphed at the Public Theater in 2003 but was unable find a feasible venue to allow an extended run. <em>American Utopia</em> was devised as a 2018 concept album. The traditional concert tour left Byrne and cohort wondering whether the presentation could be reconfigured as a legit piece.</p>\n<p>And how! The theater version opened to high acclaim in October 2019 for a limited four-month engagement at the Hudson. Plans to bring it back in September 2020 were upended, just like everything was upended in those dark days. <em>American Utopia</em> is now back in town, at the considerably larger St. James, for another six-month run.</p>\n<p>The same, but somewhat different. Certainly, Byrne’s ongoing commentary has been altered to reflect the changing times. (Born in Scotland and raised in Canada and the United States, Byrne offers wise and trenchant philosophical and political views within and between songs.)</p>\n<p>The production is stunning. Byrne appears in a well-tailored grey suit, with bare feet. His stagemates—two vocalists, six percussionists, and three additional musicians—gradually appear, similarly garbed and similarly barefoot. The musicians wear custom-made harnesses which allow them to play their various instruments while in constant movement. And that movement, choreographed and staged by Annie-B Parson, is remarkable (to say the least). Everyone, from Byrne on, is propelled like a kinetic automaton throughout the evening; movement here, actual dance steps there, and practically perpetual motion.</p>\n<p>The show is impeccably fashioned. The all-important lighting and sound design come from Rob Sinclair and Pete Keppler, respectively. Alex Timbers, director of Byrne’s <em>Here Lies Love</em> and the current <em>Moulin Rouge</em>, is credited as “production consultant.” There is no scenic designer mentioned, but whoever came up with the versatile walls of what look like metal chain beads made an immense contribution to the evening.</p>\n<p>The band is led by music directors Karl Mansfield (on the keyboard) and Mauro Refosco (percussion). The rest are so spectacularly entertaining and individually talented that we’ll cite them, alphabetically, as a group: Jacquelene Acevedo, Gustavo Di Dalva, Daniel Freedman, Chris Giarmo, Tim Keiper, Tendayi Kuumba, Stéphane San Juan, Angie Swan, and Bobby Wooten III. Given that the show is all music, due praise goes to Byrne and his songwriting companions: Brian Eno and numerous other collaborators are all duly credited in the back of the program.</p>\n<p>At evening’s end, Byrne invites the audience to stand up and dance their way through “Burning Down the House,” adding that the Fire Department has requested that people not dance in the aisles. Because, he adds, patrons dancing in the aisles would have an unfair advantage in case of fire. At the performance attended, not quite everyone stood and danced; but you still had 1,500 or so fans stomping their collective 3,000 feet. Welcome back to Broadway.</p>\n<p><strong>David Byrne’s American Utopia resumed its run on September 17, 2021 at the St. James Theatre and continues through April 3, 2022.

Photo : Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>David Byrne&#8217;s American Utopia</em> can be described as a theatrical concert, but let&#8217;s call it what it really is: musical therapy for emotionally traumatized audiences. When the show originally opened nearly two years, we were suffering under the Trump administration and then an attempted insurrection. In the period that the production was on hiatus, the world has endured a deadly pandemic. So is it any wonder that we all feel like &#8220;Burning Down the House&#8221;? If there was any justice in the world, this show would remain on Broadway forever as a respite from future crises.</p>\n<p>The former Talking Heads frontman has always delivered complicated messaging in his music. This is a songwriter, after all, who famously got people on their feet and dancing to the nihilistic first-person ramblings of &#8220;Psycho Killer.&#8221; But with this show, which toured much larger venues internationally before landing on Broadway, Byrne provides a soothing emotional balm to a world in which we seem to communicate largely through social media.</p>\n<p>The evening begins with Byrne onstage, pondering a model of the human brain and wondering why babies apparently have more neural connections than adults. This leads to the opening song, &#8220;Here,&#8221; as he points to different sections of the model and sings, &#8220;Here is a region of abundant details, here is a region that is seldom used/Here is a region that continues living, even when the other sections are removed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/17/american-utopia-david-byrne-and-his-merry-band-lift-us-back-to-our-feet/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Reprising a stylistic concert device that he&#8217;s often used in the past, he&#8217;s slowly joined by the other performers, who come onstage as if summoned by a musical pied piper. Eventually, the stage fills with eleven other musicians, including singer/dancers Chris Giarmo and Tendayi Kuumba, guitarist Angie Swan, bassist Bobby Wooten III, keyboardist Karl Mansfield (perhaps the MVP of the band), and no less than six percussionists: Jacquelene Acevedo, Gustavo Di Dalva, Daniel Freedman, Tim Keiper, Mauro Refosco and Stephane San Juan. Their names are all mentioned here because their brilliant musicianship is absolutely integral to the show&#8217;s success.</p>\n<p>The deceptively simple but genius notion that Byrne had was to have all of the musicians performing wirelessly, so that they can move around the stage while they play. And move they do, constantly, with Annie-B Parson&#8217;s endlessly inventive choreography and musical staging making the show as fascinating to watch as to hear. Many musical artists have incorporated choreography into their acts (Motown made it a trademark), but not to the extent of this show. The dancing and movement feel both precisely calibrated and joyful in its simulated abandon, with Rob Sinclair&#8217;s protean lighting making an invaluable contribution. There are times when the ensemble feels utterly individual, each marching to the beat of a different drummer (or in this case, six drummers), and other times when it seems to function like a single, multi-faceted organism.</p>\n<p>The set list (almost a banal term for a show like this), includes 21 songs culled from the Talking Heads and Bryne&#8217;s solo career, as well as a cover of Janelle Monae&#8217;s protest song &#8220;Hell You Talmbout,&#8221; which Bryne informs us he asked permission to play since he&#8217;s a &#8220;white man of a certain age.&#8221; The number is composed largely of chants of the names of African-Americans killed by the police, and it&#8217;s a discouraging sign of the times that it seems to need continual updating.</p>\n<p>While the newer songs and deep cuts don&#8217;t have the anthemic power of the Talking Heads hits, they have such lyrical resonance and are performed here in such stirring fashion that the evening never flags. Throughout the show, Byrne acts as a genial, frequently self-deprecating host; introducing &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s Coming to My House,&#8221; he describes hearing a high school choir&#8217;s rendition that made the song sound much sunnier than it is. He then cheerfully admits that while he likes their version better, he nonetheless has to do it his considerably darker way. He also makes an impassioned plea for people to vote, having a spotlight trained on a small section of the audience to represent the tiny percentage of registered voters who participate in local elections.</p>\n<p>There are striking visual touches throughout. At the beginning of &#8220;Once in a Lifetime,&#8221; Bryne jerks his body around, as if he&#8217;s being buffeted by unseen forces. &#8220;Glass, Concrete &amp; Stone&#8221; starts out with the musicians performing from behind the metallic curtains, only their instruments peeking out. All of the performers, including Byrne, are clad in light grey suits and button-down shirts and yet barefoot, as if unable to figure if they&#8217;re hipsters or hippies.</p>\n<p>The show is largely unchanged from its original incarnation, although some of the between-song patter reflects recent events. When Byrne once again thanks the audience for leaving their homes, he comments that the greeting has a very different meaning in light of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s the rousing polyrhythmic music that produces the joyous effect and has the audience on their feet. The show ends in optimistic fashion with the soaring &#8220;One Fine Day,&#8221; but leave it to Byrne to send us home on a more ambiguous note with &#8220;Road to Nowhere.&#8221; We may not know where we&#8217;re going, but we can certainly dance on the way.</p>\n<p><strong>David Byrne’s American Utopia resumed its run on September 17, 2021 at the St. James Theatre and continues through March 6, 2022.

Photo: Chad Batka</figcaption></figure>\n<p>What if I told you that the best acting on Broadway is coming from a woman who doesn’t utter a single word?</p>\n<p>As you might have heard, in Lucas Hnath’s <em>Dana H.</em>—now on Broadway after runs in Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York at off-Broadway’s Vineyard Theatre—the dynamite Deirdre O’Connell lip-syncs every bit of dialogue. In another ingenious turn, that dialogue itself is cut together from multiple 2015 interviews between Hnath’s mother, Dana Higginbotham, and Steve Cosson, artistic director of The Civilians.</p>\n<p>While Hnath is an acclaimed playwright—his works include <em>Hillary and Clinton</em>, the Tony-nominated <em>A Doll’s House, Part 2</em>, and <em>The Christians</em>—he was smart to use those recorded interviews; <em>Dana H. </em>wouldn’t be as powerful if not for its documentary-style script (not unlike <em>Is This A Room</em>, which is running in repertory with <em>Dana H.</em> at the Lyceum).</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/17/dana-h-deirdre-oconnell-brilliant-in-lucas-hnaths-portrait-of-his-mother/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>There’s no artifice or theatrical wizardry on display here: Before O’Connell begins speaking, we see a stagehand fit her with wired earbuds; she’s hearing Dana’s voice just as we are. Beeps alert us to cuts and splices in the recorded interviews. And occasionally we hear Cosson prodding her along as she recalls a horrific five-month stretch in 1998 in which she was abducted, beaten, and terrorized by a mentally disturbed ex-convict.</p>\n<p>Dana is a hospice chaplain with a calming voice and palliative demeanor. “I have been present at the point of death at the very moment of death and the average is about 3 or 4 times a week for 20 years,” she says, “so multiply that.” She was a chaplain in a psych ward when she met Jim (“…he was just a very intimidating character to look at”). She counseled him; he came to her Bible study. And when he was released, she took him for a meal, gave him shelter during Christmas (“I remember him sharpening the pen…to make a weapon”), and helped him find an apartment.</p>\n<p>Dana describes the ensuing disturbing litany of events with an almost journalistic detachment. She mentions “carrying out jobs, hits”; purchasing a gun at a pawn shop; buying bomb-making supplies at Walmart. “He’s got his hand on my neck the whole time,” she recalls, “almost everywhere we were his hand was always on my neck.”</p>\n<p>It’s hard for her to remember all the details—the exact timeline. Dana frequently thumbs through a thick manuscript, something she wrote in 2013. Or is it hard for her to tell us the details, and does she just need a bit of a breather now and then? Because they certainly are difficult to hear.</p>\n<p>And I know what you’re thinking. Why didn’t she run away? Call the cops? Reader, she did! <em>Of course she did!</em> She’s black and blue all over, and the police come back with: “You know it’s just your word against his.” And: “We can keep him for maybe 48 hours maybe 72 we’re not sure but that’s all we can do.” As she later explains: “Every encounter ended with him and the cop over there chatting and pats on the backs and smiles and off he went. Leading him right back to me so that I was never able to uh fully escape.”</p>\n<p>Still, the most astonishing part about <em>Dana H.</em> is its utter lack of bitterness and rage. She does allow herself one moment of sarcasm—“Oh, ok, my favorite part”—before reciting, very quickly, the details of perhaps the most violent, damaging moment of the entire experience. Then again, this is a woman who stares death in the face for a living. It’s not surprising that what we hear in Dana&#8217;s voice, more than anything else, is strength.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dana H.</em></strong><strong> opened October 17, 2021, at the Lyceum Theatre and runs through November 28.

Photo: Chad Batka</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Maybe not the first observation to make about <em>Dana H., </em>playwright Lucas Hnath’s new piece, is that it contains an unforgettable feat. All the same, I’m going to observe it. Throughout, Deirdre O’Connell, a New York City actress not nearly as celebrated as she deserves to be, pulls off an unusually astounding accomplishment. (The awards she’s already amassed during her career must be near to collapsing a home shelf.)</p>\n<p>For the overwhelming part of 80 minutes, O’Connell lip-syncs a testimony that playwright Hnath’s mother gave some time ago about her life, a life marked dramatically by a terrifying episode from which she still hasn’t recovered. For that matter, she isn’t entirely convinced it happened.</p>\n<p>In giving testimony to Hnath’s not-seen-but-heard-on-tape friend Steve Cosson, Dana H. spoke—as people do when talking under duress—by stumbling over words, coughing, hesitating, uttering the occasion “um-er” equivalent, giving into embarrassed laughter, breathing warily.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/17/dana-h-deirdre-oconnell-triumphs-in-a-survivor-story/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>At no time does O’Connell commit the slightest lip-synched mistake. As she delivers the lines (from elided tapes), she accompanies herself with appropriate gestures, often while paging through a manuscript she holds containing the harrowing 2013 memoir she was finally able to write about a central, five-month-long 1997 incident.</p>\n<p>So yes, O’Connell is again offering her audience a tour de force commensurate with the accolades she received when <em>Dana H. </em>opened two years ago at the Vineyard.</p>\n<p>That enthusiastically said, Hnath’s <em>Dana H. </em>does prompt some touchy questions. Notice that above I referred to it as a “piece,” which is a way of suggesting that an actor sitting in a chair for most of the hour and twenty minutes it takes to unfold doesn’t necessarily rise to the level of a play, On the other hand, <em>Dana H. </em>is certainly a something. But what exactly? Perhaps it validates itself sufficiently as a verbatim account of a dreadful event in one woman’s life, an experience representative of what might occur in a society ill-prepared to deal with these and other horrors visited on women. (For recent comparison, consult <em>A German Life</em>, Christopher Hampton’s adaptation of Joseph Goebbels’ chilling, emotionless secretary’s tale, as rendered by a sitting, non-lip-synching Maggie Smith.)</p>\n<p>As Hnath presents it and director Les Waters carefully shapes it, Dana H. introduces herself as a chaplain recognized for her success with difficult patients as well as for her outstanding care at dying patients’ bedsides. Relieved of her duties when superiors hear of her impending divorce and follow company policy, she finds work elsewhere and is eventually brought into contact with suicidal Jim (no surname supplied).</p>\n<p>Recovering from the hideous but failed attempt to end his life, Jim retaliates by kidnapping Dana H., forcing her on a cross-country chase including multiple criminal acts. Having her purchase a gun—which he’s unable to undertake himself due to a criminal record—is only one of the episodes she endures. Purchasing ingredients for a bomb he eventually sets off is another. Declaring  her “favorite part,” Dana H. devotes much of her confessional time chronicling the worst act she underwent. That won’t be detailed here.</p>\n<p>Explaining how Jim constantly kept her by his side, Dana H. reports that even when Jim and she were briefly separated, he convinced her she was being watched. That she believed him, never attempting to make a run for it might pique some observers’ disbelief. Then again, others might call to mind Patty Hearst and the frightening Stockholm Syndrome.</p>\n<p>Obviously, Dana H. is rescued from her living nightmare—there is an incident when she felt she was about to lose her life—but the situation lingers that <em>Dana H. </em>isn’t quite a play. Not that Hnath and director Waters don’t make a valiant try to clinch it. About two-thirds through the work the lights fade for several seconds and when they come up, O’Connell is gone and a pulsating lighting-and-sound interlude tales over—Paul Toben the lighting designer, Mikhail Fiksel on sound.</p>\n<p>Fiksel increasingly piles loud and louder chunks of the Dana H./Cosson tapes one on the other. Toben rainbows the lights on set designer Andrew Boyce’s version of an anonymous hotel (motel?) room where at least one of the traveling tapes is recorded.</p>\n<p>Possibly, the foremost question a <em>Dana H. </em>spectator wants answered is the huh-why of Hnath’s exposing the hours of tapes his mother sat for. The likely answer is that he’s persuaded himself that the world needs to know about such daily atrocities. Dana does mention she found trying to get police attention futile. Yet, there remains a soupçon of humiliation in Hnath’s endeavor, this from a first-rate playwright who makes a policy of never repeats himself from play to play.</p>\n<p>It seems likely that in <em>Dana H., </em>Hnath has his reasons for both allying himself with his mother and separating himself from her. Nonetheless, he has written a theatre piece that unmistakably demands considerable thought and even more unmistakably boasts Deirdre O’Connell’s unbounded talents.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Dana H. </b>opened October 17, 2021, at the Lyceum Theatre and runs through November 28.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Theatrical astonishment is back on the Broadway boards. <em>The Lehman Trilogy</em>, which has conquered and enraptured audiences since it first appeared, has finally arrived at the Nederlander after a pandemic pause. New Yorkers who missed the production’s instantly sold-out limited engagement at the Park Avenue Armory in 2019 have 12 weeks before it moves on to brief stops in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Miss it at your peril.</p>\n<p>A three-hour-plus drama about the unparalleled rise and disastrous fall of the Lehman financial dynasty might not sound like indispensable viewing to some. But that’s where the magic comes in. <em>The Lehman Trilogy</em> is intriguing, involving, and sparklingly filled with theatrical wizardry. Wizard-in-chief is director Sam Mendes, yes; but honors extend to just about everyone on and behind the stage. This includes Stefano Massini, the Italian playwright; Ben Power, who with Mendes fashioned this English-language version for London’s National Theatre; and the entire design and music teams. Not to mention the cast of dozens—or rather, three actors sliding with quicksilver ease into myriad roles of varied ages and genders without bothering to change out of their dour, 19th-century garb.</p>\n<p><em>The Lehman Trilogy</em> is a comprehensive but crystal-clear chronicle of three penniless German immigrants to the United States from Bavaria, the first arriving in 1844. The Americanization of the woefully out-of-place Bavarian brothers Henry (Simon Russell Beale), Emanuel (Adrian Lester), and Mayer (Adam Godley) eventually brings them to the realization that there is far more to be earned by being what they term “middlemen.” Especially because in this guise they needn’t grow the material, manufacture the material, or even personally handle it: Just take a substantial guaranteed profit from the seller and an immoderate profit on the other end. Which culminates, 164 years later, in financial bankruptcy and the Great Recession of 2008.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/14/the-lehman-trilogy-sam-mendes-landmark-production-makes-a-triumphant-broadway-debut/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>[<em>Read our <a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/09/04/the-lehman-trilogy-a-thrilling-look-at-the-american-experience-from-london/\">London</a> and <a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/03/28/the-lehman-trilogy-theatrical-magnificence-from-sam-mendes-at-the-armory/\">Park Avenue Armory</a> reviews here.</em>]</p>\n<p>There are two major differences in the production now ensconced on 41st Street. Both, most happily, serve to enhance the evening’s magic. The altogether extraordinary Beale and equally adept Godley are now joined by a new compatriot. Lester—an Olivier winner for his performance as Bobby in Mendes’ 1995 London production of <em>Company</em>—made a most memorable New York debut in 2014 as Ira Aldridge in Lolita Chakrabarti’s <em>Othello</em>-infused <em>Red Velvet</em>. He brings added dimension to the formerly less-interesting brother Emanuel and the multiple roles essayed over the course of the evening (including his impressive work in the Act 3 “Black Thursday” section).</p>\n<p>The other difference is spatial. At both the National and the Armory, the extra-wide stage space served to isolate Es Devlin’s remarkable, cube-like set. Seen in a more traditional proscenium house, that same set now dominates our view. This serves to make the action more viscerally immediate. The spatial relationship also seems to compress the expanse of the projection screens, enhancing the extreme power and ultimate frenzy of Luke Halls’ video design. Let us not overlook stellar contributions from costume designer Katrina Lindsay, lighting designer Jon Clark, composer/sound designer Nick Powell, and music director Candida Caldicot who is ever-present downstage at the upright. The piece was first performed as an Italian radio play in 2012, followed by stage productions in France and Italy. It was alchemist Mendes and then-National Theatre deputy director Power who translated and transformed Massini’s original five-hour, large cast epic into the marvel that is now in view.</p>\n<p>When we first saw <em>The Lehman Trilogy</em> in London in 2018, we instantly rated it as the finest theatrical experience since Jez Butterworth’s <em>The Ferryman</em> (which, most significantly, was also spearheaded by Mendes). Three years and a pandemic later, that appraisal more than holds. <em>The Lehman Trilogy</em> is a unique stage experience not to be missed. Treat yourself now, as you just might feel the necessity of paying the astonishing Beale-Godley-Lester team a return visit before they depart.</p>\n<p><strong>The Lehman Trilogy opened Oct. 14, 2021, at the Nederlander Theatre and runs through Jan. 2, 2022.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It shouldn&#8217;t work, it really shouldn&#8217;t. A three-and-a-half-hour drama spanning over 160 years, featuring a mere three actors playing dozens of roles ranging from infants to coquettish young women to elderly men, depicting complicated historical and financial events with a minimum of scenery. And with much of the dialogue delivered in the form of third person narration, no less. It sounds like a recipe for disaster, but <em>The Lehman Trilogy</em> proves an unalloyed theatrical triumph.</p>\n<p>Previously seen on our shores at the cavernous Park Avenue Armory, the production, first staged at London&#8217;s National Theatre, had its original Broadway transfer plans derailed last year due to the COVID pandemic. Thankfully, the stars have aligned and it&#8217;s now receiving its long-delayed Broadway run at the relatively intimate Nederlander Theatre, a far more advantageous venue for this drama which somehow manages to feel epic and intimate simultaneously. The superb British actor Adrian Lester, making his Broadway debut, has joined the cast, replacing Ben Miles, who had a previous commitment.</p>\n<p>Stefano Massini&#8217;s play, adapted by Ben Power, opens in 1844 with the arrival in America of the Bavaria-born Heyum Lehmann (Simon Russell Beale), who, as with so many immigrants of his era, was promptly renamed the more Americanized Henry Lehman. He&#8217;s eventually joined by his brothers Mayer (Adam Godley) and Emanuel (Lester), who partner with him on a fabric and clothing store in Montgomery, Alabama.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/14/the-lehman-trilogy-astonishing-sam-mendes-production-finally-reaches-broadway/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Over the course of multiple decades and generations of the Lehman family, their modest retail business goes through many permutations before eventually morphing into the financial industry powerhouse that came crashing down in 2008. Along the way, they navigated their way through the American Civil War and two world wars, the dawn of the nuclear and computer eras, and the economic transformation from material goods to the moving around of money. It&#8217;s a quintessential American tale, ironically related by an Italian playwright and largely British creative team.</p>\n<p>Presented in three sections, each running roughly an hour, the play never feels overly dense despite its complex subject matter and profusion of characters and situations. The evening flows beautifully from scene to scene, with the amazingly skilled actors delineating their multiple roles with elegant precision. Despite never once changing from their initial 19<sup>th</sup>-century dark garb, they compellingly transform themselves with chameleon-like agility. When Beale plays a divorcee flirtily bantering with a Lehman descendant at a racetrack, he never lurches into caricature but rather subtly shifts his voice and body language to suggest wily femininity. His performance, like those of his co-stars, is a master class in versatile acting.</p>\n<p>The imaginative, fast-paced staging by Sam Mendes, demonstrating the art of story theater at its finest, is equally stunning. The actors perform in a large transparent cube, featuring stacks of cartons and modern office furniture, which frequently revolves to showcase different perspectives. Sometimes it moves slowly, while at other times, when historical events seem to spiral out of control, it spins so rapidly you worry for the actors&#8217; safety. Adding to the vertiginous effect are Luke Halls&#8217; scene-setting video projections and Jon Clark&#8217;s transformative lighting, while Nick Powell&#8217;s cinematic-style musical underscoring, performed live by pianist Candida Caldicot, provides haunting accompaniment.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s nearly impossible to single out a particular moment, but there&#8217;s a true show-stopper with a scene late in the play, set in the 1960s, in which the last remaining Lehman brother, Robert (Godley) dances a maniacal twist as he ages into irrelevance and ultimately death, the other two actors mirroring his movements like back-up dancers at a morbid television variety show.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no denying that <em>The Lehman Trilogy</em> represents a significant investment in time (although thankfully not as much as the original five-hour version), but it&#8217;s never less than enthralling. It could be argued that the play would be even more effective with less of the third person narration, which too often tells us what we&#8217;re already seeing (&#8220;Emanuel stares at Henry,&#8221; Emanuel informs us as he stares at Henry, for instance), but it&#8217;s a small quibble about a production representing stagecraft at its finest.</p>\n<p><strong>The Lehman Trilogy </strong><strong>opened October 14, 2021, at the Nederlander Theatre and </strong><strong>runs through January 2, 2022.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Perhaps the first praiseworthy statement to make about Keenan Scott II’s <em>Thoughts of a Colored Man </em>is that in the nearly two hours it unfolds not a single word spoken fails to carry the ring of absolute truth.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the second comment—not meant as a criticism—is that Scott’s title is misleading. Something more like <em>Thoughts of Colored Men </em>would be closer to heralding the play’s immense power.</p>\n<p>That’s because seven colored men arrive. Note that “colored” is a word not usually considered politically correct nowadays. Nevertheless, as the audience enters, the provocative word is seen projected on an upstage screen. (Sven Ortel is the projections designer.) The point is that Scott is using “colored” to resonate with woke patrons at a time of widespread gentrification.</p>\n<p>[<em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em>]</p>\n<p>These men—six in a line, one on a low runway behind the others—have no common names. They’re identified in the <em>Playbill</em> by their most prominent emotions, another notable Scott notion eventually acknowledged before the lights fade. The men sharing their thoughts are: Love (Dyllón Burnside), Happiness (Bryan Terrell Clark), Wisdom (Esau Pritchett), Lust (Da’Vinci), Passion (Luke James), Depression (Forrest McLendon), and, last but hardly least, Anger (Tristan Mack Wilds).</p>\n<p>Does Scott intend the septet to represent his spin on the seven deadly sins? No saying for sure, but maybe that’s part of the fun he’s having. What’s clear is that he wants each of the men to stand in for the range of emotions his characters feel. And more of the fun—although fun only covers part of his purpose—is to prompt patrons into a game of matching each man with his dominating emotion. That’s as the group interacts through a series of sketches and monologs.</p>\n<p>I played the game with meager results. I rightly sussed out Happiness and Wisdom. (N.B.: The following might register as spoilers for ticket buyers.) The two I got were easy, certainly Wisdom, who dominates the longest sketch. He’s the proprietor of Joe’s Barber Shop, a Brooklyn establishment and hang-out started by the now deceased Joe. (All action takes place in Brooklyn.)</p>\n<p>Joe sees it as his duty to assure that no one is dissed in the long-surviving business over which he presides. He’s challenged when a newcomer to the gentrifying neighborhood drops in—Happiness, an out gay man not immediately taken to the bosoms of the other five regulars present. Asked how he came to Joe’s, Happiness replies he read a recommendation in Yelp.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, The Yelp mention gets an audience guffaw as well as illustrates that Scott is strictly commenting on today’s Black men, each of whom, he wants to confirm, is his own man and not part of an easily dismissed aggregate. Yes, the n-word is used, but not often. Yes, many of the seven characters speak in what used to be termed Ebonics. (Does the designation remain in use?). And if any of the fellows uttered the often heard “Wassup?” I must have missed it. Wassup is Scott tirelessly stressing the difference between man and man and….</p>\n<p>Those differences are powerfully underlined in a sketch where neighborhood neophyte Happiness encounters supermarket worker Depression, whom he earlier met at Joe’s. Happiness is just there to pick up a few items but wants to learn why he and the supermarket man, who’s pushing a cart through apparently messy aisle nine, dislikes him. What he learns is that his privileged upper-middle-class life is sweet, whereas the supermarket fellow’s depressed frame of mind has to do with having received an MIT scholarship he turned down to care for his ailing mother.</p>\n<p>That segment alone demonstrates the spectrum along which Scott travels with determined aplomb. Elsewhere, a father, whose wife lost their first child, welcomes a son. A poetic fellow serenades the sky with his words. The lustful fellow takes about the contrast between dating Black women and white women. The legitimacy of LeBron James and Kobe Bryant is mooted. (Scott misses little.) The wise barber wisely reports that a man’s reputation precedes him into any room. Happiness suggests that money hasn’t changed him but that “money changes the people around you.”</p>\n<p>And on it accurately goes. Before Scott ends his unceasingly cogent insights on the society-changing George-Floyd-Breonna-Taylor-et-distressing-al aftermath, he unleashes a sudden shocker that won’t be detailed here. He follows it up with a finale rap from all cast members—as they started, six in line and one on set designer Robert Brill’s runway above. As throughout, they’re directed for variety and verisimilitude by Steve H. Broadnax III.</p>\n<p>Speaking, as I was above, of political correctness, I’m about to give the currently prevailing policy a tug of my own. I reiterate that Scott’s <em>Thought of a Colored Man </em>is for all audiences, but I submit that there are really only two audiences and that both will profit deeply from it. The BiPOC audience members will recognize and appreciate Scott’s understanding of who they are and what continuing indignities they experience daily. The white audience, realizing more in the last few BLM years than it historically has, will be taking in even newer revelations about a country so long and still too recalcitrantly the major societal and cultural influence.</p>\n<p>For his perspicacity and for his well-honed insistence on perceiving and respecting the life of the Other, playwright Scott is to be profoundly thanked.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Thoughts of a Colored Man </b>opened October 13, 2021, at the Golden Theatre.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>There&#8217;s a palpable urgency to Keenan Scott II&#8217;s poetic drama making its Broadway debut after several regional theater productions. Revolving around numerous themes endemic to the Black experience in contemporary America, <em>Thoughts of a Colored Man</em> is the sort of finger-on-the-pulse work that elicits murmurs of approval from its audience, one that is more racially diverse than usually seen on the Great White Way. It&#8217;s advertising proclaims it to be &#8220;A New American Play for a New Broadway,&#8221; and the tagline doesn&#8217;t seem like hyperbole.</p>\n<p>Set during a single day in an unnamed Brooklyn neighborhood, the intermissionless drama is composed of a series of short scenes occasionally punctuated with bursts of music and slam poetry. It features seven characters with archetypal names, performed by a superb ensemble: Love (Dyllón Burnside), Happiness (Bryan Terrell Clark), Wisdom (Esau Pritchett), Lust (Da&#8217;Vinchi), Passion (Luke James), Depression (Forrest McClendon) and Anger (Tristan Mack Wilds). Their interactions and monologues deal with such issues as urban gentrification, interracial dating, sexual identity, gun violence and thwarted ambitions, among many others.</p>\n<p>Robert Brill&#8217;s simple but striking set design features a metal grid in front of a large screen on which the word &#8220;Colored&#8221; is prominently featured, along with various projections effectively delineating different locales.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/13/thoughts-of-a-colored-man-seven-men-splendidly-declare-who-why-they-are/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Several scenes take place at a neighborhood barbershop run by the aptly named, elderly Wisdom, who forces his customers to put cash in his swear jar for using inappropriate language, including the N-word and gay slurs. For the men, it is a safe place, one where they can let their guard down and talk about whatever they&#8217;re feeling. Passion, a teacher, says that he tells his students, &#8220;Talk to God. He&#8217;s your best friend. And when in doubt, know that the barbershop is our sanctuary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s at the barbershop where Happiness first meets the others. He&#8217;s new to the neighborhood, having recently moved with his male fiancé into one of the new upscale apartment buildings that is rapidly transforming the neighborhood, much to the consternation of many of its longtime residents. Unaware of the newcomer&#8217;s sexuality, one of the other men makes a casual reference to a &#8220;fag,&#8221; causing Wisdom to eject him from the premises.</p>\n<p>The evening is well balanced between episodes that are darkly funny (Lust&#8217;s description of meeting the condescending family members of the white girl he&#8217;s dating) and others that resonate with deep feeling (Wisdom rhapsodizing about his wife of 42 years, Passion emotionally addressing his newborn son). Director Steve H. Broadnax III expertly keeps the pace flowing smoothly despite the play&#8217;s disjointed structure and mingling of dramatic styles.</p>\n<p>There are times when the evening inevitably recalls Ntozake Shange&#8217;s classic <em>For Colored Girls Who Have</em> <em>Considered Suicide/ When the Rainbow is Enuf</em>, although it&#8217;s less presentational in style. But as its title and character names might indicate, <em>Thoughts of a Colored Man</em> occasionally suffers from a generic quality, as if the playwright was more intent on putting his ideas across than fully engaging us. The characters often lapse into speechmaking—waiting in a long line to buy the latest Air Jordans, Anger asks, &#8220;When we gonna realize our buying power, instead of latching onto miniscule materialist items that give us a false sense of worth?&#8221;  At another point, he urges, &#8220;If you really wanna help our young brothers out, stop making our schools look like prisons. And stop determining how many cells you gonna build off our second-grade reading scores.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The play is actually at its most effective when it&#8217;s being the most specific. One of the best scenes features Happiness running into Depression at the Whole Foods in which the latter works. He&#8217;s astonished to learn that Depression had to give up a full scholarship studying electrical engineering at M.I.T. in order to care for his sick mother. He&#8217;s even more astonished that Depression doesn&#8217;t think that the situation was unfair. &#8220;If something needs to be done, I do it,&#8221; the financially struggling young man says simply. (By the way, did the play&#8217;s one gay character have to be the successful yuppie? Feels a bit like stereotyping to me. Just saying.)</p>\n<p><em>Thoughts of a Colored Man</em> feels overly emphatic at times, but it pulses with a theatrical dynamism that marks its young playwright as an important new voice, one that is fairly demanding to be heard. It&#8217;s a credit to the production&#8217;s legion of producers, which include such acting notables as Sheryl Lee Ralph and Samira Wiley, that it&#8217;s now being heard on Broadway.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Thoughts of a Colored Man </b>opened October 13, 2021, at the Golden Theatre.

Photo: Chad Batka</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Fascination and frustration.</p>\n<p>Those are the emotions likely to overwhelm you as you leave <em>Is This A Room</em>, the brief but gripping dramatization of the 2017 FBI interrogation of Reality Leigh Winner, at Broadway’s Lyceum Theatre.</p>\n<p>Fascination because of who she is—and yes, Reality Winner is her given name—and what she did: a 25-year-old Air Force intelligence specialist who trained as a linguist; she’s fluent in Farsi, Dari, and Pashto. Then working as an NSA intelligence contractor in Augusta, Ga., she’s accused of sending a classified document that proved Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to the online news outlet <em>The Intercept</em>. And frustration because of the result: She was charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, later pleaded guilty, and ultimately received 63 months in a federal prison—the longest ever sentence for such an offense (the government was initially seeking 10 years). You might remember reading snippets of those memos from former FBI director James Comey where he bragged that he was “eager to find leakers” and talked about “putting a head on a pike.” Behold: the head.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/11/is-this-a-room-chilling-verbatim-fbi-investigation-into-government-whistleblower/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Conceived and directed by Tina Satter, <em>Is This A Room</em>—which arrives on Broadway after a successful late 2019 run at off-Broadway’s Vineyard Theatre (<em>Room</em> runs in rep at the Lyceum with another Vineyard hit, <em>Dana H.</em>)—takes its dialogue, word for word, from the official FBI transcript. What, you don’t think a couple of cops interviewing a suspect for an hour makes for captivating stuff? You must not have seen a single episode (or 457 episodes) of <em>Law &amp; Order</em>.</p>\n<p>Of course, the FBI agents who show up to “talk” with Reality Winner (played by Emily Davis, with just the right mix of intensity, self-deprecation, vulnerability, and strength)—Agent Garrick (Pete Simpson) and Agent Taylor (Will Cobbs), plus another, identified only as Unknown Male (Becca Blackwell)—aren’t nearly as smooth as the law enforcement officers you see on <em>L&amp;O</em>, <em>FBI</em>, <em>CSI</em>, <em>NCIS</em>, or any other TV procedural. “What’s the, uh. How do we open this?” asks Taylor, staring at Reality’s smartphone. And a minute or so later: “How do we—how do we do it? Show me how to do it, or tell me how to do it.” Garrick cracks lame jokes. They all bond over CrossFit, one of Reality’s passions, along with competitive powerlifting. They display what’s probably genuine concern for Reality’s cat and rescue dog. The agents do everything possible to establish a casual, seemingly friendly rapport with her. (On stage we see only three agents; there were actually nearly a dozen at her home on June 3, 2017.)</p>\n<p>“And of course, you-completely voluntary to talk to me,” says Garrick. But is it? Especially when they ask her if there’s a room where they can talk and she describes it thus: “Oh gosh, it’s just creepy. It’s just weird. It’s like an addition to the house behind the kitchen and it’s always dirty and…” Garrick agrees just a little too quickly: “Okay. Uh, we can talk back there if you’re fine going back there.”</p>\n<p>Satter’s staging ratchets up the tension slowly, subtly. Note how Garrick creeps behind Reality’s shoulder, then inches closer and closer to her face. He throws around the word “voluntary,” but could Reality simply have left? Everything about the situation—including the redactions in the transcript, which are punctuated by blistering sounds and stark lighting shifts—screams pressure; it’s no wonder she eventually comes clean. (Side note: This is an argument for the lawyers, which she did <em>not</em> have. But the fact that her confession, which came before she was read her rights, was admissible is mind-boggling. If Briscoe and Logan had pulled this stunt with a perp on <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, McCoy wouldn’t have gotten the confession past any judge in New York.)</p>\n<p>And this is perhaps the most fascinating—and frustrating—part of all: <em>Is This A Room</em> might be the only time we get to hear Reality Winner’s story. Though in June 2021 she was released from prison for good behavior, barring a presidential pardon (which her family is seeking) the terms of her plea agreement prevent her from ever discussing…pretty much any of this. Thankfully, for now, she can (sort of) speak for herself in <em>Is This a Room</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Is This A Room</em> opened October 11, 2021, and runs through November 27, at the Lyceum Theatre.

Photo: Chad Batka</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Before designer Thomas Dunn throws light on the <em>Is This A Room </em>proceedings as set out by conceiver-director Tina Satter, theatergoers have the opportunity to read the following Playbill alert: “On June 3, 2017, a 25-year-old Air Force intelligence specialist named Reality Winner, suspected of leaking proof of Russian interference in the 2016 U. S. presidential election, was visited at her home in Augusta, Georgia, by the FBI. <em>Is This A Room </em>stages this visit word for word from the official transcript recorded that day.”</p>\n<p>The two sentences go some way towards preparing audience members who are not aware of the case—and may even resist believing Reality Winner (full name: Reality Leigh Winner) is a real person. But the sentences don’t go far enough towards identifying a young woman and a noted war veteran who, as a National Security Agent contractor, leaked explicit information about Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.</p>\n<p>Her action, confessed in the recorded FBI “visit,” during which she wasn’t advised of her Miranda rights, led to a conviction and a five-year prison term under the Espionage Act. Significantly, hers is the longest ever recorded for such a crime. It led to her being regarded at the time as “a head on a pike” for Donald Trump’s need to undermine the damning Russian-interference contention.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/11/is-this-a-room-reality-winner-speaks-her-truth/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Without this background, the 60 minutes that <em>Is This A Story </em>takes to unfold is drained of its power in presenting the beginning of Winner’s ordeal—some of which she brought on herself, to be sure. For many of the audience members the verbatim reproduction may pass merely as an up-close look at FBI tactics, a kind of unmoored <em>Dragnet </em>episode. On the other hand, knowing the ominous details lends the quasi-documentary a solid grounding.</p>\n<p>Satter is repeating the eye-opening interview-investigation on designer Parker Lutz’s multi-leveled, monochrome set. Taking place in the home that Winner (Emily Davis in a performance of many non-monochromes tones), Lutz provides no furniture. Okay, that isn’t quite true. Lined up at the back of the stage and separated from the playing area, there’s a line of metal folding chairs. Why? Only Satter and Lutz know.</p>\n<p>As Davis and fellow actors replicate not only every word but every stammered word, every cough, and several charged moments when the figures speak over each other, she strongly resembles the actual blond Winner. Impersonating Winner well, she’s equaled by Pete Simpson as chief interrogator Agent Garrick, Will Cobbs as Agent Taylor, and Becca Blackwell as Unknown Male. Unknown Male? Since this is a word-for-word enterprise, there must have been a third man (not Orson Welles as Harry Lime) heard speaking a few times. In Satter’s replay, this interloper(?) moves about with some ominous frequency, sometimes even hovering by the increasingly uneasy Winner.</p>\n<p>Which brings up some of the issues arising from a supposedly unadulterated transcript. On the one hand—perhaps the upper hand—<em>Is This A Room </em>is effective in illuminating the process by which the sometimes reassuring, sometimes intimidating FBI agents elicited Winner’s less-than-winning admissions.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, adhering strictly to the word-for-word declaration introduces several questions. Okay, it’s word-for-word, but after a while, doesn’t the actors so assiduously replicating every verbal hiccup begin to feel like a stunt? Doesn’t this representation prompt a thought about what is the more efficacious manner of representing theatrical reality (no pun intended)?</p>\n<p>And what of gestures? Undoubtedly, director Satter can’t be going for accuracy in that regard. Audio recordings don’t catch movement, though they may offer some sense of—can one say?—social distance. Yes, this is an instance of a reviewer’s being foolishly picky. And yes, a director has discretion that extends to lighting designer Dunn’s dousing all lights for indicating blacked-out classified information. Indeed, that’s rather clever, a smart stage equivalent of blacked out parts of printed transcripts.</p>\n<p>But what of other more prominent digressions? As Winner begins to realize she’s in deeper trouble than she thought and as the agents ferret more information from her, designer Dunn flashes red lights high above the action. Often at the same time, an engineer sitting at a control booth sends co-sound designer Lee Kinney and Sanae Yamada’s aural stings to make certain no patron misses what’s just revealingly occurred.</p>\n<p>Is this Satter worrying that to maintain audience interest, an uncompromised verbatim stage transfer might benefit from a little theatricalizing? She doesn’t need the superfluous rude awakenings to the multitudinous transgressions of the former administration.</p>\n<p>For already making that unsettling Trump administration accomplishment perfectly clear, Satter deserves many thanks.</p>\n<p>And now about Satter’s title: <em>Is This A Room </em>without a heavily implied question mark is not a typo popping up throughout this review. That’s the way it’s wanted, and perhaps there’s a completely reasonable explanation. If so, it hasn’t been vouchsafed to the press. Also, how about the title’s capital A? Nowhere in the verbatim account is there a reference to a B Room or so on. At one moment in the proceedings—If this messenger heard correctly—Unknown Male does ask, pointing to his right, “Is this a room?” and then to his left, “Is this a room?” He receives no answer. Whether his queries divulge anything illuminating, they remain a mystery here.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Is This A Room </b>opened October 11, 2021, at the Lyceum Theatre and runs through November 27.

Photo: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure>\n<p>To put it succinctly: Douglas Lyons’s <em>Chicken &amp; Biscuits</em>, directed by Zhailon Levingston, is as satisfying a theatrical meal as is an ample serving of actual chicken and biscuits.</p>\n<p>To put it at greater length: <em>Chicken &amp; Biscuits </em>joins the long list of American plays about dysfunctional families. It also joins a shorter list of American plays during which those dysfunctioning forge a way to become functional.</p>\n<p>It may be that while creating that trajectory, dramatist Lyons takes a few, sometimes sentimental shortcuts, but only the crankiest onlookers will object to what looks to be a commercial success.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/10/chicken-biscuits-funeral-plus-family-dysfunction-adds-up-to-familiar/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★☆☆☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The family here, residing in New Haven, is named Jenkins. They and a couple of not necessarily welcome guests have gathered for the funeral of Pastor Bernard Jenkins (affectionately called “B”), whose special chicken and biscuits dish wasn’t loved by all due to the biscuits being predictably dry.</p>\n<p>The service is to be led by the deceased man’s son-in-law and now successor pastor Reginald Mabry (Norm Lewis). Reginald is married to knows-her-own-mind Baneatta Jenkins Mabry (Cleo King). Also present are Baneatta’s outspoken sister Beverly Jenkins (Ebony Marshall-Oliver) and Beverly’s 15-going-on-16 daughter La Trice Franklin (Aigner Mizzelle).</p>\n<p>Rounding out the effervescent, frequently boisterous group are the Reginald-Baneatta offspring, Simone Mabry (Alana Raquel Bowers) and Kenny Mabry (Devere Rogers), who brings to the service his white (gasp!) boyfriend Logan Jacob Leibowitz (Michael Urie). There is one other attendee, Brianna Jenkins (Natasha Yvette Williams). More of her later—well, not much more.</p>\n<p>Recognizing Lyons’s characters is crucial, because each one is some kind of alarm-pulsing character, all right. They’re fictional figures—are any or all of them plucked from Lyons’s past?—that actors love to grab by the shoulders and make theirs. Which is a way of saying that Lewis (taking a hiatus from musicals but getting close to singing once) is his usual irrepressible self. He’s not alone. Attempting to repress any of the others busy at their high-level thesping would be a formidable challenge. Just leave it that this ensemble is a playwright’s dream.</p>\n<p>So what goes on for the two hours that <em>Chicken &amp; Biscuits </em>covers its forty-miles-of-good/bad-road course? Yes, this is a drama, but it’s peppered-and-salted with hugely comic moments. For much of the loopy proceedings Baneatta refuses to acknowledge Logan, other than to call him not by his rightful name but by substitutions like Lucius. Sisters Baneatta and Beverly wage their sisterly war, a war in which the former starts by taking great objection to the latter’s low-cut and glittery outfit. La Trice is very involved with her adolescent self. Simone and Kenny lace into their own sibling battles. Logan spends much stage time taking Kenny’s temperature on acknowledging to his family the extent of their alliance. For the most part Reginald keeps his cool. Then there’s Brianna Jenkins, but this is a spoiler-free review zone, so that’s the end of that.</p>\n<p>Because Lyons has packed so much into a family get-together that comes across more like a family lets-get-at-each-other-while-we’re-together encounter, it constantly somersaults from one wild mood to one tame mood and back again and them back again. To handle the shifts, it takes a director who may feel the need to consult a lion tamer. Director Levingston is up to the task most of the time. Occasionally he allows his happily histrionic troupe to get the upper hand, whereupon the audience may experience a whoosh in the solar plexus.</p>\n<p>To make certain his point gets across, Lyons may insert one or two too many clashes. His characters’ reversals more often than not ultimately feel right, but sometimes they don’t. Would self-involved La Trice become as accepting as she does towards Logan? Sure, Logan is Jewish; but would he really wonder, when asked to open his Bible to the Book of John, whether John has a last name? The joke gets one of the big Lyons laughs, but it’s hardly as deserved as so many others are.</p>\n<p>Kudos to the creative team, especially Dede Ayite, the range of whose costumes are an eye-popping fashion parade. Special attention need be paid to Baneatta’s stylish funeral suit, Beverly’s ultra-swank almost-outfit, and La Trice’s jacket with streamers swinging just below the shoulders. Nikiya Mathis’s wigs and hair designs also run a wide field. The same shout-out to lighting designer Adam Honoré and sound designer Twi McCallum.</p>\n<p>Reserved kudos go to Lawrence E. Moten II, who arranges, possibly under Lyons’s desires, four pews in a square to indicate a chapel, which is fine as far as it goes. The catch is that throughout <em>Chicken &amp; Biscuits </em>locales change, requiring awkward pew pushing and pulling and sometimes merely ignoring them. When Reginald’s service is underway, Moten does reveal a Black Jesus, which makes complete sense in the context.</p>\n<p>Important extra: Throughout dramatic literary history, special theatrical symbols abound. An unforgettable example appears in <em>Chicken &amp; Biscuits </em>when a covered casket becomes a dining table for a redemptive celebratory meal. Watch for it.</p>\n<p>We all know—don’t we?—the phrase Goin’ to Church, which means letting religious fervor flow no matter what the context. Dramatist Lyons has written a play about literally goin’ to church. He’s gotten the church bells reverberantly chiming. If theater lovers are smart, they’ll heed the call and go straight to <em>Chicken &amp; Biscuits </em>church.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Chicken and Biscuits </b>opened October 10, 2021, at Circle in the Square and runs through November 28.

Photo: Emilio Madrid</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Stop me if you&#8217;ve heard this one before. A funeral for a family patriarch gets derailed by sibling rivalries, inappropriate behavior and language, and the arrival of a surprise guest that spurs dramatic revelations.</p>\n<p>Of course you have, because the familiar scenario has inspired an endless series of films, television shows and plays, including not one but two film versions of the darkly comic <em>Death at a Funeral</em>. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped playwright Douglas Lyons from hewing to the formula yet again with his debut Broadway effort. Previously presented at Queens Theatre in a 2020 production cut short by the pandemic, <em>Chicken &amp;</em> <em>Biscuits</em> has returned with a formidable new cast including Norm Lewis, Michael Urie, and TV and film veteran Cleo King (<em>Mike &amp; Molly</em>).</p>\n<p>How much you enjoy the evening will depend on your tolerance for stereotypical characterizations and situations more redolent of a sitcom than theater. To be sure, there are laughs to be had, and the audience at a late preview performance was certainly partaking of them.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/10/chicken-biscuits-dysfunctional-family-becomes-beautifully-functional/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The play revolves around the memorial service of a pastor whose death has resulted in the appointment of his son-in-law Reginald (Lewis, seemingly enjoying not having to sing on Broadway for once) as his replacement. One of Reginald&#8217;s first duties is officiating at the funeral attended by his wife Baneatta (King, a formidable presence) and her younger sister Beverly (Ebony Marshall-Oliver). The other mourners include their daughter Simone (Alana Raquel Bowers) and son Kenny (Devere Rogers) and Beverly&#8217;s social media-obsessed teenage daughter La&#8217;Trice (Aigner Mizzelle). Much to his mother&#8217;s consternation, Kenny has brought along his partner Logan (Urie), whom she refuses to accept. She even pretends not to remember Logan&#8217;s name, referring to him as &#8220;your little friend, Lucas.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tensions are apparent from the beginning. The rambunctious Beverly&#8217;s revealing clothes and plunging neckline elicits disapproval from her daughter and straitlaced older sister, but she&#8217;s unrepentant. &#8220;Today is a celebration, that&#8217;s why my puppies are out!&#8221; she declares. &#8220;Her titties are doing the tango outta her blouse,&#8221; Baneatta observes. The Jewish Logan has never been to church before, let alone attended a Black funeral. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a reverse <em>Get Out</em> and we all know how that ended!&#8221; he says nervously.</p>\n<p>In case the on-the-nose dialogue proves too subtle, director Zhailon Levingston emphasizes the tense interactions by having the actors momentarily freeze to the ominous strains of Ennio Morricone&#8217;s <em>The</em> <em>Good, the Bad and the Ugly</em> theme.</p>\n<p>The moment we&#8217;re introduced to the characters, we know how things are going to play out. Will Baneatta and Beverly overcome their very different personalities and resolve their long-standing issues? Will Kenny find the courage to stand up to his mother and proudly declare Logan to be his lover? Will the insecure Bernard come into his own as a pastor, leading the family members (and the audience) in a rousing chant of &#8220;Hallelujah?&#8221; And will the arrival of the mysterious Brianna (Natasha Yvette Williams, <em>Waitress</em>) and the revelation of her relationship to the others bring the family closer together or drive them further apart? No points for guessing correctly.</p>\n<p>To his credit, the playwright introduces various social, racial, and class themes into the mix. The problem is, he does so in highly awkward fashion, with jarring tonal shifts in which the farcical proceedings stop cold so that various groups of characters can engage in deadly serious conversations. It all feels like a situation comedy indulging in a &#8220;very special episode.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The performers, several of them new to Broadway, strive mightily to mine the broad humor for all its worth and generally succeed. The standouts are Mizzelle, a hoot as the precocious teen, and Urie, who gets laughs with every nervous twitch, although he&#8217;s playing the sort of role from which he should have graduated by now.</p>\n<p>For more than a few, <em>Chicken &amp; Biscuits</em> will live up to its name by being enjoyable theatrical comfort food. But you can&#8217;t ignore the fact that it simply isn&#8217;t very nutritious.</p>\n<div>\n<div><strong><b>Chicken and Biscuits </b>opened October 10, 2021, at Circle in the Square and runs through November 28.

Photo: Marc J. Franklin</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Perhaps it’s because I’ve just been reading Charles Dickens&#8211;<em>The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit—</em>that I took in Ruben Santiago-Hudson’s current <em>Lackawanna Blues </em>revival as stunningly Dickensian. Dealing, as it does, with a young boy brought up in near poverty who encounters any number of memorable characters, Santiago-Hudson’s early travels magically echo those of the prolific 19th-century author.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Santiago-Hudson is acting in his own work. Over the course of his life Dickens, who considered himself an actor as well, gave numerous dramatic readings from his canon. So, considering the two as evoking similar milieus doesn’t seem at all far-fetched.</p>\n<p>No need to summarize Dickens’s works—other than to mention poor boys like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, who seem precursors to Santiago-Hudson’s Ruben, a child in a deprived Black community taken in by Rachel, a quietly confident pillar of her community.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/07/lackawanna-blues-ruben-santiago-hudsons-acclaimed-solo-play-makes-its-broadway-debut/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Known to him and others as Nanny, she owns several houses in which all sorts of boarders pay rent or don’t when they’re hard up, houses to which all sorts of other abandoned souls or sometime grifters are drawn. They rely on Nanny to extract them from a variety of scrapes or to chide them toward obeisance, without, by the way, ever raising her voice.</p>\n<p>As Santiago-Hudson’s characters press forward, they all become memorable, including one of the earliest unlikely charmers who’s full of malapropisms like the “Entire State Building.” Among others of persistent crowd the actor-author brings to pulsing life is womanizing Bill, who—not to stretch a point—behaves like a descendent of Dickens’s Bill Sykes. To another Lackawanna miscreant, Nanny says in her steely calm, no-nonsense way, “If you think you’re bad, try me.” No question she’s badder.</p>\n<p>How does Santiago-Hudson bring the crowd from his Lackawanna, New York youth to the stage where set designer Michael Carnahan has placed an upstage brick wall broken by an ornate doorway and one sometime-lighted (by Jen Schriever) second-story window? He does it all by his brilliant self. A tall, handsome man, he’s a cargo of talents, not the least of which is his unbridled energy, not the least of which is his mastery of carefully captured accents and ways of expression, not the least of which is his harmonica playing that includes a tear-eliciting eulogy, not the least of which is his hilarious reference to the popular pomade, Dixie Peach.</p>\n<p>At this indisputable tour de force he’s immeasurably helped by his director. That’s to say by himself. He keeps himself circling a center-stage stool as the characters express themselves in their carefully differentiated postures. That’s when he regularly returns to his recreation of Nanny Rachel’s signature stance—still, facing forward, eyes intent, hands firmly held below the waist. By the way, he returns as director in January when he takes on the revival of Dominique Morisseau&#8217;s<em> Skeleton Crew</em>.</p>\n<p>Although Santiago-Hudson does all the talking, he’s not alone. Perched to his right on a second stool is renowned guitarist Junior Mack, providing what amounts to a soundtrack, original music by Bill Sims Jr. Once in a while, there’s an interlude during which Mack on guitar and Santiago-Hudson on harmonica play together. It’s transporting every time.</p>\n<p>Unquestionably. <em>Lackawanna Blues </em>is a tribute to Nanny Rachel from the boy whom she turned into a man. Santiago-Hudson is declaring he wouldn’t be who he is today without the guidance she gave him directly or by example. And who he is today is a man of unbounded ability. As actor-writer, director, impersonator, harmonica player, he excels.</p>\n<p>Is there anything wrong with this <em>Lackawanna Blues</em>? Nothing could be wrong with something this right, but the intermissionless 90-minuter does leave a spectator wanting more, more of the characters already presented and more of characters Santiago-Hudson hasn’t yet revisited. Please, sir, may I have some more?</p>\n<p>N.B.: The playwright-actor transferred <em>Lackawanna Blues </em>to the screen in 2005, Directed with surpassing vivacity by George C. Wolfe, starring S. Epatha Merkerson, and now available on YouTube, it’s somewhat different from the stage play. I recommend it highly but with this aviso: See both. They complement each other. By no means should one substitute for the other.</p>\n<p><strong>Lackawanna Blues opened October 7, 2021, at Samuel J. Friedman Theatre and runs through October 31.

Photo: Marc J. Franklin</figcaption></figure>\n<p>There are only two men onstage, but there&#8217;s an awfully big crowd populating <em>Lackawanna Blues</em>. Ruben Santiago-Hudson&#8217;s autobiographical one-man play (plus musician) paying loving tribute to the woman who raised him features such a gallery of colorful characters that it&#8217;s no wonder it was adapted into a cable television movie featuring a large ensemble. But the piece works best as it was originally conceived—the actor narrating the tale and portraying some two dozen other characters in a virtuoso demonstration of solo storytelling.</p>\n<p>The show, first seen at the Public Theater in 2001, revolves around its writer/director/star&#8217;s recollections of his childhood in the titular upstate New York town, which was thriving in the 1950s thanks to the booming steel industry. He grew up in a boardinghouse run by the enterprising Miss Rachel, mostly referred to as Nanny, who looked after him when it became clear that his neglectful parents weren&#8217;t up to the task.</p>\n<p>Performing in front of a reproduction of the house&#8217;s brick façade, the actor regales us with anecdotes from his youth featuring such eccentric local denizens as Numb Finger Pete, Small Paul, Sweet Tooth Sam, and Bill, Miss Rachel&#8217;s romantic partner, who was also, unfortunately, an inveterate ladies&#8217; man.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/07/lackawanna-blues-ruben-santiago-hudson-brillliantly-tour-de-forcing/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The star&#8217;s delivery of the material feels musical, not only because his vocal rhythms are often redolent of jazz and hip-hop, but also because he&#8217;s accompanied onstage by the excellent guitarist Junior Mack, performing the blues music composed by Bill Sims Jr., Santiago-Hudson&#8217;s original collaborator on the show. (The actor, who clearly knows how to express gratitude, pays loving tribute to him in the program.) Occasionally, Santiago-Hudson also contributes blues harmonica solos, eliciting appreciative cheers from the audience.</p>\n<p>Santiago-Hudson is such a dynamic, charismatic performer that it&#8217;s easy to overlook the fact that the piece, more an assemblage of vignettes than a compelling narrative, is sometimes difficult to follow. Although he entertainingly shifts among the many personas, expertly adjusting his voice and body language to portray the multitude of variously aged male and female characters, as well as himself as a child, you sometimes feel as if you need a scorecard to keep track of who&#8217;s who.</p>\n<p>But if the storyline is occasionally confusing, one thing comes through loud and clear: his adoration of his beloved Nanny, who comes across as a strong, complex and nurturing maternal figure. &#8220;Nanny was like the government if it really worked,&#8221; he tells us about the woman who opened her boarding house to numerous species of animals as well as many of the town&#8217;s down-on-their-luck denizens. One of the funniest stories involves a self-entitled raccoon who showed up in her kitchen every morning for a home-cooked breakfast of scrambled eggs and toast.</p>\n<p>There are times when the material feels overly broad. Portraying some of the more eccentric elderly characters, Santiago-Hudson relies too often on cheap, malaprop-driven humor. We hear about such New York City landmarks as the &#8220;Statue of Delivery&#8221; and &#8220;The Entire State Building,&#8221; that someone is suffering from &#8220;roaches of the liver,&#8221; and that &#8220;beauty is in the behind of the holder.&#8221; A little of that sort of thing goes a long way.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s when the performer settles down, getting to the heart of his tale, that the show most resonates. Particularly moving is his account of being anguished as a child when he realized that his beloved Nanny would die before him, a memory that becomes all the more poignant in the scene when he visits her on her deathbed in the hospital.</p>\n<p><em>Lackawanna Blues</em> provides stirring evidence of how much Nanny did for Santiago-Hudson. It also shows that with this adoring tribute, he&#8217;s movingly returned the favor.</p>\n<div><strong>Lackawanna Blues opened October 7, 2021, at Samuel J.

It serves as catchphrase of the opening number of <em>Six</em>, the international juggernaut of a pop-concert musical that has washed up on 47th Street for what looks to be a healthy, wealthy, and worldly-wise run.</p>\n<p>This is not what you might call a traditional musical, nor what formerly would have been considered a well-crafted one. But it has mass appeal, immediacy, enthusiasm, and an incredibly high sense of style; and it revels in what used to be called &#8220;girl power&#8221; but can now more properly be described as simply, or not-so-simply, <em>power</em>. An audience show for a wide audience, <em>Six</em> is a rafter-raising entertainment that’ll get you throwing your proverbial bonnet in the air (but please keep that mask on, for now). Even if, yes, a third of the crowned characters portrayed did indeed—in the plot, and in actual history (and in actual herstory)—lose their heads.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/03/six-long-live-the-queens/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Demned careless of them, Oscar Wilde or Nöel Coward might have said, although neither of those celebrated dramatists—or Shakespeare, for that matter—ever thought to set his sights on this particular story, the biographical outlines of which were in place long before any of said scribes first emerged from swaddling clothes.</p>\n<p>Leave that to Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, two Cambridge University students who devised <em>Six</em> for presentation at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2017. Marlow has been a professional for 16 of his 26 years; he started as a child actor at the age of 10. Moss, 27, serves as co-director as well. To say that they are the first of a new generation of musical theater makers is an understatement; they make Pasek and Paul look <em>old</em>, and Lin-Manuel Miranda seem to be of Jerome Kern vintage. (Editor’s Query: Didn’t Rodgers &amp; Hart write something called “Bewitched, Bothered and Beheaded”?)</p>\n<p>The musical is told with breathtaking simplicity. We meet our six heroes at curtain rise, introducing themselves to the audience as the “divorced, beheaded, died…” celebrities of yore. They explain to us that they will be competing—on this, their self-proclaimed “Divorced Live Beheaded Tour”—for the title of “who’s the most important wife?” Then come one-by-one demonstrations in song from Catherine of Aragon (Adrianna Hicks); Anne Boleyn (Andrea Macasaet); Jane Seymour (Abby Mueller); Anna of Cleves (Brittney Mack); Katherine Howard (Samantha Pauly); and Catherine Parr (Anna Uzele).</p>\n<p>The evening concludes with a number in which they collectively realize that the only reason for their enduring fame—as opposed to names of the lost-to-history wives of, say, Henry VI or Henry VII—is because, well, because they were “divorced, beheaded,” etc. So they sing a closing number, cap it with a song mix they call “The Megasix,” and send the chortling crowds out into the street.</p>\n<p>The six give equally high-powered performances. From my seat on the aisle, I somewhat favored Macasaet as Anne Boleyn, perhaps because she has the sharpest material of the bunch. Hicks (who starts the competition as the first wife) and Mueller (as the nice wife, who dies of <em>natural</em> causes) also stand out. Meanwhile, one mustn’t overlook the quartet they call “the ladies in waiting,” keyboardist Julia Schade, sidemen (sidewomen?) Michelle Osbourne and Kimi Hayes, and drummer Elena Bonomo. All are dressed to kill and drolly glare out at us, as directed, with the attitude of sentries on patrol or perhaps prison guards. Attitude amplified, deliciously so. Schade, who also serves as music director, at times looks like some mad queen of hearts on a hand-painted playing card.</p>\n<p>Production values are high, considering the relatively simple unit setting and thorough lack of furniture or props other than ever-prominent hand microphones. The smartly functional scenery is designed by Emma Bailey, while splendiferous Tudor costumes with modern-day finesse come from Gabriella Slade. <em>Six</em> especially gleams with its lighting design by Tim Deiling, whose instruments play some mighty nifty tricks, while the ever-important sound design is by Paul Gatehouse. Co-directing with Moss is Jamie Armitage, with choreography from Carrie-Anne Ingrouille. The U.K. production team—responsible for the London edition at the Arts Theatre, which has just now reopened at the significantly larger Vaudeville—assembled the present cast in May 2019 for an engagement at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater, followed by stops in Edmonton, Canada, and St. Paul, Minnesota, before moving to the Atkinson for a March 12, 2020 opening which was postponed an hour before curtain. And then there was a pandemic&#8230;.</p>\n<p>There are some who might say—without actually seeing this new musical, most likely—that it is a fine musical for teenaged girls and their mothers. Agreed. But <em>Six</em> offers so much more, and does so with steady propulsion and an irresistible sense of high style.</p>\n<p>“Don’t lose ur head” sings Anne Boleyn, savagely wielding her microphone, and you can&#8217;t argue with that.</p>\n<p><strong>Six opened October 3, 2021, at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s no secret that Americans love a juicy royal drama. (Two words: <em>The Crown</em>.) And in the roughly 1,200 years of the British royal family’s reign, it doesn’t get much juicier than the life—and the wives—of Henry VIII.</p>\n<p>But enough about <em>him</em>. We’re here to talk about six women—the women behind the man—that the musical <em>Six</em> (now open at the Brooks Atkinson) represents, celebrates, and idolizes as the pop stars they were surely always intended to be. Sick vocal riffs, tight harmonies, slick dance steps…here, they’re essentially Renaissance-era Spice Girls.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/10/03/six-hold-on-to-your-heads-with-cheers-and-huzzahs/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s&nbsp;</em>★★★★★ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>If you see <em>Six</em>—and if you’re a Tudor history buff, a royal watcher, or someone who’s simply looking for a show with strong central female characters, you bloody well should—chances are you’ll be up to your elbows in preteen girls, many of whom already know all the lyrics. Co-written by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss (who also directs with Jamie Armitage), <em>Six</em> arrives with a built-in fan base after runs in the West End and stints at Chicago’s Shakespeare Theater and A.R.T. in Cambridge, Mass., plus a couple other stops along the way; finally, more than a year and a half after the pandemic stopped the New York run in previews (bringing down the curtain on <em>Six</em>’s actual opening night), Broadway gets to experience this rockin’ rewrite of 16th-century her-story.</p>\n<p><em>Six</em> brings together a sextet of badass queens—clad in brilliant chain-trimmed corsets, studded black boots, and spiky crown-like headpieces designed by Gabriella Slade—to compete, <em>American Idol</em>–style, for a somewhat dubious honor: Who took the most crap from that self-serving, Church-splitting, six-times-married monarch?</p>\n<p>In order, the wives are: Catherine of Aragon (played by Adrianna Hicks), who married Henry’s brother, was imprisoned after his death, and was then forced to wed Henry; Anne Boleyn (Andrea Macasaet), best remembered for her beheading, and also for helping to kick off the Protestant Reformation; Jane Seymour (Abby Mueller), who gave Henry his long-awaited heir but died of complications from childbirth; mail-order bride Anna of Cleves (Brittney Mack), whose looks allegedly didn’t live up to her portrait; the decades-younger Katherine Howard (Samantha Pauly), another who lost her head at her husband’s behest; and the twice-widowed Catherine Parr (Anna Uzele), a scholar—she wrote and published her own books—who outlived Henry. As the well-known rhyme—and oft-repeated lyric—goes: “Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived.”</p>\n<p>Each queen gets an absurdly catchy pop-inspired anthem to tell her own (often untold) story. There’s a little Beyoncé in Catherine of Aragon’s salsa-tinged “No Way,” which details Henry’s infidelity, his quest for an annulment, and her refusal (“You must think that I’m crazy/ You wanna replace me, baby, there’s/ N-n-n-n-n-n-no way”). Anne Boleyn’s bouncy, electro-pop “Don’t Lose Ur Head” has a Lily Allen vibe. To play up her sex appeal—and youthfulness—Catherine Parr sings the breathy, Britney Spears–style “All You Wanna Do.”</p>\n<p>While the show ostensibly sets up a competition to decide which queen suffered the most at her ex-hubby’s hands, you’ll notice the women backing each other up at every turn, and all through one another’s songs. Sure, they do their share of sniping. “My son had to deal with the <em>loss </em>of his <em>mother</em>,” wails Jane Seymour. Deadpans Anne Boleyn: “Wow yeah, kinda like how my body had to deal with the loss of its head.” But come time for Anna of Cleves’ “Get Down”—a swaggering hip-hop number that nods to Kanye West and Jamie Foxx’s “Gold Digger”—and they’re all in sync behind her like Janet Jackson’s “Rhythm Nation” crew. (The stylish choreography—which incorporates everything from Renaissance steps to royal waves, both Queen Elizabeth and Queen Bey style—is by Carrie-Anne Ingrouille.)</p>\n<p>And speaking of backup, yes, that is an all-female onstage band behind our beautiful queens. As if we would have it any other way!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Six</em> opened Oct. 3, 2021, at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is good to be back in a Broadway theater—with an Excelsior Pass, a mask, and two (two!) exuberant rounds of applause during the pre-show announcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is good to be at </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pass Over</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—an intense and provocative new play by Antoinette Chinonye Nwandu that updates </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waiting for Godot</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, sort of, to examine the constricted and oppressed lives of young inner-city Black men.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it is hard being the play’s protagonists—two impoverished friends, Moses (Jon Michael Hill) and Kitch (Namir Smallwood), literally stuck on an inner-city corner, metaphorically trapped by society and history.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/08/22/pass-over-a-play-that-speaks-to-our-times/\"><em>Read Frank Scheck’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pass Over</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> exists on those two planes, or at least those two: The Playbill places its setting as “the river’s edge, but also a ghetto street, but also a plantation, but also a desert city built by slaves.” The passing over of the title is Moses and Kitch’s quotidian fantasy of getting out, leaving their block, making it in the world; but it is also the Exodus, or the mythical exodus they’re yearning for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The play opens at its most </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Godot</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-ish, two men onstage, a streetlight looming over them like a tree, one of them futzing with his shoe. Boasting and joking, trash-talking and wordplay, their idle talk is its own absurdist dialogue. A recurring game is listing their “promised land top ten,” ten items they dream of, from “new Air Jordans, not thrift store new, new new” to a girlfriend to enjoy the promised land with. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there’s also, from the start, an ominous undercurrent: Moses’s brother was killed by the “po-pos,” as was a list of other neighborhood boys. Every now and then, the boys freeze, hands up, as the light shifts—are the police passing by? Are the police stopping them? Are they imagining that the police are stopping them? Does it matter which?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things get more absurd, and arguably more profound, with the entrance of an out-of-place, out-of-time white man (Gabriel Ebert). He’s lost, “all turned around,” prone to expressions like “gosh golly gee.” He’s Pozzo to Moses and Kitch’s Vladimir and Estragon, and instead of a chicken he’s got a basket full of food. Despite his aw-shucks demeanor, he lords his affluence, his abundance, over the two Black men. He scolds them for their profligate use of the n-word. As he gets ready to depart, he mentions his name: Master. It lands like a punch. “Gosh,” he says. “It’s just a name, a family name.” Nwandu’s script describes him as “an owner, and also a billionaire, and also a planter, and also pharoah.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the wake of that unusual encounter, Moses and Kitch decide to bring a different outlook to a former more typical one: a visit from a cop (again Ebert). They talk like Master, behave like him, and the cop treats them well. But when Kitch accidentally slips into his usual language, things turn. A gun is drawn, abuse is hurled, the promised land seems as far away as ever. Things will not end well for Moses and Kitch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dialogue is sharp, funny, and unflinching, and the performances are extraordinary. Hill and Smallwood (in his Broadway debut) are deft and winning, and they imbue their talky parts with a dynamic, nearly acrobatic physicality. Ebert is unctuously oily in his two roles. And director Danya Taymor, together with designers Wilson Chin (scenery), Sarafina Bush (costumes), and Marcus Doshi (lighting), create a world that is bleak and haunting, until it suddenly and unexpectedly turns vibrant and lush.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did not see the previous New York production of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pass Over</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, at LCT3 in 2018, when the play ended with a character’s murder. Now, Nwandu has provided a new final section, one that provides what she has called a more “healing,” “Afro-futurist” ending. It is visually lush, but I’m not sure it’s uplifting; there is plenty of room for discussion and argument, but by my reading it shows that the two Black men can achieve happiness only in death—and even then still at risk of temptation by a poisoned apple.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It remains, as she told the <em>Times</em>, “a lament.” And it is an important and necessary one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I’m worried it won’t be a commercially successful one. After 17 months of illness and death, after lockdown and loneliness, after Trump and January 6 and wildfires and floods, amid Delta surges and mask wars, I can’t shake the feeling that what we now crave is joy and exuberance, connection and celebration. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pass Over</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tells the story of an exodus, and its canvas is a plague. Right now, we’re all looking to heal.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Pass Over </strong><strong>opened August 22, 2021, at the August Wilson Theatre and </strong><strong>runs through October 10.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Antoinette Chinoye Nwandu&#8217;s <em>Pass Over</em> has opened on Broadway, making it the first play to appear there since theaters were closed down as a result of the pandemic 17 months ago. That&#8217;s the good news.</p>\n<p>The bad news is that this allegorical, racially charged drama is sadly more relevant than ever.</p>\n<p>Previously seen in earlier, pre-pandemic productions at Lincoln Center&#8217;s Claire Tow Theater and Chicago&#8217;s Steppenwolf (that version, filmed by Spike Lee, is available to watch at Amazon Prime), the play would seem an unlikely prospect for, no irony intended, the Great White Way. An intimate, three-character piece riffing on <em>Waiting for Godot</em> and incorporating biblical themes, particularly from the Book of Exodus, hardly seems a likely prospect for commercial success. The fact that it&#8217;s being presented in the spacious August Wilson Theatre, more customarily a home for lavish musicals, doesn&#8217;t help. And yet, a second viewing only confirms that it&#8217;s the play we need right now.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2021/08/22/pass-over-waiting-for-the-po-po-hoping-for-the-promised-land/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★★☆ <em>review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The pandemic and the brutal murder of George Floyd (not that there was any shortage of police killings of unarmed black men before then) have only added extra resonance to this blistering, highly theatrical work. Its flaws haven&#8217;t been eradicated for this version which features a radically rewritten ending. But they&#8217;re easier to overlook, especially since this is the sort of challenging, provocative fare too rarely seen on Broadway.</p>\n<p>The single setting is a bleak urban street dominated by a looming lamppost and featuring little more than an abandoned tire. There, two African-American men, the alpha-male Moses (Jon Michael Hill) and his sidekick Kitch (Namir Smallwood)—any relationship to Beckett&#8217;s Vladimir and Estragon is presumably purely intentional—pass their considerable time hanging out with no apparent purpose. Their profanity-laden banter, which includes a plethora of F-bombs and constant unsettling use of the N-word, at one point includes imagined calls to room service from which they order lobster rolls, caviar and champagne.</p>\n<p>They also anxiously worry about their harsh environment&#8217;s dangers, particularly from the police, or &#8220;po-pos.&#8221; Their existential dread is frequently conveyed through ominous sound effects and sudden lighting shifts during which they momentarily freeze in terror.</p>\n<p>Their rambling conversation is suddenly interrupted by the incongruous presence of a tall, gangly white man (Gabriel Ebert, resembling the love child of Lyle Lovett and Big Bird), clad in an all-white suit and carrying a picnic basket. Moses and Kitch assume the stranger is either a Mormon or a police officer, but he assures them that he&#8217;s simply on his way to visit his ailing mother with a supply of food. He&#8217;s endlessly enthusiastic and friendly, peppering his language with such expressions as &#8220;Gosh, golly gee!&#8221; He also offers the two men a repast from his basket, leading to one of the show&#8217;s funniest (albeit familiar) absurdist sight gags.</p>\n<p>The initially friendly encounter eventually proves tense when Moses addresses the stranger as &#8220;Mister.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Master,&#8221; the man corrects him. &#8220;My name is Master,&#8221; he says, in a suddenly charged moment that produces shocked gasps from audience members. Things get even more tense when Master comments disapprovingly about Moses and Kitch&#8217;s constant use of a certain word, pointing out that there seems to be a double standard. &#8220;If I don&#8217;t get to say the N-word, why do you?&#8221; he asks. Not long after, he takes his leave, wishing the men &#8220;Salutations and good evening.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Later in the play, another white man appears. He&#8217;s a police officer (Ebert, his character identified in the program as &#8220;Ossifer&#8221;), who greets the pair in friendly fashion before predictably turning menacing. He eventually leaves them alone but later returns, leading to a tense confrontation that turns violent. It doesn&#8217;t turn out the way you&#8217;d expect, as Moses suddenly displays miraculous powers akin to those sported by his biblical namesake.</p>\n<p>As if to offer theatergoers a ray of hope amidst these perilous times, the play now features a new, more mystical and less bleak ending that provides spiritual optimism as well as a few chuckles. It also offers the opportunity for scenic designer Wilson Chin to alleviate the production&#8217;s visual drabness with a majestic visual representation of the Promised Land.</p>\n<p>While <em>Pass Over</em> marks an auspicious Broadway debut for its talented playwright, it&#8217;s not fully successful as drama. Despite its short running time, the work often feels aimless and repetitive, its poetically stylized dialogue occasionally coming across as forced and making the evening seem longer than it is. Too often, you feel Nwandu straining to weave together her numerous themes and allusions. Nonetheless, the play packs a powerful punch, abetted by Danya Taylor&#8217;s highly theatrical staging.</p>\n<p>The three actors, repeating their Lincoln Center performances, couldn&#8217;t be better. Hill and Smallwood expertly play off each in the manner of seasoned vaudevillians, while Ebert delivers a tour-de-force turn, infused with comic physicality and an undercurrent of danger, that keeps us on edge even as we&#8217;re laughing.</p>\n<div><strong>Pass Over </strong><strong>opened August 22, 2021, at the August Wilson Theatre and </strong><strong>runs through October 10.

Sanders in Girl From the North Country. Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When <em>Girl From the North Country </em>opened last year, it gave a very good impression of being the best new musical of the season. Now traveling uptown from the Public Theater—after originating at London’s Old Vic—it’s been improved. If you can imagine that. This suggests that the transfer immediately has a hold on best new musical of the Broadway season.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the only hitch is that traditionally the gauge of outstanding musicals is they contain original scores. <em>Girl From the North Country </em>doesn’t. Nevertheless, that requirement has been shifting since the increasing presence of the jukebox musical.</p>\n<p>Offhandedly, it could be said that <em>Girl From the North Country </em>is one of those jukebox types. Dylan has been in this situation with <em>The Times They Are A-Changin’ </em>before he was Nobeled. And another thing: <em>Girl From the North Country </em>could just as well be considered in the integrated-musical column, which has also prevailed for the last several decades.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2020/03/05/girl-from-the-north-country-bob-dylan-american-poet/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★★☆<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>But the heart-breaking, hardscrabble <em>Girl From the North Country </em>is quite the opposite. Instead, call <em>Girl From the North Country </em>a disintegrated musical. It’s disintegrated in the treatment of the Dylan songs within an original Conor McPherson book that itself is about the disintegration of a family and the 1934 Duluth, Minnesota community where the family strives.</p>\n<p>Nick Laine (Jay O. Sanders) runs a boarding house where his mentally-disturbed wife Elizabeth (Mare Winningham), his aching late adolescent son Gene (Colton Ryan), and adopted black daughter Marianne (Kimber Elayne Sprawl) cater to mostly destitute guests. Among these are money-short Mr. Burke (Marc Kudisch), dissatisfied Mrs. Burke (Luba Mason), and their autistic son Elias Burke (Todd Almond).</p>\n<p>Then there are other transients—not to say vagrants—Joe Scott (Austin Scott), a onetime boxing champ who has eyes for Marianne, and Reverend Marlowe (Matt McGrath), who may not be as thoroughly spiritual as he makes out. Passing through but slowly is Mrs. Neilsen (Jeannette Bayardelle), with whom Nick is dallying under Elizabeth’s aware gaze; old Mr. Perry (Tom Nelis), who fancies himself a suitor for Marianne; and Kate Draper (Caitlin Houlahan), Gene’s wished-for intended. Last but not least, by virtue of serving as a genial <em>Our Town</em>-like narrator, is Dr. Walker (Robert Joy).</p>\n<p>This swirling gaggle is viewed through intercut sketches. Attempting to understand their relentless Depression lives and thereby make something of them, two or three or four troubled characters interact at different charged moments on Rae Smith’s often claustrophobic, sometimes wide open set and in Smith’s dingy period costume and in Mark Henderson’s properly engulfing lights.</p>\n<p>How is the Dylan canon plumbed to serve the searching characters? Almost never by delivering the 21 chosen numbers in their entirety. This, notwithstanding Dylan being the Bard of Multiple Lyrics. That’s to say, the pithy snatches are disintegrated—with Simon Hale responsible for the solid orchestrations, arrangements and musical supervision. (McPherson sometimes has his hand in here, too.) Also, it’s significant that when last words and notes of the songs are intoned, <em>Girl From the North Country </em>never expects applause.</p>\n<p>Nor do the songs express explicitly who and what the characters are. More often than not they’re oblique references to the characters’ states of mind. Perhaps the sole exception occurs when Gene and Kate face each other and insist, in Dylan’s blunt outcry, “I Want You.” Definitely not an exception is Mare Winningham’s somewhat truncated but devastatingly effective version of “Like a Rolling Stone.” Audiences won’t quickly recover from that trenchant rendition. (Presumably, either Dylan or a representative has signed off on the alterations.)</p>\n<p>McPherson directs the production with calculated style, proving himself the rare playwright who can helm his own work. The actors often sing at microphones. Many times they gather in groups to back up those, like Bayardelle and Scott, fervently soloing. Winningham goes to the onstage piano, once playing Debussy’s “Clair de Lune.” Almond has a harmonica solo. At different times, Mason and Kudisch work a drum set.</p>\n<p>Among the 13-strong cast members, there’s no first of equals—unless it’s Winningham for her addled Elizabeth or unless it’s Scott for his down-and-out boxer or unless it’s Bayardelle for her wise Mrs. Neilsen or unless it’s McGrath for his slippery Reverend Marlowe or unless it’s Kudisch for his bullying Mr. Burke or unless it’s any of the other terrific eight.</p>\n<p>Although no <em>Girl From the North Country </em>choreographer is credited in the program, Lucy Hind is cited as movement director. There’s plenty of it. Despairing as the book and so many of Dylan’s songs are, joy breaks through several times over. The entire cast bursts into spell-inducing, celebratory dance. It’s the dance of people who must dance or otherwise give in to debilitating, irreversible despair.</p>\n<p>Prolific, proficient McPherson is known for his plays about contemporary Irish woes (like <em>The Weir</em>, <em>The Seafarer</em>). He wouldn’t necessarily be expected to produce a profound look at the American Midwest. But he has, and—with the observant, compulsively rhyming Bob Dylan helping immeasurably—he’s done it with an unflagging regard for people anywhere at the frayed end of their tether.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Girl from the North Country </b>opened March 5, 2020, at the Belasco Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Bob Dylan won the Nobel Prize in 2016, among other things it certified the folk legend as not just a musician but also a writer. The award, after all, was for literature. It was presented, the Swedish academy said, “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The genius of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Girl From the North Country</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which opened tonight at the Belasco Theatre, is that it treats Dylan’s oeuvre, which forms the basis for the lovely, lyrical musical, not as hits to be played from a jukebox but as poetry that constructs a mythic, broken American landscape. The music sets a scene and tone; the story, original to the play and equally mythically American, unfolds within it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The setting is Duluth, Minnesota, in the winter of 1934. It’s Bob Dylan’s hometown, less than a decade before his birth, but it serves not so much as that specific location as a your-town-here down-on-its-heels middle American small city. We meet a crowd of misfits living in a boarding house, struggling to make ends meet. They are a sharply drawn bunch, each one a sort of archetype but all with their own quirks, in ways that you wouldn’t immediately expect.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2020/03/04/girl-from-the-north-country-depression-musical-elates/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The landlord, Nick (Jay O. Sanders), is about to lose the boarding house to foreclosure; his wife, Elizabeth (Mare Winningham), is suffering some sort of dementia that leaves her barely mentally present but nevertheless still sure she no longer loves him; their grown son, Gene (Colton Ryan), is an alcoholic with dreams of being a writer, and their adoptive daughter, Marianne (Kimber Elayne Sprawl), is an African-American woman, now unmarried and pregnant, who was long ago abandoned by guests and raised more or less as their own, helping to run the house. Guests include a woman (Jeannette Bayardelle) waiting on a small inheritance, with whom Nick is having a not very secret affair; a glad-handing, out-of-work businessman (Marc Kudisch) with a pill-popping wife (Luba Mason) and overgrown, developmentally challenged, manchild of son (Todd Almond); and a Bible-selling, fast-talking Bible salesman and preacher (Matt McGrath) who arrives late one night in a storm accompanied but a onetime boxing phenom (Austin Scott) recently out of prison for a crime he says he didn’t commit. A local doctor (Robert Joy) often comes by to visit, and to serve as a narrator, as does an elderly cobbler (Colton Ryan), who hopes to marry Marianne.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The play is both written and directed by the Irish playwright Conor McPherson, whose previous work, including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Weir </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Seafarer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, has won him an Olivier Award and Tony nominations. He has both constructed and staged the play beautifully, a dark and impressionist take on the world conjured by Dylan’s words. His songs — more often deep cuts than greatest hits — show up to highlight moods, performed by characters commenting on the action, often with other performers joining in on instruments (along with a small band upstage).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cast is similarly strong. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Girl From the North Country</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> originated at The Old Vic and had its New York debut a year and a half ago at The Public. Populated by expert New York stage actors, with Jay O. Sanders (who has joined the cast for the Broadway transfer) as paterfamilias and often gathered around a table to talk about life and loss, it can sometimes feel reminiscent of a Richard Nelson Rhinebeck play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Except that Nelson’s plays have a glimmer of hope. This one, while moving and pretty, is also dark and sad. It is a portrait, really, of a world that’s falling apart. Nick is losing the house, and everyone has a dark secret. The doctor is an addict, the boxer is an escaped con (that he will sing “Hurricane” is the only jukebox-musical-obvious note here), the preacher is a con man. By play’s end, even this ersatz, found family is scattered, everyone — except perhaps Marianne — moved on to a situation that’s somehow even worse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2018 Public production was inevitably more intimate. But this one feels even more visceral. As a pandemic rages, as the government shows its incompetence, and the stock market teeters, as everything in the news seems more and more desperate, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Girl From the North Country</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> seems less about a far-off, old-fashioned America and instead, suddenly, about what hasn’t changed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does it feel?</span></p>\n<p><strong><b>Girl From the North Country </b>opened March 5, 2020, at the Belasco Theatre.

As can be imagined, the playing area had to be stretched across the expanse of the arena. A new, mostly flat stage floor was constructed, some 90 feet wide (as opposed to perhaps 35 feet on Broadway). No scene changes possible, under the circumstances; the courtroom was set at one end, the house unit at the other, with numerous scenes played in between. This arrangement placed most parts of the arena—at least those on the lower levels—within distance of at least some of the action, augmented by live-video closeups on four Madison Square Garden-sized LED screens.</p>\n<p>This required the show to be significantly restaged, which seems to have been accomplished handily. Director Bartlett Sher, who did an astonishing job in what couldn’t have been much time, patrolled the perimeter during the performance; at one point he could be seen instructing Nina Grollman and Nick Robinson—adult actors who play Scout and Jem Finch and serve as narrators—like the head coach on the sideline.</p>\n<p>The performance was intact, featuring the current Broadway cast. (Ed Harris stars as Atticus Finch, with Grollman, Robinson, LisaGay Hamilton, and Taylor Trensch joining original cast members Dakin Matthews, Neal Huff, Kyle Scatliffe, et al). The show’s two performing musicians were joined by several high school choirs, which sang a spiritual at the beginning and performed during intermission. The performance was introduced by Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife Chirlaine McCray, followed by filmmaker Spike Lee who proudly proclaimed himself a product of the New York City Public School system and offered encouraging words to the eagerly awaiting crowd.</p>\n<p>Given the circumstances, critics were specifically enjoined from reviewing the production. Let us say, simply, that the overall excellence of Aaron Sorkin’s stage adaptation of Harper Lee’s ground-breaking novel was very much in evidence, with nothing lost and quite a bit enhanced by the contribution from the very much engaged and involved audience.</p>\n<p>That audience reaction, mind you, was altogether staggering. The high school and middle school students, drawn from all five boroughs, hung on every word (which was surprisingly audible, given arena acoustics). The racial components of the novel resonated to the rafters, to say the least. Playwright Sorkin, presumably, had to be electrified by the way nuances in his script—which might ordinarily receive silently knowing nods from a few hundred playgoers each night—were here picked up and cheered by thousands of rapt patrons. Time and again, you could feel the visceral impact of the performance.</p>\n<p>All this was made possible by the <em>Mockingbird</em> producers (led by Scott Rudin and Barry Diller) and Madison Square Garden, with executive chairman James L. Dolan providing the house and related expenses rent-free. Dolan threw in 18,000 boxes of popcorn, too. As far as we can tell, this was the largest audience for a live theatrical production since Euripides was pulling them in at the 24,000-seat house at Ephesus back in the third century B.C.</p>\n<p>Electrifying is the word, I suppose, that best describes this one-of-a-kind exhibition. Now that Broadway producers, Madison Square Garden, and the New York City Department of Education have demonstrated that this sort of civic partnership is not impossible once you substitute altruism for profits, one can only hope that other top-line hits do the same. <em>Hamilton</em>, notably, has performed a series of underwritten student matinees at its 1,300-seat home. But 18,000 public school students at one sitting, the majority of whom are unlikely to have ever seen live theater?</p>\n<p><em>Mockingbird</em> at Madison Square was phenomenal indeed, and likely as memorable for all in attendance—including the acting company and assorted witnesses from within the profession—as for the students.</p>\n<p><strong>To Kill a Mockingbird opened December 13, 2018, at the Shubert Theater, and played one performance on February 26, 2020 at Madison Square Garden.

Photo: Kyle Froman</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if your devoted father was murdered in your home when you were a child? What if the police never figured out who did it? What if, even worse, everything you thought you knew about your parents was wrong?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are the provocative stakes in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Headlands</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a trim new San Francisco-set play—the title refers to hikes in the nature preserve across the Golden Gate Bridge in Marin—that opened tonight in an LCT3 production at the Claire Tow Theater. Unfortunately, it doesn’t quite deliver on them, with a tone that shifts ineffectively from smart-alecky noir satire to deep, dark family psychodrama and generally stolid performances that seem more to be examining the story than living and feeling it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things start off promisingly. I’ve often felt that for a young playwright, it must feel like winning the lottery to score a slot at LCT3, where big budgets and a beautiful space ensure that your “emerging artist” work is lavished with tender care. Here, we have a Chinese-American playwright, Christopher Chen, telling a Chinese-American story, with largely Asian-American performers. These are all things to celebrate. There is a big cast and an elegant, minimalist staging by Knud Adams that, van Hovianly, incorporates giant video projections on the upstage and side walls, some pre-recorded for scenic effects, some live.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even as its protagonist, a young Google engineer named Henry (an adequate but not especially emotive Aaron Yoo), unlocks the mystery of his family history, the play itself never unfolds into something fully engaging. This might be because Henry&#8217;s parents—we meet them in flashbacks, his father (Johnny Wu) and his mother both as a romantic young woman (Laura Kai Chen) and a dying older one (Mia Katigbak)—are by design both reticent and also removed, relegated to those flashbacks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mostly, though, it’s because Henry and his girlfriend, Jess (Mahira Kakkar), are so opaque, both as written and as performed. Henry makes a point of telling us that he’s a software engineer, but that profession never relates back to the plot. He introduces himself as a true-crime aficionado and amateur sleuth, and makes a funny early joke about how their joint gumshoery brings he and Jesse together, but on the evidence we see the extent of his crime passion begins and ends with trying to figure out what happened to his dad. (Which, by the way, is quite a big thing on its own; I just don’t know that it makes one a Hardy Boy.) And when, late in the play, Jess announces that she needs a break from the relationship because Henry has become so obsessed, neither have we seen him behaving in an obsessed manner nor are there any plot stakes or development from Jess’s departure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mystery at the heart of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Headlands</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—what happened to dad, and what are mom and dad’s long-buried secrets—is nicely plotted and slowly, intricately revealed, even if if the emotional storytelling around it is not. There’s the real germ of something worthy here. Unfortunately, in what’s currently onstage at the Tow, it never comes to fully comes to, um, a head.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Headlands opened February 24, 2020, at the Claire Tow Theater and runs through March 22.

Since van Hove’s staging almost ceaselessly presents the musical&#8217;s physical action against enormous projections of live and pre-recorded video, it is the perfect house for just such an attraction.</p>\n<p>You likely are familiar with the details of the Arthur Laurents storyline drawn from <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> and the terrific Leonard Bernstein-Stephen Sondheim score, so we’ll move along, yes?</p>\n<p>As the show begins, a live shot pans across the actors depicting the Sharks and the Jets. Their close-up faces and bodies loom large along the theater’s back wall. Everybody is dressed in scruffy 2020 streetwear, displays tattoos all over, and appears to be smoldering away in extremely bad moods.</p>\n<p>Not so incidentally, the two gangs are peopled mostly by young performers of various color, and since their clothes sport no insignia, it’s a challenge to tell the warring factions apart. Probably this casting is meant to signify the multi-cultural mix of today’s conflicted population.</p>\n<p>Possibly you have heard that “I Feel Pretty” and the “Somewhere” ballet have been eliminated, the lyrics used for the “America” number are the acrid movie version, and Jerome Robbins’ original choreography has been jettisoned here. All true. Swiftly performed and sans an intermission, the show runs a grim 105 minutes.</p>\n<p>Dwarfed by their vast video selves or slow-mo panoramas of bleak Bronx streets, the performers energetically rumble through plenty of writhing, mostly low-on-the-floor choreography by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. Some of these moments are projected onscreen from overhead camera angles, like an old Busby Berkeley number.</p>\n<p>“Gee, Officer Krupke” is performed against a video montage of courtrooms, jails, and police brutality. The “America” montage presents sweet and sour images of Puerto Rico and Manhattan today.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the performers leave the stage entirely and can be glimpsed only through video: What was formerly known as the Bridal Shop (cited in the program here as the Sweatshop) and Doc’s drugstore are realistically depicted within inset stages that only the cameras can capture. There is no balcony onstage for the “Tonight” balcony scene, but a backstage area has been remade into the apartment where Maria and Anita dwell for the camera to project live onscreen.</p>\n<p>Extensive use of live video projections is characteristic of van Hove’s directorial style, and so is rain. Here the rains begin during “The Rumble” sequence and pour down intermittently for the remainder of the show. Sometimes lighted in toxic yellow, this <em>West Side Story</em> looks entirely desolate.</p>\n<p>The relentless misery of the director’s gloomy interpretation of the musical scarcely allows for any contrasting moments of joy or sweetness as Tony and Maria discover each other and fall in love. The show’s most striking moments are those involving conflict, as when an embracing Tony and Maria literally are torn away from each other by the opposing gangs.</p>\n<p>Something should be said about the performances, but there’s little to mention except that everybody, lead players and ensemble members, render their character’s music, motions, and emotions capably enough. The shows that van Hove directs usually are cool in temperature, and this one is no exception. No hot young stars blaze forth in the production’s damp firmament here.</p>\n<p>Still, the Bernstein-Sondheim score remains beautiful and touching to hear, and music director Alexander Gemignani mostly conducts it at a quick clip that moves the show along neatly.</p>\n<p>I suspect that younger viewers will appreciate this production more than others. Raised on video games and computer screens, they are less likely to find the nearly wraparound video of the staging as distracting as their elders might. And, of course, newcomers to the musical are likely to be struck by the loveliness of the score and the urgent nature of its story.</p>\n<p>By the way, should anyone have the urge to see this rather doleful rendition of <em>West Side Story</em>, best viewing is in the front mezzanine, from where the dance patterns can be seen across the deck.</p>\n<div>\n<div><strong><b>West Side Story </b>opened February 20, 2020, at the Broadway Theatre.

Photo: Julieta Cervantes</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Every so often, if you&#8217;re lucky, a song that you&#8217;ve known and loved forever becomes a revelation. One such instance is when Isaac Powell delivers Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim&#8217;s rapturous ballad &#8220;Maria&#8221; in the new Broadway revival of <em>West Side Story</em>. As most reading this review know, Powell&#8217;s character, Tony, the increasingly ambivalent co-founder of a New York street gang called the Jets, has just met Maria, the sister of the leader of a rival gang, the Sharks, and to say that Tony is besotted would be a vast understatement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ma-<em>ree</em>-ah,&#8221; Powell utters, adorably, before launching into a performance that is—like his Tony, generally—at once delightfully goofy and dead serious, desperate and indomitable, brimming with the unbridled joy and sheer sense of wonder particular to young love. Whether he&#8217;s raising his lilting lyric tenor to caress a high note or simply shrieking in ecstasy, you believe that this Tony will, truly, never stop saying Maria.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2020/02/20/west-side-story-damp-desolate-and-usually-distracting/\">[<em>Read Michael Sommers&#8217; </em>★★★☆☆<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>Powell&#8217;s portrayal is both a high point of this production—helmed by Ivo van Hove, one of the most sought after and controversial directors of our era—and of a piece with it. Van Hove has assembled a magnificent cast for what is, not surprisingly, a distinctly contemporary, graphic, brooding (but not humorless), and powerful take on one of the greatest and most groundbreaking works in musical theater. Watching fog rise off the stage, and listening to what sounded like a faint rumble in between certain songs, I was reminded of a colleague&#8217;s comment that the Belgian director likes to stage the subtext of plays—and of how I irritated I was by the tics and tricks in some of his previous New York efforts.</p>\n<p>Not so here. Most notably, scenic and lighting designer Jan Versweyveld, van Hove&#8217;s longtime collaborator, has teamed with video designer Luke Halls to make the latter aspect central to this production. An enormous screen projects both live and pre-recorded images, threatening to overshadow the actors at times but also providing vivid insights, not all of them dark. During &#8220;The Jet Song,&#8221; we see the different individuals in the gang preening and clowning through the streets, even as the young men glower as a collective.</p>\n<p>Tony and Maria—the latter played by Juilliard undergrad Shereen Pimentel, with both earthy spunk and a refined, glistening soprano—are also revealed as fleshed-out modern teenagers, with van Hove mining the awkwardness and humor in their rapid-fire courtship, and nurturing a wonderfully playful rapport between his leading actors. Meeting in secret in the sweatshop (a bridal shop, in the original book) where Maria works—which can appear, like other sets, like a dollhouse as it also looms large on the screen hanging over it—Powell and Pimentel giddily follow each other into hidden nooks, like tiny figures defying the injustices that will doom them.</p>\n<p>One of the most disputed features of this <em>West Side Story</em> may stem from van Hove&#8217;s decision to jettison Jerome Robbins&#8217;s original choreography, a dazzling watershed for dance on Broadway, to work with Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, an accomplished veteran but a musical theater newbie. But De Keersmaeker has retained a sense of tension and release, of allowing frustrated youth to express their burning stories through movement, crafting exhilarating vehicles for the supple, charismatic performers—among them Yesenia Ayala, who exudes sexual intensity as Anita, Maria’s feisty protector and confidante and her brother’s girlfriend, and Broadway newcomer Dharon E. Jones, whose strong singing and nuanced acting as Jets leader Riff unveils a new triple threat.</p>\n<p>A bigger problem for purists might be van Hove&#8217;s gutting of a good chunk of what was the second act. In shaving his production down to an hour and 45 minutes, with no intermission, the director has eliminated the breezy standard &#8220;I Feel Pretty,&#8221; so that the tragic momentum that begins building with &#8220;The Rumble,&#8221; originally the Act One finale, isn&#8217;t disrupted. More significantly, he and De Keersmaeker have eliminated the iconic &#8220;Somewhere&#8221; ballet, and replaced the original &#8220;America,&#8221; a ferociously witty, all-female showstopper, with the watered-down, co-ed number featured in the 1961 film adaptation.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a noble attempt to inject more racial diversity into a show that specifically highlights bias against Puerto Ricans, even as it exposes the general dangers and idiocy of intolerance. A number of the actors playing Jets, including Jones and even Powell, are non-Caucasian or of mixed race—as many Puerto Ricans are. But with Arthur Laurents&#8217;s original libretto and Sondheim&#8217;s lyrics intact, little is done to reflect the gang&#8217;s evolution from what has commonly been perceived as a posse of white xenophobes in the 1950s to a group dealing with our current, equally troubling dynamics—aside from a video montage documenting police brutality, juxtaposing the traditionally comic &#8220;Gee, Officer Krupke,&#8221; in which a black youth is attacked with particular force.</p>\n<p>Then again, perhaps that&#8217;s part of the point—that just as the Jets have been, from the start, descendants of people from other lands, they share more with the Sharks than they realize. In any case, it&#8217;s a tribute to this unsettling, transporting production that its quirks and departures do little to diminish its overall potency. If you were going to choose only one <em>West Side Story</em> to see in your lifetime, you might miss this one. But I would strongly advise against either option.</p>\n<p><strong><b>West Side Story </b>opened February 20, 2020, at the Broadway Theatre.

Latest on the list is songwriter Jerry Herman, who died on the day after Christmas at the age of 88—which, as was gleefully pointed out, is the same number as keys on a piano.</p>\n<p>Herman’s tuneful catalog provided plenty of top-flight material, and the large number of performers who’ve worked on his shows and concerts thronged the Lunt—one song each, please—with a cascade of audience favorites. A 29-piece orchestra was ensconced on stage, blasting out a veritable parade of what Jerry delighted in calling <em>showtunes</em>.</p>\n<p>And what a parade it was, consisting of highlight after highlight. The festivities began by tuning the grand up (as Jerry would say) with the brass-and-banjo filled overture to <em>Mame</em>. On came Marilyn Maye, who’s been singing “It’s Today” since 1966, belting that paean to living across the footlights despite her 91 years (and counting). This was just a warmup. After Jeremy Jordan essayed <em>Hello Dolly</em>’s “It Only Takes a Moment,” on came Debbie Gravitte with a comedic spitfire rendition of “Wherever He Ain’t” from <em>Mack &amp; Mabel</em>. Which, as part of an unplanned mini-Jerry Herman celebration, will be seen at City Center Encores! starting February 19.</p>\n<p>While songlists typically make less-than-dynamic prose, the most direct way of giving a taste of the event and the performers is to simply step through the program. The songs come from six musicals: One from <em>Dear World</em>, two each from <em>La Cage aux Folles</em> and <em>The Grand Tour</em>, three from <em>Mack &amp; Mabel</em>, four from <em>Hello, Dolly!,</em> and six from <em>Mame</em>.</p>\n<p>Sutton Foster (characteristically fine with a rousing “I Don’t Want to Know”) was followed by a performer who slinked on in the semi-darkness for “Gooch’s Song,” only to rotate on the first big belted tone revealing that she was costumed and <em>supremely</em> pregnant. (Part of the song.) The singer was extremely effective and extremely funny; she was also extremely unrecognizable, as the onstage introduction was inaudible. The singer turned out to be extremely expert in the manner of the treasured Jane Connell, with a couple of vocal stretches that sounded vaguely familiar to ears grasping to identify her. When she sat on the lip of the stage, feet dangling into the auditorium like her mother at the Palace, her identity became clear. Who knew Lorna Luft was this good?</p>\n<p>Next came Ron Raines with an ensemble of 16 or so singers to spotlight the top-notch original vocal arrangement of “Mame.” This was from the days when you actually hired 16 singers for the chorus, instead of 10 or 12 singer/dancers who are so busy that they can’t stand still long enough to create such a strong sound. This number was conducted by 94-year-old Don Pippin, who created the original arrangement as Jerry’s longtime musical director and vocal arranger.</p>\n<p>Tyne Daly and Klea Blackhurst hit the comic bases with—no surprise here—“Bosom Buddies”; nor was it a surprise, given the stellar lineup, when Kristin Chenoweth came on for “If He Walked into My Life.” Next up was Jason Graae, who produced an oboe and proceeded to sing, play, and clown his way through “You I Like,” fully demonstrating that he belonged up there with the assorted Broadway luminaries. (Many of the company have toured extensively with Herman, and were performing routines they have mastered in the past.)</p>\n<p>Next came Michael Feinstein, a prime supporter of the composer who has consistently featured his songs, with “I Won’t Send Roses.” The surprise of the afternoon turned out to be Leslie Uggams, who started out quietly with what turned out to be a ferociously dynamic rendition of “I Am What I Am.” In an afternoon filled with vociferous audience response, Uggams—who continues to astonish, after all these years—got the entire orchestra floor up out of their seats.</p>\n<p>Next came three <em>Dolly</em> numbers, starting with “It Takes a Woman.” John Bolton—announced from the stage as “the <em>real</em> John Bolton”—led the number, presumably flying in from the national tour (this week: Naples, Florida). Lewis J. Stadlen, who played Vandergelder in an earlier stage of the tour, was listed in the program but not in evidence. Then came Kelli O’Hara (on “Before the Parade Passes By”) and Betty Buckley (singing the title song, without the red dress).</p>\n<p>Next up was Jerry himself, on video, singing “I’ll Be Here Tomorrow.” This was followed by another one of those only-one-name-is-necessary performers called Bernadette. Unlike in other songwriter memorials, she was the only original cast member actually recreating a song she first introduced—“Time Heals Everything”—and Peters was quite as effective as she’d been as a waif-like newcomer in the 1974 <em>Mack &amp; Mabel</em>. The evening ended with Lee Roy Reams leading the cast and hand-clapping audience in, no surprise here, “The Best of Times.”</p>\n<p>Marc Bruni directed the fast-paced 90 minutes, the proceedings propelled by a top-notch band led by Larry Blank. The full orchestra played mostly the original charts by 11 arrangers led by Philip J. Lang, all of whom—through the unaccustomed courtesy of the management—received title page credit.</p>\n<p>The evening was interlaced by five speakers, including two on video. Angela Lansbury seemed a bit frail, inaccurately recounting that Herman had introduced her to the musical stage (which she had memorably conquered two years before <em>Mame</em> in some Sondheim musical). Sir Paul McCartney also chimed in, speaking of his fondness for Jerry from what is apparently his living room with two authentic-looking Impressionist paintings half visible in the frame. (McCartney’s father-in-law, John Eastman, was for a while Herman’s publisher.)</p>\n<p>Speaking in person were Herman’s goddaughter Jane Dorian, who had a life full of memories to relate briefly; Herman’s longtime friend Alice Borden, who described the weekend in 1963 when Herman wrote four songs “on spec” for <em>Hello, Dolly!</em> and she accompanied him to David Merrick’s office to sing the audition that got Jerry the job; and Harvey Fierstein, who related how when he started to collaborate on <em>La Cage</em> Herman lived in an overwhelmingly beige townhouse with a <em>Mame</em>-like staircase and houseboy, while the poverty-stricken Fierstein was wearing a bulky winter jacket with strips of mylar patching the holes. Harvey regaled the house with laughter and—like the other in-person speakers—wound up near tears.</p>\n<p>The memorial was produced by Dorian, Feinstein, and Herman’s husband, Terry Marler; Herman specifically directed Marler to put Dorian and Feinstein in charge. This, it turns out, was the precise right choice. The afternoon—from performers to selection of material to tasteful projection work—was lovingly and cannily assembled, always in the very best of taste (and with no expense seemingly spared). One felt that Jerry himself was sitting there, personally supervising every element of his very own memorial. He likely would have loved every single moment, and implored everyone to get back together next month in Washington/Los Angeles/London to do it all again.</p>\n<p><strong>Jerry Herman: A Memorial Celebration was presented for one performance, February 3, 2020, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre.</strong></p>\n",

Photo: Aidan Gibney</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The two-act <em>Beyond Babel</em>, at The Gym at Hudson, is being promoted as “a narrative urban dance riff on Shakespeare’s <em>Romeo and Juliet.</em>” So, of course, is <em>West Side Story</em>, which coincidentally(?) is now revived uptown (with a February 20 opening) and may be the Broadway season’s most anticipated production. That’s if you go by the overwhelming advance publicity and advertising, which is hard not to go by.</p>\n<p>Since comparisons are supposed to be odious and since I haven’t yet seen Ivo van Hove’s buzzed-about revival (revisal? revision?) with its new Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker routines, there isn’t going to be any comparison here.</p>\n<p>Instead, I advise any and all entertainment hunters for contemporary <em>Romeo and Juliet </em>dance updates to boogie right on over to the Hideaway Circus project. It’s choreographed by company artistic directors Keone and Mari Madrid—with Josh and Lyndsay Aviner as creative directors—and reaches Manhattan after a 125-performance 2018 run at a pop-up San Diego theater.</p>\n<p>Maybe “boogie” is an inaccurate verb to land on as the mode of travel. Boogie-ing isn’t exactly what the Madrids and 10 other double- and triple-jointed terpers are doing with enough stamina to run a country the size of, say, Australia. The troupe’s moves are not derived from “boogie” but from, among other influences, break dancing, from Toni Basil, from angular hip-hop gestures, and from Madonna’s “Vogue” video. Many searing steps abound that can also be noted in current musicals like David Byrne’s <em>American Utopia </em>and Alanis Morrisette’s <em>Jagged Little Pill</em>. Occasionally, the buff Madrids even draw on the contraction-and-release mode so much a part of Martha Graham’s ground-breaking technique.</p>\n<p>These elements are synthesized into a new <em>West Side Story</em>-by-way-of-<em>Romeo and Juliet </em>that’s as exciting—or close to as exciting—as its acclaimed <em>West Side Story </em>predecessor. For this one, Keone Madrid is Romeo/Tony and Mari Madrid is Juliet/Maria, with Fabian Tucker as a new figure who frequently appears in fencing-like mask to act as the cause of the gangs’ volatile divisiveness. Incidentally, the warring gangs are eventually identified by red (Sharks?) and blue (Jets?) wrist bands the Fabian character attaches. It’s a color scheme electrifyingly played up by the Jeff Croiter-Sean Beach lighting.</p>\n<p>Though the stage is often bare to allow for sequences like a seeming dance at a gym (yoo-hoo, <em>WSS</em>), just as often tall metal frames on casters—some with chain-link—are rolled out to form the physical and metaphorical wall between the gangs. Often the frames are covered with colorful crocheted piece. So is the proscenium, which features a “Love Endures” slogan, although whether love actually does endure is questioned by the Shakespeare-derived plot. (It could be that love kept from enduring is what really guarantees the tragedy’s 400-plus-year’s endurance.)</p>\n<p>The music—not, to be sure, by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim—is piped in from 30-plus sources like, to name only a few, Jacob Banks, Years &amp; Years, and since this is her year, five-time Grammy-clutcher Billie Eilish. All inclusions, well chosen as they are, add to the <em>Beyond Babel </em>romance, suspense and suggestion that the tragic action is very much taking place in 2020. .</p>\n<p>As the star-crossed lovers the Madrids feature themselves. Before the final black-out, they have contributed three (or is it more?) breakdance <em>pas de deux </em>of breathtaking virtuosity. More than that, though, they make it clear they’re determined to be appreciated as part of an ensemble—all members often wearing matching beige costumes as they execute their numerous drills.</p>\n<p>The other dancers—not one ever making a false step or allowing an errant hand gesture and each repeatedly given the spotlight—are Olivia Battista, Melissa De Jesus, Noelle Franco, Selene Haro, Shannon Kelly, Samuel Moore, Dylan Mayoral, Julian Sena and, if there’s a first among equals, Mikey Ruiz.</p>\n<p>As good, as strong, as exhilarating, as beautiful as <em>Beyond Babel </em>is, it’s also longer than it needs to be at telling the <em>R&amp;J </em>story once again. The attenuation is due, to a large extent, to the eventual repetition of today’s trendily hands-heavy gyrations. All the same, the problem is somewhat vitiated by the unflagging energy the troupe exhibits.  How do they do it? Hours spent in exercise classes where no amount of stretching can be too much must account for part of the answer.</p>\n<p>By the way, the <em>Beyond Babel </em>title is elusive. It can’t mean that speech itself has been discarded, which is true of most, if not all, dance. Throughout these hopping proceedings, the dancers do speak to each other from time to time—and even to the patrons (who’ve been encouraged to talk and shout back). Nothing especially cogent is uttered, but the banter is there.</p>\n<p>Never mind: Once again, the course of true love not running smoothly as a result of society-bred intolerance is held up and once again made an urgently pressing matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Beyond Babel opened February 1, 2019, at the Gym at Judson Theater and runs through March 25.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Did you hear the one about the nuns, St. Peter at the pearly gates, and the holy water? It ends with the zinger “If I’m going to have to gargle with that stuff, at least let me do it before Sister Christine puts her ass in it”? (How many Hail Marys does that get me?) It’s an oldie but goodie, and James Cromwell, as retired pharmacist–turned–would-be stand-up comic Bill, delivers it with gusto in Bess Wohl’s laugh-packed <em>Grand Horizons</em>.</p>\n<p>Senior citizens telling dirty Catholic jokes are just the start. There’s also the revelation that Bill is sending X-rated texts to Carla (Priscilla Lopez); his wife of 50 years, incidentally, is named Nancy. “That’s what you call it, right? Sexting? Sending pictures?” Nancy (Jane Alexander, giving a gorgeously understated performance) asks their son Brian (Michael Urie). There’s Carla’s ode to battery-powered pleasure, which she shares over tea with Nancy. And—perhaps most outrageous, and hilarious, of all—there’s Nancy’s recollection of some seriously racy stolen moments with the love of her life: her high school sweetheart, Hal. (Tempting as it is to quote Wohl here, it wouldn’t be fair; you have to hear Alexander deliver the speech.)</p>\n<p>The setup for all this nuttiness is a two-line dinner conversation. Nancy and Bill have just wrapped up their perfectly choreographed premeal routine: Nancy plating the pot roast; Bill shaking the salt into his hand and sprinkling it over his plate (he doesn’t even need to taste before he salts, because he’s had this dinner so many times); both unfurling and delicately placing their napkins on their laps. “I think I would like a divorce,” Nancy says. She might as well be saying “I think I would like chicken tomorrow”—that’s how casually she drops the bomb. “All right,” replies Bill, continuing to shovel his way through his meat and mashed potatoes.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2020/01/23/grand-horizons-senior-citizen-sex-comedy-gets-boost-from-jane-alexander/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the news sends their grown sons, Brian and Ben (Ben McKenzie), into a total tailspin. Ben’s well-meaning, and very pregnant, wife, Jess (<em>Mean Girls</em> Tony nominee Ashley Park), draws on her therapist training and eventually gets the couple to grudgingly hold hands. But the brothers are in fix-it mode, and seem determined to talk their parents out of it. “I’m not even sure you can end it at all at this point, I mean, if you wanted to get divorced you should have done it after we went to college, like normal people. Like a mid-life crisis kind of a thing,” says Ben. “I mean, you’re almost eighty. Like. How much else—even is there?”</p>\n<p>Senior-citizen sex, know-it-all emotionally erratic kids, a looming divorce: It sounds like a pitch for a sitcom as opposed to the newest play from the writer of the somber <em>Make Believe</em> and the minimalist <em>Small Mouth Sounds</em>. <em>Grand Horizons</em>—produced by Second Stage, which commissioned and developed the play with Williamstown Theatre Festival, where <em>Horizons</em> premiered in July—may not be as weighty as some of Wohl’s other works, but it’s damn funny, and very on-point.</p>\n<p>Wohl and set designer Clint Ramos do a brilliant job capturing the cookie-cutter feel of senior living. “It’s one stop shopping,” says Bill, explaining the ins and outs of the not-so-grand Grand Horizons facility. “And then in the cafeteria they put your picture up there on the bulletin board with all the other news. So it’s like, ‘Okay, everyone, so it’s gonna rain Friday, Ed is this week’s Bingo champion, Sheila’s started a new book club, Sam and Joanie are dead.’” Don’t hate yourself for laughing at that line; you definitely won’t be the only one.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Grand Horizons</em> opened Jan. 23, 2020, and runs through March 1 at the Helen Hayes Theater.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Grand Horizons is one of those independent living communities of cookie-cutter condos set up so the staff can seamlessly transfer you to the assisted living section when the bell, as they say, tolls. It is neither “grand” nor on any discernible “horizon,” being located in what seems to be suburban Delaware. Rather, it is an upscale parking spot for the affluent middle class.</p>\n<p>Bess Wohl’s geriatric new play, which takes its name from the retirement community, at least offers unprecedented originality in this day and age: None of the seniors on stage has or develops dementia, and when was the last time we saw <em>that</em>? What we do get, in its place, is adulterous old folks detailing sexual escapades to their horrified adult children. To say nothing of their audience.</p>\n<p>Here’s the venerable Jane Alexander, of all people, offering guffaw-raising dialogue about what they used to call “private parts.” This is supplemented by detailed discourse on the operational details of little blue, egg-shaped, hands-free, multi-speed vibrators you can order on the internet. (“You can do harder, softer, pulse, steady,” the always enjoyable Priscilla Lopez helpfully explains, “just like on a blender.” <em>Leave space for laughter.</em>) Octogenarian sexting, too, and let’s all be glad that the projection designer is content to leave <em>that</em> element to our over-assaulted imaginations.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2020/01/23/grand-horizons-the-kids-arent-alright/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Dramaturgical question: how likely is it for an 80-year-old woman to ask her 80-year-old husband’s 70-something mistress about her sex life? No matter, long as it generates laughs.</p>\n<p><em>Grand Horizons</em>—a coproduction of Second Stage and the Williamstown Theatre Festival—is a comedy of the dysfunctional-family-gathers-and-due-to-parental-sexual-activity-falls-apart genre, in two acts. Nancy (Alexander) and Bill (James Cromwell) are living in silent misery. Playwright Wohl and director Leigh Silverman are at their most humorously creative in the opening scene, which continues several minutes before anyone says anything at all. (Watch Alexander pour gravy on the mashed potatoes!) Finally:</p>\n<p>She: <em>I want a divorce.<br />\n</em>He: <em>Okay.<br />\n</em>Quick blackout.</p>\n<p>Lights up on the couple’s two grown sons, Ben (Ben McKenzie)—accompanied by his increasingly pregnant wife, Jess (Ashley Park)—and Brian. The latter is a vodka-and-Crystal-Light swilling high school drama teacher played by Michael Urie, just then ensconced in a 200-person production of <em>The Crucible</em> with multiple John Proctors and Abigails and even a court stenographer so that “every kid who wants a part gets one.” (Someone email Rebecca Miller, quick!) Yes, this is milked for what it’s worth—it’s worth considerable laughter, indeed—and Urie is every bit as funny as you’d hope.</p>\n<p>The sons (squabbling, of course) and stepdaughter (squabbling, of course) try to patch this squabbling Humpty Dumpty marriage together again, but can’t; otherwise, what would they do for a second act? Instead, the kids react in horror to word of the parental affairs; otherwise, what would they do for a second act? And then, there&#8217;s the U-Haul truck but you&#8217;ll have to see the play to find out about that.</p>\n<p>Each reveal, needless to say, results in filial shock laced with laugh lines. In the end, despite fitful laughter at an evening’s worth of fitful jokes, nobody is happy. Except maybe Carla-the-flame (Lopez), who following the vibrator discourse realizes that she’s wise to leave her pink scarf (don’t ask) and flee back to her condo in less luxurious Vista View (&#8220;near the highway&#8221;).</p>\n<p><em>Grand Horizons</em> is a new play, but not new in the Broadway sense. This sort of thing abounded in the third quarter of the last century. Some were hits, often major; does anyone remember <em>Never Too Late</em>? (Middle-aged mom gets pregnant to the shock of her husband, pregnant daughter, and son-in-law, for 1,007 performances.) Watching the first act of <em>Grand Horizons</em>, I was swept back to a different old play, a negligible 1972 offering called <em>6 Rms Riv Vu</em>. This was mostly because that play demonstrated the comic touch of the then-young Alexander, who has spent a good deal of her career playing more serious fare. Her deft performance in <em>Grand Horizons</em> is decidedly reminiscent of that earlier play, which despite her ministrations and those of the equally young Jerry Orbach proved to be a flimsy comedy trying too hard to compete with ol’ Doc Simon, a popular gagman of the era.</p>\n<p>Alexander is a delight; when she and Urie are left to their own devices, for the momma-has-sex scene, they make <em>Grand Horizons</em> seem highly accomplished. Urie is excessive and over-the-top throughout, precisely as called for. Park—a major asset in <em>Mean Girls</em> and a memorable Tuptim in the Lincoln Center <em>King and I</em>—reveals a more than fine comic sense as well. So does Lopez, who is destined to be ever-remembered as the “I felt nothing” girl from <em>A Chorus Line</em>. Cromwell, an accomplished screen actor best known as the pig tender in <em>Babe</em>, holds his own but is unable to surmount the material as his cohorts effortlessly do. Where’s Jerry Orbach when you need him?</p>\n<p>Wohl is among the current crop of fine younger playwrights filling our stages nowadays. <em>American Hero</em> (2014) was promising, <em>Small Mouth Sounds</em> (2015) arresting, <em>Make Believe</em> (2019) altogether provoking. With <em>Grand Horizons</em>, she seems to have wanted to step back and try her hand at a traditional, non-challenging, old-fashioned sex comedy. That’s more or less what we get.</p>\n<p><strong>Grand Horizons opened January 23, 2020 at the Helen Hayes Theater and runs through March 1.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It might be a pleasure to report that Charles Fuller’s <em>A Soldier’s Play</em>, which is set in 1943-44 and deals with “the madness of race in America,” has reached the point where the play falls into the category of treasured period piece.</p>\n<p>No such luck. The drama premiered at the Negro Ensemble Company in 1981 and was handed the Pulitzer Prize in 1982. The first-rate Roundabout Theatre Company revival, opening as the fourth (and final?) year of the Trump administration begins, is every bit as pertinent as its debut was then—perhaps, given the divisiveness now afflicting the country, even more so.</p>\n<p>If anything is at all dated, it’s the use of the word “negro,” which has faded into disuse and might even be considered nowadays as inappropriate. Otherwise, <em>A Soldier’s Play </em>registers as high on the Shock-o-meter as it did 39 years ago when it first shattered the air with a many-perspectives look at what happens when a black officer, Captain Richard Davenport (Blair Underwood), is sent to a segregated Army camp to handle a murder investigation. The dead enlisted man is Sergeant Vernon C. Waters (David Alan Grier), shot and killed off the base and further mistreated in what initially is assumed to be a Klan incident.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2020/01/21/a-soldiers-play-a-stodgy-whodunit-and-a-thoughtful-meditation-on-racism/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★☆☆<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Captain Davenport isn’t exactly welcomed by white Captain Charles Taylor (Jerry O’Connell), who, if he is expected to work with a new officer of his rank, is startled to meet—for the first time—a black officer. His hardly disguised prejudice is only one of the prejudices clogging Fuller’s atmosphere.</p>\n<p>As for the deceased Sergeant Waters, as tough a sergeant as these men usually go, he has charge of a platoon populated by privates (one recently stripped of three stripes), who are such proficient baseball players that they’re in contention to win a competition that will have them play an exhibition game against the New York Yankees.</p>\n<p>For the most part Waters, seen throughout in flashbacks, takes pride in his men, making an exception of Private C. J. Memphis (J. Alphonse Nicholson). Not because Private Memphis is a less accomplished player—he&#8217;s a reliable home run hitter—and not because he’s insubordinate. Insubordination is relative for Waters. Platoon newcomer Private First Class Melvin Petersen (Nnamdi Asomugha) is regularly insubordinate and earns Waters’ respect, not despite his attitude but because of it.</p>\n<p>Waters is a drinker. He’s drunk the first time he’s seen, putting himself in the sights of his murderer. Waters’ racial hatred is on full regard then and is only displayed in its complete power as the two acts unfold, as the victim becomes the focus of Captain Davenport’s interviews with the Waters&#8217; platoon members.</p>\n<p>Fuller has constructed <em>A Soldier’s Play </em>with impressive intricacy. As it proceeds, it even takes on something akin to film noir: what could be dubbed stage noir. Waters’ death isn’t the only one that crops up. There’s a suicide, which is linked to Waters and to aspects of racial hatred.</p>\n<p>So Captain Taylor’s ingrained prejudiced behavior, when introduced to Captain Davenport, may be the first glaring instance of unexamined bias but maybe not. Drunk Sergeant Waters bellowing about whites hating blacks just before he’s murdered in Klan territory is the introductory instance of Fuller’s screed on American madness. That kneejerk assumption already establishes the severely compromised atmosphere. But Waters brings yet another bias to bear on the subject: hatred Northern blacks have for Southern blacks. Waters is a Northern black. (Does that particular form of prejudice no longer persist in 21st century America? Or is it only better masked?)</p>\n<p>One of the most brutal speeches in a drama overflowing with brutal speeches has Waters fulminating about the obsequious nature of Southern blacks. He insists to another platoon member about Private Memphis’ upbringing, saying (only in part): “My daddy told me we got to turn our backs on his kind….Close our minds to the chittlin’s, the collard greens—the cornbread style. We are men—soldiers, and I don’t intend to have our race cheated out of our place of honor and respect in this war because of fools like C. J.”</p>\n<p>Waters’ foul opinion is at least in part attributable to being shaped by white treatment of blacks, which is to say the threads of racism so knotted as to be impossible to untangle. Therein lies the beauty of Fuller’s work, if “beauty” is a word that can be applied. Actually, it can be: the terrible beauty of unflinching honesty.</p>\n<p>Honesty is certainly what director Kenny Leon presents. While being true to Fuller’s script, he makes a couple irresistible alterations. As background music for <em>A Soldier’s Play</em>, the author asks for snippets of “Don’t Sit Under the Apple Tree” at the start of each act. It’s a perfectly sensible request. The 1942 Andrews Sisters hit was as much a World War II emblem as the Oscar Hammerstein II-Richard Rodgers <em>Oklahoma!</em>, but Leon just as meaningfully replaces it with the men in the platoon preceding Waters’ entrance with a rhythmic gospel song. Leon kicks off the act-two opening with a fancy-footed parade of platoon members across the stage.</p>\n<p>Leon’s demands of the cast are met in full. It’s as if every member is a stick of just-lighted dynamite. Grier and Underwood detonate the brightest and account for the most emotional damage inflicted, but everyone is outstanding. The same goes for Derek McLane’s set, Dede Ayite’s costumes, the Allen Lee Hughes lighting and the Dan Moses Schreier sound.</p>\n<p>Underwood as Captain Davenport speaks Fuller’s devastating statement about “the madness of race in America.” Just after he’s said it, he does something that has the effect of an entire blighted union exploding in tragic frustration. It may be the most heated moment currently on any local stage. For its reflection of a case of national despair, it’s not to be missed.</p>\n<p><strong><b>A Soldier&#8217;s Play </b>opened January 21, 2020, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through March 15.

It opened straightforwardly: “Charles Fuller, the black playwright who yesterday won the Pulitzer Prize for drama, said he was ‘stunned’ and ‘delighted’ by the news.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not “the playwright,” but “the black playwright.” This was in 1982.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That, in its way, gets to the heart of Fuller’s work, which debuted in 1981 in an off-Broadway production staged by the Negro Ensemble Company and opened in its Broadway premiere tonight, in a lovely and loving revival by the Roundabout Theatre Company at the American Airlines Theatre that ably masks the script&#8217;s flaws. Even when black people succeed in America, Fuller says, they’re still first and foremost seen by this country as black.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2020/01/21/a-soldiers-play-charles-fullers-pulitzer-winner-in-stunning-revival/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Soldier’s Play</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a murder mystery on its most basic level, set at a Southern Army base during World War II. It opens with the murder: A drunken African-American sergeant, Waters, is laughing and shouting. “They’ll still hate you,” he says, repeatedly. Then he’s shot. Soon enough, Davenport, the rare African-American officer, an MP—“I’m a lawyer the segregated Armed Services couldn’t find a place for,” he says by way of introduction—arrives to investigate. The story is told in a series of flashbacks as Davenport works to uncover the truth. Everyone thinks it was the local Klan; everyone worries it may have been some racist white solders; and, as Davenport learns, it turns out all of the black men in Waters’ unit hated him. You can’t have a murder mystery without plenty of plausible murderers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On that basic murder-mystery level, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Soldier’s Play</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is, well, pretty basic, a by-the-book procedural. There’s a lot of “send in the next one” and “are you sure that’s really what happened.” Davenport’s main antagonist is a white captain on the base, Taylor, who thinks of himself as a decent person but also can’t quite take to the idea of a black man holding his same rank. For no particularly good reason except that it moves the story along, in one scene Taylor shifts from undermining and attacking Davenport to sharing the base’s secrets with him. It’s all a little bit underwhelming.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it’s on the less basic levels that the play works. It’s really a portrait of what living under racism, and what hating oneself for it, can do to a person. Waters was a man who did everything right—joined up, worked hard, got ahead. And still, he realized, they hated him. He took out that diminishment on his men, especially the Southern black men he hated most, the ones he saw as living up to stereotypes, the ones who reminded him why, he believed, whites hated him. (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shondes for di goyim</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you might say.) It’s this socio-psychological element that raises Fuller’s OK play to something more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s also this particular staging. David Alan Grier gives a remarkable performance as Waters, both blustery and wounded. (It didn’t hurt that the night before I saw </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Soldier’s Play</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I’d been at the Met for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porgy and Bess</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which mostly served to remind me of Grier’s sensational Sporting Life at the Richard Rodgers several seasons back.) Blair Underwood is controlled and fierce as Davenport. The actors playing the men of Waters’ company ably sketch a collection of real individuals, and even Jerry O’Connell shines in the somewhat motivationless role of Taylor, the white caption who switches from bad guy to good. Kenny Leon directs with a sort of quiet military precision, and Derek McLane’s post-and-beam set, moodily lighted by Allen Lee Hughes, impressionistically suggests a barracks, a drill hall, and perhaps a gallows.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, <em>A Soldier&#8217;s Play</em> remains as stubbornly earnest and straightforward as its title. At its end, the black soldiers—relegated mostly to playing baseball for the base, never getting to fight Hitler—receive word that they’re finally shipping out. And O’Connell’s Taylor realizes the error of his early ways. “I was wrong, Davenport—about the bars—the uniform—about Negroes being in charge,” he says. “I guess I’ll have to get used to it.” It’s a play set in the 1940s, written in the 1980s, optimistically looking toward a better time in American race relations. In 2020, that can’t help but feel quaint.</span></p>\n<p><strong><b>A Soldier&#8217;s Play </b>opened January 21, 2020, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through March 15.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Emotions are carefully measured and sentimentality is in short supply in <em>My Name Is Lucy Barton</em>, the very fine (and very faithful) stage adaptation of Elizabeth Strout’s mother-daughter–focused novel.</p>\n<p>“No-one could isolate any bacteria or figure out what had gone wrong,” says Lucy (Laura Linney, who will smash your heart to bits with a single word: <em>mommy</em>), standing in the hospital where an appendectomy turned into a nine-week stay. “No-one ever did.” No anger, no bitterness, no frustration with the American health care system—just the verbal equivalent of a shoulder shrug.</p>\n<p>Speaking of her childhood in the “tiny rural town of Amgash, Illinois”—distressed farmland where there was “no beauty for the eye to rest upon”—Lucy is similarly frank: “We did not have a television. We did not have newspapers or magazines. We did not have books.” A frequent family dinner was bread with molasses.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2020/01/15/my-name-is-lucy-barton-her-name-is-laura-linney-in-an-illuminating-performance/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★☆<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Yet when Lucy’s mother—also played by Linney, only by adopting a ramrod-straight posture and that indisputable Midwestern drone (sorry, Mom!)—arrives for an unexpected hospital visit, they don’t reminisce about the big stuff. How they all lived in one room—the garage—until Lucy’s great uncle died; then they moved into the adjacent house, which afforded such luxuries as hot water and a flushing toilet. (“But often it was still very cold,” says Lucy. “Always, I have hated being cold.” Mom probably did too; perhaps that’s why she’s always pulling at her sweater, trying to wrap herself up tighter.) They don’t discuss Lucy’s wedding, which her parents didn’t attend, or her two daughters, whom her parents haven’t met. And as much as it weighs on her, Lucy doesn’t dredge up her most painful memory: being locked in her father’s truck. “The dirt-streaked windows, the tilt of the windshield, the grime on the dashboard, the smell of diesel gas and rotting apples, and dogs.… I remember pounding on the glass of the windows, screaming. I did not think I would die, I don&#8217;t think I thought anything, it was just terror, realizing that no one was to come, and watching the sky get darker, and feeling the cold start in. Always I screamed and screamed. I cried until I could hardly breathe.” She was, she recalls, “probably no more than five years old.”</p>\n<p>For Lucy, it’s easier, and actually more comforting, to let her mother yammer on about everyone and everything else. (Isn’t it always?) Kathie Nicely—“goodness she came to a bad end,” says her mother. “The thing about Kathie Nicely … I don’t know how nice she really was.” She discusses her worrywart cousin Harriet, whose husband “dropped dead in the street” and “left her nothing, poor woman.” Harriet’s son, Abel, married “quite a hoity-toity”; and his sister, Dottie, “poor Dottie,” had her husband run out on her. “He was from the East,” sniffs Lucy’s mother, dropping a not-so-subtle reference to her Massachusetts-raised son-in-law. “Thought he was just a tiny bit better than she was, probably.” But the best losing-a-husband story—and there are <em>a lot</em> of them—is definitely the tale of Mississippi Mary, the “cute as the dickens” former head cheerleader. I won’t spoil it for you.</p>\n<p>Theirs isn’t an I-love-you-to-the-moon-and-back relationship. Theirs is: “Mommy do you love me?” “When your eyes are closed.” When things get too serious—when Lucy’s doctor tells her she might need surgery—mom high-tails it back to LaGuardia. But Rona Munro’s play—and Strout’s book—is more about what’s <em>not</em> said: what happens when our eyes are closed, what happens when we’re thousands of miles (and worlds away) from our family.</p>\n<p><strong><em>My Name Is Lucy Barton</em> opened Jan. 15, 2020, and runs through Feb. 29.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Looking out on a picture-perfect Manhattan cityscape dominated by the glimmering Chrysler Building from a high-up private room at the hospital where she is ensconced following a routine appendectomy that develops into a nine-week mystery illness, a sophisticated and altogether together New York writer introduces herself: “My name is Lucy Barton.” But things are not what they seem. Small things, big things, <em>all</em> things.</p>\n<p>This applies not only to the character, essayed by the altogether wonderful Laura Linney, and the play (adapted by Rona Munro from the 2016 bestseller by Pulitzer-winner Elizabeth Strout, directed by Ronald Eyre for Nicholas Hytner’s London Theatre Company and brought to New York audiences by Manhattan Theatre Club). It applies to the concept and even the setting, a bare rectangle occupied solely by a chair, a hospital bed, a side table with an untouched pitcher of water, and Linney. Plus that postcard-perfect window view of Manhattan spires, projected on one of three upstage screens. It&#8217;s not much of a production from ever-inventive designer Bob Crowley, you might think, especially given the rows of patron-filled seats occupying what would be the wings. But things are not what they seem, and Linney and her unseen cohort manage to fill the stage and fill the theater altogether nicely, thank you very much.</p>\n<p>“Nicely” is not a random description, mind you; it’s the name of a family of childhood neighbors who are discussed in depth, and needless to say the self-proclaimed “pretty Nicely girls” were not all that nice. Although who’s to say given the bias of the anecdote teller, Lucy’s estranged Midwestern mother. And don’t you think of calling the lady “trash”; she’ll cut you dead, and this is a hardscrabble, dirt-poor drab who <em>specializes</em> in demeaningly withering maternal wisdom. “Wizzle,” she repeatedly calls her daughter, with a sardonic edge.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2020/01/15/my-name-is-lucy-barton-maternal-affairs/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Mother—whom, unless I missed it, appears to be nameless—makes an abrupt, surprise appearance beside the hospital bed, having been exiled from Lucy’s cosmopolitan life many years back. This occurs something like ten minutes in, and Mother proceeds to more or less commandeer the play and explode the reality of her daughter-the-writer’s carefully and painfully earned existence. And her self-worth, too.</p>\n<p>Much of this fractured memory play centers around Mother’s five-night hospital-room visit. Linney inhabits both roles, with the parent’s Midwestern-pioneer twang threatening to efface the mild-mannered daughter. Which, as it turns out, is part of what long ago drove Lucy away from the fictional hamlet of Amgash, Illinois. (The majestic Chrysler Building skyscape is replaced, in our view and in Lucy’s imagination, by the corn and soybean fields of her youth as well as a startlingly claustrophobic representation of a key childhood trauma. These courtesy of video designer Luke Halls, who will return to Broadway in March with his remarkable work on <em>The Lehman Trilogy</em>.)</p>\n<p>As the ravels of the story are unspooled, Lucy reveals a surprising—to us and to herself—forgiveness of Mother’s passive acceptance of the girl’s severe abuse at the hands of her violent and troubled father. This is not addressed explicitly by Lucy, and presumably wasn’t by novelist Strout, but it is central to the play. “I kept wishing she would say <em>your father hopes you get better</em>,” Lucy says at one point from her hospital bed. “But she did not.”</p>\n<p>Things are not what they seem, no. Ultimately, Lucy confesses almost apologetically to an abiding love for her decidedly difficult mother; despite the hardships, this is the only mother she knew. Even though the adult Lucy Barton has otherwise erased from her life all vestiges of her upbringing, beginning with that thick-as-a-backhoe native twang.</p>\n<p>Transforming <em>My Name Is Lucy Barton</em> from page to stage in such engrossing manner is quite a feat on the part of the actor, as well as Strout, Munro, and Eyre. Linney gives an astounding performance, circling the truth (whatever that might be) with a supreme ambivalence. The overall effect, on that almost bare platform set within the stage of the Friedman, being that she—the actress and the character—is thoroughly, and nicely, compelling.</p>\n<p><strong>My Name Is Lucy Barton opened January 15, 2020, at Samuel J. Friedman Theatre and runs through February 29. Tickets and information: <a href=\"https://lucybartonplay.com/\">manhattantheatreclub.com</a></strong></p>\n",

It seemed that everyone admirable who appeared onstage in New York wanted at least a few weeks of Connecticut greenery and the breeze from Long Island Sound. Not that it was always sunshiny. There were heat waves and hurricane warnings, and those dreaded gray mornings when the fog would roll in and never seem to lift; “Mary Tyrone mornings” we called them. There were foggy evenings too: Once I remember going for an afternoon walk on the beach with two friends up from New York for the day. As we turned to go back, the fog rolled in behind us, which we didn’t see till it had engulfed us, so thick it made us totally invisible to each other. I with my wretched night vision panicked; they had to clutch me, one by each arm, to get me safely back to the O’Neill grounds.</p>\n<p>Climate change has burnt away much of the fog, but has brought other problems in its wake, including an increased population of deer ticks and sometimes sweltering heat. Nobody has ever really loved the Amphitheatre, the largest of the O’Neill’s four performance spaces, but in extreme heat its open-air spaciousness can become nigh on unbearable. Even back in the day, an actor rehearsing in the Amp during a heat wave once passed out from heatstroke. Mercifully, he was uninjured and recovered in time for the performance that night. The Amp is also plagued with noise from the nearby Ocean Beach Amusement Park, particularly during its annual “Polka-bration,” which arrives in time to plague one of the O’Neill’s big weekends every summer.</p>\n<p>My favorite story about the Amp and the amusement park, though, has to do with the Fourth of July, one year when I was dramaturg on a show there. The amusement park of course had fireworks planned, and the O’Neill had worked out a schedule with them so that the fireworks would, we hoped, occur during our act break. Unfortunately, there were many visitors up from New York that holiday weekend. They took a while to get settled, and Lloyd in his introductory speech—he gave one at every show—seized his opportunity to work the crowd, urging donations. Between the slow house-filling and his speech, we started later than planned, and had only just gotten to the first act’s climactic moment—where Dianne Wiest exclaimed to Jeffrey DeMunn, “God in the sky! Are you a virgin?”—when a very large Roman candle went up, signaling the start of the amusement park’s fireworks display. Between the fireworks and the laughter, I don’t think our audience that night noticed much of the rest of Act One.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/author/feingold/\"><em>Read more Feingold Columns </em><em>here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Plays at the O’Neill rehearsed for two and a half days, performed with scripts in hand, then had a day off, with a few afternoon hours allowed for notes and for any quick revisions the playwright and director chose to make, before the second performance, also with scripts in hand. Some directors pressured their playwrights to rewrite (the Broadway out-of-town tryout tradition still sent its vibes our way), and some dramaturgs abetted them. I usually strove to put the brakes on, warning playwrights, “You don’t have to do this. It’s your choice.” And some directors didn’t love me for it; others, who approached rewriting more gingerly, were grateful for the support my warnings offered. Some playwrights had come expecting to go through a manic rewrite process, and couldn’t stop themselves; the script office was kept busy churning out last-minute new pages. Others refused to make any changes at all—I suspect the phrase <em>kill your darlings</em> was invented as a rebuke to them. Some of this latter group had a fondness for what I called “gizmos”—verbal tricks or clever twists in the action that seemed to me (and often to their directors) to add nothing to the play’s substance. Gently, I would try to persuade them to take these things out—only to find, ironically, in several such cases, that when the play got a full production, in New York or at some resident theater, that all the gizmos had been put back in place, because there are directors and producers in the world who love gizmos too. They think of a play simply as a means of keeping the audience diverted, not of leading them somewhere.</p>\n<p>The best playwrights had to struggle, deeply, to find exactly where they were leading the audience. I had the honor to serve, at the O’Neill, as dramaturg on two of the plays by August Wilson first seen there. The first was <em>Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom</em>, an astonishing discovery by a then-unknown artist. We all marveled at the cumulative power of its talk and its spellbinding confrontations. Somewhere, buried in an archival box, I think I may still have my O’Neill script, with a remarkable epilogue that August, when reworking the play for its full production, elected to abandon. Following the murder, Ma and the remaining members of her band are seen waiting for the police to complete their investigation and release them. Their talk is a requiem—shockingly, not for the murdered piano player and amateur philosopher, Toledo, but for Levee, the hot-headed young trumpeter who has killed him, and who now will never be able to display the musical brilliance of which his early (and intrusive) efforts to assert himself in Ma’s accompaniment have shown such an exciting foretaste.</p>\n<p>One can see why August cut this scene: It sheers away from the play’s main dramatic focus, and the unexpected jolt its topic gives the audience could come off seeming like—well, like a gizmo. Yet at the same time, it widens the scope of the play’s tragedy, casting light on its social context from an unexpected angle. Sometimes, seeing revivals, I have regretted its deletion.</p>\n<p>Writing was a particularly deep struggle for August, and every completed script a hard-won victory. The ending of <em>The Piano Lesson</em>, the second of his plays on which I served as dramaturg at the O’Neill, was a source of true anguish for him as well as a challenge for us. Later, when Lloyd staged the full production at Yale Rep that moved to Broadway, August found an ending that, at that time, seemed to me like a patch—too facile and too easily settling a conflict weighed down by the riveting power of the play’s backstory. (Berniece’s line “Money can’t buy what that piano cost” is burned on my heart.) Only when Ruben Santiago-Hudson staged its Signature revival did the end seem right and fulfilling.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10434\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10434\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10434\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Richards_and_Shanley1.jpg?resize=1200%2C849&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"849\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Richards_and_Shanley1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Richards_and_Shanley1.jpg?resize=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Richards_and_Shanley1.jpg?resize=1024%2C724&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Richards_and_Shanley1.jpg?resize=768%2C543&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Richards_and_Shanley1.jpg?resize=218%2C154&amp;ssl=1 218w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Richards_and_Shanley1.jpg?resize=283%2C200&amp;ssl=1 283w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lloyd Richards and John Patrick Shanley in 1983.

Vincent Scarano</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While playwrights struggled to bring their scripts into sharper focus, directors—at least, the more commercially minded ones—entertained themselves with fantasies of being linked to a play that was a “hot property,” with visions of regional and Main Stem productions dancing in their heads. Such directors were not always asked back for a second season, but it was hard to ignore the success stories of plays that had traveled the rocky road from the O’Neill to New York and moneymaking: Ron Cowen’s <em>Summertree</em>, Chris Durang’s <em>History of the American Film</em>, John Patrick Shanley’s <em>Danny and the Deep Blue Sea</em>, and so many others. However often Lloyd bemoaned <em>The New York Times</em> feature that had dubbed the O’Neill “Tryout Town, USA,” neither he nor anyone else could ignore the prestige, and the funding, that such successes brought the O’Neill. For most of us, it was simply another burden of the kind nonprofit arts organizations have learned to live with; but there were directors, and a few playwrights, who saw the successful transfer as their chief goal in life. I remember one director who loaded so many props (and not modular props, either) onto a rather slight comedy that his stage manager reported him to the “art police”—meaning that she complained quietly about the excessive prop list to Lloyd’s office staff, so that the director duly received one of Lloyd’s gentle but firm reprimands. And in good time, too, for while overloading the play with his gimmickry, the director had almost succeeded in turning its meager satirical point upside down.</p>\n<p>On another occasion, I found myself, at breakfast, trapped between the director and writer of the previous night’s performance, each of whom had stayed up all night preparing a very different version of the play’s second act, which each insisted must be inserted at that afternoon’s rehearsal. As each was equally determined that his version be the one used, there was nothing for me to say but “Let’s go talk to Lloyd.” So off we went. Not for the first time did it occur to me that Lloyd’s role model was Abraham Lincoln, in his “Great Compromiser” mode. He listened patiently to the two clashing accounts of what needed to be done to repair the play, then turned to the playwright, saying that of course his version would have priority; the Conference was about him and was dedicated to helping him make his play better. But, he added, it might be that the director’s version was worth a look, before jumping in with a brand-new second act so hastily prepared; perhaps the playwright might find some of the director’s revisions of use, as clues or even as shortcuts to the material he was striving to sort out. Both went away content with this, mollified by Lloyd’s calming, soft-spoken presence. I breathed a sigh of relief and stayed out of what I knew would be a long and knotty wrangle between then and our late afternoon rehearsal hours. The new pages that arrived that afternoon were very much a merger of the playwright’s rewrites with the director’s cut-and-paste edits. The act played much better, and everyone involved was happy. Lloyd didn’t say anything to me about the incident, but at the conclusion of the second performance, he smiled at me and said, “Good work.”</p>\n<p>George White was a passionate internationalist, and there were always groups of foreign visitors at the O’Neill—frequently from then–Soviet Russia and from China, for the Cold War was still on and George felt vehemently that theater could be the best way of bridging the political gap. The Russians came in the hope of raising “valuta” by selling Soviet plays in the U.S.: There were always one or two men from the State Copyright Bureau in the delegation, whom most of the Conference assumed to be KGB agents sent to keep the artists in line. That always made me laugh, since to me they seemed exactly like hardware salesmen from the Midwest—just guys trying to market a product they were pretty sure wouldn’t sell. My fun came from trying to guess by their behavior which of the Soviet playwrights were the actual KGB agents and which were mild dissidents being let out for a brief breath of free air. The Russians always had breakfast, all together, on the sea porch of the mansion, with its beautiful view of Long Island Sound. A regular Conference joke was that they did so hoping to catch a glimpse of the Electric Boat Company’s latest products. (EBC, one of New London’s major industries, manufactured nuclear subs for the Navy. There was a rumor that, during the O’Neill’s earliest years, they had tainted the local water supply, and in fact a number of actors from those years died of cancer.)</p>\n<p>Plays by Russians, mostly not very good, were sometimes put on the Conference schedule. They usually came with equally mediocre, British-inflected translations by the State Translation Bureau. I recall being assigned to one (authored by one of the mild dissidents), and sitting down with a Russian-speaking American advisor, to retranslate it, line by painful line, because the actors had found the script they were given literally unspeakable.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10437\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10437\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10437\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rose_Barn1.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rose_Barn1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rose_Barn1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rose_Barn1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rose_Barn1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rose_Barn1.jpg?resize=231%2C154&amp;ssl=1 231w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10437\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Rose Barn Theater at the Eugene O&#8217;Neill Theater Center.

With them, as with the Russians, conversation had its limits, and one learned not to press a touchy point. (The Russians always came prepared to answer attacks on the Soviet system which, most of the conferees being politically unawakened, almost never occurred.) One year, the Chinese visitors included the young woman who had just translated O’Neill’s’ <em>The Iceman Cometh</em> into Chinese. Rashly, because I couldn’t resist, I asked her how she had translated the slang expression <em>pipe dream</em>, which occurs several hundred times in the play’s lengthy text. “We use the word for <em>illusion</em>,” she replied demurely, but with a firmness that clearly shut down any further discussion of the matter. She had no intention of delving into the twisty topic of China’s long and tangled history of opium smoking, from which the phrase derives.</p>\n<p>On another occasion I found myself chatting with a Russian librettist who told me he had written a musical version of a play “by a writer you probably never heard of.” He was floored when I told him that Isaac Babel’s work was not only well known in English, but that I had actually seen an off-Broadway production of the very play he was adapting. Then, unfortunately, I mentioned the film Babel had written for Sergei Eisenstein (which had been suppressed and destroyed in the Stalinist 1930s), and our conversation, like my exchange with the Chinese O’Neill translator, ground to a dead halt. The topic was one that an artist from a politically regulated totalitarian state firmly (and no doubt wisely) declined to discuss.</p>\n<p>Besides Russians and Chinese, the most frequent foreign visitors were Scandinavians, chiefly Danes and Swedes; I don’t recall British, French, German or Italian visitors turning up with any frequency, and there were surprisingly few from the then-Soviet satellite countries, except for an occasional Hungarian. The Swedish drama critic Ingmar Bjorkstejn, who later did me a kindness for which I will be forever grateful, loved the place, and for a time came regularly every summer. (Years later, he arranged for me to visit the Ibsen Fest in Oslo and the Dramaten in Stockholm. I spent two weeks seeing some of the best theater in the world.)</p>\n<p>One year Ingmar’s visit happened to coincide with a black play, not unworthy but of only mild interest in itself, about the struggles of the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. A significant figure in the play was Dunbar’s determined mother, a former slave fiercely ambitious for her son, and this was Ingmar’s first opportunity to experience the work of Mary Alice, an extraordinary actress who had become a beloved fixture at the O’Neill. The first act ended with a ferocious scene between Dunbar (powerfully played by Roc Dutton) and his mother, as he fought to get free from her domination. I’ll never forget the way Ingmar came out of the Barn Theatre, on fire with amazement. He caught sight of me, grabbed me by the shoulders, and shouted, “Who is this woman? Why isn’t she playing Medea?” I explained to him that she was Mary Alice and could play anything, and would set ablaze with her inner light anything she chose to do, from a condom commercial to an avant-garde poetic threnody. Thinking back, I now rather regret that I never followed up that conversation by urging Mary to play Medea, and everyone who remembers her Tony-winning performance in August Wilson’s <em>Fences</em> on Broadway will know exactly what I mean. The climactic moment, when she takes the illegitimate newborn child from her faithless husband’s arms and says, “From now on, Troy Maxson, this child has got a home. But you a womanless man,” Mary played this with a seemingly unemphatic quietude that nonetheless made every spectator feel nailed to the back wall by its intensity. (<em>Fences</em>, too, began at the O’Neill, though in nowhere near the taut shape in which it arrived on Broadway.)</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10435\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10435\" style=\"width: 613px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10435\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/August_Wilson_Lloyd_Richards1.jpg?resize=613%2C433&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"613\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/August_Wilson_Lloyd_Richards1.jpg?w=613&amp;ssl=1 613w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/August_Wilson_Lloyd_Richards1.jpg?resize=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/August_Wilson_Lloyd_Richards1.jpg?resize=218%2C154&amp;ssl=1 218w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/August_Wilson_Lloyd_Richards1.jpg?resize=283%2C200&amp;ssl=1 283w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10435\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">August Wilson and Lloyd Richards at the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center. Photo: A. Vincent Scarano</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I let Lloyd down one summer. I had been hired to translate a new opera for Santa Fe, and did not give him enough advance warning that I would be unavailable for the Conference that summer. He did not reproach me, and our relations remained cordial when we ran into each other, but he did not invite me to serve as a dramaturg again. Luckily, by then I had already established myself in a role which allowed me a further link to the Conference for many years; as a teacher in the National Critics Institute, run when I first taught there by Ernie Schier of <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em>, and after his retirement by Dan Sullivan of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, who had been his second in command.</p>\n<p>NCI was another outgrowth of Lloyd and George’s quest to integrate criticism into the O’Neill process. Its fellows were a mixture of recent journalism school graduates with an interest in the arts and fairly inexperienced or artistically untutored critics from newspapers around the country. Many were reporters or feature writers who had been handed the theater-critic “beat” simply because the vacancy needed filling. Their teachers—who included, besides Ernie, Dan, and myself, Judy Rousuck of <em>The Baltimore Sun</em> and the invaluable Linda Winer, then at <em>Newsday</em>—were seasoned critics, mostly East Coast–based, with long experience of professional theater, as well as the terminology and tools with which to evaluate it.</p>\n<p>But the critic-fellows’ best teacher was, quite simply, the Conference itself. Many of them, even among those who had seen a good deal of professional theater, had rarely watched a professional company rehearse. And at the O’Neill, where the process was accelerated and compressed, like time-lapse photography of flowers blooming, they could see it all, schedule permitting, from first read-through to closing performance. In some summers, Dan facilitated this by assigning each critic-fellow a feature article on one of the Conference plays, so that he or she was exempt from most other assignments during that play’s three-day process. And in addition to all this, there was the unexampled joy of being able to socialize, in off hours, with those mysterious beings who make theater, usually viewed by journalists as a race apart: playwrights, directors, actors and even designers. For although sets at the O’Neill were strictly modular, there was a professional scenic designer or two in residence throughout the Conference. Every playwright was invited to discuss what he or she “saw” onstage in terms of scenery, and the designer would create a full rendering based on this input, which was posted at the theater entrance for audiences seeing the performance to inspect.</p>\n<p>Of course the critic-fellows were there to polish their craft as critics, and, except when assigned a feature, they each reviewed every Conference play, along with jaunts to some of the area’s summer-stock playhouses, including a visit to the scenically delicious Goodspeed Opera House, a lovingly restored Victorian town hall which presented mostly old musicals, situated on the bank of the Connecticut River in nearby East Haddam.</p>\n<p>But then came the reviews—which Ernie, an old hand on the beat, insisted should be done overnight. (When he retired, Dan relaxed the schedule somewhat, taking account of the reality of press previews, which gave the critic-fellows some breathing time.) The reviews were due before breakfast, and when we convened after breakfast (or after that morning’s critique), copies were handed out to everyone, the fellows were divided into two groups, each with a teacher, and the fun began. Each critic read his or her review aloud, the teacher sometimes interrupting the reading to point out an issue or question a choice of words. Linda, who taught a course in critical writing at Columbia during the academic year, was by far the best at this, smooth and reassuring while still challenging any misused terms or misguided assertions. I tended to be clumsy and laborious, plodding through every sentence in my obstinate way. One former student has recorded, in an online blog post, his horror on realizing that I was going to question every sentence in one of his reviews.  But I was only doing for him what my editors at the <em>Voice</em>, Ross Wetzsteon and Erika Munk, had done for me. Ross was meticulous about verbal clarity; Erika tended to approach assertions of opinion in a jovially combative spirit (“Is that really what you mean?”). They had sharpened my perceptions, and I didn’t see why these youngsters shouldn’t have their perceptions sharpened as well, for the four weeks they were there. It was exhausting, but it was heartening. Everybody, including the teachers, learned a good deal. Then Helene Goldfarb, Dan’s invaluable assistant, carefully locked the reviews away in her files, where nobody else could see them—though I think playwrights who asked specifically may have been allowed to look at those for their show. Most of them did not ask, which was probably just as well.</p>\n<p>The critic-fellows had other activities too. Dan might shanghai any notable playwright, director, or actor who had some free time from rehearsal to spend a few afternoon hours talking with them about what his or her work entailed. The fellows all read <em>Long Day’s Journey</em> (I was always startled by the number who had never read or seen it), and sometimes Dan found a designer with a few free hours, who would invite them to supply their own rough sketches of a possible design for its set. After the O’Neill had acquired Monte Cristo Cottage, he instituted what many critic-fellows said was their most memorable Conference experience: A director, often Amy Saltz or Tina Ball, would spend a day with them in the cottage’s front parlor, staging them, in groups of four, in the play’s opening scene.</p>\n<p>I don’t know how many of the critic-fellows remained theater critics. It’s an ever-shrinking job market, and not everyone has the vocation. One I know went back to his first love, reporting; one teaches musical theater in Boston, another in Philadelphia; still another became a foundation executive. Some of those who established themselves as critics duly found their way back to NCI as teachers, including the delightful Mike Phillips, today a prominent film critic. Several others found their way into dramaturgy, and today have literary posts at various resident theaters. And one, I regret to say, has become a religious fundamentalist, though I believe a nonharmful one; her posts flowing with God and devoutness crop up on my Facebook news feed.</p>\n<p>The days I am talking about are quite long gone. When George and Lloyd retired, the world of the O’Neill changed. Today it is a different operation, more streamlined and high-powered, with new buildings which I have not yet seen.  Its time-frame has been compressed. No actor and no working critic has time to spend four idyllic weeks in the country anymore. Casts and directors come up for one play and then return home; critiques have been abolished. There is communality, but, I suspect, little communal spirit, though the flow of talent remains extensive. Many other organizations have risen over the years, in emulation of the O’Neill or in the effort to create an alternative to it; virtually every resident theater has its own play development program, some of them far more extensive and thorough than the O’Neill’s is or ever was.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10436\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10436\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10436\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wilk_Kaye_Blessing1.jpg?resize=1200%2C864&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"864\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wilk_Kaye_Blessing1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wilk_Kaye_Blessing1.jpg?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wilk_Kaye_Blessing1.jpg?resize=1024%2C737&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wilk_Kaye_Blessing1.jpg?resize=768%2C553&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wilk_Kaye_Blessing1.jpg?resize=214%2C154&amp;ssl=1 214w, https://i0.wp.com/nystagereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wilk_Kaye_Blessing1.jpg?resize=278%2C200&amp;ssl=1 278w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10436\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Max Wilk, Phyllis Kaye, Lee Blessing 2003</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The O’Neill I recall is probably un-recreateable. The new O’Neill is like the rest of the modern world, not as much to my somewhat old-fashioned taste as I could wish, though still full of admirable and exciting things. I miss the less hurried, less pressured ways of that earlier time. I miss the late Phyllis Kaye, head of Reception, who lovingly hand-calligraphed the name tags we all wore so proudly on our lapels. (I cherish the memory of playwright Harry Kondoleon’s mother, striding proudly across the grass, her ample bosom bearing an extra-long name tag that read “Mrs. Sophocles Kondoleon.”) Phyllis also brewed the devastating punch that knocked everyone for a loop at the end-of-Conference party each year. I imagine the recipe, like Phyllis herself, is gone. Global warming has burnt away most of the Mary Tyrone fog, and the increased heat makes air-conditioned indoor spaces preferable for rehearsals. Constant traffic in the mansion seems to have worn away or scared off any remaining ghosts. One of the ancient copper beeches—the one in the sunken garden that Lloyd always used to call “the Conference tree,” has gone too, struck by lightning during a bad storm. Some of these are the inevitable changes wrought by time; others are the foolish changes that we, foolish humans, carelessly allow to happen when they might better be prevented. Yet the memory of what the O’Neill once was remains, and it strikes me that today, when diversity is the cry on everybody’s lips, it might be useful to remember a place where diversity was practiced rather than preached, where artistic development was an article of faith, not a slogan to paste on grant applications, and where people came to work because the place made it fun for them to work together, and gave them time to breathe and enjoy themselves while doing that work. It was a good place in a not-so-great world. If Lloyd and George could create its goodness then, there is no reason to suppose that a place of such goodness could not be created now, though the world has grown far less great. We have only to feel the need of it, and believe that it can happen, and then it will.</p>\n",

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>At base, we have Harry Connick Jr. singing fourteen or so songs by Cole Porter. Given Connick’s way with a tune, his nimble pianistics, and his expert arranging skills, the show—a tour promoting his newest album, <em>True Love: A Celebration of Cole Porter</em>—more or less describes itself. Yes, Connick will be swinging along to a high-octane band, concentrating on the music and lyrics of the unlikely songsmith from Peru, Indiana.</p>\n<p>Rather than simply standing up there and singing the songs, though, Connick has gone out of his way to provide not only a Porter concert but a bells-and-whistles <em>show</em>. And it’s a dandy one. The singer is no stranger to Broadway, having appeared locally in revivals of <em>The Pajama Game</em> and <em>On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,</em> in two prior extended-run Broadway concerts (in 1990 and 2010), and as composer-lyricist of his own 2001 musical, <em>Thou Shalt Not</em>, which might well have scared him away from Shubert Alley altogether.</p>\n<p>Connick goes through Porter standards, sticking to the more melodious titles (“Just One of Those Things,” “I Love Paris”) while mostly eschewing those upon which Porter lavished high-comedy lyrics (with nothing along the lines of “Let’s Do It” or “You’re The Top” in evidence). No complaints, as there’s something to be said for sticking to what you do exceptionally well and doing it exceptionally well.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/12/12/harry-connick-jr-a-celebration-of-cole-porter-where-anything-goes/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>There is one dark horse in the mix, an obscure title called “Mind If I Make Love to You,” which Porter wrote for the 1956 motion picture version of <em>High Society,</em> and which, unlike the vast majority of his later songs, he never saw fit to have published. Connick has clearly adopted the song for extra attention on his CD and in his stage show, and has been heavily promoting it. Even so, it does not seem to scale the same heights as Porter’s bests. The singer—who is also credited as director, author, coproducer, and arranger, doing fairly well on all bases—also includes his own &#8220;Take Her to the Mardi Gras&#8221; in a New Orleans jam session segment.</p>\n<p>The 90-minute affair attains its loftiest heights with two late-in-the-evening sequences. Readers already planning to see the show can skip this description to preserve the surprise; those on the fence might find it intriguing enough to compel attendance. Connick begins his examination of “Night and Day” by explaining how masterful Porter was as an arranger and orchestrator. (Unless Connick knows something we don’t, this is a false supposition. Porter’s three main Broadway orchestrators each suggested that Cole had neither interest nor input into arrangements, carefully keeping himself snobbishly walled off from the music staff. If he had a rare comment or objection after hearing the charts, he would not say anything; rather, he would dispatch a toady to deal with the matter.)</p>\n<p>Connick then sits at a desk and describes how Porter might orchestrate the song, with the notes he “writes” for the different instruments appearing on the expansive screen above the stage. This serves as a fine explanation of how Connick (rather than Porter) builds his arrangements, and the visuals are so nifty that one only wonders what Leonard Bernstein might have accomplished with this technology.</p>\n<p>After which Connick hauls a massive wing-to-wing piano onstage—704 keys, by my count—for “Begin the Beguine,” hopping and sometimes dashing from one part of the keyboard to another. Meanwhile, an on-screen tap-dancing Cole Porter jumps down to the stage and engages in a wild challenge tap with Connick atop the stage-wide piano cabinet. The entire number is fantastical—did Fred Astaire once do something of the sort?—and rather phenomenal. Luke Hawkins is credited as choreographer and as the filmed Cole, while the onstage Cole is danced by Aaron Burr. At least, the Playbill calls him Aaron Burr; and mind you, Cole never looked like <em>this</em>.</p>\n<p>That piano, along with the altogether effective scenery, is designed by Beowulf Boritt and Alexis Distler; the excellent multimedia comes from Boritt and Caite Hevner. Ken Billington, meanwhile, bathes it all with stunning beams of filtered light. There is no credit for the film segments, but whoever directed them has done a marvelous job. The opening sequence alone, a Wellesian fantasy of Porter, starts what we might have assumed to be a plain old song-by-song concert on fanciful footing. (Porter and Welles, in fact, once tangled on what turned out to be one of Broadway’s biggest fiascos of the midcentury. But that’s a discussion for another time.)</p>\n<p>Connick, meanwhile, sings his way through the evening in familiar Sinatra style, stopping along the way to dazzle us at the keyboard. The excellence of his arrangements—conducted by Andrew Fisher—is accentuated by the top-notch soloists in the singer&#8217;s entourage. Standing out, although so casually identified that we cannot be too sure, are Mark Braud on trumpet, Jerry Weldon on sax, Geoff Burke on clarinet, Arthur Latin on drums, and Neal Caine on bass. Not to mention that ol’ New Orleans boy himself, scruffily unshaven, at the Steinway. And yes, he does at one point strip down to his undershirt, occasioning some hoots from his salivating fans.</p>\n<p>We do, alas, have one complaint to offer. The evening—at least from the tenth row on the aisle—is amplified beyond endurance. It almost seems like the promoters of this nationwide tour devised a sound system capable of use in the largest venues on the route, some of which might well be more than twice the size of the Nederlander. Coming to Broadway for a high-profile visit, don’t you think they might have had someone sit in the house at a music rehearsal and listen to how it sounds? Apparently not. (No sound designer is credited, or discredited.)</p>\n<p>Here we have a dynamite 25-person band that, it goes without saying, can easily fill the 1,200-seat Nederlander. But the music doesn’t seem to emanate from the stage. Even when Connick is soloing, do we hear the sound of the keys striking the hammers striking the piano strings? Nope. The sound comes from those blasted, blasting speakers on the side of the stage, so loud that it all sounds almost tinny. But that doesn’t take away from the effectiveness of this evening with the seriously talented Harry Connick and his celebration of Cole Porter.</p>\n<p><strong>Harry Connick Jr.—A Celebration of Cole Porter opened December 12, 2019, at the Nederlander Theatre and runs through December 29.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Before the curtain rises on <em>Harry Connick Jr.–A Celebration of Cole Porter</em>, in addition to the standard cellphone-off, no-photography-allowed warnings, the announcer has a rather unusual request of the audience members, from Connick himself: He’d like us to “refrain from posting” details about the show to social media—so we don’t spoil things for future theatergoers.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, then, this review should simply say that singer-actor-musician Harry Connick Jr. has taken up residency at Broadway’s Nederlander Theatre for a couple weeks with <em>A Celebration of Cole Porter</em>.</p>\n<p>Hopefully Connick will forgive me if I add just a few more details.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/12/12/harry-connick-jr-celebrating-cole-porter-with-brass-and-multimedia/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Connick’s all-Porter program includes staples such as the bang-up title number from <em>Anything Goes</em> (featuring the new-to-me lyric “When senators and legislators start / Calling each other traitors and/  So-and-sos/ Anything goes”); <em>Can-Can</em>’s nostalgic valentine “I Love Paris”; the jazzy “Just One of Those Things,” from <em>Jubilee</em>; <em>Kiss Me, Kate</em>’s “Why Can’t You Behave?”; the stunningly lush “Begin the Beguine”; and the spell-binding “You Do Something to Me.” Coincidentally, all of those—plus most of the others he performs—can be found on his just-released album, <em>True Love: A Celebration of Cole Porter</em>. (Surely he didn’t want us to leave out <em>that</em> detail.)</p>\n<p>Now, don’t expect the affable Connick to just plop down at the piano and sing. He certainly plays—at a grand piano and, at one point, on a variety of uprights. But at this point in his career, Connick is as much a performer as he is a musician—albeit one who did all the arrangements and orchestrations for every song in this show, thank you very much. And this certainly isn’t his first Broadway rodeo. (Counting his two previous concert stints, in 1990 and 2010, it’s his fifth; I’m not including 2001’s <em>Thou Shalt Not</em>, for which he wrote the music and lyrics but in which he didn’t star.) The man who headlined <em>The Pajama Game </em>and <em>On a Clear Day You Can See Forever</em> is going to bring a little personality to the proceedings—particularly if he’s crooning moody numbers such as “Love for Sale,” where he’s accompanied beautifully by bassist Neal Caine, and “Mind If I Make Love to You?” Connick calls the latter—originated by Frank Sinatra in the 1956 film of <em>High Society</em>—his favorite Porter song.</p>\n<p>I hope I don’t earn the artist’s ire for letting this detail slip: At one point, Connick breaks off for a jam session on the song “Take Her to the Mardi Gras” with six of the 25 (that’s right, 25!) orchestra members at “the Hall”—as in Preservation Hall in his native New Orleans. It just got me thinking: What I wouldn’t give to see Connick play a full NOLA-style jazz concert! Perhaps for his next Broadway stint?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Harry Connick Jr.–A Celebration of Cole</em> <em>Porter</em> opened Dec. 12, 2019, and runs through Dec. 29 at the Nederlander Theatre.

Photo: Monique Carboni</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Donja R. Love, the author of <em>one in two</em>, derived its title from a passage in a 2016 study released by the Center for Disease Control that projected “one in two Black gay and bisexual men will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime.”</p>\n<p>In his program note, Love recalls how he felt such a dire statistic was absurd, and so he decided to craft his semi-autobiographical <em>one in two</em> as an absurdist work regarding black queer men living with HIV today.</p>\n<p>Three black men in a white room await the audience as they take their seats for <em>one in two</em>.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/12/10/one-in-two-donja-r-love-turns-hiv-statistics-into-stage-warning/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The men soon debate who will perform the central role and decide to leave that choice up to the audience. In this meta-theatrical process, audience applause determines which actor will play the protagonist, while the remaining two performers go through a rock-scissors-paper bit to divide up the character tracks they will enact over the next 85 minutes.</p>\n<p>Love&#8217;s unconventional and seriocomic approach—with its self-conscious, often funny, interactions among the actors and their direct addresses to the audience—enlivens a somewhat familiar story about a young black writer’s struggle in the aftermath of being diagnosed with HIV. Fluently composed in brief scenes, the 85-minute play witnesses the writer grapple with depression and the usually unsupportive people in his life.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes the hurt is a bigger virus than the HIV,” a nurse tells him.</p>\n<p>He drinks to excess. He recklessly hooks up with strangers. He neglects to take his medicine. His downwards spiral appears to be diving towards a fatal ending.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the absurdist nature of the play, <em>one in two</em> neatly avoids just such a bitter ending. Instead it concludes with a direct appeal to the audience to be empathetic and work to end the epidemic. When the audience finally leaves the auditorium, the men remain standing in that white room.</p>\n<p>Their continuing presence when the show is over intimates that life stories typical of this one are likely to keep recurring. And all the while that the play progresses, a row of numbers projected on the rear wall ceaselessly multiplies, racking up the many thousands of individuals who will be infected with HIV.</p>\n<p>While the playwright’s message remains serious, a sly sense of humor often infuses his writing and prevents the proceedings from becoming grim, while director Stevie Walker-Webb’s pacing moves everything along at a quick clip.</p>\n<p>The studied simplicity of Arnulfo Maldonado’s white-on-white setting evokes a dream-like limbo to accommodate the play’s rapid succession of scenes and possibly also comments upon the situation of black people existing in a white America. It is lighted with precision by Cha See.</p>\n<p>Solid acting by Edward Mawere in the leading role (at the performance I attended), deftly supported by versatile performances from Jamyl Dobson and Leland Fowler as everybody else, animates the play considerably. Various bits of apt clothes provided by designer Andy Jean enable the actors to quickly take on and off the identities of their assorted characters. The fact that these actors are prepared to tackle their roles in the play depending upon the audience&#8217;s choice is laudable as well.</p>\n<p>Produced at the Pershing Square Signature Center by The New Group with its customary excellence, <em>one in two</em> is a lively and smartly crafted look at an abiding critical issue that unfortunately needs to be constantly addressed.</p>\n<div><strong><b>one in two opened December 10, 2019, at Signature Center and runs through January 12, 2020.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Among the major holiday attractions currently available in the city, you can see the annual <em>Christmas Spectacular</em> at Radio City Music Hall, a new rendition of <em>A Christmas Carol</em> on Broadway, a revival of <em>Slava’s Snowshow </em>also playing in a Broadway house, the Classical Theatre of Harlem’s <em>A Christmas Carol in Harlem</em>, and the New York City Ballet’s <em>The Nutcracker</em>.</p>\n<p>Arriving later this week at Madison Square Garden is <em>‘Twas the Night Before …</em>, a new spectacle by Cirque du Soleil.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile back on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theatre there is <em>The Illusionists: Magic of the Holidays</em>. Some of you perhaps have attended earlier versions of <em>The Illusionists</em> franchise, which sends out traveling magic shows that feature half a dozen or so performers.</p>\n<p>Other than the production’s décor, which sprinkles snowflakes, candy cane colors, and similar seasonal images among its video projections, and the prerecorded music, which rearranges traditional carols, there’s little else particularly holiday-ish about this <em>Magic of the Holidays</em>.</p>\n<p>But there is magic onstage, of course, or at least six magicians of various kinds performing in this two-act event, and together they conjure up some easygoing entertainment.</p>\n<p>The show is more or less emceed by Paul Dabek, a fast-talking British chap whose snazziest trick involves toast, which he terms a “deck of carbs.” Scarcely magical, but certainly cute to observe, is Dabek’s expertise at creating with his hands and a spotlight a parade of large shadow images of animals.</p>\n<p>Eric Chien, a winner of <em>Asia’s Got Talent</em>, offers remarkable sleight-of-hand feats with coins and playing cards. The close-up details of Chien’s act are captured by a handheld camera operator and simultaneously projected upon a large overhead screen. So, too, are the show’s other acts shown on the screen.</p>\n<p>Dom Chambers, an <em>America’s Got Talent</em> semi-finalist, is a cheerful Australian bro who plucks or pours glasses of beer from unlikely places. Enzo Weyne, a charmer from France, suavely deals in several David Copperfield-type illusions such as the one during which he disappears from one location and instantly materializes in another spot.</p>\n<p>Chris Cox, a lanky Brit who favors a bow-tied geek image, is a mind reader who somehow is able to identify audience members’ professions, birthdays, addresses, and even their most recent meals. If Cox’s high-energy personality soon becomes a bit wearing, his ability to coax responses out of tongue-tied strangers remains admirable.</p>\n<p>An avuncular figure in his frock coats, Kevin James makes several appearances during the show. James’ specialty appears to be flashy variations on slicing people into segments and smoothly reassembling them. In one charming sequence performed in an aisle, however, James fashions a flower from a crumpled piece of paper, which he then levitates with the help of a very young spectator who, magically, takes an actual long-stemmed rose back to her seat.</p>\n<p>Director-choreographer Neil Dorward neatly rolls out this series of acts. The show flatly ends without a bang, and <em>Magic of the Holidays</em> really might benefit from adding a conclusion that would involve all of the artists in some kind of a magical throw down or grand finale. As it is, it&#8217;s a nice enough event for the family crowd, but scarcely an attraction that will create lingering holiday memories.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>The Illusionists opened December 3, 2019, at the Neil Simon Theatre and runs through January 5, 2020.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jagged Little Pill</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the landmark 1995 angsty, angry, no-shits-given Alanis Morissette album, has in 2019 become </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jagged Little Pill</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the angsty, angry Broadway musical that somehow has a sweetly happy ending. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ironic, isn’t it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less ironic: The musical, which opened tonight at the Broadhurst Theatre, is, like the album, surpassingly excellent, if also slightly flawed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes it so good? It’s the ideal exemplar of a certain sort of jukebox musical, one that hangs an artist’s catalogue onto a fictional story, often to laughable result. (See: Everyone from the lovelorn Spring Breakers of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Escape to Margaritaville </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to the wandering cowboy of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ring of Fire</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.) Here, in the hands of Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jagged Little Pill</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fashions a story with characters that are actually compelling: A modern, seemingly all-American, upper-middle-class family, in which all the members have their own problems. A cynical theatergoer, weary of this kind of jukeboxer, might well find himself surprised to be emotionally engaged in the story.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/12/05/jagged-little-pill-alanis-morissette-lavishly-broadway-ized/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★☆<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of that is the power of Morissette’s songs. (She wrote the lyrics; she and Glen Ballard co-wrote the music.) A lot of that is Cody’s book, which not only tells a successful story, but also succeeds at a dialogue level, with witty exchanges and ingratiating self-awareness. (“Ironic,” performed as an English-class writing workshop, is interpolated with know-it-all high schoolers noting its lack of actual irony.) And it is lovingly directed by Diane Paulus (at whose American Repertory Theater it originated), with scenic design by Riccardo Hernández, costumes by Emily Rebholz, lighting by Justin Townsend, and especially seductively shit-kicking choreography from Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui that give the production a smooth, slightly dreamlike air. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But a huge part of its success is the sensational performances from the two young female leads, Lauren Patten and, in her Broadway debut, Celia Rose Gooding. It’s to some degree an ensemble piece, and all the characters’ songs come from the Morissette catalogue (not for nothing is the mom named Mary Jane, like the ninth track on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JLP). </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But these two young women embody where those songs came from; they’re the Alanises, and they get the big anthems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gooding is Frankie, the adopted black daughter of the central family, the Healys. She’s a social justice warrior and a more-or-less closeted bisexual, dating Patten&#8217;s Jo at the play’s start and eventually hooking up with a seemingly nice boy in her class. She wrestles with her family’s privilege and her own blackness; she’s always felt out of place, despite her comfort, in white-bread Connecticut. Patten’s Jo — not Joanne; “I am not a fucking fabric store.” — is a butch lesbian in a religious family. She is even less comfortable in this jock-and-cheerleader world than is Frankie. Her “You Ought To Know,” after she’s been dumped by Frankie, is quite literally a show-stopper.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And just what is that successful jukebox story? Ultimately, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jagged Little Pill </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next to Normal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meets </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Idiot</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — with, this being a story at least in part about today’s teens, a dose of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dear Evan Hansen</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> thrown in for good measure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next to Normal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in that Mary Jane (Elizabeth Stanley) is a mess and trying to hide it (the jagged pill in question is today an opioid); Mary Jane&#8217;s relationship with dad, Steve (Sean Allan Krill), is falling apart; son Nick (Derek Klena) is idealized and perfect (although in this case alive); and Frankie is the mopey, challenging child. (Tony-winning </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next to Normal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> composer Tom Kitt is this show’s orchestrator and arranger.) It’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Idiot</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in that it is a full-tilt reconstruction of the songs, with a grunge-clad chorus always surrounding our present-day principals to remind us of the time and place from which the music came. And it’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dear Evan Hansen</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in that it considers the consequential impact actions taken by high schoolers — especially social-media-enabled high schoolers — can impact the rest of their lives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, the same omnivorousness that allows one to see connections to so many antecedent shows can also result in a plot that seems overstuffed with hot-button issues, a very-special-episode on steroids. It’s impolitic but true: After the expository first act has introduced the keeping-up-appearances pressures of a wealthy suburb, the get-into-Harvard pressure of the same, the unhappy marriage with the workaholic dia, the pill-popping, the secret lesbianism, and the cool-kid peer pressure of high-school parties, when we get to the sexual-assault plotline, well, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dayenu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And when, by the show’s end, all that angst has been wrapped up in a neat bow, everything restored to happy equanimity? Well, that seems a bit much, too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, then again, that’s sort of the point of Alanis, isn’t it? All those emotions she sings about, they’re all a bit too much. We ought to know.</span></p>\n<p><b>Jagged Little Pill opened December 5, 2019, at the Broadhurst Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Alanis Morissette released “Jagged Little Pill,” her third album—the first released outside of her home country Canada—in 1995. It quickly became an international bestseller and, in today’s vernacular, a significant influencer. It’s no wonder that someone had the idea to run it up into a Broadway musical via Diane Paulus’ American Repertory Theater and a Houston try-out.</p>\n<p>Indeed, bursting—as the cliché goes—onto the scene in the 2019-2020 season when David Byrne’s <em>American Utopia </em>is raking it in and <em>Girl from the North Country </em>with a Bob Dylan score is on its way from the Public Theater, <em>Jagged Little Pill </em>is practically a question of what-took-so-long?</p>\n<p>Whatever, here it is, announcing itself with the kind of opening sound convulsion that’s becoming familiar in Great White Way houses where jukebox musicals are the marauding thing, although the above three entries are (only momentarily) lifting the genre into somewhat more sophisticated theatrical climes.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/12/05/jagged-little-pill-everythings-gonna-be-fine-fine-fine/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Don’t fool yourself. <em>Jagged Little Pill </em>is at the accommodating Broadhurst for a lengthy run, thanks to the salivating Morissette fans and also thanks to the ultimate quality of the piece, which has a book by Diablo (Oscar for <em>Juno </em>screenplay) Cody and is directed by Paulus, who made much a few years back of the <em>Pippin </em>revival and the just-about-to-close <em>Waitress </em>transfer from screen to stage.</p>\n<p>The observation the pair made on listening to “Jagged Little Pill” on vinyl, cassette or digitally reproduced is that one of Morissette’s themes—perhaps the most pertinent one—is  free-floating anxiety. (To be sure, many others as well have picked up on the angst rampaging through these pungent lyrics, insistent melodies and Morissette interpretations.)</p>\n<p>Paulus and Cody realized that the loose-limbed and persuasive singer-songwriter sees the world as rife with problems, many (most?) of them further exacerbated by current events. Their more or less shrewd move was to put the powerhouse “Jagged Little Pill” material into the tale of one contemporary family—so contemporary they’re practically on the cusp of tomorrow. They’re the Healy family—mom Mary Jane (Elizabeth Stanley), dad Steve (Sean Allan Krill), son Nick (Derek Klena) and daughter Frankie (Celia Rose Gooding).</p>\n<p>And if you think the choice of Healy for a surname is random, you’ve got another think coming. The Catholic Healys, introduced by Mary Jane reading her latest family Christmas letter, are not so jolly as reported but are actually in deep doo-doo. They need healing fast. Although if they came by it fast, there’d be no musical, and there is one here—with, among their severe problems, an especially provocative hitch that’s tenaciously snatched from recent events.</p>\n<p>The Healys arrive at dysfunction relief slowly and painfully as their individual problems are pursued. Mary Jane, recovering from an automobile accident, is now addicted to painkillers Oxycodone and Fentanyl. (Oh, yes, Cody and Paulus have raided the headlines with a political and social vengeance.) Don’t forget as well that “Mary Jane” is the title of a “Jagged Little Pill” track—and a longtime alternate term for marijuana. While M. J., as her friends know her, plays the perfect mother, she’s been reduced to scoring drugs in back alleys.</p>\n<p>Steve, frustrated by a sexless and otherwise unsatisfactory marriage, spends hours at the office watching porn. Frankie, adopted and black, is unhappy about fitting into a white context while testing her sexuality with BFF and gender-bending Jo (Lauren Patten). Nick, an early acceptance at Harvard, is seemingly copacetic, but he eventually follows the  coming-undone pattern. He figures into the above-mentioned provocative twist, about which a more eye-popping revelation later.</p>\n<p>As the unhealed Healys struggle with their inner demons and each other, they and a singing-dancing-playing-other-parts chorus deliver Morissette’s songs, enhanced by Glen Ballard’s co-written melodies with additional music by Michael Farrell and Guy Sigsworth. Tom Kitt has supervised the album’s leap to the stage, and he’s imaginatively arranged Morissette for solos and groups. (Notably, they all sing the lyrics clearly, where Morissette doesn’t consistently.) Bryan Perri conducts with a firm grip on the melodic verve. The Morrisette “You Learn” title and message goes a long way to explaining all.</p>\n<p>So how is it that Nick gets himself in trouble? He goes to a party with good buddy Andrew (Logan Hart), who gets drunk and assaults unconscious family friend Bella (Kathryn Gallagher). Nick stands by, saying nothing, allowing a he-said-she-said situation to develop with not only a #MeToo resonance but something even more contemporarily potent.</p>\n<p>If you’re reading this and thinking the harrowing plot turn is reminiscent of the Brett Kavanaugh-Supreme Court hearings, you’re thinking exactly what Paulus and Cody want you to think. No denying that—with the Morissette songs as the springboard—there’s everything here but the most up-to-date kitchen sink.</p>\n<p>It could be said—and will be right here and now—that with <em>Jagged Little Pill </em>Paulus and Cody are contriving a bit too much. It could also be said that the excesses are somewhat offset by the stagecraft: Riccardo <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernández&#8217;</span>s set with its high gliding panels on which Lucy Mackinnon aims neatly complimentary projections, Justin Townsend’s lights and Jonathan Deans’ sound, although the often rock-concert decibel level could be modified without artistic loss.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, there’s choreography—lots of it—for which Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui is responsible. He’s working with a gang of supple dancers, among whom are a few who dance the inner feelings of the story’s worried women and execute their work with tense style. Too often, however, Cherkaoui indulges in the busy-busy hands movements that appear to be in vogue now.</p>\n<p>Paulus and Cherkaoui have the six principals on their toes throughout, each of whom is impressively committed to his or her role. While they nail every moment, there is one performance that threatens to dislodge the Broadhurst roof: Lauren Patten giving Morissette’s “You Oughta Know” all the sizzle that a Peter Luger steak used to have.</p>\n<p>As this review winds up, readers may wonder what happens when wayward Andrew gets his hearing in court. It’s not given a final gavel, but the boy does succeed in one aspect: college admission.  For all we know, he’s off to Princeton and thereby on the Supreme Court track. Talk about jagged little pills for audiences to swallow.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Jagged Little Pill </b>opened December 5, 2019, at the Broadhurst Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>One thing about preparing to review <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, you figure you don’t have to worry much about spoilers. Struggling with talking about <em>The Inheritance </em>or <em>Parasite </em>or <em>The Laundromat </em>or <em>The Prince of Providence </em>without giving away key plot points or <em>coups de th</em><em>éâtre</em> becomes most fatiguing. As a result, the act of confronting a universally familiar story—in this instance, wicked Ebenezer Scrooge’s recognition of the true meaning of Christmas—comes as something of a relief.</p>\n<p>Well, ‘old yer ‘orses, guvnor. It turns out that the Old Vic-generated reimagination of this age-old tale, in residence on Broadway for an eight-week holiday stint, includes enough narrative changes and staging surprises that I feel I must walk on eggshells yet again. Two Tony Award winners, writer Jack Thorne (<em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em>) and director Matthew Warchus (<em>God of Carnage</em>), are determined to hold up Scrooge (Campbell Scott) as a mirror to all of us privileged first-worlders, especially the 1 percenters, to reveal the fecklessness of our behavior relative to our expressed values. And if Dickens might be thunderstruck at the Freudian undertones they’ve mined in their mission, I’d bet me last farthing that he’d approve.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/11/20/a-christmas-carol-spooked-by-the-past/\">[<em>Read Michael Sommers’ </em>★★★<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>The beauties of which Scrooge is heedless are made manifest as you enter the Lyceum to hundreds of streetlamps, large and small, up into the rafters as if ready to guide Peter Pan and Wendy. (Hugh Vanstone&#8217;s lighting is inventive throughout, as is Simon Baker’s adventurous sound design.) Top-hatted musicians perform familiar carols—Christopher Nightingale is the composer/arranger; music direction by Michael Gacetta—and cast members hand out clementines and bags of cookies to anyone who wants them. (A good idea, to get the audience all sugared up.) The ensemble storytelling is that remembered from <em>Nicholas Nickleby, </em>assigning bits of rapid-fire narration across the cast. Scenic designer Rob Howell has four doorframes, arranged in a square, which rise from the floor to define Scrooge’s self-imposed office prison, reinforced by floor-to-ceiling chains about the expanse. These, of course, match the chains that deceased partner Marley (Chris Hoch) will drag in from upstage to kick off Scrooge’s This-Is-Your-Life pity party.</p>\n<p>Thorne gets to the ghostly visitations relatively quickly, allotting little time to the mortals who come in vain to seek alms. Scott keeps the role in the family—papa George C. starred in a famous TV film version—but he is a baritone to his father’s gravelly bass, with an approach that is accordingly much more urbane and sinister. This is a <em>reasonable</em> Scrooge, one who efficiently stores his strongboxes in wormholes in the floor (the easier to retrieve and stack them to construct set pieces). His sangfroid, and what he perceives to be self-awareness, mean that he eschews the fussy blustering we associate with the Alastair Sims and Albert Finneys of memory. He does have a persistent sniffle, though I was unsure whether it was unconscious, deliberate, or just unavoidable due to a cold. Anyway, this Scrooge&#8217;s lean, self-satisfied look signals his illusions won’t be easily stripped away.</p>\n<p>That stripping is in the hands of three of the most corporeal spirits who ever haunted a merchant’s bedchamber: Andrea Martin, doing a lovely beneficent Cockney thing as Christmas Past; LaChanze, doing an amusing Caribbean seer thing as Present; and as Future—whoops, can’t reveal who steps in as the third ghost, but all are assuredly <em>there</em>, and end up dressed in Howell&#8217;s ragtag calico which suggests either Dresden dolls or homelessness, you pick. So solid are these “visions” that while there’s a young Scrooge avatar (Dan Piering), Scott himself steps in to reenact his memories of old Fezziwig (Evan Harrington), young love Belle (Sarah Hunt, here made Fezziwig’s daughter), et al.</p>\n<p>What we get in this telling is that Scrooge was victimized from an early age by his father (Hoch)—yes, you’ll think of Fred Trump, or Joe Kennedy maybe—who demanded that young Ebenezer become a world-beater at all costs and scorned any hint of weakness or artistic temperament. Scrooge’s puppets, particularly the green-and-yellow parrot, are usually cut from adaptations, but here Warchus and Thorne make the bird a touching symbol for that sweet part of life Scrooge yearns for but has ruthlessly shut out. A shark in training, he spurns Fezziwig’s offer to wed his daughter and become his heir because he wants a magnificent fortune worthy of her. The first act ends with Ebenezer’s desperate cry “I am a great man!,” which may make you think you’ve arrived at the first interval of <em>The Lehman Trilogy, </em>and the resemblance isn’t inapt. This production refuses to allow us to sit back passively to a comfortable, remote fairy tale about how selfishness cannot forestall goodness once one’s eyes are opened. It rather insists that we lean into our own lives to recognize that embracing a capitalist, consumerist culture, by its very nature, can make us complicit in evil and misrule.</p>\n<p>The kiddies in the Lyceum seats may find the messaging a tad heavy (though they might as well start hearing it now). And I do wish the adaptation had acknowledged that our own Scrooges, our billionaire investment bankers and Internet moguls, tend to donate tons of cash to all sorts of worthy, even progressive enterprises, even as their policies envelop modern-day Cratchits in want. That brand of greedhead might be fortified against even the scariest of ghosts, so allowing Scrooge to content himself with some genuine philanthropy would add another nice jolt to the story.</p>\n<p>The most effective touch by far is the casting of two young actors with cerebral palsy, Sebastian Ortiz (at the performance I caught) and Jai Ram Srinivasan, in alternation as Tiny Tim. It’s no stunt. Tootling along in his little walker to investigate Scrooge’s bounty the next morning—sorry, can’t reveal anything about that either—Ortiz placidly works within his body’s limits with fortitude and grace, more movingly than any ordinarily-abled moppet ever could in that role. His encounters with Scrooge bring tears to Scott’s eyes and to ours: not tears of pity, but of recognition that there are people all around us who merit our help and at the very least, our respect, and yet look how often we deny both.</p>\n<p>The lad gets the final bow, and deservedly so, with audience and cast awash in good feelings and carols performed on bells. But wait! Lest you think you will sail home with a sense that all is now right with Dickens’ world and our own, the play has one final trick up its sleeve. Stagecraft, and the cribbing of a line from a world-famous war movie (no, it’s not “The horror, the horror”), combine to make the point that 180-degree changes of heart are as rare in real life as they are prevalent in pleasant fiction, and that the transformation of Scrooges into Santas may be in the end, as the Bard put it, no more yielding than a dream.</p>\n<p><strong>A Christmas Carol opened November 20, 2019, at the Lyceum Theatre and runs through January 5, 2020.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Tiny Tim dies before your eyes in a new Broadway production of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, which arrived on Wednesday at the Lyceum Theatre for the holiday season.</p>\n<p>Oh, don’t get upset. You know perfectly well that on the final page of the Charles Dickens classic, the reader is informed that Tiny Tim does <strong>NOT</strong> die.</p>\n<p>Still, be advised that the play adapted from it by Jack Thorne throws in a “Christmas Present” scare that sees the frail tyke fatally felled by cold weather on a London street as Tim awaits Bob Cratchit’s long overdue return home from the office, where Scrooge has kept him working late.</p>\n<p>An accusing somebody says to clueless Scrooge, “Are you still unaware of the blood on your hands?”</p>\n<p>So much for a plum pudding version of the 1843 holiday yarn, huh?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/11/20/a-christmas-carol-god-blast-ye-merry-gentlemen/\">[<em>Read Bob Verini&#8217;s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>Thorne, a British writer who in recent seasons has given Manhattan the current <em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child </em>two-parter, the script for the late <em>King Kong</em> musical, and <em>Sunday</em>, a pensive Gen Y comedy staged at Atlantic Theater, evidently strives to make his Dickens adaptation into a grim and cautionary character study of a mean old moneylender who is redeemed by supernatural intervention.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, two of the three holiday spirits are portrayed by the darling likes of Andrea Martin and LaChanze. Still, in spite of their luminescence, Thorne&#8217;s version of <em>A Christmas Carol</em> remains something of a finger-wagging drag: Giddy old Fezziwig is no longer a merchant but an undertaker here. The young Ebenezer is smacked around by his brutal father. Scrooge is guided past shuttered establishments that he has foreclosed. A coffin rolls out as Scrooge witnesses his own funeral.</p>\n<p>One gets the impression that Thorne invents such dreary business simply so his version of <em>A Christmas Carol</em> is somewhat different than the countless other stage adaptations before it. A high moral tone that infuses the play as several characters chide Scrooge for his behavior stiffens the drama considerably.</p>\n<p>Abetted by Hugh Vanstone&#8217;s dramatic lighting, production designer Rob Howell conjures up bleak and stormy visuals. Swirling clouds of smoke often fog up the stage while scores of lanterns suspended overhead from chains ominously flicker. Somber mounds of chains and broken lanterns are heaped around the cruciform deck, suggesting the detritus of extinguished lives.</p>\n<p>Curiously enough, director Matthew Warchus stages this production—which originated at the Old Vic in London—with various gambits seemingly intended to dispel the general gloom of Thorne’s two-act play.</p>\n<p>Although the 15-member company wears dark 1840s clothes, they sufficiently unbend to sing traditional carols and they occasionally romp through dance steps of the period. Even more impressive, everyone adeptly rings out a lovely version of “Silent Night” using hand bells. Throughout the show, an eight-member orchestra performs sonorous musical arrangements crafted by Christopher Nightingale.</p>\n<p>Before the performance begins, actors cheerfully wander up and down the aisles, distributing clementines and little packages of cookies among the audience. Late in the show, as the reformed Scrooge trundles toward the humble abode of the Cratchit family, viewers are asked to pass toward the stage various foodstuffs for their banquet such as actual cauliflowers and prop platters of sweetmeats. This makes for some rather jolly moments, if one enjoys that participatory sort of thing.</p>\n<p>Along with the ever-endearing Andrea Martin and LaChanze (who inexplicably spices her Ghost of Christmas Present with a Caribbean accent), familiar Broadway faces such as Chris Hoch (Marley), Dashiell Eaves (Cratchit), and Evan Harrington (Fezziwig) pop up among the players. Sporting mutton-chop whiskers, a frayed crimson tailcoat, and a freezing hauteur, Campbell Scott offers a relatively subdued performance as Scrooge. One can’t help but wonder whether this excellent actor is spooked by that past <em>Christmas Carol</em> TV film version in which his father, George C. Scott, played the same role.</p>\n<p><strong>A Christmas Carol opened November 20, 2019, at the Lyceum Theatre and runs through January 5, 2020.

Levine, Kyle Soller, and Andrew Burnap in The Inheritance. Photo: Marc Brenner</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Yes, Matthew Lopez’s magnificent <em>The Inheritance</em> is performed in two separate parts, clocking in at over six hours, which is a not inconsequential commitment in time and dollars. But after no more than 20 minutes, you are likely to lean back contentedly in your seat, <em>eager</em> to spend six hours with Lopez, director Stephen Daldry, and their impressive ensemble of (mostly) young men.</p>\n<p>That “(mostly) young men” is, indeed, the point. <em>The Inheritance</em> has, since its initial performance at the Young Vic in March 2018, been repeatedly compared to <em>Angels in America</em>, Tony Kushner’s two-part masterpiece from 1991-93. The plays are comparable in terms of scope, length, excellence, and the subject matter at its base, which is the effects of AIDS on a group of New Yorkers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/11/17/the-inheritance-gay-life-in-america-then-and-now/\">[<em>Read Michael Sommers’ </em>★★★★☆<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>The difference is that so many of the generation Kushner was writing about yesterday, in <em>Angels</em>, did not survive to become the middle age generation of today. One of the peaks of the play comes when a young firebrand attacks conservative industrialist Henry Wilcox (John Benjamin Hickey) and “men your age” for standing on the sidelines in the present-day fight for equality. “There <em>are</em> no gay men my age,” Wilcox barks back. “Men my age paid for your rights with their lives.”</p>\n<p>Lopez writes of the fight for equality, today (his play begins in 2015 and ends in 2018); Kushner was writing about the fight for life, in the epidemic years of 1985-90. But Lopez purposely links the times and the fights, addressing the notion of inheritance from one generation of men to the next. Several inheritances, actually: social freedom, disease, and even the right of existence over the course of a century.</p>\n<p>It is this last which enhances <em>The Inheritance</em> and lifts it to something extra-ordinary and positively Stoppardian. Lopez has built upon the notion—or, apparently, was inspired by the notion—of building his story of social change and inheritance on E.M. Forster’s 1910 novel <em>Howards End</em>. Transplanted a century, and from England to New York State, yes; and with a virtually all-male dramatis personae.</p>\n<p>But industrialist Wilcox remains central to the tale, as well as the ethereal Mrs. Wilcox now in the person of Walter Poole (Paul Hilton). Sisters Margaret and Helen Schlegel become nearly penniless lovers Eric Glass (Kyle Soller) and Toby Darling (Andrew Burnap), facing eviction in a majestic rent-controlled Upper West Side aerie. The New York domiciles of Eric and Henry correspond with Forster&#8217;s London flats, while the two country manor houses are identical, complete with the illness-healing pig’s teeth in the tree bark.</p>\n<p>Lopez is not interested in a mere literary trick, though; and audience familiarity with the novel or its celebrated 1992 film version is not required. The playwright makes a central character of displaced novelist Forster, famously a closeted gay man whose other books include the classic <em>A Room with a View</em>. Forster directly followed <em>Howards End</em> with <em>Maurice</em>, a 1914 novel so uncompromising that he forbid its publication until after his death in 1970 (at the age of 91).</p>\n<p>Forster’s participation as something of a guide to aspiring novelist Leo (Samuel H. Levine) allows us to see the present not only through the lens of the Stonewall generation but through Forster’s 19th century eyes as well, accentuating the “inheritance” that he (and his secretive society) passed on to the present day.</p>\n<p>The novelist’s presence—and his hidden life, which made him such a keen observer of pre-Great War English society as both insider and outsider—is lucidly explained and adds to the emotional pull of <em>The Inheritance</em>. Let us add that while the play premiered at the Young Vic in London, Lopez is a Floridian of Puerto Rican descent. He won an Obie Award for his 2011 drama <em>The Whipping Man</em> (at Manhattan Theatre Club), and made his last local appearance in 2018 with the extremely funny and curiously heart-warming <em>Legend of Georgia McBride</em> (at MCC). Neither of which suggest the overwhelming power of his new play.</p>\n<p>There are no less than six astonishing performances on display. Let’s qualify that; the entire 14-person cast seems to contribute cracklingly vibrant moments when called upon. Leading the group are three young American actors. Levine, who spends most of his stage time not as the aspiring writer Leo—who, in the course of the evening, “writes” the novel-within-the-play—but as Adam, an idealized and privileged version of Leo (and perhaps Lopez himself); Soller, as the present-day stand-in for Forster’s heroine Margaret; and Burnap, as the latter’s wildly uncontrollable partner who plays a central role until he literally burns out.</p>\n<p>Levine is stunning. There are a handful of moments across the six hours where Adam seems to drop his guard and reveal a frighteningly real inner self. It is not uncommon for an accomplished actor to play disparate roles, of course; but in these cases, it seems not to be the actor but <em>the character</em> making these lightning transitions. Soller plays the straight man (figuratively) throughout the evening, with increasing strength as the story takes its unexpected turns. Burnap, meanwhile, threatens to consume the entire piece as the self-invented playwright-within-the-novel with his own personal, and shattering, inheritance.</p>\n<p>English actor Hilton offers a special and spectral presence as the ghostly Walter and the uncomfortable time-traveler Forster. (The other four principal men in the London cast where imported from the United States, a sign of the artistically fruitful present-day cooperation of British and American Actors’ Equity.) It is no surprise to find that stage veteran Hickey—a Tony winner for <em>The Normal Heart</em>—thoroughly commands the stage in the somewhat smaller but no less important role of Wilcox. Also offering a galvanic performance is Lois Smith, who only comes on in the final act of Part Two as the dedicated caretaker of Howards End. Or, rather, of Walter’s House in Upstate New York. Smith, who last week turned 89, is the only one of the major players who did not appear in the London production, where the role was played by Vanessa Redgrave.</p>\n<p>One can’t overestimate the vision of director Daldry (of <em>An Inspector Calls</em>, <em>Billy Elliot</em>, and <em>The Jungle</em>). <em>The Inheritance</em> is a massive undertaking, and he has staged it with focus, clarity, and welcome touches of humor. He is abetted by British designer Bob Crowley, whose usually massive and mostly brilliant designs have won him seven Tony Awards thus far. For <em>The Inheritance</em>, he has come up with what is basically a bare stage with an enormous rectangular stage lift in its midsection. (Much of the action takes place with cast members figuratively “sitting around a table,” which Daldry and Crowley contrive masterfully.) There are dynamic surprises along the way, not to mention a breathtaking—and altogether heart-stopping—<em>coup de théâtre</em> at the end of Part One which left a large swath of the audience thoroughly devastated and literally in need of a break before Part Two.</p>\n<p>Theatergoers fortunate enough to have seen the original cast in the original productions of such two-part dramas as <em>Nicholas Nickleby</em> and <em>Angels in America</em> will likely tell you that those experiences remain unforgettable. <em>The Inheritance</em> hereby joins that list. Pure theatrical magnificence.</p>\n<p><strong>The Inheritance opened November 17, 2019, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre and runs through March 15, 2020.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Life is short, and some plays are long—and such is <em>The Inheritance</em>, a six-plus-hour-long epic regarding gay life in America, then and now, crafted as two full-length dramas that opened tonight at the Barrymore.</p>\n<p>A vivid, highly ambitious work by Matthew Lopez, a rising American playwright, <em>The Inheritance</em> premiered to acclaim in London last year. Yet do not expect to see the gay <em>Cavalcade</em> here, but rather an entertaining, if exceedingly overlong, study in cultural change and the power of human compassion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/11/17/the-inheritance-a-magnificent-look-at-the-post-angels-in-america-world/\">[<em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em>]</a></p>\n<p>Five actors from the original company recreate their roles in this Broadway production as the leading figures among an excellent 14-member ensemble nimbly directed by Stephen Daldry. He wisely stages Lopez’s weighty work with a deceptively light hand that swiftly delivers its often engrossing story.</p>\n<p><em>The Inheritance</em> is inspired by <em>Howards End</em>, a 1910 English novel about two sisters in London whose lives go different ways during the Edwardian era. Lopez develops his two-part drama so that viewers need not be familiar with <em>Howards End </em>or its 1992 film version to appreciate <em>The Inheritance</em>.</p>\n<p>Anyone conversant with the original, however, will be able to see how Lopez cleverly retains portions of its plot even as he updates his Americanized story to the years 2015-2018. Supplementing these times are flashbacks to the closing decades of the 20th century.</p>\n<p>In Lopez’s modern-day situation, the sisters are reinvented as a 30-something gay couple. The kindly Eric (Kyle Soller) and tempestuous Toby (Andrew Burnap) are smart New Yorkers whose longtime relationship goes bust and diverts them along contrasting paths.</p>\n<p>Eric gets emotionally involved with an older man, Henry (John Benjamin Hickey), a cool billionaire whose neoconservative values ignites conflicts with Eric and his liberal friends. Toby writes a smash Broadway play, but his thwarted hots for Adam (Samuel H. Levine), his twinkling leading man, drives him instead to Leo (Levine again), a pensive sex worker with a troubled past.</p>\n<p>Key to the story is a venerable country house in upstate New York that later is revealed to have been a refuge for a generation of men dying in the AIDS nightmare.</p>\n<p>Nearly all of the drama’s multiple characters are gay men, notably the magical figure of E.M. Forster (1879-1970), the author of <em>Howards End</em>.  A gray-suited <em>Goodbye Mister Chips</em> sort of kindly English don, Forster (Paul Hilton) annotates his story to the others who depict his characters. Later they question Forster harshly about why he lived a closeted existence.</p>\n<p>The play has been composed by Lopez—brilliantly in some places—as a fluent blend of realistic dialogue, third person narration, direct address, and easy chitchat. The ensemble, barefooted and dressed casually, collectively portray the story’s principal and many incidental characters atop a blond wooden deck cunningly designed by Bob Crowley that subtly shifts its shape to evoke numerous spots from a swimming pool on Fire Island to a swank townhouse in the West Village.</p>\n<p>A thoughtful, at times even insightful, study in the changing manners and mindsets of Eastern Seaboard-type gay male culture over the last 40 years, <em>The Inheritance</em> ultimately proves to be more or less a high-grade soap opera.</p>\n<p>Expect some steamy scenes, explosive face-offs, confessional monologues, considerable humor, and snappy aphorisms such as “To fall in love is to make an appointment with heartbreak.” Among the play’s <em>Queer as Folk</em>-style doings, a Sunday brunch gathering goes terribly sour, a sex party turns nasty, a wedding gets crashed, and later so does a car, fatally. There’s even a dose of backstage intrigue as the troublesome Toby is ejected from rehearsals of his own show.</p>\n<p>If some of <em>The Inheritance</em> is surprisingly glib, it nevertheless remains a mostly well-written and observant work that successfully studies contrasts in generational attitudes—and socio-political awareness—even as it features several poignant sequences. The concluding scene of the first play, which cannot be described here but is the finest episode in the entire production, is genuinely moving through the breathtaking simplicity of its evocation of a lost generation.</p>\n<p>A great director, Daldry strategically employs top of the line designers to realize the production with effectively minimalist visuals. Paul Englishby’s original musical further enhances the drama. But it is the keen acting—confident, animated, expressive—that makes the production such a vital experience. In addition to the actors previously cited, all of whom deliver fine portrayals of their characters, a luminous Lois Smith arrives late in the second play’s action to sweeten an increasingly bitter storyline.</p>\n<p>Although the drama’s two-part length is questionable, the fluency of Lopez’s skillful writing, the scope of his intergenerational narrative, and the immediacy of Daldry’s sterling staging of its production make <em>The Inheritance</em> an important event of the Broadway season.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>The Inheritance opened November 17, 2019, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre and runs through March 15, 2020.

Photo: Vladimir Mishukov</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If you’re a kid or the kid in you is still hyperactive, you’re likely to fall in love (again?) this holiday season with <em>Slava’s Snowshow</em>, which returns to New York City for the first time since 2008. That’s after the Moscow-created entertainment took the town by (snow)storm in 2004.</p>\n<p>Slava Polunin—who bills himself as scenographer, meaning he takes care of sets, costumes, and so on—heads a colorful production boasting a squad of clowns who caper in either lumpy and bulky sunshine outfits or in green get-ups with fake-fur-lined gray hats the earflaps of which stick out like airplane wings.</p>\n<p>Throughout, the motley crew, drawn performance to performance from a dozen raring-to-go players, contend mightily with the on-stage wintry weather or rise above it in varying degrees of merriment or melancholy. They cavort thusly without ever uttering a single word and while goofy music plays almost nonstop.</p>\n<p>The cast members currently supporting Slava’s high-and-low-jinx are: Artem Zhimo, Robert Saralp, Vanya Polunin, Georgiy Deliyev, Aelita West, Bradford West, Alexandre Frish, Nikolai Terentiev, Francesco Bifano, Spencer Chandler, and Elena Ushakova. At the performance I saw the two yellow clowns were Slava Polunin and Zhimo, and the main green clown was Saralp. My educated guess is that things are topping no matter the contingent on any given night.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the clowns egg each other on. Sometimes they are in accord. Sometimes they look to compete. Sometimes they just stand about to be noticed. Sometimes, acting alone or in unison, they engage the audience in just about any manner imaginable. Oh, yes, wary patrons, <em>Slava’s Snowshow </em>is consistently immersive—whether you like it or no. And they don’t wait for you to come to them. They come to you. One neat trick is dropping thousands of paper shards on the audience. Once the multiplying snowflake wannabes are strewn everywhere by a heavy wind. Make that wind machine. (Woe betide the Stephen Sondheim Theatre cleanup staff.)</p>\n<p>Sometimes gauzy sheets are pulled over patrons’ heads as they remain seated and getting a kick out of the conceit—or just tolerating the inconvenience. To begin the second act (it’s a two-hour, one-intermission snow show) the clowns in protruding-wing hats clamber over the audience seats. For extra added fun some of them swing uncapped bottles of water. Done with that, they line up to lift their arms and drop them. It’s their encouragement for all spectators to ooh, aah, and aww, and then stop. N.b.: Audience members are not monitored for compliance.</p>\n<p>For part of the remaining second act, the sad-eyed Slava does things like trying to communicate with who-knows-who over a pair of big fat telephones (one yellow, one red) with loud, raspy dials that the sound designer (Slava?) supplies. Slava’s solo clown’s segments during this stretch are interrupted once by the second clown in yellow. He’s seated on a chair balancing precariously at an angle. The chair sits alongside a table balancing at the same angle. And guess what!</p>\n<p>So it goes to the delight of many, certainly to the delight of most of the children present. (<em>Slava’s Snowshow </em>is recommended for age 8 and above.) But as suggested at the top of this review, the ideal patron is either 8, 7, 6, or 5, or is an adult whose inner child still wants to play with the hastily unwrapped toys the young’uns have already abandoned on Christmas morning.</p>\n<p>Sorry to say it looks as if I’m not one of the latter group. My 2004 and 2008 recollections—general rather than specific—run to the four-star or even five-star ranking. Evidently, however, the kid in me is now in his 20s and not so starry-eyed. He’s snowed by some of Polunin’s whimsical notions but finds others less enthralling than they are sledding towards the tedious.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, <em>Slava’s Snowshow </em>is a show you don’t forget so easily, if only because of the square and rectangular paper snowflakes that cling to your head and your clothes way past the time you’ve skipped out of the theater and reached home. I found one unmelted snowflake on my living room floor the next morning.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Slava&#8217;s Snowshow</em> opened Nov. 14, 2019, and runs through Jan. 5, 2020, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre.

Photo: MSG</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The annual <em>Christmas Spectacular</em> has danced into Radio City Music Hall for another holiday season, and it’s more or less—perhaps just a tad less—the same show that many people love to visit year in and year out.</p>\n<p>Me, I first experienced this one-of-a-kind holiday attraction when I was a kid. Witnessing the vintage sequences of the <em>Christmas Spectacular</em> always turns me back into a 6-year-old.</p>\n<p>Probably a similar phenomenon happens to adults in the audience who were taken to the event by their parents or grandparents way back whenever. The family memories of the Music Hall show that so many tristate spectators share are what makes the <em>Christmas Spectacular</em> a genuine tradition.</p>\n<p>The world may be a mess and our nation at daggers over practically everything these days, but somehow The Rockettes cheerfully and precisely keep on kicking away.</p>\n<p>The troupe remains in typically fine form this year, which is a good thing, too, since The Rockettes are the heart and soul of the event, to say nothing of its evidently tireless legs.</p>\n<p>Sure, the jolly figure of Santa Claus makes several appearances, most notably in the 3-D movie short during which he flies over and through Manhattan. An adorable “Nutcracker” salute is performed by dancers costumed as various toy bears. And, of course, a perennial feature on the program is the (tactfully Christian) “Living Nativity” pageant with its herds of livestock and Biblical characters dressed up like extras in a Cecil B. DeMille epic.</p>\n<p>Otherwise this event remains all about The Rockettes.</p>\n<p>This edition gives the troupers nothing new to perform. Sporting illuminated antlers, they hoof away with Santa’s sleigh. They clatter about in an intricately choreographed “Twelve Days of Christmas.” They zoom around on a Grey Line double-decker bus tour of the city. Disguised in Santa drag, they romp through a bell-ringing exercise. Goofily dolled up as rag dolls, they tap all over Santa’s workshop.</p>\n<p>Most of these numbers conclude with hitch or scissors-style kick lines, and the variations on this historic pattern that the dancers demonstrate is worth noting.</p>\n<p>Speaking of historic, The Rockettes again march about in “The Parade of Wooden Soldiers,” a replication of a number performed in the very first Music Hall holiday show in 1933. Dressed in white and tomato red uniforms crowned by plumed shakos—designed by Vincente Minnelli back in his pre-Hollywood days—The Rockettes sharply step through Russell Markert’s complex military drill before ending in a mass toppling over.</p>\n<p>Director-choreographer Julie Branam neatly and quickly paces The Rockettes and the ensemble in this intermission-free series of clever dance works that were mostly originally choreographed by others. Several sequences, notably “The Nutcracker,” appear to be trimmed back in length since previous editions.</p>\n<p>Conversely, the Music Hall now strategically makes striking use of vast, moving projections splashed all over the enormous auditorium that extend practically every sequence into awesome proportions. Lighting effects and the sporadic appearance of the Music Hall orchestra enhance the performances.</p>\n<p>Smarties have long dismissed the Radio City Christmas shows as traditional white-bread kitsch on legs, and to be sure the event makes scant reference to diverse cultures. But, truly living up to its name, the <em>Christmas Spectacular</em> offers family audiences something familiar and yet vastly entertaining, done with precision and pizzazz, smoothly presented in a beautiful Art Moderne theater that’s been all decked out for the holidays. There’s nothing else like it on Earth.</p>\n<div><strong>Christmas Spectacular opened November 13, 2019, at Radio City Music Hall and runs through January 5, 2020.

Photo: Bruce Glikas</figcaption></figure>\n<p>There are many things I love about Kristin Chenoweth—who won audience’s hearts as, for starters, the pint-size philosopher Sally in <em>You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown</em> and Broadway’s original bubblicious Glinda in <em>Wicked</em>—but perhaps chief among them is her commitment to young artists.</p>\n<p>She (jokingly) calls herself a diva—and when you’ve won a Tony (<em>Charlie Brown</em>) and an Emmy (for TV’s short-lived but beloved <em>Pushing Daisies</em>) and recorded with the likes of Ariana Grande, Reba McEntire, and Dolly Parton (on her current album, <em>For the Girls</em>) you certainly have the right to. But her concerts, such as the current <em>Kristin Chenoweth: For the Girls</em> at Broadway’s Nederlander Theatre, are by no means one-woman shows. In <em>For the Girls</em>, she’s got two singers up there with her, Crystal Monee Hall and Marissa Rosen, and they’re doing much more than ooh-ing and ahh-ing; Hall even cowrote the show’s last song, “Reasons for Hope,” with Chenoweth’s longtime musical director, the dynamite Mary-Mitchell Campbell (or “MMC,” as KC calls her).</p>\n<p>And there is always at least one guest: During the run of <em>For the Girls</em>, Chenoweth is bringing in a Glinda at every show. But it’s not only for a quick verse of “Popular.” The night I attended, the star left for a costume change and turned the stage over to Brittney Johnson, who sang “As If We Never Said Goodbye”—with the Barbra Streisand lyric revisions, FYI. Later, the opera-trained Chenoweth brought out badass mezzo Jamie Barton and gave the star of the Met’s recent <em>Orfeo ed Euridice</em> (she played Orfeo) her Broadway debut: Barton wowed the crowd with “Alto’s Lament”—“Please give me a chance to sing melody/ Give me a crack at the tune”—by Zina Goldrich and Marcy Heisler (they also wrote “Taylor, the Latte Boy,” a Chenoweth fan fave). After she bowed to Barton, Chenoweth ordered her offstage and considered stabbing her, <em>Psycho</em>-style, with a microphone. All in good fun, of course.</p>\n<p>Ostensibly, <em>For the Girls</em> is a showcase for Chenoweth’s new album of the same title, and you’ll hear plenty of those songs: Lesley Gore’s girl-power anthem “You Don’t Own Me”; “Desperado,” the Eagles song immortalized by Linda Ronstadt; “The Man That Got Away,” from the Judy Garland version of <em>A Star Is Born</em> (Chenoweth pairs it with “Over the Rainbow” and sings both wearing a pair of sky-high red sequined shoes); the Alan Bergman–Marilyn Bergman–Marvin Hamlisch Oscar winner “The Way We Were,” backed only by Campbell’s wistful piano accompaniment; and “I Will Always Love You,” an ode to the woman Chenoweth calls “my queen,” Dolly Parton. You might have to wait for the encore for that beauty.</p>\n<p>But she doesn’t stick solely to the album lineup. There’s also Trisha Yearwood’s “The Song Remembers When”; the Carpenters’ “Yesterday Once More”; and “How Great Thou Art,” a stunning tribute to another native Oklahoman, fellow soaring soprano Sandi Patti. “If you don’t love Jesus,” Chenoweth said in the introduction, “it’ll be over in four minutes.”</p>\n<p>Between songs, Chenoweth cracked jokes about her love of 7-Eleven (she’s always sipping from one of the chain’s giant plastic cups), her upcoming Christmas movies for Netflix and the Hallmark Channel (she dubbed them “Naughty” and “Nice”), and even her skirt length. “I’m sorry, sir,” she said to a gentleman in the front row. “Or—you’re welcome!” She even gave fans a chance to snap photos at the top of the show. You’re welcome!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Kristin Chenoweth: For the Girls </em>opened Nov. 8, 2019, and runs through Nov. 17 at the Nederlander Theatre.

Photo: Manuel Harlan</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is only one Tina Turner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s really two statements in one. First: There is only one </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tina Turner</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It’s a comment on the inimitable talent and singular power of the beloved singer, dancer, and survivor. She’s an icon, and she should be. But also: There is only </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Tina Turner. It’s notable that unlike in the recent </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cher Show</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which each required three actresses to portray their titular divas, the new </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tina: The Tina Turner Musical</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stars just one Turner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And Adrienne Warren, as it turns out, needs no assistance.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/11/07/tina-trying-too-hard-to-catch-fire/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tina</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which opened tonight at the Lunt-Fontanne, is, surprisingly, pretty good. Warren, its star, is spectacular. She sings beautifully and she dances ecstatically. She nails that raspy, growling, wide-vowelled Tina voice. (There is, one notices, something a little Cher-y about Tina&#8217;s drawl.) And she does the whole thing with a focused ferocity that demonstrates how little Anna Mae Bullock could grow up to a legend. Warren’s “River Deep—Mountain High,” late in Act One, makes you stop, take notice, and settle in for whatever else she has to offer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tina’s story, if you don’t know it: Born to poor sharecroppers in Tennessee, abandoned by her parents, she was married off to the singer Ike Turner, who gave her a new name and a career and abused her, both emotionally and physically. When she finally found the courage to walk away, she was left with almost nothing—until the global success of her 1984 solo album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Private Dancer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That’s when she became a star. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a triumphant tale that comes pre-packaged with a catalogue of beloved hits, and as such is obvious grist for a biomusical. But, then, such would also seem to be true of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summer </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cher …</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ain’t Too Proud </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Your Feet</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motown The Musical</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a million others. It’s an ever-replenished genre, fed by memories of the dollar signs that emerged from the August Wilson for the dozen years </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jersey Boys</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> played there. Most of the recent crop have not been very good. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tina </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is. How did that happen?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warren is a big part of that. She played the role in London, too, where the show originated and where she won raves. She’s a gifted performer and a dynamite Turner. But that’s not all of it: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cher</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had Stephanie J. Block, who won a Tony; </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had LaChanze. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tina</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has a book by a serious and respected playwright, Katori Hall. But that’s not it, either: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s was by Rick Elice, who previously scripted </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jersey Boys</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tina </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is competently staged (by Phyllida Lloyd—of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mamma Mia,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of all things!), well-acted, and features fun choreography (by Anthony Van Laast) inspired by the Ikette originals. But parts of that are true for all those recent so-so jukebox shows: those Mackie costumes for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cher</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that Sergio Trujillo take on the classic Temps moves for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ain’t Too Proud</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an unmatchable score for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motown</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tina</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> works, I think, exactly because it has all that, and it’s content with what it has. Turner’s story is ultimately a simple and classic one, and it’s told simply but dramatically. No three-perspective Cubism, no direct-address narration. It also tells the truth, more or less. It’s an occupational hazard of life-rights stories that the protagonists (or their estates) are also producers. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motown</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> didn&#8217;t work, for example, because Berry Gordy’s saccharine take on his own story could never be compelling. Tina Turner is a producer of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tina</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but the story appears to pull no—well, let’s say it doesn’t hide the bad parts. Horror after horror befalls our immensely talented heroine, and we watch, engrossed, as she surmounts them all. The bumpin’ score doesn’t hurt, either.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not to say that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tina </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is perfect. Hall’s script resorts to frequent cliches, in dialogue as frequently as in story. (Truth be told, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tina</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> does have its own tripartite late moment, when young Anna Mae, played by an excellent Skye Dakota Turner, and Grandma Georgeanna, Myra Lucretia Taylor, appear just before Tina reaches megastardom to release her from her past.) The costumes are often surprisingly shapeless; bathrobes and sweatsuits, I suppose, make for easy quick-changes into those sparkly concert minis underneath. And as much as I enjoyed the choreography—those iconic nice-girl-group-gets-down-and-dirty backup moves—I’d have loved to know more about how they developed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite those complaints, the show works. Turner had—has!—an amazing talent and a tough life. She earned her success. Powered by Warren’s hard-charging performance, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tina</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> makes us feel that. It’s joyous. And when during the bows and encore Warren pulls out Turner, the young Anna Mae actress, for her own verse of “Proud Mary”—and when the kid </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kills it</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—you can’t help but recognize there’s something pretty magical going on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s nice—and rough.</span></p>\n<p><strong><b>Tina </b>opened November 7, 2019, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre.

Photo: Manuel Harlan</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It&#8217;s impossible not to be inspired by the story of Anna Mae Bullock, a girl who suffered abandonment to become a woman who endured abuse to emerge as one of the 20th century&#8217;s most prominent music figures and survivors, as one Tina Turner. It was only a matter of time before this rock and soul goddess got her own jukebox hagiography; and given the U.K.&#8217;s fondness for such things, and Turner&#8217;s fondness for Europe in general—she currently lives in Switzerland, with her German husband—it seems fitting that the show should have premiered in London, then spawned another production in Hamburg.</p>\n<p>Now <em>Tina: The Tina Turner Musical</em> arrives on Broadway, with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Even by jukebox standards, <em>Tina </em>is a garish spectacle, with overwrought performances—under the direction of Phyllida Lloyd, whose stage successes here and abroad range from <em>Mamma Mia!</em> to an all-female <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em>—and banal dialogue, by Katori Hall (best known for the Martin Luther King, Jr.-inspired fantasia <em>The Mountaintop</em>) with Frank Ketelaar and Kees Prins. It&#8217;s also an undeniable crowd-pleaser, which at the preview I attended drew an extended standing ovation, with nary a person seated from my vantage point in the orchestra section.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/11/07/tina-better-than-all-the-rest-of-the-jukebox-musicals/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Were the audience members embracing the theatrical pyrotechnics (which extend to the design, particularly Jeff Sugg’s psychedelic lighting) and emotional clichés being tossed at them, I wondered, or cheering at least in part for Turner herself? I suspect it was a little of both—though frankly, I found leading lady Adrienne Warren, a dynamic singer and actress who won an Olivier Award for originating the role of Turner in London, less than convincing as a stand-in.</p>\n<p>Unlike Jessie Mueller in <em>Beautiful: The Carole King Musical</em> or Stephanie J. Block in <em>The Cher Show</em>, to cite a pair of recent Tony winners, Warren seems reluctant to put her own virtuosity aside in service of capturing the distinctive quirks of a popular voice. To the contrary, Warren&#8217;s singing here is a bombastic caricature of Turner&#8217;s (not the subtlest of singers, admittedly); the actress emphasizes her subject&#8217;s distinctive rasp and growl while ramping up her use of vibrato and melisma, so that her readings of hits from &#8220;River Deep—Mountain High&#8221; to &#8220;We Don&#8217;t Need Another Hero&#8221; suggest an overzealous contestant on &#8220;American Idol&#8221; or &#8220;The Voice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If Warren&#8217;s acting is a bit more nuanced, it&#8217;s likely not because of Lloyd&#8217;s guidance, judging by the other performances here. Several of the principals cast as Turner&#8217;s female relatives in rural Tennessee, and the women she meets after moving to St. Louis and beginning to sing with Ike Turner, speak with accents so exaggerated that I sometimes had trouble making out what they were saying. Given the obviousness of the dialogue, that wasn&#8217;t always a bad thing. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let that man make you his puppet,&#8221; the father of Tina&#8217;s first child (musician Raymond Hill, pleasantly played by Gerald Caesar) tells her about their bandleader and her soon-to-be husband, Ike Turner. &#8220;Why do you stay? It&#8217;s not too late to fix this mistake,&#8221; urges Ike&#8217;s (and later Tina&#8217;s) manager Rhonda, played with curious woodenness by Jessica Rush.</p>\n<p>The actor cast as Ike, Daniel J. Watts, has little opportunity to give us a sense of what drew Tina in before he starts to slap her around—just as Anna Mae&#8217;s dad did her mother, portrayed here (by a forceful Dawnn Lewis) as a bitter, withholding woman who shows signs early on of envying her gifted daughter. Australian manager/producer Roger Davies and German record company executive Erwin Bach (Turner&#8217;s current spouse) are the nice guys who help Tina find herself. &#8220;Are you staying in London long? Forever maybe?!(sic)&#8221; Erwin (a puppyish Ross Lekites) asks, seconds after meeting her.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s Roger—played by Charlie Franklin as a sort of happy-clown antidote to Simon Cowell—who matches a reluctant Turner to the song that will relaunch her career, &#8220;What&#8217;s Love Got To Do With It?&#8221; The opening bars of that comeback hit are teased several times, as if to prepare the audience for the unveiling of the Holy Grail, before Warren&#8217;s Turner digs in and belts it out to the rafters. <em>Tina</em>&#8216;s score also features songs stretching back to her early days with Ike, as well as tunes made famous by other artists that she has covered, from the Al Green classic &#8220;Let&#8217;s Stay Together&#8221; to &#8220;Disco Inferno.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Having been lucky enough to catch Tina Turner in concert before she essentially retired from touring, I can report that <em>Tina</em>, for all its huffing and puffing, doesn&#8217;t capture the force of nature she was in live performance. That&#8217;s not a criticism of Warren; it&#8217;s just a reminder that a better, truer and generally less expensive way to appreciate our favorite artists is through their own work. Though if <em>Tina</em> were to lead a few uninitiated audience members to Turner&#8217;s, I&#8217;d be the first to stand up and cheer.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Tina </b>opened November 7, 2019, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Contemporary pop music generally has been a muted soundtrack in my life, so I am scarcely expert regarding the songwriter-performer who lends his name to <em>David Byrne&#8217;s American Utopia, </em>which opened on Sunday for a Broadway sojourn through mid-January.</p>\n<p>The only exception to such ignorance is my fanboy admiration for <em>Here Lies Love</em>, Byrne’s lush and inventive off-Broadway musical about Imelda Marcos that incarnated her life and times as glitzy doings in a disco club. How producers have not yet been able to secure a suitable venue to give <em>Here Lies Love</em> an extended run in New York is baffling.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Hudson Theatre, among the nicest and most comfortable of Broadway houses, hosts <em>American Utopia</em>, an excellent musical event that Byrne has devised from his 2018 studio recording.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/10/20/american-utopia-in-times-of-trouble-bringing-on-the-funk/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Half a dozen <em>American Utopia</em> selections as well as several of Byrne’s greatest hits are among the 20-plus numbers staged as an extremely stylish 100 minute-long concert.</p>\n<p>Striking minimalist looks enhance the entertainment. Byrne and 11 musicians are all barefoot and identically dressed in pale gray suits. As they play their instruments—which are worn on harnesses—everyone energetically dances and travels around the stage in various choreographed patterns playfully devised by Annie-B Parson to the rhythms of the songs.</p>\n<p>Their often angular and repetitive moves reflect the hypnotic quality of Byrne’s music.</p>\n<p>Looking trim and elegant, Byrne introduces the numbers with brief, germane anecdotes. Often flanked by snazzy dancer-vocalists Tendayi Kuumba and Chris Giarmo, Byrne masterfully incants the songs in his declamatory style amid warm, close-harmony singing from the company. Their fine musicianship blends complex percussion/keyboard instrumentals with sharp guitar and bass lines. And they do it all while in nearly ceaseless motion around the stage.</p>\n<p>Beginning with “Here” and concluding with “Road to Nowhere,” Byrne’s song stack presents existential studies in perceptions, connections, and unusual points of view concerning daily life.</p>\n<p>Not all of them being human. Part of “Everyday is a Miracle” wonders about heaven from a chicken’s perspective. “Bullet” traces a projectile’s path through a man’s body. And then of course, the classic “Once in a Lifetime,” with its “same as it ever was” chant, is a how-did-I-get-here study in midlife crisis. Byrne&#8217;s powerful cover rendition of Janelle Monae&#8217;s &#8220;Hell You Talmabout,&#8221; a protest song that calls out the names of victims of racial violence, becomes a transcendent expression for a better world.</p>\n<p>Future ticket-buyers take note that I was seated six rows back from the stage and experienced trouble comprehending lyrics due to dense sound mixing and nearby equipment placement. That’s a pity, since the wordplay is so crucial to appreciating Byrne’s work. The seating locations further back in the house, or even upstairs, likely offer a better view of Parson’s quirky choreography, too.</p>\n<p>Alex Timbers, the director of spectacles such as <em>Moulin Rouge</em>, is billed as production consultant, so likely his input contributes to this concert’s handsome visuals. The ultra-cool surroundings involve thin beaded chains that create a silvery screen effect, dramatically lit by Rob Sinclair with looming shadows and various colors.</p>\n<p>Of course everything blazes into fiery oranges and reds for that lusty “Burning Down the House.” By this time, later in the concert, many spectators are standing up and singing along.</p>\n<p>A choice gallery of thoughtful songs given a classy staging and headlined by a charismatic star, the exhilarating <em>American Utopia</em> will please David Byrne fans and probably win him plenty of new ones.</p>\n<p><strong>American Utopia opened October 20, 2019, at the Hudson Theatre and runs through February 16, 2020.

Photo: Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Theatergoers who don’t mind leaning forward in their seats and paying rapt attention to ideas, thoughts, and intricately sculpted language are in for a magical evening at Studio 54, where Adam Rapp’s <em>The Sound Inside</em> is holding the stage.</p>\n<p>The play starts and ends with Mary Louise Parker delivering something of an inner monologue, neither loud nor flashy but piercingly human. Parker, who has been gracing the local boards for 30 years now, is one of those actors of whom it can be said that when they are good—as with unforgettable performances in <em>How I Learned to Drive</em> and <em>Proof</em>—they are very good. Here, Parker is very good indeed.</p>\n<p>The highly accomplished veteran is accompanied by an astonishing newcomer by the name of Will Hochman, who turns out to be a perfect match. (You might have caught him downtown, briefly, in the 2016 CSC adaptation of <em>Dead Poet’s Society</em>.) Parker has far more to do and say throughout the evening, but no matter; Hochman is central to the piece, and the pair indeed make magic.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/10/17/the-sound-inside-adam-rapps-potent-nod-to-great-literature/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>All of this is courtesy of the text they are given, a marvel of a play that consistently challenges us to listen and wonder and think. Rapp, author of numerous plays and novels, makes an auspicious Broadway debut with <em>The Sound Inside</em>, which originated with this production in July 2018 at the Williamstown Theatre Festival.</p>\n<p>There’s one additional magician on hand: Director David Cromer, who has helmed such diverse fare as the Barrow Street <em>Our Town</em>, the Tony Award-winning <em>Band’s Visit</em>, and more. Cromer works with such a masterful but invisible hand here that you might well gasp when the two actors, in the middle of a discussion, stand and switch sides of a table. Cromer offers further directorial touches—or mere, unobtrusive hints of such—as the brisk 90-minute evening approaches its climax.</p>\n<p>Bella Lee Baird is an English professor at Yale on the far side of 50, with one unsuccessful novel and several short stories to her credit but little more. (She describes herself as “four or five degrees beyond mediocre, the equivalent of a collectible plate mounted to a wall.”) Bella teaches in a vacuum until confronted, one fall day, by Christopher Dunn, an unconventional freshman from Vermont who is every bit as much of a literary introvert as Bella.</p>\n<p>Is Christopher real? Or is the boy—and the novel that he is fitfully writing, with noticeable parallels to Bella’s 20-year-old debut novel—merely a character in a second novel that Bella, suddenly diagnosed with &#8220;a stomach riddled with a constellation of tumors,” is feverishly rushing to finish? Rapp’s writing—and the performances by Parker and Hochman—teases us into a state of pristine unclarity.</p>\n<p>Which leaves us listening so carefully that we almost ration our breathing. Bella’s writerly creed, and her advice to her generally nonresponsive students, is “listen to the sound inside.” And “the sound inside” is, indeed, descriptive of <em>The Sound Inside</em>. Bella is a teacher of communication—that is, English—incapable of any sort of communication with anyone.</p>\n<p>Until the similarly disconnected Christopher comes along. Even then, they don’t communicate through conversation; rather in what seem to be inner (inside) monologues. You’ll note that the small talk—from both of them—is littered with what sounds like novelistic prose. (“I’m essentially a walking Social Security number with a coveted Ivy League professorship and a handful of moth-bitten sweaters,” Bella says casually.) This brings them together, against the world; but they are not actually together. They are overwhelmed by their individual sound inside, and somewhat reassured to find someone with whom they can communicate—or, at least, talk with and at.</p>\n<p>Set designer Alexander Woodward, lighting designer Heather Gilbert, and production designer Aaron Rhyne all contribute mightily to Cromer’s production, often making it seem like we are listening to an interior monologue on a bare stage except when we gradually sense we are not.</p>\n<p>All in all, it&#8217;s a magical evening from Rapp, Cromer, and the altogether mesmerizing Parker and Hochman. Theatergoers who are not averse to listening and thinking should head over to 54th Street to hear <em>The Sound Inside</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>The Sound Inside opened October 17, 2019, at Studio 54 and runs through January 12, 2020.

Photo: Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Saying that Adam Rapp’s <em>The Sound Inside </em>has an unusual meta-literary quality may seem off-putting, but it’s meant to be a compliment, a heartfelt encouragement aimed at anyone eager to attend a play with subtly deep rewards.</p>\n<p>Bella Lee Baird (Mary-Louise Parker) is a Yale creative-writing professor who’s published one novel that was well reviewed almost everywhere but in the <em>New York Times Book Review. </em>Hardly bitter about that response from a “peer” writer-reviewer—as wise novelists are about that sort of thing—she remains apparently inspirational to her students and certainly to freshman Christopher Corbit Dunn (Will Hochman).</p>\n<p>Christopher shows up at her office one day without having made an appointment. Requiring one is Bella’s policy, but she allows him to stay and patiently listens to his angry criticisms of school rules. Her interest is heightened when he announces he’s writing a novel and she likes the sound of it.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/10/17/the-sound-inside-mary-louise-parker-spins-an-intriguing-literary-yarn/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Over subsequent visits for which he eventually does contact her in advance, he keeps her up to date on what he’s writing. His protagonist—at first identified as X but then as Christopher—is a Yale student who, traveling to Manhattan to see Caryl Churchill’s <em>Cloud Nine </em>in revival, joins a slightly older man on the trip, and the action leads to dire repercussions that won’t be revealed here.</p>\n<p>In time, Bella, who comes across as a loner, and Christopher, who comes across as a loner of a different stripe, begin having meals together. A relationship grows, but something that might occur to observers as about to happen doesn’t. Be happily advised that this is not a drama about an older woman having an affair with a student that meets a sorry end. Phew!</p>\n<p>Rapp has something quite different in mind for a piece that Bella narrates. As she reports the increasing teacher-student bond, she also announces that a severe pain she unexpectedly suffered at one mealtime is shortly diagnosed as (somewhat of a spoiler looming) an advanced cancer for which there is no particularly promising prognosis. That prognosis gives 53-year-old Bella the idea (another spoiler on the way) that suicide is her best recourse, one that requires a second person to complete—that participant being Christopher.</p>\n<p>Disclosing all the above, Bella continues telling her tale, including in graphic detail a one-night stand she has after receiving the bad news. Nevertheless, she gives pride of place to Christopher’s novel, which he calls “To Lie Face Down on a Field of Snow,” a title that has a disturbing foreshadowing effect. Both Bella and Christopher read aloud from what she decides is, at 100 pages, the student’s novella, a novella she admires.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the talk of novels and novellas, not to mention the first-person narrative, gives <em>The Sound Inside </em>its richly literary quality. It’s almost as if the play is somehow both more and less than a play. To some extent, playwright-novelist Rapp’s work suggests that it might initially have emerged as, like Christopher’s, a novella. The presence of Christopher’s excerpts are part of the meta-literary sense clinging to <em>The Sound Inside</em>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Christopher’s novella isn’t the lone literary work discussed during <em>The Sound Inside</em>. Bella summarizes the plot of her novel, <em>Billy Baird Runs Through a Wall</em>. In it the title character—whose name is a spin on Bella Baird, just as Christopher uses his name—attempts to follow through on the title’s promise.</p>\n<p>Wait, there’s more! It could be that with Bella’s title Rapp is alluding to Marcel Aymé’s 1943 short story <em>Le passe-muraille </em>(translated as <em>The Man Who Walked Through Walls</em>). As French author Aymé (1902-67) pens it, the man does succeed in walking through walls, whereas Bella’s Billy Baird doesn’t.</p>\n<p>It’s unlikely that many spectators at Rapp’s play will be aware of the (possible) Aymé reference, but still there’s a novel-within-novel, a hall-of-mirrors aspect to <em>The Sound Inside </em>that’s hard to miss. The result is not so much that a play is being performed but that a novel (novella? short story?) has been adapted for the stage and that wonderful stage actor Parker has been recruited to give it the full three-dimensional-character treatment.</p>\n<p>In costumer David Hyman’s casual clothes, Parker brings Rapp to life with a lovely looseness. She conveys Bella’s love of books, a devotion that overrides her interest in daily life. She underlines Bella’s dedication to teaching and to students who show talent. She gets across Bella’s taking the world wherein she lives with a mature acceptance—with an ability to dismiss its vicissitudes in favor of the interior life great literature provides. (Rapp’s title may have something to do with that.)</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Hochman, making his Broadway bow, plays opposite her with a fervor matching her appealing equability. And director David Cromer—with set designer Alexander Woodward, sound designer Daniel Kluger and, most prominently, lighting designer Heather Gilbert—facilitates with alluring ease.</p>\n<p>(N.B.: <em>The Sound Inside </em>isn’t the only recent play about a creative-writing teacher at Yale. Theresa Rebeck’s <em>Seminar </em>is another. It may even be that one of these days a third playwright will remember that Robert Penn Warren taught a beloved creative writing seminar at Yale and produce a play about that.)</p>\n<p><em>The Sound Inside </em>arrives at a time when literature is under siege, when the dumbed-down frame of mind is in ascendant. Rapp is to be thanked for an indisputably probing play that pays homage to the still potent aspiration to greatness.</p>\n<p><strong>The Sound Inside opened October 17, 2019, at Studio 54 and runs through January 12, 2020.

Photo: Jeremy Daniel.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>So now we know: The Greek gods were not helicopter parents.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the takeaway, at least, from <em>The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical</em>, adapted from the popular young readers&#8217; book by Rick Riordan, the first installment in a series that&#8217;s emerged as a sort of <em>Harry Potter</em> lite. The show follows the adventures of a group of &#8220;half-bloods&#8221;—not the offspring of witches and wizards and non-magical &#8220;Muggles,&#8221; as in J.K. Rowling&#8217;s novels, but the spawn of gods or goddesses and mere mortals. And rather than meeting at a school for superior beings, these teens cross path at a summer camp for misfits, where our titular hero is sent after being tossed out of three schools; the last expulsion occurs after Percy attacks a teacher, when she turns into a creature called a Minotaur. (Think Dementor, Potterheads.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mommy is too busy/Daddy is too busy,&#8221; the half-bloods sing in &#8220;Prologue/The Day I Got Expelled,&#8221; the first in a steady stream of catchy, if sometimes too cute, rock-flavored songs by composer/lyricist Rob Rokicki. Where other kids their age won&#8217;t be seen with their folks at the mall, these youngsters crave a sense of attachment, or even acknowledgment. Percy doesn&#8217;t even know who his old man is at first; though his mom offers a strong hint when she takes him on a stroll along the beach, he must first beg for a sign.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/10/16/the-lightning-thief-scarcely-a-striking-attraction-for-the-whole-darn-family/\"><em>Read Michael Sommers’ </em>★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Percy, who also suffers from ADHD and dyslexia, gets more than he bargains for, in the form of a &#8220;quest&#8221;—the highest honor a half-blood can receive—that will take him to the underworld and put him smack in the middle of a war involving the mightiest of gods. He&#8217;s joined, conveniently, by the smartest gal at camp, Annabeth, daughter of Athena and a history professor, and Percy&#8217;s goofy best buddy and &#8220;satyr,&#8221; or protector, a half-<em>goat </em>(um, get it?) named Grover.</p>\n<p>Potter fans are at this point welcome to draw their own comparisons, though the real problem with some of the characters in <em>Lightning Thief </em>is less their similarity to icons of contemporary fiction than their tendency to fall back on more general stereotypes. As written by librettist Joe Tracz (of <em>Be More Chill</em> fame, tellingly) and played by Chris McCarrell, Percy could be any number of disaffected, angst-ridden adolescents we&#8217;ve encountered lately. To Tracz&#8217;s and McCarrell&#8217;s and director Stephen Brackett (another <em>Chill</em> alum)&#8217;s credit—and Riordan&#8217;s—this protagonist is at least a bit more of a bad boy than Harry P.; when Annabeth cautions him that the gods will think they&#8217;re impertinent, he replies, with relish, &#8220;We <em>are</em> impertinent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Annabeth feels pretty generic as well, though Kristin Stokes makes the feisty, brainy heroine likable and invests her with a potent, if occasionally shrill, pop belt. Other cast members juggle two or more roles, in some cases inserting similar traits—the comic overzealousness shared by Grover and permanently irritated camp manager Mr. D (as in Dionysus), both played by Jorrel Javier, or the square-jawed, basso-voiced drollness of camp activities director Chiron and the god who turns out to be Percy&#8217;s dad, deftly played by Ryan Knowles.</p>\n<p>In guiding them all, Brackett and choreographer Patrick McCollum aim for a youthful, even manic energy. The latter&#8217;s routines at times seem inspired by Bill T. Jones&#8217;s work on the original <em>Spring Awakening</em>, with the performers jumping about as if simply too restless to settle in their own skin. It&#8217;s in these moments that <em>Lightning Thief</em>, which I first caught during its off-Broadway run in 2017, fills the larger space here most effectively.</p>\n<p>David Lander&#8217;s flashy lighting and scenic designer Lee Savage&#8217;s immersive use of confetti and toilet paper add less to the picture, though their commercial instincts are solid enough. Like Riordan, the team behind <em>Percy Jackson </em>knows and frequently charms its audience—even if its call to fight the darker creatures that lurk within and outside us has been delivered many times with more imagination.</p>\n<p><strong>The Lightning Thief opened October 16, 2019, at the Longacre Theatre and runs through January 5, 2020.

Photo: Jeremy Daniel</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Rolls of toilet paper wildly unspool from the stage and spew over the audience during a climactic moment during the second act of <em>The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical</em>.</p>\n<p>Such a not-so-special effect accurately reflects the quality of this minor musical and its stinky production, which opened on Wednesday at the Longacre Theatre.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong: I have no issues with musicals, such as <em>The Lightning Thief,</em> that are aimed for kids and their folks who spring for tickets. Several Disney shows are charmers. Heaven knows that <em>Wicked</em> speaks significantly to my inner tween self. I even liked <em>Be More Chill</em>, a cute musical that eluded Broadway popularity last season.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/10/16/the-lightning-thief-half-gods-and-monsters-at-summer-camp/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Speaking of <em>Be More Chill</em>, that late musical&#8217;s talented book writer and smart director, respectively Joe Tracz and Stephen Brackett, execute similar chores on <em>The Lightning Thief</em>, which is adapted from Rick Riordan’s bestseller novel for youngsters.</p>\n<p>Too bad they yield such a dud. <em>The Lightning Thief</em> makes <em>Be More Chill</em> look like <em>Der Rosenkavalier</em>.</p>\n<p>An increasingly tiresome outing, this overlong, patchy, at times crudely realized, two-act tuner will likely be a more effective show whenever its makers trim the piece back to 90 minutes.</p>\n<p>Riordan’s present-day yarn concerns teens who discover they are the half-blooded children of mortals and (apparently still powerful) Greek gods and goddesses.</p>\n<p>In Tracz’s repetitive script, a major chunk of the musical’s first act sees Percy (Chris McCarrell) trying to figure out which immortal figure might possibly be his dad even as demons such as a Minotaur materialize in order to destroy him.</p>\n<p>Finding refuge in a Long Island summer camp of other teen demi-gods, Percy teams up with the extremely smart Annabeth (Kristin Stokes), an offspring of Athena, and the goofy Grover (Jorrel Javier), satyr son of an unidentified deity. They set forth across the country on a quest to recover a stolen lightning bolt.</p>\n<p>En route, although they’re stuck for a long time in New Jersey, these plucky kids overcome several creepy creatures such as Medusa—weirdly resembling Norma Desmond here—and, oh wow, later zoom down to Hades by elevator for a visit. (Of course, they could walk right across the street to see <em>Hadestown</em>, a far more entertaining show, but let&#8217;s not get into meta-theatrics.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, amid the story&#8217;s sword fights and mythological references, songwriter Rob Rokicki provides loud bursts of pulsating, often angst-y, rock music. His songs about girl empowerment and neglectful dads sound perfunctory, but “D.O.A.,” an R&amp;B-style number for the Hades sequence, as fired up by Jalynn Steele’s red-hot vocals, proves to be pretty catchy.</p>\n<p>The lead performers agreeably inhabit their generic individuals, while Ryan Knowles, Sarah Beth Pfeifer, and James Hayden Rodriguez join everybody in depicting sundry characters. A few incidental figures are rendered extremely broadly—Javier screams through a role as a sour camp counselor—but then, there’s nothing much subtle about <em>The Lightning Thief</em>.</p>\n<p>Although the musical is mostly a yawn for adults (and probably smarter kids), sub-par visuals make it even a less attractive event. The production looks so cheap visually that let’s be kind and not name the designers. Industrial scaffolding can only go so far to create places effectively, while the cheesy effects for the story’s monsters and miracles are heralded by blasts of white lights meant to bedazzle viewers into not seeing the stagecraft. There is not an inch of magic anywhere on the stage, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>It’s my understanding that <em>The Lightning Thief </em>plans to be in residence at the Longacre for a limited engagement through the coming holiday season. It’s likely a show that many will want to miss.</p>\n<p><strong>The Lightning Thief opened October 16, 2019, at the Longacre Theatre and runs through January 5, 2020.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Of the many mysteries in Broadway’s current revival of <em>The Rose Tattoo</em>—and there are many—the one that looms largest must be: What in the name of John Waters is the deal with the pink flamingos?</p>\n<p>Perhaps they’re meant to evoke the “almost tropical” setting that Tennessee Williams specifies in his production notes (even though we generally associate the flamingo—especially in its plastic form—with Florida, and the play takes place on the Gulf Coast “somewhere between New Orleans and Mobile”). Maybe it’s simply their color: The lawn ornaments are perfectly pink, and the home of our heroine, Serafina delle Rose (Marisa Tomei, giving an earthy, passionate performance), is supposed to be soaked in the shade. Or perhaps scenic designer Mark Wendland just got a bulk rate on the Day-Glo plastic birds, and he liked how terrifically tacky they look—especially behind the makeshift shrine to the Blessed Virgin where Serafina prays regularly, down on her knees asking, “Oh, Lady! Give me a sign!”</p>\n<p><em>The Rose Tattoo</em> is a curiosity in the Williams oeuvre—an unconventional, almost schizophrenic amalgam of tragedy, situational comedy, and unadulterated optimism. Serafina giddily awaits the arrival of her tattooed truck driver husband Rosario; Estelle (Tina Benko), the woman everyone but Serafina knows as Rosario’s mistress, commissions seamstress Serafina to sew a man’s rose-colored silk shirt; the neighbors inform Serafina of her husband’s death; she declines into an unkempt, almost catatonic <em>animale</em>; her rebellious 15-year-old daughter, Rosa (Ella Rubin, attempting to sound vaguely Southern-ish), falls hopelessly, clumsily in love with a sailor, Jack (Burke Swanson, attempting to sound somewhere in the vicinity of Southern-ish); Serafina lashes out at everyone around her. That’s all in the first act. It’s not until Act 2 that Serafina gets her groove back, when she meets Alvaro Mangiacavallo (Emun Elliott, whose accent veers into that’s-a-spicy-meatball territory). Then <em>The Rose Tattoo</em> turns into what Williams called in his memoirs “my love-play to the world.” Williams dedicated the play to his Sicilian-American partner, Frank Merlo: “To Frankie, in Return for Sicily.”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/10/15/the-rose-tattoo-tennessee-williams-rose-isnt-a-rose-isnt-a-rose/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>That’s a lot for a director to wrangle, and Trip Cullman (<em>Choir Boy</em>, <em>Lobby Hero</em>)—who I suspect would do a bang-up job with another slightly wacko Williams play, <em>Camino Real</em>—might be as overwhelmed by the flock of flamingos as the rest of us. Though Williams specifies the presence of a guitar-playing Sicilian folk singer between scenes, Cullman here expands that stage direction into a distracting wandering female Greek chorus. There’s also the much smaller matter of the live goat, which was probably done away with for practical reasons. (Maybe the one who appeared in the 2016 Williamstown Theatre Festival production had a scheduling conflict.)</p>\n<p>But the excision of a major male authority figure is another matter altogether. It’s no big deal to cut the Doctor; his purpose is easily absorbed by Assunta (Carolyn Mignini), who’s kind of a witch doctor. But Father de Leo? A Sicilian immigrant community in 1950 would have <em>at least </em>one priest to counsel and comfort. In the original script, he is there with the women when we learn of Rosario’s death. He also speaks against cremation—which Serafina does, so she can keep her dead husband’s ashes in a place of honor (going against the Church). Later, when Serafina totally loses it and starts wandering outside in a slip, Father de Leo is the one who confronts her. Yet she only wants one thing from Father de Leo—knowledge about her husband: “Did he ever speak to you about a woman?” Now, she’s asking that question of Assunta. Why would a cheating man talk to a woman who knows the business of everyone in the neighborhood (who would likely tell his wife)? He would confess to a priest. Also, when Serafina physically attacks the Father, it’s pretty shocking; it shows how far she’s fallen.</p>\n<p>Perhaps removing the less-significant male characters is supposed to focus more squarely on the blossoming parallel love stories: the awkward, oh-so-idealistic teenage pairing of Rosa and Jack, and the awkward, cynical, mature coupling of Serafina and Alvaro. But sometimes the sauce just doesn’t come together.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Rose Tattoo</em> opened Oct. 15, 2019, and runs through Dec. 8 at the American Airlines Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Trip Cullman—who directs the revival of Tennessee Williams’ 1951 Tony award-winning play <em>The Rose Tattoo</em>, headlined by Marisa Tomei—thinks this item from the playwright’s canon is a comedy. He’s not altogether wrong, but he’s not altogether right, either. In the long run of this somewhat trimmed version, his oversight makes a significant and problematic difference.</p>\n<p>For an essay Williams inserted in a printed edition of the script, he twice refers, without speaking explicitly of <em>The Rose Tattoo</em>, to “plays in the tragic tradition.” On the other hand, he includes one late stage direction stating that “the scene should be played with the pantomimic lightness, almost fantasy, of an early Chaplin comedy.”</p>\n<p>So even if it’s considered that Williams was aiming at the comic more than the tragic—which isn’t necessarily so—an  obligatory tone is missing. Another way of putting this is to maintain that Williams’ insistence on the play’s profundities is set aside for a production that skims the text’s surface and is content to do only that.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/10/15/the-rose-tattoo-love-aint-sweeter-the-second-time-around/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Williams is telling the story of Serafina Delle Rose, a Sicilian seamstress living on the Gulf shore somewhere between New Orleans and Mobile. Her 40-ish heart has been severely pummeled twice by her trucker husband Rosario. He gave her the rocky business for the first time when he’s killed in a road accident. He wounds her the second time when she learns (her neighbors already know this) that he had been running around with gambling-house dealer Estelle Hohengarten (Tina Benko).</p>\n<p>A Madonna-devoted Catholic of rough feelings and thin skin, Serafina isn’t the sort to live a deprived life given to superficial emotions that others regard as easily mocked, as overblown. If further proof of her inner torment is needed, it helps to remember that Williams wrote the play for the irrepressibly tragic Anna Magnani. She only turned down his offer to introduce it on stage because she feared appearing before a live audience. Nevertheless, she said she was prepared to make the movie. (She did, of course, and won the 1955 Oscar as best actress.)</p>\n<p>Allowing herself to become blowzy after Rosario’s demise and raising her rebellious 15-year-old daughter Rosa (Ella Rubin), Serafina longs from the center of her being—not the outer layers—for a transforming epiphany, a “sign” from the Madonna she worships. She receives one but only warms to it slowly when trucker Alvaro Mangiacavallo (Emun Elliott)—who also hauls, as did Rosario, bananas—shows up on her humble doorstep.</p>\n<p>A good-hearted oaf able to joke about his surname—a name holding within it the macho implication of a man who could eat a horse—Alvaro poses a quandary for Serafina. Though wary of him, she does mention that Rosario had a rose tattoo on his chest. When he returns the following day, she has difficulty resisting the eager fellow: He’s had a rose tattooed on his chest.</p>\n<p>Cullman is on safe ground allowing the humor in the Serafina-Alvaro encounters to flow, and good for Tomei and Elliott making the most of it. He’s also busy at getting laughs from Rosa’s first dates with fleet’s-in sailor Jack Hunter (Burke Swanson), whose naïveté is like an aura safeguarding him but whose name is another cue to Williams’ penchant for script-populating hulks.</p>\n<p>But with Tomei, the Williams heartbreak is elusive. She looks the neighborhood scourge in costume designer Clint Ramos’s slips and robes and Tom Watson’s wigs, but the debilitating weight of her loss and the fear that it won’t be regained is not in her eyes or in the effortful way she carries herself. Tomei is effective as far as she goes, and it’s likely she has it in her to go much farther. But she hasn’t been guided that way.</p>\n<p>Without the deep grieving that penetrates Serafina and emanates from her, this <em>Rose Tattoo </em>falls short of its potential impact. Yes, the women watching her—sometimes keening in black—form a mournful Greek (Italian?) chorus. (Sound designer Fitz Patton and Jason Michael Webb supply original music.) Obstreperous children (Alexander Bello, Isabella Iannelli, Jacob Michael Laval) shoot through like omens (and foreshadow the <em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof </em>no-neck monsters), but they don’t lend enough of the needed doleful thickening.</p>\n<p>Mark Wendland’s set, surely in accordance with Cullman’s request, registers as a mistake. It features one window with a liftable shutter, a Madonna shine, a shelf holding a container in which Rosario’s ashes supposedly rest, and very few walls. It’s an airy space. Upstage, Lucy Mackinnon projects breaking Gulf waves.</p>\n<p>The suggestion is that <em>The Rose Tattoo </em>is a memory play. It isn’t. Wendland’s contribution might be ideal if this were the Wingfield home in <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>. But this is the Delle Rose home that Serafina has stuffed with her paraphernalia. It’s somewhere stifling, an environ where increasingly independent Rose, ripening to 18, might not want to bring friends.</p>\n<p>Williams did write one out-and-out comedy, <em>Period of Adjustment</em>. But <em>The Rose Tattoo </em>can’t be cited as a warm-up to it. Always to be kept in mind is that his plays, though not all of them, are to some extent autobiographical. The women in them—it’s problematic to ignore this—are fictionalized, even transgendered versions of himself. He inveterately longed for the right man to enter his life but was ambivalent about just who that man might be, how trustworthy, how kind that person might be.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Who said Broadway comedy was dead?</p>\n<p>Tracy Letts, well known in these parts for his Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>August: Osage County</em> and as a Tony Award-winning actor (in plays including the 2012 revival of <em>Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</em>), is back at his keyboard, and the results are superb. While his past oeuvre has not been noted for laughs—this is the man who wrote <em>Killer Joe</em> and <em>Bug</em>, after all—time and tide have caught up with the playwright, who battles his own fifty-year mark with wild comic lances thrust at life’s annoyances, only to have these darts more or less boomerang. The results are knowing, prickly, and altogether hilarious.</p>\n<p>Wheeler (Ian Barford) is a mess of a loser, as he’d be the first to tell you. Divorced, estranged, crotchety, and stuck in a low-grade job as a camera repairman in a near-obsolete shop with no apparent customers, he is—to quote one of the four women in his life—“a turtle who doesn’t know he’s lost his shell.” A cranky Everyman, a hero who will battle to get in the last word while tottering around his overactive bedroom wrapped in a bedsheet.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/10/10/linda-vista-a-view-from-the-bottom/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Wheeler—his first name is Dick, “which is why I go by Wheeler,” he explains—has just moved into a two-bedroom condo in the Linda Vista neighborhood of San Diego, with a communal pool and a view of the ocean if you stand up tall and “look to the right of the silver building.” Long-time friends Paul (Jim True-Frost) and Margaret (Sally Murphy)—the latter a former girlfriend of Wheeler, still battling it out with him 25 years later—set him up on a date with a life coach named Jules Isch (Cora Vander Broeck). There&#8217;s a Jules-ish joke in there, of course, it’s that kind of play.</p>\n<p>Our hero’s life is further complicated by the presence of Minnie (Chantal Tuy), a tattooed, battered and pregnant “20-year-old Vietnamese rockabilly girl” who lives in the complex, and, at the shop, the loquaciously vulgar owner Michael (Troy West)—sort of an alternate version of Wheeler, one who still lives with Mother—and the friendly but just-holding-it-together clerk Anita (Caroline Neff). Plus Wheeler&#8217;s unseen but frequently discussed wife and teenager.</p>\n<p>The whole is consistently well played under the helm of Chicago-based director of Dexter Bullard. While this is a coproduction between Second Stage and Center Theater Group of Los Angeles, it is billed as “Steppenwolf’s Production” and therein lies a significant part of the success of <em>Linda Vista</em>. The play was commissioned by and premiered at Steppenwolf, Letts’ home base, in April 2017; the entire team, with the exception of two cast members, appears to be intact. Also very much in evidence is Steppenwolf designer Todd Rosenthal, who won a Tony and an Olivier for <em>August: Osage County</em>. Rosenthal’s set makes grand use of a turntable, with the actors literally running through the rooms (to get to the bedroom) while the table ever-so-swiftly turns against them.</p>\n<p>The actors are little known in New York other than Barford (the father in <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em>, “Little Charlie” in <em>August: Osage County</em>) and Murphy (another <em>Osage County</em> original, well-remembered as Julie Jordan in the 1994 Lincoln Center <em>Carousel</em>). All are quite marvelous, with three of the cast pulling off explicit (and explicitly hysterical) sex scenes. Barford is especially wonderful in an award-worthy turn as the hapless hero who one suspects is a self-portrait of the author not-so-much in disguise.</p>\n<p>What makes <em>Linda Vista</em> so very special, though, is the writing. That might sound like an obvious statement, but we have several acclaimed productions on Broadway just now in which staging and scenery predominate over what the writer(s) actually wrote. The dialogue is razor sharp and positively laced with laughter—the kind of laughter that comes not merely from “funny” lines but innocent lines that are funny in context. I don’t know if there’s a bigger laugh on Broadway right now, <em>The Book of Mormon</em> aside, than Lett’s line, “You don’t understand!!” Not funny on the page, you’ve got to be there.</p>\n<p>On more than one occasion I pondered that this is very much like a Neil Simon play, albeit one written for today. (There is also in evidence at least a bit of the exasperatingly nonconformist philosophy of the dropout-from-life Murray Burns in Herb Gardner’s incomparable comedy, <em>A Thousand Clowns</em>.) Letts displays the Simonian knack of stoking the dialogue with aside-like lines that are cascadingly funny but very much suited to character and scene.</p>\n<p>Simon, in fact, made several attempts at writing a similar play in which the hapless hero was something of a stand-in for the playwright (<em>Chapter Two</em>, <em>Jake’s Women, Last of the Red Hot Lovers</em>). He was never quite able to pull it off, as the late “Doc” was happy to poke fun at himself but uncomfortable when prodding too deep. Letts—who does seem to have created something of a self-portrait here—is uncompromising in giving us not just the laughter, but the pain; and as a highly accomplished actor himself, he is very much aware of how to effectively translate this to the stage.</p>\n<p>Which is, in part, why <em>Linda Vista</em> is such a strong, warmly human and emotionally satisfying comedy of crotchety manners. Altogether lovely, when you stop to wipe your tears from all those howls of laughter.</p>\n<p><strong>Linda Vista opened October 10, 2019 at the Helen Hayes Theater and runs through November 10.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s impossible to escape the irony that a 50-year-old man in the midst of a divorce, working as a camera repairman, limping around on an almost-lame hip lives in apartment complex called Linda Vista. Beautiful view? From where we sit, everything about Wheeler (Ian Barford)—the antihero of Tracy Letts’ latest dark comedy, <em>Linda Vista</em>—is pretty repellent.</p>\n<p>This is a guy whose idea of foreplay is a three-hour Stanley Kubrick costume drama (<em>Barry Lyndon</em>, in case you’re considering trying this at home). He loathes anything coming out of Hollywood and “the fanboys who support and demand this shit.” (“I can’t name any American movies I like that came out after about 1984,” he sniffs.) He hates Elvis, Queen, and essentially anything you’d call popular music. His blind date, a sunny life coach named Jules (Cora Vander Broek), dares to ask his opinion on Radiohead: “Until they came along, I’d forgotten music could be so joyless.” (Needless to say, Wheeler did not approve of her karaoke selection, Lisa Loeb’s lovelorn <em>Reality Bites</em> anthem, “Stay.”) And don’t get him started on Trump voters: “The problem with these racist cocksuckers isn’t that they’re doing too much OxyContin, it’s that they need to do a whole lot more.” Okay, we’ll give him that last one.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/10/10/linda-vista-rollicking-comedy-on-broadway-from-tracy-letts/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>As central characters go, Wheeler is, admittedly, supremely unlikable. He’s also a staggeringly realistic creation. A foreign-film obsessed guy in a dead-end job who bags better women than he deserves? Been there, done him.</p>\n<p>Your tolerance for Wheeler and his escapades—his eons-ago girlfriend–turned–old friend Margaret (Sally Murphy), calls it his “shtick”—will likely depend on if you’ve ever tolerated your own Wheeler. (There’s one dialogue exchange, about a dozen lines or so, between Wheeler and Jules, that I have actually had. Word for word.) Margaret is also the only person who calls him out: “Your shtick is <em>old</em> and <em>tired</em>.” Though one of Wheeler’s coworkers gives it to him pretty straight as well: “You’re a mess,” says Anita (Caroline Neff) unpityingly after he makes a fumbling pass at her.</p>\n<p>I’m still trying to puzzle out why there are three people—Wheeler, Anita, and the pervy Michael (Troy West), who has clearly spent an unhealthy amount of time contemplating suicide by cheese grater (“Step on it and flatten it…sharply draw that serrated edge across my carotid artery…you could bleed out in three minutes”)—working in a camera shop. Are that many people in Southern California suddenly trading their iPhones for actual cameras?</p>\n<p>Barford—who you might remember as the emotionally inert Little Charles in Letts’ Pulitzer- and Tony-winning <em>August: Osage County</em> (which also featured Murphy and West)—makes Wheeler a charmer when he needs to, but he’s even better when he goes to the character’s dark side. Wheeler’s casual cruelty toward Jules and his inexplicable coupling with the 20-something Minnie (Chantal Thuy) are so painful to watch they actually induce audible gasps.</p>\n<p>Usually a messed-up central character takes some sort of journey toward redemption in a play; he gets better. But in this case, Wheeler acknowledges he’s a wreck and actually gets <em>worse</em> as time goes on. (Act 2 Wheeler, fair warning, is a real A-hole.) But actually…staggeringly realistic.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Linda Vista</em> opened Oct. 10, 2019, and runs through Nov. 10 at the Hayes Theater.

Harris’ <em>Slave Play</em> and didn’t spend the next day or two (or three or four) processing it, did you really see <em>Slave Play</em>? You might have been at Broadway’s Golden Theatre, where it just opened—or at New York Theatre Workshop in late 2018, where it premiered and caused a major sensation—and you probably watched it, but did you really <em>see</em> it?</p>\n<p>Because <em>Slave Play</em>—sharply and smartly directed by Robert O’Hara—is a show that needs to be processed. Admittedly, that is a terribly clinical way to put it. “Can you stop saying processing?” yells one character, Jim (Paul Alexander Nolan). “We aren’t computers. My emotions aren’t materials.” But fair warning: As the program note by poet-novelist Morgan Parker begins, “This might hurt.”</p>\n<p>Jim and Kaneisha (Joaquina Kalukango) are the first couple we meet on the MacGregor Plantation, just outside of Richmond, Va. (To bring us all back to the old South, set designer Clint Ramos cleverly projects an image of the chalk-white mansion and the lush, manicured grounds onto the mezzanine overhang—and reflects it back to the whole theater by lining the entire stage with mirrors.) She is a slave, unenthusiastically sweeping the floor of a cottage…until Rihanna’s “Work” comes on, and then she’s dancing like no one’s watching. Pretty soon someone is—Jim, the property manager, who’s intrigued and turned on. And carrying a whip.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/10/06/slave-play-down-on-the-ol-plantation-on-45th-street/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Inside the house, the pale blonde Mistress MacGregor (Annie McNamara) is hot and bothered and in serious need of a violin serenade. She beckons the handsome Phillip (Sullivan Jones), begging him to work his “mulatto magic.” Somehow, his playing has emboldened her. “I want to be inside you,” she declares. Seemingly out of nowhere, she produces a large black dildo (“On the night before my wedding, my mother gave me this”). You can probably guess the rest.</p>\n<p>Outside, under the scorching Virginia sun, Dustin (James Cusati-Moyer), a white indentured servant, is slowly hauling bales of hay. Gary (Ato Blankson-Wood)—or Nigger Gary, as he’s called on the plantation—is showing him who’s boss, and definitely enjoying it. The sexual attraction is palpable, propelling the pair into a combative interpretive dance and climaxing, literally, in a boot worship scene.</p>\n<p>But it’s not all fun and sex games. Warning: Here’s where you might want to stop reading if you haven’t seen <em>Slave Play</em> or if you don’t want a spoiler. We do know we weren’t <em>actually</em> in the pre–Civil War era South. Harris plants plenty of clues—the biggest of which is probably the hook-filled tune by a certain Barbadian singer/fashion mogul/lingerie queen/makeup magnate; one of the lyrics—“Nuh body touch me you nuh righteous”—even lines the top of the stage, each letter outlined in neon (a nod to Bronx-born artist Glenn Ligon, perhaps?). Kaneisha and Jim get into a lovers’-style quarrel over fruit: “Watermelons are green, on the outside, they green. Red in the middle,” she impatiently tells Jim, who confused it with a cantaloupe. Mistress MacGregor is wearing black patent thigh-high boots that look straight out of the Frederick’s of Hollywood catalog (I’m guessing). Dustin and Gary strip down to reveal matching Calvin Klein underwear.</p>\n<p>But when all the couples gather in a brightly lit room and therapists Teá (Chalia La Tour) and Patricia (Irene Sofia Lucio) come out and start throwing around words like <em>anhedonia</em>—the inability to feel pleasure (Hedone was the Greek goddess of pleasure), clearly there’s something else at play: “Antebellum Sexual Performance Therapy,” Teá declares. “A RADICAL therapy designed to help black partners re-engage intimately with white partners from whom they no longer receive sexual pleasure.” It’s a technique, she explains, that she and Patricia developed at Smith and Yale (which Harris recently graduated from and where <em>Slave Play</em> had its premiere, incidentally).</p>\n<p>Yet the most fascinating revelations from the talk therapy session aren’t related to the recent sex scenes; they’re in how the characters see themselves. Phillip throws it back to college, when he was a Division I soccer star: “This upperclassman like looked over and was like ‘Phillip isn’t a nigger, Phillip’s Phillip.’ And yeah I think, that that’s basically what everyone thinks of me,” he says. “I’m not black I’m not white I’m just Phillip.” Dustin—who’s an actor, and just a teensy bit dramatic—is vehemently, repeatedly “not white”; yet no one seems to know what he is. Meanwhile, Gary describes himself as “black black blue black jet black raisin black eerie black. People have seen so much color in me they could make a new rainbow with the shades but they always go back to black.” And it galls him that Dustin gets to “exist in this ambiguity of ‘non-whiteness.’”</p>\n<p>Harris gets a lot of mileage out of the group-therapy vibe and the affirmations Teá and Patricia hand out like Kleenex. Patricia to Jim: “You are heard. You are affirmed.” Teá to Phillip: “I want you to know that I see you.” Teá to Patricia: “Know that I was hearing you.” But the section gets way too bogged down by psychobabble—granted, an easy target.</p>\n<p>It’s not a spoiler to say that the road to resolution won’t be easy for these three couples. Harris doesn’t tie things up for us; neat and tidy isn’t his style (also on display earlier this year in his play <em>“Daddy”</em>). And he will give a couple characters a thorough emotional beating before evening’s end.</p>\n<p>But amid the devastation, Harris intertwines uncommonly evocative, poetic imagery. “I remember how you looked at me that night at the bar when we first met,” Kaneisha says to Jim. (Kalukango and Nolan are breathtakingly good.) “How it felt when I first tasted your eyes on me.” His eyes tasted like Chardonnay.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Slave Play</em></strong><strong> opened Oct. 6, 2019, at the John Golden Theatre and runs through Jan. 19, 2020.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Improv is back on Broadway. A special variety of improv, mind you; while there have not been many shows of its type on 45th Street, this is perhaps the most exuberantly entertaining thing of its kind since Mike Nichols and Elaine May set up at the Golden in 1960.</p>\n<p>Just what is <em>Freestyle Love Supreme</em>, you might well ask? That title is enigmatic enough to make you wonder if you even want to see a show called <em>Freestyle Love Supreme</em>. The answer should be, yes indeed. (The title, it turns out, is in homage to John Coltrane’s 1965 LP, <em>A Love Supreme</em>.)</p>\n<p>What you get is five actors—or, rather, lightning-quick improv artists—with keen talent for words, movement and music along with an uncanny ability to play well together. That is, intermix their improvised words and actions like a jazz combo.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/10/02/freestyle-love-supreme-hip-hop-dont-stop/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>We cannot describe the plot, as there is none. There is a framework, which has been distilled over the years, since 2003 when a trio of friends—Anthony Veneziale, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Thomas Kail—first created the show. Yes, <em>that</em> Lin-Manuel Miranda, along with his eventual <em>In the Heights</em>/<em>Hamilton</em> director Kail. An early production of <em>Freestyle</em> was done at the then-new talent incubator Ars Nova back in November 2004. The present production premiered in Greenwich Village at the Barrow Street Theater this past February.</p>\n<p>Yes, there is an apparent framework; but this is a theatrical piece in which words, music and staging are improvised each night. There is a rotating cast of sorts: Seven actors are listed in the Playbill, four of whom appear at any given performance joined by one unannounced “cameo performer.” At the press performance attended, Veneziale served as the genially canny emcee; a fleet-tongued fellow named Utkarsh Ambudkar was the primary improvisatory rapper; and Chris Sullivan—with a hand microphone more or less permanently attached to his mouth—provided beats and percussion. Given the excellence of these three, one guesses that they play the majority of the performances. They are accompanied by conductor/performer Arthur Lewis and one of two additional musicians. The eighty-minute show plays eight times a week, including 7 and 10 PM shows on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.</p>\n<p>The cameo performers, we are told, include otherwise unengaged actors like Daveed Diggs, Christopher Jackson and James Monroe Iglehart (all of <em>Hamilton</em>) plus Mr. Miranda himself. At the press preview attended, Jackson was on stage. When the subject of politics came up, one of the others pointed to him—he created the role of George Washington in the hip-hop pageant at the Rodgers—and said, “I want <em>him</em> as my president!” to cheers from the audience. (Jackson, now a regular on the television series <em>Bull</em>, is listed as one of the seven “founding members of <em>Freestyle Love Supreme</em>,” the others beings Kail, Lewis, Miranda, keyboardist Bill Sherman, Sullivan and Veneziale.)</p>\n<p>How does the improv work? Veneziale (or whomever is playing “Mic 1” at a given performance) canvasses the audience for words, anecdotes or even life-changing tales. Having selected suitable responses, he leads his cast in what might be seen as brief one-act plays based on the audience prompts. Hence, they are making up <em>Freestyle Love Supreme</em> every night on their feet, as the evening progresses. Miranda has described it as making up “a hip-hop show in real time.”</p>\n<p>One of the set-pieces includes a built-in rewind of events, requiring the cast to babble their way backwards, recreating the words and movements they have just made up without consultation or rehearsal (and hope that their castmates will be in the same place at the same time). Impressive. Then they have to do it again, with different story/words/movement/music, at the next performance.</p>\n<p>While critics generally try to avoid audience participation, I decided under the circumstances to test just how these improvisers take audience suggestions. I sent up the word “subpoena” and sure enough, Veneziale and his companions wove the word into the dialogue four times over the rest of the evening.</p>\n<p>Is <em>Freestyle Love Supreme</em> traditional Broadway fare? No, certainly. Would this production be ensconced at the fabled Booth on Shubert Alley <em>without</em> the Messrs. Miranda and Kail serving as co-creators and co-producers? Assuredly not. But based on a back-of-the-ticket-envelope tally, I calculate that <em>Freestyle Love Supreme</em> easily merits inclusion on my list of the six most entertaining shows currently on Broadway. So those of you interested in keen and knowing fast-paced topical humor fueled by high intellect and political insight might want to try to get over to the Booth.</p>\n<p><strong>Freestyle Love Supreme opened October 2, 2019, at the Booth Theatre and runs through January 12, 2020.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If we’re being excruciatingly honest, improv is not my idea of a good time. I’m still recovering from a 1995 incident with a campus comedy troupe (who shall remain nameless).</p>\n<p>But the giddy, upbeat <em>Freestyle Love Supreme</em>—now on Broadway after a recent hit off-Broadway run—is enough to cure anyone’s improv-phobia. It’s also a welcome break from the exhausting 24/7 election-and-corruption news cycle that assaults us from every direction.</p>\n<p>The company—Utkarsh Ambudkar (aka UTK the INC.), Aneesa Folds (Young Nees), Chris Sullivan (Shockwave), Anthony Veneziale (Two-Touch), and music supervisor Arthur Lewis (Arthur the Geniuses), plus keyboardist Ian Weinberger and special guest Christopher Jackson (C-Jack) at the performance I attended—solicits suggestions from the audience throughout the show. But no matter how many times they heard <em>impeach</em>, they didn’t bite. (Of course, they also passed on <em>defenestrate</em>. “I don’t want to throw it out, but we’ve used it before,” explained Two-Touch.) It’s words such as <em>gyrate</em> that the group pounced on, turning the evocative verb into an indescribably kicky opening number—something about a centrifuge and a gyroscope?—the likes of which will never be heard again. Literally.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/10/02/freestyle-love-supreme-high-flying-improv-at-the-booth/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>“I can only imagine what’s going through your mind right now—what the <em>hell</em> are they doing?” asked Two-Touch, who started <em>FLS</em> 15 years ago with director/producer Thomas Kail and producer (and sometime guest star) Lin-Manuel Miranda in the basement of the Drama Book Shop. Possibly. But judging by the number of <em>Hamilton</em>-savvy fans on hand—UTK’s line to C-Jack “That’s <em>my </em>president!” brought down the house—the audience pretty much knows what they’re in for.</p>\n<p>Still, who would have thought C-Jack could extemporize such a soulful R&amp;B-laced meditation on lactose intolerance? Or that raisins could be the basis for such a—pardon the pun—fruitful rap? Young Nees took on the divisive dried grape, spinning a tragic tale that involved Thanksgiving stuffing and a white girl named Karen. (Why are they always named Karen?) But that’s the magic of <em>Freestyle Love Supreme</em>: The performers find inspiration in the most unlikely places. Later, with Lewis providing silky smooth vocals, Young Nees, Two-Touch, and C-Jack turned out an old-school slow jam built around the word <em>matcha</em>, the trendy/possibly healthy green-tea-leaf powder.</p>\n<p>What’s most impressive about <em>FLS</em> is the group’s versatility. When I saw the show off-Broadway, I was blown away by UTK. This time, though he rocked the speed-improv round, spitting insane rhymes while C-Jack threw word after word after word—one of which was <em>coagulate</em>—at him, he wasn’t quite as razor-sharp playing, say, audience member Katie from Tennessee who ran over her brother’s foot when they were teens. Meanwhile, C-Jack completely killed it during the matcha song—turning it into an ode to his grandmother and recalling his roots in activism (“Gonna be a marcher”)—and everywhere else. <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, if you need someone to play Cory Booker, he’s your man. And Two-Touch is the secret weapon. Not only is he the emcee, but he’s also the guy who has to decipher everything the theatergoers are shouting out. When a gaggle of drunk girls is yelling “Lexapro!” that’s no mean feat.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Freestyle Love Supreme</em> opened Oct. 2, 2019, and runs through Jan. 12</strong><strong>, 2020, at the Booth Theatre.

Photo: Evan Zimmerman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A sequel to his Tony Award-winning best play <em>All the Way</em>, Robert Schenkkan’s <em>The Great Society</em> dramatizes Lyndon B. Johnson’s turbulent presidency during the years 1965-1968.</p>\n<p>Like its Broadway predecessor of 2014, which detailed Johnson’s first year in office and subsequent election as President in his own right, <em>The Great Society</em> is again directed by Bill Rauch, employs a relatively large ensemble of 19 actors to portray more than 50 statesmen and personalities of the era, and covers a vast amount of American history within a nearly three hour-long production.</p>\n<p>Probably much too much history, as it turns out. Opening on Tuesday at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, <em>The Great Society</em> eventually congeals into a ponderous drama in spite of the efforts of some excellent actors who do their damnedest to inject life and excitement into a series of woeful events.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/10/01/the-great-society-a-leader-in-shades-of-gray-in-another-troubled-time/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Just as the escalating Vietnam conflict and the burn-baby-burn inner city riots are shown to gradually overwhelm Johnson’s ambitions to eradicate poverty, provide federal health benefits, and ensure equal rights for black Americans, so does this hard march through some extremely troubled times ultimately prove to be a downer of a drama.</p>\n<p>This is an enormous and complicated historical canvas and the playwright strives to craft a living diorama from it. Much to his credit, Schenkkan’s workmanlike construction usually neatly dovetails the succession of episodes while providing a sufficient amount of exposition to launch each of them as independent vignettes. Of necessity the story’s lesser figures are merely sketched in, leaving the actors to flesh out the blanks, but one wishes that the playwright had painted his portrait of Johnson with deeper personal insights and colors.</p>\n<p>Except for several sharp instances that illustrate Johnson’s masterly ways of persuasion—notably a humorous end-run around the American Medical Association to launch Medicare and a cunning confrontation with Alabama governor George Wallace regarding the safety of people marching for voting rights—too much of the play seems to witness Johnson simply receiving and trying to cope with nearly ceaseless bad news.</p>\n<p>It is unfortunate that Brian Cox, who depicts Johnson, neither resembles nor much sounds like the tall, craggy-featured, and strategically folksy President. A solid actor, Cox is not a sufficiently dynamic presence to drive the drama forcefully along. His performance pales against the memory of a far more charismatic Bryan Cranston, who played Johnson in <em>All the Way</em>.</p>\n<p>Cox is not the only one whose portrayal lacks power. Gordon Clapp makes for quite a dull J. Edgar Hoover. Richard Thomas is undermined by his underwritten role as Hubert Humphrey, the Vice President who became the Democratic Party’s nominee in the 1968 presidential election.</p>\n<p>Other artists among the hard-working ensemble fare better. Looking little like Martin Luther King, a youthful Grantham Coleman aptly suggests the man’s soulful magnetism. Sharply depicting Wallace and Richard Nixon, David Garrison further provides a touching cameo as a Quaker who sets himself on fire to protest Vietnam. Marc Kudisch energetically stomps about as Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley and other tough guys. Enabled by Tom Watson’s hair and wig designs, Frank Wood neatly plays four people including a cynical Senator Everett Dirksen.</p>\n<p>A side note here: Do these names still ring bells with many viewers? It’s good that a cardboard insert in the <em>Playbill</em> provides brief who’s who descriptions of the drama’s multitudes. Brian Dykstra, Ty Jones, and Matthew Rauch are others who capably assume numerous identities.</p>\n<p>An efficient, rather homely, setting designed by David Korins accommodates various projections that delineate the story’s far-flung locations, although Rauch stages much of the action downstage and center at the Beaumont. If <em>The Great Society</em> is intended to be an animated history lesson, one wishes the illustrations that accompany it packed greater visual punch.</p>\n<p>More a parade of unfortunate circumstances than an effectively curated biography, <em>The Great Society</em> is an earnest consideration of how even a smart and aspirational leader can be undone by his times.</p>\n<p><strong>The Great Society opened October 1, 2019, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater and runs through November 30.

Photo: Hugh Glendenning</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Florian Zeller, the Parisien <em>l’auteur dramatique</em> who has taken the English-language stage by storm with six plays since his West End debut in 2015, has returned to New York for his third time in three years. <em>The Height of the Storm </em>follows up—in theatric, thematic and most likely successful manner—on his first local visit with <em>The Father</em>, which the estimable Frank Langella rode to a 2016 Tony on the very same Manhattan Theater Club mainstage on West 47th Street.</p>\n<p>André (Jonathan Pryce) is a legendary writer, grappling with dementia in his rustic country house. That much seems clear, anyway. (Note: If you’re intending to see the play but don’t like to know anything about what you will see, you might wish to skip the next three paragraphs.)</p>\n<p>André’s daughters Anne (Amanda Drew) and Elise (Lisa O’Hare) are visiting from Paris, the former to search his papers for unpublished but publishable manuscripts and both to broach the idea of selling the family manse and dispatching André to what they call “the Blue House.” This following the recent funeral of the writer’s wife, Madeleine (Eileen Atkins); no sooner than which in she comes, alive and kicking and preparing sautéed mushrooms with chives—green, red and yellow—from their beloved backyard garden.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/09/24/the-height-of-the-storm-cloudy-skies-ahead/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Or does she? We have become accustomed to ghost dramas, where one character might play scenes with another character who turns out not to be there; or engage with another character who <em>is</em> there, except the discussion took place years earlier or years later; or alternating versions of the same presumably real-life scene played repeatedly with twisted dialogue. Zeller, in <em>The Father</em>, added a real-life twist to this. As his protagonist was descending into Alzheimer’s, it made perfect sense for said character’s conversations with diverse characters—real and imaginary—<em>not</em> to make sense, thus at times purposely deceiving the audience.</p>\n<p>Here, André is—too—struggling with dementia. Presumably, at least. Playgoers, sitting patiently in their seats, naturally if subconsciously attempt to glean the reality of the proceedings and assemble them logically. Zeller, in both of the plays in question, purposely thwarts that, basing his truth on the illogical confines of the patient. If you sit there wondering <em>but which is real?</em> you are missing the point. For André—and, for that matter, Madeleine—there is no truth, no reality.</p>\n<p>Those who remember the Langella play might recall that the father in <em>The Father</em> was named André, with daughters named Anne and Elise. The characters in the new play are clearly a different André, Anne and Elise. Or are they? Again, Zeller doesn&#8217;t raise the issue; he is content to leave at least some viewers wondering.</p>\n<p>Even were the text not so intriguing, the evening would be altogether memorable thanks to the acting on display. (The Manhattan Theater Club production, directed by Jonathan Kent and designed by Anthony Ward, is a direct import from last October’s engagement at Wyndham’s Theatre, with five of the six-person cast intact. <em>Avant de s’envoler</em> originally opened at Théâtre de l’Oeuvre in Paris on October 5, 2016.) Two-time Tony and two-time Olivier-winner Pryce (<em>Miss Saigon</em>) is wonderful as the writer, spending half his time in limbo but struggling to regain command when he perceives a personal threat in the conversation which swirls around him. Watch Pryce’s right hand; time and again he hides it—thrusting it into his pocket—just before it starts to shake uncontrollably. He also has some stuttering speeches which are exceptionally well played.</p>\n<p>As for Dame Eileen, she is magnificent; her intensity is staggeringly controlled, and she can express more without words, more with a glare or a simple glance, than just about any actor on the present-day stage. The 85-year-old Atkins—who in addition to hundreds of stage, screen and television appearances since her professional debut in 1952 found time to write screenplays (<em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>) and co-create the hit television series <em>Upstairs, Downstairs</em>—rivets attention throughout the piece.</p>\n<p>For those not quite up on continental playwrights, Zeller is a forty-year-old successful novelist who latterly turned to theater. <em>The Father</em> is part of a trilogy, preceded by <em>The Mother</em> (which visited the Atlantic Theatre last winter in a less-than-inspired new staging) and followed by <em>The Son</em>, which opened on the West End two weeks ago to high acclaim. Yet to reach our shores are two other internationally-successful plays, <em>The Truth</em> and <em>The Lie</em>. The English-language versions of all six plays—and this is not inconsequential—have come from Christopher Hampton, an excellent dramatist in his own right (with <em>The Philanthropist</em> and <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em> among his credits). Hampton sets Zeller&#8217;s plays like a jeweler working with rare gems, and the latter is most perceptive to enlist the former.</p>\n<p><em>The Height of the Storm</em> is a puzzle built on cobwebs, with a couple of puzzle-pieces purposely missing (or perhaps several pieces too many). This allows Zeller&#8217;s play, like <em>The Father</em>, to succeed on its own terms, sending you out into the night (after eighty-odd minutes with no intermission) talking, thinking, considering and—yes—puzzling over the affair. But in any case, fully and totally engaged.</p>\n<p><strong>The Height of the Storm opened September 24, 2019, at Samuel J. Friedman Theatre and runs through November 24.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>“You think people are dead, but it’s not always the case.”</p>\n<p>André (Jonathan Pryce) is relaying a rambling story about an acquaintance who may have died after consuming some poisonous mushrooms. Or slipping off a perilous path into the river. Or he might be alive and well, living another life with a woman who is not his wife.</p>\n<p>We’ve just spent half of the first scene of Florian Zeller’s <em>The Height of the Storm</em> thinking that André is alone. As Anne (Amanda Drew) explains, again and again, to her inflexible father, “You can’t live here on your own.” Then, in breeze her mother, Madeleine (Eileen Atkins), and her sister, Élise (<em>A Gentlemen’s Guide to Love and Murder</em>’s Lisa O’Hare), toting groceries. We thought Madeleine was dead—but it might not be the case.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/09/24/the-height-of-the-storm-provocative-play-offers-master-class-in-acting/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>With an assist from lighting designer Hugh Vanstone, Zeller and director Jonathan Kent manage to stretch the is-she-or-isn’t-she tension until the 80-minute play’s end—and even beyond, judging by post-show comments. (Overheard: “Wait, so which one was dead?” “I don’t know, I was going to ask you!”) But it almost doesn’t matter.</p>\n<p>The production’s chief draw is the pairing of theatrical luminaries Pryce and Atkins as a 50-years-married couple, and they more than live up to the hype. As the slowly deteriorating André, Price certainly has the showier role; his rantings and ravings put me in mind of another on-the-decline dad, Lear. But Atkins’ performance—even as Madeleine is doing the most mundane things, such as sipping tea or chopping an onion—possesses a quiet intensity. Watch her methodically peel mushrooms; it’s practically hypnotic.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, if these characters sound familiar, they should. Zeller’s <em>The Father</em>—which also played at the Friedman Theatre, and starred a Tony-winning Frank Langella—centers on the aging André, who’s descending into dementia. He too has a daughter named Anne. There’s no need to enumerate all the crossovers, but suffice it to say that <em>The Father</em> is a much more unflinching, cold-eyed portrayal of a fast-crumbling man.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it’s the presence of Madeleine, but <em>Storm</em> feels less chilly than Zeller’s <em>The Father</em> and <em>The Mother</em> (seen earlier this year off-Broadway); similarly, the translation, by the French playwright’s longtime collaborator, Christopher Hampton, sounds less stilted. “The fact that you stayed together all that time,” Anne marvels to her mother. “It’s not very common, if you think about it. The ability to love one another to the end.”</p>\n<p>Yet at other times, something about <em>Storm</em> looks too much an exercise. Two characters, obliquely called The Woman (Lucy Cohu) and The Man (James Hillier), pop in here and there to…well, The Woman isn’t so much a set of characters as a frustrating stuck-in-a-loop plot device. The play is at its best at its most meditative—the calm during the <em>Storm</em>, if you will. André, achieving an ever-so-brief moment of lucidity with Anne: “You know, as time goes by, You see things in a different light. What once seemed important to us suddenly becomes trivial.” Or Madeleine, enjoying the silence after their daughters have departed: “It’s nice of them to come and see us&#8230; But after two days, I’ve had enough of it. Don’t you think?” A few more of those moody, mushroom-peeling moments would not have been unwelcome.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Height of the Storm</em> opened Sept. 24, 2019, and runs through Nov. 24 at the Friedman Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Calling <em>Derren Brown: Secret</em> a magic show is like calling <em>Hamilton</em> a patriotic historical pageant. Yes, there’s magic in this new offering at the Cort (produced, incidentally, by two of the lead purveyors of that equally magical revolutionary musical now and forever ensconced at the Richard Rodgers). But you go into a so-called magic show in reasonable expectation of card tricks, vanishing ladies, coins-pulled-from-ears, and the like. Brown, a mild-spoken and ingratiating 40-something mechanic of misdirection from England, offers none of the above. No rabbits out of hats; he doesn’t even have wear a hat. (Does anybody wear a hat?)</p>\n<p>What you get is mental magic, sleight after sleight after sleight. Because Brown is a master showman, he doesn’t just astound you. He starts off small, leaving you to turn in your seat to your companion to whisper, “How’d he do that?” By midway through the show (a neat two hours, plus an intermission that allows patrons to clamber across the stage), you are cordially nudging your random neighbor to ask, “How’d he do that?” By evening’s end, you’re practically shouting out the question on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>(Historical Aside: As we spilled out onto 48th Street following the Thursday night preview, we ran smack dab into one of the present-day commander-in-chief’s paid attorney-spokesmen, looking like a cadaver painted with caked TV-camera makeup, being escorted by an overfed security guard from the neighboring Fox News building. Perhaps Mr. Brown should focus his prestidigitational prowess on making <em>them</em> disappear? But we digress.)</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/09/15/derren-brown-secret-international-man-of-mystery-and-mind-games/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Brown, whose career has been boosted by frequent appearances on British television, is no stage amateur: He has made seven West End visits, picking up twin Olivier Awards for <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em> (2005) and <em>Svengali</em> (2012). <em>Derren Brown: Secret</em>, his first U.S. stage show, premiered off-Broadway in April 2017 at the Atlantic Theater Company. I found it astounding at the time, and am pleased to say that it has increased in effectiveness at the thousand-seat Cort; with more than thrice the patrons, the spell is even greater. (Live video is used in the show, as before, but now the video allows actual participation by even those in the second balcony.)</p>\n<p>As for audience participation, yes—there is a lot of it. In fact, it’s safe to say that there’d be no show without it. Is it mandatory participation, likely to embarrass recalcitrant patrons? No; rest assured, those of you in that boat (like the present reviewer) need not be tentative. Audience plants? You might think some of these participants <em>need</em> be plants, given how handily Brown forecasts their responses. But apparently no. Dozens participate, pulled from all corners out of the auditorium. Consider the logistics of seating 50 plants, forfeiting ticket revenue for dozens of seats and actually paying them all for nightly participation. Can’t be done. What’s more, Brown selects many of his participants by hurling Frisbees into the house. Try to pre-plan <em>that</em>.</p>\n<p>Does a second visit “spoil” the magic, or at least give away Brown’s <em>Secret</em>? Not in the least. If anything, it makes the show even more impressive. What we have here is an evening of mystifying extemporanea that is, in fact, carefully and meticulously assembled; the better to clout the patrons over the head with some astounding pre-planned feats, which Brown gleefully springs on us. The star requests, from the stage, that we don’t spoil the fun for future audiences, so that’s as much as I shall divulge.</p>\n<p>How’d he do that? That’s not the point. As the show progresses, you can try to figure out the tricks (and there are a few that, on consideration, are comprehensible). But why let that detract your attention from Brown’s compilation of magical marvels? It&#8217;s more fun—<em>way</em> more fun—to just sit back, on the edge of your seats, and allow yourself to be thrilled.</p>\n<p><strong>Derren Brown: Secret opened September 15, 2019, at Cort Theatre and runs through January 4, 2020.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>According to his Playbill bio, the star of <em>Derren Brown: Secret </em>has, among other things, &#8220;predicted the national lottery, convinced a shy man to land a packed passenger plane at 30,000 feet, hypnotized a man to assassinate Stephen Fry and created a zombie apocalypse for an unsuspecting participant after seemingly ending the world&#8221;—and that’s just in Brown&#8217;s native Britain, where the magician and mentalist is a veteran TV star and &#8220;his name now pretty much synonymous with the art of psychological manipulation.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, one suspects that had Brown, whose credits also include Netflix specials, not been drawn to his current calling, he might have applied his powers of persuasion to a more nefarious one—become a cult leader, perhaps, or a marketing executive for an oil company. Let&#8217;s be glad he chose the path he did, one that led him onstage, for Brown is as natural and charismatic a live performer as you&#8217;re likely to see in any capacity this season, combining a razor-sharp wit with exuberant improvisational finesse and, notwithstanding the various gifts he displays here—which extend to sketch artistry, apparently—a disarming sense of wonder.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I will always be honest about my dishonesty,&#8221; Brown told a preview crowd last week, but it&#8217;s the gray area between illusion and reality—how our individual experiences shape our perception—that seems to most fascinate and delight him, and form the premise of <em>Secret</em>, which arrives on Broadway following an acclaimed run at Atlantic Theatre Company two years back. Though written by Brown and co-directors Andrew O&#8217;Connor and Andy Nyman, the show by nature varies from night to night, drawing widely on audience volunteers who willingly (we assume) take part in a succession of routines showcasing Brown&#8217;s ability to get inside our heads and pull off astonishing feats with his own, or at least convince us that he can.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/09/15/derren-brown-secret-legerdemain-unleashed-at-cort/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>While Brown appeals to critics not to reveal specifics of each performance, I can report generally that while one participant appeared to stump him at the preview I saw—&#8221;My authority is perfectly fallible,&#8221; he admitted—his multi-faceted mastery could defy disbelief, or more importantly, from an entertainment standpoint, make us happy to suspend it. (Brown was convincing enough that when he suggested at one point that some psychic interaction might be taking place in the theater, I determined to make my mind as blank as possible, lest he or anyone else try to read my innermost thoughts.)</p>\n<p>Darting about between the faux brick walls that handsomely frame Takeshi Kata&#8217;s set, Brown also demonstrated a delectably dry facility with one-liners. Launching the first of several frisbees he would toss to volunteers throughout the evening, he fretted, &#8220;They are hard and sharp and fast, and you are a famously litigious culture.&#8221; He later quipped that an audience member&#8217;s writing showed her to be &#8220;something of an adventurous speller,&#8221; and instructed another, whose phone had begun beeping, &#8220;Don&#8217;t check that text message. It&#8217;s terrible news.&#8221;</p>\n<p>More seriously, though with his playful spirit still very much intact, Brown observed, &#8220;We are story-forming creatures.&#8221; The enduring thrill of his job, he added, is that it allows him &#8220;to be more alive and alert to the complexity of what it is to be real.&#8221; Whatever that may be, or seem to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Derren Brown: Secret opened September 15, 2019, at Cort Theatre and runs through January 4, 2020.

Photo: Marc Brenner</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Of the many subtle, seemingly inconsequential but spectacular choices that director Jamie Lloyd and the creative team make in the Broadway-by-way-of-London production of Harold Pinter’s late-’70s love-triangle drama <em>Betrayal</em>, perhaps the best is a song that punctuates a couple of scene changes: “Enjoy the Silence,” by English electro-pop band Depeche Mode.</p>\n<p>The haunting cover version, performed by Susanna and the Magical Orchestra, is stripped down—like the rest of the revival—so all that remains is little more than the lyrics:</p>\n<p>“All I ever wanted/ All I ever needed/ Is here—in my arms/ Words are very unnecessary/ They can only do harm.” And let’s not forget this adultery-appropriate verse: “Vows are spoken/ To be broken/ Feelings are intense/ Words are trivial/ Pleasures remain/ So does the pain.”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/09/05/betrayal-pinters-web-of-deception-returns-to-broadway-incisively/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Lloyd’s entire production is as refreshingly spare and unadorned as Pinter’s pause-packed prose. (Never doubt the intent of those pauses. Peter Hall, who directed many of Pinter’s plays in their premieres, once said in an interview: “It’s not at all absurd for Harold to ring up and say, ‘Page 37—cut the pause.’”) Though the story spans nine years—starting two years after the end of an affair between Jerry (Charlie Cox) and Emma (Zawe Ashton), the wife of his best friend, Robert (Tom Hiddleston), and traveling back to the deceptive duo’s clandestine first kiss—the actors undergo no hairstyle or clothing changes. Throughout, the duplicitous Emma wears a flowing blouse and high-waisted jeans in complementary shades of blue—the color of trust and loyalty.</p>\n<p>Similarly, while the action begins in a pub and shifts to both Jerry’s and Robert’s houses, a restaurant, the lovers’ flat, and—in the most pivotal scene—a hotel room in Venice, Italy—there is virtually no set to speak of, save a turntable that helps move the characters through time.</p>\n<p>Though projections (“two years earlier,” and so on) help guide the audience, we see the finish-to-start progression most vividly in the performances: In the first scene, thanks to the charming Cox and the stylish, just-a-touch-flirty Ashton, it’s clear why Jerry and Emma sparked. “Ever think of me?” asks Emma, clearly wanting the answer to be yes. “I don’t need to think of you,” says Jerry. “Oh?” she replies. “I don’t need to <em>think</em> of you,” he says, a bit softly. Because of course you don’t need to think of someone who’s become a part of you. Then we watch the pair cycle back to incomprehensible sadness (their breakup) to blissful faux domesticity (Emma decorates their flat with a tablecloth she bought while in Venice… with Robert) to drunken possibility (how their affair, and probably many others, first began).</p>\n<p>All the while, Robert is there. This is one of Lloyd’s possibly controversial but ultimately craftiest choices. At first, you will wonder about the logic: Even though he’s standing scarecrow-still on the back wall, won’t <em>Avengers</em> star (and Olivier Award winner) Hiddleston—whose remarkable Broadway debut is the cause for the stage-door pandemonium and scalper mania on West 45th Street—be a bit of a distraction? Actually, no. He simply fades into the background—as Ashton does when her Emma lingers near a Robert-Jerry scene, and as Cox does when his Jerry sits up against the wall during the only Emma and Robert scene (the play’s midpoint and its dramatic peak, being the moment when Robert discovers the betrayal). By keeping every actor onstage, constantly in each other’s orbits, Lloyd has captured the greatest—and most heartbreaking—truth about infidelity: The other person is <em>always</em> there.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Betrayal</em> opened Sept. 5, 2019, and runs through Dec. 8 at the Bernard B.

Photo: Marc Brenner</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Harold Pinter’s <em>Betrayal</em> has returned to Broadway less than six years after the play’s last starry, smashingly successful visit. Don’t let that dissuade you: The new production at the Jacobs is equally excellent, equally exciting, and likely to be a premium-ticket sellout for the duration of its 17-week engagement. This thanks to incisive performances from Tom Hiddleston, Charlie Cox, and Zawe Ashton, plus an intriguing and often surprising production from director Jamie Lloyd.</p>\n<p>Hiddleston—a major international star thanks to appearances in <em>The Hollow Crown</em> and <em>Thor, </em>along with other Marvel films—seems to be the magnet for excited ticketbuyers, which is all to the good. But he is also an Olivier-winning stage actor, and his performance here—always lurking, usually brooding, and ever-cautiously shielding the truth (or is he?)—enhances the power of Pinter’s play. Cox, another film superhero (<em>Daredevil</em>) with stage experience (Nick Payne’s <em>Incognito</em>, at MTC in 2016), does similarly well. The pair are well matched, demonstrating a long-time camaraderie masking the secrets and poison-tipped betrayals between them.</p>\n<p>The surprise of the evening is Ashton, who was previously unknown to this reviewer (despite numerous U.K. stage and screen credits). She offers an exceptional performance, her Emma dominating the play in a manner which the three actresses I’ve seen in prior productions have not. One of Lloyd’s several intriguing touches has Ashton slinking along the rear wall of the set like a lynx surveying prey, and you literally can’t take your eyes off her.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/09/05/betrayal-less-is-more-in-this-london-born-revival/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>If I seem hesitant to reveal Lloyd’s handiwork, it is only to preserve his several surprises for future playgoers. (Pinter’s script is spare, with few stage directions to impede directors.) He has placed his cast on an almost bare stage backed by a massive wall that stretches the entire width of the stage from wing to wing, as opposed to the bedroom/restaurant/kitchen scenery typically used in productions of the play. The design comes from Soutra Gilmour, a busy U.K. designer who picked up a Tony nomination for her one previous local visit with Lloyd’s 2012 <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em> at the Roundabout.</p>\n<p><em>Betrayal</em> seems to have grown more engrossing since its premiere. For this viewer, at least, the original Broadway production in 1980—starring Raul Julia, Blythe Danner, and Roy Scheider, with director Peter Hall and designer John Bury recreating their 1978 Royal National Theatre production—was altogether underwhelming and somewhat sleepy. The play, traveling nine years in time (mostly backward), reveals a triangular relationship among a successful publisher (Hiddleston), his gallery-owning wife (Ashton), and his best friend/her seven-year lover (Cox). The plot was taken from life. The woman in question was TV news journalist Joan Bakewell, memorably dubbed “the thinking man’s crumpet” by a British humorist; her then-husband, a BBC producer/director; and the playwright with whom she had a long affair. Pinter, that is. Bakewell later wrote her own radio play about her seven-year affair with Pinter, <em>Keeping in Touch</em>.</p>\n<p>When <em>Betrayal</em> finally reappeared in New York in 2000—with Liev Schreiber, Juliette Binoche, and John Slattery, under the direction of David Leveaux—it was something of a revelation. Pinter’s “Pinteresque” drama was now revealed to be a web of betrayals, secrets, and confessions (and false confessions) that held you riveted. I wondered at the time whether this was perhaps influenced by the fact that in 1980 I was watching three “old” characters dealing with the subject, while in 2000 I myself was 20 years older. This seems not to be the case; the play’s reputation has grown considerably since those first early productions, to the point that it can be successfully revived again and again in both London and New York with increasing audience attention and enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>Mike Nichols’ 2013 production, led by Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, and Rafe Spall, pointed up the web of infidelities—both marital and intra-personal—underpinning the play. These are further accentuated in director Lloyd’s present production, which originated in March as the capstone of his unprecedented <em>Pinter at the Pinter</em> season, which revived some 30 plays (including numerous one-acts) at the Harold Pinter Theatre.</p>\n<p>When first encountered, <em>Betrayal</em> did not by any means look like a future classic. The present production, thanks to Lloyd and his acting company, demonstrates that after 40 years, Pinter’s examination of truth and deception holds up exceedingly well.</p>\n<p><strong>Betrayal opened September 5, 2019, at Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre and runs through December 8. Tickets and information: <a href=\"https://betrayalonbroadway.com/\">betrayalonbroadway.com</a></strong></p>\n",

Photo: Richard Hubert Smith</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Some people just have to get something off their chest. They’re so intent on it that they’re ready to unburden themselves to anybody, even to strangers, maybe even preferably to strangers.</p>\n<p>Count among these determined speakers Alex (Tom Sturridge) and Abe (Jake Gyllenhaal), who are bursting so compulsively with talk that they’ve corralled no less than an entire audience to whom they direct, respectively. Simon Stephens’ <em>Sea Wall </em>and Nick Payne’s <em>A Life i</em>n the absolutely hypnotic dual monologues <em>Sea Wall/A Life</em>.</p>\n<p>Pushing up an off-stage lever to give himself light (Guy Hoare handles the subtle lighting throughout), Sturridge’s Alex presents himself in what is a difficult confession, one that he never actually gets around to. He seems to want to exculpate himself of the worst thing he has ever done, but before he can get to the whatever it is, he skids from topic to topic.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/08/08/sea-wall-a-life-fathers-and-sons-grappling-with-love-and-loss/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>He chats uncomfortably about his belief that the proof of God lies with the mathematical term pi, claiming that only God’s existence could account for the term’s indisputability. He describes a scuba-diving episode involving a sea wall and his sensations experiencing underwater weight. He drops any number of topical references, to Danny DeVito, Daniel Craig, <em>Reservoir Dogs</em>, James Elroy. A photographer, Alex talks about his lieutenant colonel father, who would never discuss his Falklands War tour.</p>\n<p>In time, he gets around to his wife Helen and daughter Lucy. He solemnly reports witnessing Lucy’s fall from a cliff (another sea wall?) during a swimming vacation with her dad, Arthur. He goes into the tragic aftermath, stalling only when he&#8217;s about to reveal what he so horrifically said at the time to Arthur. His exposed grief becomes at last the explanation for the abiding diffidence, a gnawing uncertainly that leaves him unable to know what to make of existence but hoping that knowing might someday come to him.</p>\n<p>Gyllenhaal’s Abe has a similar, yet dissimilar story to tell, which also includes a father-son as well as a father-daughter relationship. Birth and death—themes that urgently link <em>Sea Wall </em>and <em>A Life</em>—are cogitated as Abe is so fixed on his father’s death and his daughter’s birth that he blends them into one burning anecdote.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the listener(s) he’s buttonholed (read, the audience) may have the occasional challenge in following just what and whom he’s on about. Not to worry. The memory-melding is a reflection of his being overwhelmed by both the facts of life’s beginning and end. There’s a point at which he becomes so charged with boundless energy that he leaves the spotlight in which he’s been standing to race off the stage, circle the Hudson Theatre auditorium and even shuffle through a row of ticket buyers—“You can go back to sleep,” he says to one of them.</p>\n<p>During an interlude between the moving father-daughter discourse, he reports on the chat he had with his long-time girlfriend about their perhaps tying the knot. The halting exchange between them stands as one of the most charming love scenes written since George and Emily first shared a soda in Thornton Wilder’s <em>Our Town</em>.</p>\n<p>Bravos to Gyllenhaal and Sturridge for flawless performances. Their acting has to be viewed as outstanding examples of contemporary naturalism. They gesture constantly, mumble (audibly), stumble and stutter on words, assume the intermittent uncomfortable posture. Masters of their technique, they use charm profitably, with Gyllenhaal, playing the less dark figure, reaping any number of laughs. (Both had the opportunity to hone their roles when <em>Sea Wall/A Life </em>was presented last season at the Public Theater—which isn’t to say they weren’t surpassingly good then.)</p>\n<p>Surely, Stephens (the superlative <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time </em>and <em>On the Shore of the Wide World</em>) and Payne (this is his third production with Gyllenhaal, <em>Constellations</em>, among them), are grateful to Gyllenhaal and Sturridge for bringing to explosive manifestation two men intended to be representative of a guy—Abe is clearly American—and a bloke—Alex has that pronounced English accent—who are so much of our moment. Curiously, both men allude to the not-so-recent television series <em>ER</em>. Their director is Carrie Cracknell, who sure-as-shootin’ knows what she’s doing.</p>\n<p>The men do their unstoppable communicating on Laura Jellinek’s intentionally spare set, which is little more than a brick-wall stage with a rickety staircase leading to an upper walkway (Alex knocks some unidentifiable something off it in his first scary climb), a small table with a lamp and chair (none of it ever used) and an upright piano on which Gyllenhaal picks out a bit of John Lennon’s “Imagine,” a tune that neatly ties into the <em>A Life </em>plot.</p>\n<p>Luke Halls provides a late projection subtly implying that Alex and Abe are stand-ins for any number of men everywhere trying to make sense of life as we live it and only having the flimsiest success in their daily groping. That finale lifts an already exceptional production to an even higher plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Sea Wall/A Life opened august 8, 2019, at Hudson Theatre and runs through September 29.

This is particularly true in the first, <em>Sea Wall, </em>written by Simon Stephens, whose other works include <em>Heisenberg</em> and <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em>.</p>\n<p>Tom Sturridge has acted in two other Stephens plays, <em>Punk Rock</em> and <em>Wastwater. </em>Here he plays Alex, a young photographer utterly devoted to his wife, Helen, and their daughter, Lucy—to the point that he can seem awestruck simply describing the sight of Helen in a new dress, or Lucy asking her equally smitten grandfather to read to her. Alex invokes these treasures in a soft voice, at times seeming to hesitate between words, or grasp for them. The character is a sensitive soul, clearly, a man who seems easily overwhelmed; he cries frequently, he admits.</p>\n<p>But there is more than a tendency towards heightened emotion underlying the fumbling, elliptical way Alex speaks, the painful pauses and sudden shifts that pepper his monologue. The character is trying to summon the courage to tell us something, something terrible, and by the time he does—in graphic detail—Sturridge&#8217;s exquisitely raw, delicate performance has so thoroughly captured our imagination and empathy that the revelation surpasses a gut punch, becoming a full blow to the heart. &#8220;There&#8217;s a hole running through the center of my stomach,&#8221; Alex says at one point, adding, &#8220;You can probably see it.&#8221; We can.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/08/08/sea-wall-a-life-jake-gyllenhaal-tom-sturridge-in-great-nervous-shape/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Yet tragedy is not what defines <em>Sea Wall</em>, or <em>A Life</em>, penned by another acclaimed British playwright, Nick Payne (<em>Constellations</em>, <em>If There Is I Haven’t Found It Yet</em>) and starring another film and stage star known to collaborate with him, Jake Gyllenhaal. Under the fierce, tender direction of Carrie Cracknell—also a Brit, who won praise here several years back for her London-based staging of <em>A Doll&#8217;s House</em> at BAM—the plays attest to our essential will to live and love, despite the challenges these pursuits continually throw at us.</p>\n<p><em>Sea Wall</em> and <em>A Life</em> share additional themes—death, parenthood, faith, all accompanied by their own obstacles—and though not initially intended to be staged together, there are uncanny parallels, down to the wording of certain lines. But they remain very much separate, each adhering to a distinct rhythm and sensibility. Were Gyllenhaal&#8217;s fast-talking, more patently neurotic Abe to meet Sturridge&#8217;s Alex in a bar, I&#8217;m not sure they&#8217;d readily strike up a conversation, much as they&#8217;d have to discuss. (They&#8217;re even lit differently; Guy Hoare&#8217;s design has Alex simply turn on a switch, where Abe fusses, eventually choosing a spotlight that leaves much of the stage dark.)</p>\n<p>Abe, too, is father to a girl, or is about to be when <em>A Life</em> begins, with him recounting his wife revealing she&#8217;s pregnant, as he bastes a chicken. This juggling of the profound and the prosaic continues, as Abe, like Alex, veers between subjects, from that of impending fatherhood to the more sadly daunting matter of his own dad&#8217;s failing heart. But the transitions in <em>A Life</em> (also the title, incidentally, of a superb Adam Bock play, which offers a more probing look at mortality) can seem too rushed and cute, as if Payne were more interested in making a clever segue than digging into his character&#8217;s life-changing experiences, which actually occur some years apart.</p>\n<p>Gyllenhaal deftly mines the humor in the more fundamentally comedic <em>A Life</em>, and, eventually, the pathos. As Alex frantically darts—at least in recollection—from his parents&#8217; dining room to birthing classes, from the hospital where his father is dying to the one where his wife is in labor, the actor evokes the nerdy hysteria of a Woody Allen protagonist. While Alex devotes a fair amount of time to questioning God&#8217;s existence, then is driven to a sort of desperate hope, Abe finds himself mired in doubt after the most joyous of events—though we sense he&#8217;ll see his way out.</p>\n<p>Cracknell wraps the production with a dramatic flourish that places both actors on Laura Jellinek&#8217;s stark, vast set—featuring a piano that Gyllenhaal&#8217;s Abe will play, in an elegiac touch—while keeping their characters apart. It&#8217;s a shame, as I suspect each could learn something from the other, but at least both are still searching and growing, both in spite of what they&#8217;ve been through and because of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sea Wall/A Life opened August 8, 2019, at the Hudson Theatre and runs through September 29.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When taking your seat at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, where Barry Manilow is performing his <em>Manilow Broadway</em> concert through the middle of August, the usher hands you a little packet that contains a cardboard set of 3-D glasses and a glow stick.</p>\n<p>The glasses later come in handy for a brief animated film tour across Manhattan as the songwriter croons a tune from <em>This Is My Town</em>, his album of New York-related songs.</p>\n<p>As for the glow sticks—well, plenty of spectators already were waving them during Manilow’s opening number, and by the time his intermission-free show was over, some 100 or so minutes later, the auditorium was ablaze with their pale green radiance.</p>\n<p>Looking trim and sounding dandy at 76, Manilow remains a classy old-school entertainer who gives his audience a swift and enjoyable parade among his biggest song hits. Neatly supported onstage by three singers and an ace 10-member band, whose brass section lends extra brightness to the arrangements, Manilow sails through a generous sampler of his songbook with typical good cheer.</p>\n<p>“I’m so glad you still like these songs,” remarked Manilow with a smile, after delivering a fervent interpretation of “Even Now&#8221; that sent several ladies a-swooning among the front rows.</p>\n<p>Self-deprecating humor marks Manilow’s patter as he chats about his threadbare Brooklyn roots, the dimensions of his nose, and the fact that some of his tunes are more often heard in elevators. Manilow amusingly demonstrates to everyone that he once composed ad jingles to sell the likes of Band-Aid bandages and State Farm insurance.</p>\n<p>Initially sporting a bright blue swallowtail coat, Manilow subsequently rocks several glittery jackets while he energetically renders those “songs of love and special things” that indelibly comprise the personal soundtracks of so many Baby Boomers among his audience. Dramatic shafts of moving lights and some colorful visuals that are spread across the background—sunrises, beaches, even a happy face-type emoji for a bouncing ball audience singalong through “Can’t Smile Without You”—augment Manilow’s music-making.</p>\n<p>Manilow usually begins his numbers at the keyboard, but generally lets the musicians take over the instrumentals as he crosses to center stage to vocalize the greater part of a song, often concluding them with a long-held final note and a fist bump. If some of his musical keys are a tad lower than you may recall and there is an occasional vocal wobble during those extended endings, for the most part Manilow sounds as smooth as ever.</p>\n<p>Certainly Manilow remains a warm and ever-engaged performer who appears to be energized, and even genuinely touched, by his highly responsive audience, plenty of whom could not help singing right along with him. (Incidentally, many spectators obviously could not help recording portions of the show on their phones, about which taboo doings the ushers took a laissez-faire attitude.)</p>\n<p>Show highlights include Manilow’s fond tribute to his grandfather, who was the first one to recognize a little boy’s musical leanings; a soulful interpretation of “Memory” from <em>Cats</em>; and a vivacious, disco-ish dance version of “Could It Be Magic.” Late in the show, Manilow renders “Mandy” in touching harmony with a 1975 video of his younger self introducing the ever-romantic standard.</p>\n<p>A whirlwind “I Write the Songs” medley of a dozen or so hits brings <em>Manilow Broadway</em> to its conclusion and the audience to its feet (although scarcely for the first time). The encores featured an exuberant “Copacabana,” to which many spectators lent their voices as they brandished those infernal glow sticks.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Manilow Broadway opened July 26, 2019, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre and runs through August 17.

Arnold, Robyn Hurder, Holly James, and Jeigh Madjus in Moulin Rouge! The Musical! Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the 2001 film <em>Moulin Rouge!</em>—Baz Luhrmann’s flaming absinthe-soaked fever dream—Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) and his merry band of bohemians are creating a show called <em>Spectacular Spectacular</em>. In the new Broadway adaptation, titled <em>Moulin Rouge! The Musical!</em>, lest there be any confusion, librettist John Logan has changed the show-within-a-show’s title to <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>. Perhaps it’s simply another anachronistic musical reference in a piece packed with them. Maybe it’s a nod to the recent Oscar-winning Queen biopic. Or perhaps, for this glamorous theatrical extravaganza, <em>Spectacular Spectacular</em> suddenly seemed insufficient. <em>Comment dit-on</em> spectacular <em>en français?</em></p>\n<p>No disrespect to headliners Karen Olivo (a Tony winner as Anita in 2009’s <em>West Side Story</em>), who plays the tuberculosis-plagued performer/courtesan Satine, and Aaron Tveit (<em>Catch Me If You Can</em>, <em>Next to Normal</em>), as the lovestruck aspiring composer Christian but the real stars of this <em>Moulin Rouge!</em> are the artists who don’t appear onstage. Lighting designer Justin Townsend can evoke anything from a pulse-pounding nightclub to the shadowy alleys of Argentina to a hallucinogenic electric-green drunken dream. Six-time Tony winner Catherine Zuber, fresh off the elegantly appointed <em>My Fair Lady</em>, has crafted a stunning array of costumes: cascading cancan underskirts; bondage-style corsets; crushed-velvet tailcoats; and, for Olivo’s Satine, glittering bustiers, satiny robes, and body-hugging gowns. And set designer Derek McLane has turned the inside of the Hirschfeld Theatre into a crystal-studded, heart-shaped, hopelessly romantic fantasyland. Before the show starts, audience members are falling over themselves to take videos of the onstage sword swallowers and snap an artsy pic of the infamous elephant. If you didn’t post the perfect photo, did <em>Moulin Rouge!</em> really happen?</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/07/25/moulin-rouge-the-musical-all-you-need-is-love-and-showmanship/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Once the Insta-orgy dies down, director Alex Timbers (late of <em>Beetlejuice</em>) draws us into the action instantly with the irresistible French-tinged anthem “Lady Marmalade.” If you’re a fan of Luhrmann’s movie, you’ll surely recall the chart-topping soundtrack cover by Christina Aguilera, Lil’ Kim, Mya, and Pink. If you don’t know the film, you might remember Patti LaBelle singing the original disco-funk version and the then-controversial lyric “Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir.” This is our welcome to the Moulin Rouge: It’s where “sparkling diamond” Satine descends from the ceiling to perform; it’s where Christian first glimpses and falls desperately in love with her; it’s where the Duke of Monroth (Tam Mutu) decides he must possess her; it’s where painter Toulouse-Lautrec (Sahr Ngaujah), Christian, and tango dancer Santiago (Ricky Rojas) plan to produce their <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>. And it’s all presided over by ringmaster/emcee Harold Zidler (six-time Tony nominee and character actor extraordinaire Danny Burstein): “Welcome, you gorgeous collection of reprobates and rascals, artistes and arrivistes, soubrettes and sodomites,” he proclaims with a deliciously lewd grin.</p>\n<p>Fervent fans of the film will be delighted to know that this is, in large part, the <em>Moulin Rouge!</em> they know and love. The changes by Logan—a 2010 Tony winner for his Rothko bioplay, <em>Red</em>—are character-driven and relatively subtle. Toulouse-Lautrec gets a backstory, which explains why he’s always hanging around the club despite the fact that he’s broke. This Christian is more impulsive and foolish, almost blinded by love. Gone is Satine’s too-glossy veneer: She calls herself a “whore” rather than a “courtesan”; she’s not looking at the Duke as her ticket out of the nightclub and onto the legit stage; and she knows she’s trading her services for the Duke’s sizable investment in the ailing Moulin Rouge. But inside, she’s crumbling—literally and figuratively. “Do you ever feel/ Already buried deep/ Six feet under/ Screams but no one seems to hear a thing?” she sings to a mirror. (That’s Katy Perry’s “Firework,” and Olivo sells it so well you’d swear it was written for <em>Moulin Rouge!</em>) Meanwhile, Mutu’s Duke is worlds away from his insipid onscreen predecessor; he’s almost a legitimate romantic rival. When he waltzes in crooning not one but two Rolling Stones songs—“Sympathy for the Devil” and “You Can’t Always Get What You Want”—it’s no wonder Satine succumbs to his charms so quickly.</p>\n<p>Yes, there have been a few musical changes—mostly additions (many, many additions)—from the film version. But fret not: Christian and Satine still duet on Elton John’s “Your Song” in her Moroccan-chic boudoir, and the lilting “Come What May” remains their secret love song. However, if you were waiting to hear Burstein do “Like a Virgin,” you’re out of luck. His big moment is now Sia’s “Chandelier,” conceived as an alcohol-fueled delirium, and it’s bliss.</p>\n<p>The total tally of contemporary tunes packed into this turn-of-the-20th-century story: roughly 70. Still, adding Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)” into the “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend”/“Material Girl” medley is a stroke of genius. And the Act 2 opener—Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance” with a bit of “Tainted Love,” “Toxic,” and “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)” thrown in—becomes a brilliant mix of love-gone-wrong tunes. It’s also a showcase for the extraordinary work of choreographer Sonya Tayeh, who starts with a combative Argentine tango—a breathtaking pairing of Ricky Rojas and Robyn Hurder—and amplifies it into a sexy, roof-raising ensemble number.</p>\n<p>Over the top? Oh, just wait until the bows, a megamix that features pop hits from the likes of Tina Turner, Outkast, and the Human League. And, for good measure, one more drop-dead gorgeous gown for Satine.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Moulin Rouge! The Musical!</em> opened July 25, 2019, at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre.

The Musical!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> opened tonight (!), and they might as well give the Tony Award for best scenic design of a musical to Derek McLane right now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are very strong cases to be made, too, for Tonys for Catherine Zuber’s costume design, Justin Townsend’s lighting design, Peter Hylenski’s sound design, Alex Timbers’ direction, Sonya Tayeh’s choreography (in what seems to be her first Broadway effort), and, especially, Karen Olivo’s spectacular performance — and to be spectacular within a spectacle is really saying something — as Satine, the glamorous, tubercular courtesan at the center of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moulin Rouge</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s melodramatic Montmartre love triangle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the real question becomes: Can there be a Tony Award for music rights clearances? </span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/07/25/moulin-rouge-the-musical-a-dazzling-exercise-in-excess/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moulin Rouge!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em> The Musical!</em> is somehow — and quite successfully — even </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than the thoroughly over-the-top 2001 Baz Luhrmann film. There isn’t, and can’t be, all the filmic tricks Luhrman used, but it’s a busy, vibrant theatrical interpretation on stage at the Al Hirschfeld, and its beating heart is its score, even more overstuffed with pop hits than was the movie’s. It includes 70-odd hits, some of them full songs, some with reprises, some just a passage or even a line. The classics from the movie are there—Elton John, of course, and Lady Marmalade, and the greatest thing you’ll ever learn—plus a load of more recent hits (that will no doubt help thrill and draw in the kids) and other classics, even the Rolling Stones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And all those interwoven music cues are what makes this </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moulin Rouge!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> work. Congratulations on your invented award, music supervisor, arranger, and orchestrator Justin Levine! (If you try sometimes, after all, you get what you need.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s not to diminish any other parts of the staging or performance. Timbers, always an endlessly visually inventive director, hasn&#8217;t always had material that lived up to his specialties. (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rocky </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">comes to mind.) But Luhrmann’s fantasia gives Timbers license to do his best work—while creating something that is a definitively theatrical experience, not just a pale imitation of the film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working with McLane, he builds an overstuffed, gaudy 18th arrondissement of a set that leaves theatergoers happily Instagramming up until the curtain rises, all rich reds with a giant elephant and a Moulin Rouge windmill hanging over the house. Zuber’s costumes are rich and appropriately gaudy. Tayeh’s dances manage to be both explosively athletic and elegantly balletic, and naturally sexy and sultry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The performances are strong, too, but this is a musical built around the extravaganza, not about the people within it. From the first moments, the stalwart Danny Burstein displays a deliciously campy side, turning the club proprietor Harold Zidler into someone who resembles a major-chord </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cabaret</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> emcee. (Save another Tony.) Olivo, last seen on Broadway a decade ago as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">West Side Story</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s Maria—she’s a star-crossed star, it seems—is simply sensational, giving Satine the magnetism she needs and killing in her big numbers. In a show where spectacle is king, the other performers stand out less, except for the charasmastic Sahr Ngaujah as a full-sized but still somehow stunted Toulouse-Lautrec.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rivals for Satine’s love are the poor American writer Christian (Aaron Tveit, pretty as ever and also sort of sweet) and the imperious Duke of Monroth (Tam Mutu, suitably imperious), who demands Satine’s devotion as the price for his financial support of their music hall, and of the revolutionary play they’re trying to put on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monroth, naturally, grows dismayed with this play within the play, one clearly designed to mock him. “I like the dancing,” he tells Toulouse-Lautrec. &#8220;We should have more of that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that, alas, is a good summation of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moulin Rouge!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, too. Its big numbers are delicious and delightful, but when it slows down to a book scene it really slows down. The script is by John Logan, who won the Tony for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but also brought us the book for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Last Ship</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and it’s a more than creditable theatricalization of the Luhrmann’s film. But the success of the film relied entirely on its razzle-dazzle, and while Timbers has done an excellent job of creating stage razzle-dazzle, the plot machinations continue to hold little interest. Which makes the second act—oh, look, blood in a handkerchief!—a bit sloggier than the first.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when that plot is sung—belted to the rafters, sexily danced by a gorgeous ensemble, layering pop hit on top of pop hit on top of pop hit—it’s every thing the audience wants. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gitchie, gitchie, ya-ya, da-da, indeed.</span></p>\n<p><strong><b>Moulin Rouge!

Photo: Joan Marcus.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In our current political climate, it&#8217;s not hard to look back on the fraught aughts and apply something of a rosy tint. But Second Stage Theater&#8217;s new revival of <em>Dying City</em>, playwright Christopher Shinn&#8217;s response to the Iraq War, reminds us it wasn&#8217;t terribly long ago that we didn’t focus on George W. Bush&#8217;s amiable civility, or admire his painting skills.</p>\n<p>As anyone who saw Shinn&#8217;s play, a Pulitzer Prize finalist, in its original New York run in 2007 (or its world premiere in London the previous year) could tell you, his approach is hardly didactic, or grandiose; to the contrary, <em>City</em> uses the war for context in examining the personal battles fought by three characters, played by two actors: Kelly, a young therapist; her husband Craig, an Ivy League graduate student who enlists in the military and dies under circumstances made less than clear; and Peter, Craig&#8217;s gay twin brother, an actor.</p>\n<p>In scenes that alternate between the evening before Craig departs for Iraq and the night, a year after his funeral, Peter shows up unannounced to Kelly&#8217;s apartment, <em>City</em> traces the tangled, sometimes repressed emotions of the characters as they discuss their work and the war, all the while dancing around questions and doubts concerning their relationships with each other. It&#8217;s delicate, intricate stuff, and this production, which Shinn directed himself, evinces the challenges posed in making it translate into vital drama.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/06/03/dying-city-puzzling-out-a-significant-mystery-about-love-and-war/\"><em>Read Michael Sommers’ </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Despite Shinn&#8217;s thoughtful, sensitive guidance, the staging lacks a certain dynamism. The actors, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Colin Woodell, are attractive and intelligent, bringing compelling nuance to their characters. Woodell in particular distinguishes the brothers&#8217; shared struggles to contain heightened feelings without exaggerating either the often comical vanity that is the flip side of Peter&#8217;s insecurity—&#8221;The guy trainers I&#8217;ve had, it&#8217;s weird, I think they&#8217;ve all been jealous of me—my manager thinks it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m so handsome,&#8221; he tells Kelly at one point—or Craig&#8217;s more stoical machismo, which is gradually revealed as more complex, and disturbing.</p>\n<p>Then there are Kelly&#8217;s own efforts to fully comprehend, or come to terms with, a partner who likes to refer to one of her patients by a crass phrase suggesting an almost predatory need for sexual domination. Winstead makes the quandary poignant, and highlights its irony; her character is supposed to make a living helping people confront and deal with their issues, and until the end, she either can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t fully acknowledge her own spouse&#8217;s tortured pysche. But for all her grace and warmth, the actress seems emotionally muted for much of the play, as if too determined to emphasize Kelly’s relative discipline.</p>\n<p>Kelly&#8217;s exchanges with Peter, an unwanted visitor—he arrives at her apartment after having none of his calls returned, and discovering she has changed her numbers—find Winstead a bit more animated, suggesting a sense of relief, once Kelly recovers from the initial disruption. Sitting with her brother-in-law on the large, homey couch that dominates Dane Laffrey&#8217;s spare set, Winstead&#8217;s Kelly indulges his complaints about his thriving career (for a while) and engages him in debate about the larger conflicts that engulf them all.</p>\n<p>After a pair of meaningfully contrasting, inextricably intertwined scenes with Peter and Craig, however, Kelly is left alone, packing a new item into a box full of obviously painful memories as &#8220;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&#8221; plays on TV. It&#8217;s a beautifully played reflection of the line between connection and isolation—even finer now than it was when <em>Dying City</em> premiered, as this lovely, if flawed, production makes plain.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Dying City opened June 3, 2019, at Second Stage and runs through June 30.

Photo: Deen van Meer</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Terrence McNally’s 1987 two-character play observes a pair of mismatched middle-aged misfits who are stunned to discover—in the light (<em>clair</em>) of the Manhattan moon (<em>lune</em>)—that the future they’ve both long given up on might just be found in the other’s imperfect arms. Mismatched characters, yes; played here by the mismatched but equally brilliant Audra McDonald and Michael Shannon, <em>Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune</em> positively soars.</p>\n<p>That McDonald plays Frankie so well is not surprising; she has repeatedly demonstrated that she can do just about anything. It is surprising, at first, that she has chosen to undertake the role. (For those unfamiliar with the play: Frankie and Johnny begin the evening naked, figuratively and literally, in bed and out.) It doesn’t take long for us to understand why McDonald has tackled the role, and to be mighty glad that she has. McNally’s character is bound by many psychological walls, and McDonald is somehow able to show more vulnerability when Frankie throws on an kimono or jeans than when she is in the altogether.</p>\n<p>Shannon is far less familiar, Broadway-wise, his only credits being the quickly-forgotten <em>Grace</em> (at the Cort, in 2012) and a powerful Tony-nominated turn in the Jessica Lange <em>Long Day’s Journey into Night</em> in 2016. That list is deceptive, though. He started as a Steppenwolf actor, visiting off-Broadway starting in 1998 with powerful performances in Tracy Lett’s <em>Killer Joe</em> and <em>Bug</em>, plus Stephen Adly Guirgis’ <em>The Little Flower of East Orange</em>. He has gravitated to film, with Oscar-nominated roles in <em>Revolutionary Road</em> and <em>Nocturnal Animals</em>; but <em>Frankie &amp; Johnny </em>reminds us that Shannon is at core a stage creature. He is as fascinating to watch as McDonald.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/05/30/frankie-and-johnny-in-the-clare-de-lune-love-among-the-glamorous-downtrodden/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The performances of the stars are as different as—well, as Frankie (waitress at a “dirty spoon”) and Johnny (short-order cook). Combine two supercharged but diametric performances and the results might well sizzle or fizzle. These characters make an impossible pair; put them together and light the kindling, though, and McNally demonstrates that they may well be the best and last chance either of them will find. With McDonald and Shannon in Frankie and Johnny’s shoes, or rather bare feet, the stage is dazzled with lightning sparks of alternating current.</p>\n<p>Speaking of lightning sparks, these come not only from the cast but from lighting designer Natasha Katz doing a customarily expert job. The scenery, alas, leaves us puzzled. While McNally proscribes that we are in a one-room walkup in Hell’s Kitchen, Riccardo Hernández (<em>Indecent</em>) places this small apartment <em>in front of</em> a tenement exterior; it seems like Frankie has been dispossessed as in one of those Depression films, her furniture thrown out on the sidewalk. There is an effectively grand scenic reveal in the final moment of the play, but we sometimes feel like the bed is placed on the front stoop and they are stepping through a first-floor window to get to the bathroom.</p>\n<p>Otherwise we have an impeccable production from Arin Arbus, who after a decade at TFANA (Theatre for a New Audience) here makes a most welcome Broadway debut. Arbus carefully modulates her two powerhouse actors, not necessarily an easy task. The three of them, along with McNally, combine to creating an enchantedly moonlit evening.</p>\n<p>As for the author, he has had a long and varied career, starting with a couple of controversial Broadway flops. (<em>And Things That Go Bump in the Night </em>lasted two weeks in 1965; <em>Here’s Where I Belong </em>lasted one night in 1968—with McNally publicly battling to remove his librettist credit.) He moved on to a succession of new-style comedies (<em>Next!</em>, <em>Bad Habits</em>, <em>The Ritz</em>); a series of increasingly powerful plays from 1989 on (<em>The Lisbon Traviata</em>, <em>Lips Together—Teeth Apart</em>, <em>Love! Valour! Compassion!</em>); and finally significant success in the musical field (<em>Kiss of the Spider Woman</em>, <em>Ragtime</em>). <em>Frankie and Johnny</em>, in 1987, pointed the way forward to his career as a serious dramatist. It is revealed to be quite a good play, the author burrowing deep into his characters with abundant tension-alleviating humor.</p>\n<p>Let us point out that while McDonald began her Broadway career in parts created by others, her first two original roles were in McNally’s <em>Master Class</em> and <em>Ragtime</em>. It was thus inevitable, perhaps, that she should one day find herself playing another McNally role, and it turns out exceedingly well for actor and playwright both. Perhaps we’ll one day get to see Audra in <em>Master Class</em> again—this time playing Maria Callas?</p>\n<p><strong>Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune opened May 30, 2019, at the Broadhurst Theatre and runs through August 25.

Photo: Deen van Meer</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few things helpful to know before arriving at the Broadhurst Theatre: &#8220;Frankie and Johnny&#8221; is the title of a folk song and American songbook standard that Elvis recorded in 1966 for a hit record that accompanied a terrible movie. In it, Frankie kills her lover, Johnny, for cheating on her. “Clair de Lune” is the famous piano piece written by Claude Debussy. It is also the French term for moonlight. And, finally, in the original, off-Broadway production of Terrence McNally’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frankie and Johnny at the Clair de Lune</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, in 1987, Frankie was played by Kathy Bates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On West 44th Street today, in the play’s second Broadway revival, Audra McDonald is the female star. (Her Broadway predecessor was Edie Falco.) McDonald is a wonderful an actor as she is a singer, and it’s a pleasure to watch her work. But in a play about two lonely, sad, middle-aged people, a man who is desperate for love and a woman who has given up on it, it is helpful to recognize that the role was originated not by one of Broadway’s great leading ladies but by one whose body shape renders her not conventionally attractive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kathy Bates, in other words—and even 30-years-ago Kathy Bates—is a woman who, with the right styling and affect, could be seen as a woman resigned to her loneliness. Audra, like most women typically referred to by only their first names, does not.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/05/30/frankie-and-johnny-in-the-clair-de-lune-acting-brilliance-in-the-light-of-the-moon/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may go toward explaining why this impeccably performed production of McNally’s sweet, sad, and funny play, crisply staged by Arin Arbus, can feel nevertheless a bit sodden. For all the virtuosity on display, I’m not sure that we ever truly believe the characters, believe that these people are as lonely, and as needy, as the script requires them to be.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It opens in the darkness, with Johnny (Michael Shannon, with that cubist bust of a face) and Frankie in bed in darkness. We hear them before we see them: loud, vigorous, athletic sex. It ends, and it’s clear Frankie is ready for him to go. Their first date-turned-one night stand is over, and she’s wants her dingy, one-room apartment to herself. But Johnny won’t go. He’s a talker, but he’s also a romantic. Over the next two overnight hours—in that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clair </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lune</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—he’ll attempt to convince Frankie why they belong together, and she’ll try to get him to leave.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair met at work, the kind of blue-collar, working-class work that used to exist in Manhattan back when the play was written and is still set: Johnny’s a short-order cook and Frankie’s a waitress. He thinks the coincidence of their names and the song is a sign they belong together; so is the coincidence of their Allentown youths, so are a series of other coincidences. It’s unclear whether these details of his life are entirely true, or whether he’s a con artist. Clearly, as he says repeatedly, he’s there to get what he wants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnny is a rough character. He’s also sweet, maybe. To what degree he is each remains, through most of the play, unclear. Near the end of the first act, as Frankie insists that he goes and he warns that even if he does he’ll just be back. In a 2019 play, that would be the moment when he turns terrifying. Here, though, by the end of the act he has won Frankie over, mostly. If this is a year for revived toxic masculinity on Broadway—</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burn This </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is down the block, at the Hudson—Johnny’s, unlike Pale’s next door, is toxic masculinity with a heart of gold. He wins over the girl, with the help of a smarmy late-night DJ and some well-timed airplay for Debussy, and we’re left feeling, remarkably enough, hopeful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yet that hope doesn’t quite translate into feeling moved. Johnny, as played by the estimable Shannon, is a charmer, but he’s also overbearing, relentless, and slightly frightening. He wants to be in love, sure, and you can see how that might be attractive to someone. But not to Audra.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune </strong><strong>opened May 30, 2019, at the Broadhurst Theatre and runs through August 25.

Photo: Jason Mendez/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#8220;The roar of the greasepaint, the smell of the crowd,&#8221; Morrissey quipped several minutes after taking the stage of the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre Thursday night, for the first of a string of performances. The reference to a 1964 Anthony Newley/Leslie Bricusse musical—which draws heavily on music hall tradition, sends up British class distinctions, and arrived on our shores after touring across the pond—seemed a fitting way for this very English singer/songwriter to mark his own Broadway debut.</p>\n<p>Anyone expecting Morrissey to break into &#8220;Who Can I Turn To?&#8221; was, alas, disappointed. His show—set to be followed at the Lunt-Fontanne by &#8220;In Residence&#8221; appearances by Yanni, Mel Brooks and Criss Angel, with Regina Spektor also on tap—is a concert retrospective, though not the kind a certain chap from New Jersey delivered to soldout crowds last season.  Where <em>Springsteen on Broadway</em> found its titular rock hero sharing detailed, revealing stories with the audience, Morrissey spoke very little between songs, letting his trenchant, often mordantly witty lyrics communicate for him.</p>\n<p>This might come as a surprise, or a relief, as the infamously outspoken star has of late garnered more attention for his ongoing criticism of politicians and omnivores than his music. (A militant vegetarian, Morrissey has made equal-opportunity targets of McDonald&#8217;s burgers and halal meat.)  He&#8217;s also earned a reputation as a less than reliable performer, in the sense that he&#8217;s canceled or delayed dozens of shows in recent years.</p>\n<p>But Thursday&#8217;s performance started on time, and went off without incident. Morrissey&#8217;s arrival was preceded by a dizzying, extensive montage of videos, black-and-white film clips and photo galleries documenting his influences and flaunting his wide-ranging cultural literacy, including nods to American alt-rock icons from Patti Smith and the Ramones to the doomed cult performer Jobriath. Images of James Dean, Lenny Bruce and James Baldwin also turned up during the introduction and into the show, with a fabulous photo of a natty Baldwin dancing (with Lorraine Hansberry, whose face is mostly concealed) filling the large screen behind Morrissey and his band between songs.</p>\n<p>The set kicked off with &#8220;That Joke Isn’t Funny Anymore,&#8221; one of several songs included here that Morrissey made famous as frontman of the Smiths, a band that in the 1980s funneled personal alienation and social discontent into chiming, muscular pop. Other Smiths classics such as the ironically buoyant &#8220;Is It Really So Strange?&#8221; and the soaring, pulsing &#8220;How Soon Is Now&#8221; followed, with the backing musicians providing sinewy support.</p>\n<p>The majority of tunes were culled from Morrissey&#8217;s longer solo career, with just a pair of covers sprinkled in—another surprise, as one assumes these concerts are timed to promote the May 24 release of his new album, <em>California Son</em>, which consists of pop tunes from the 1960s and &#8217;70s. Morrissey performed the opening track, Jobriath&#8217;s torch-and-twang-filled &#8220;Morning Starship,&#8221; as well as the Pretenders&#8217; early-&#8217;80s gem &#8220;Back on the Chain Gang.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A more natural showman than many of the posers and mopers who populated indie rock in its &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s heyday, Morrissey was in good spirits and fine voice throughout. His resonant baritone, with its fast-charging vibrato, sounded comfortable on a Broadway stage, and he wielded and twirled his mic with characteristic finesse, particularly when the material invited a more playful spirit. Mike Baldassari&#8217;s bright, aggressive lighting brought an arena-friendly theatricality to the relatively intimate setting, adding bursts of color and rhythmic throbbing.</p>\n<p>There were sobering moments as well; during &#8220;I&#8217;m Throwing My Arms Around Paris,&#8221; a statue of a yellow-vested figure waving a French flag acknowledged current unrest in that country, as Morrissey sang, &#8220;Because only stone and steel accept my love.&#8221; A photo of a large crowd holding aloft a sign reading, &#8220;World Peace Is None of Your Business&#8221; materialized as he performed the song bearing that title, and photos of the Manchester United soccer team decimated in a plane crash nearly 60 years ago accompanied &#8220;Munich Air Disaster 1958.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The evening concluded with something of a tease: A brief encore involved a clichéd rock-star move delivered with predictable cheek, then followed by an unsettling twist. As with any show, it would be unsporting to say more about the ending, but the faithful who filled the audience—many remaining on their feet throughout the night—plainly left satisfied.</p>\n<p><strong>Morrissey opened May 2, 2019, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre and runs through May 11.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s showtime at the Winter Garden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, if we’re being technical, it’s showtime and then showtime again, because the very wink-wink-nudge-nudge stage version of Tim Burton’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beetlejuice</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gives us the iconic line once, first from the titular ne’er-do-well ghost, and then again, later on, from the square ghoul Adam, mocking him. In fact, if we’re really being honest, the line is there three times, starting out on an undersling hanging from the marquee out front.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words: It’s showtime! It’s showtime! It’s showtime!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And thus is conjured a very enjoyable, very self-aware, very slick, very tuneful, very constructed-to-please-the-crowds new Broadway musical. It opened tonight at the Winter Garden, that frequent home to now-and-forever-running staples, and it’s nearly guaranteed to follow suit.</span></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/25/beetlejuice-tim-burtons-1988-cult-film-kinda-musicalized/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the best part is: It’s a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> good tourist show.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The extravaganza begins well before the curtain goes up. The house lighting is all in purples and greens, to match the show’s colors, and the ushers are in themed neckties, instead of the usual collage of Shubert marquee. A version of the Danny Elfman movie theme plays. Green and purple spotlights sweep the audience. You’re </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in for a show</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that is what’s delivered. From the first notes of “Day-O” that kick off the story even before the houselights go down, to the charmingly frenetic lead performance from Alex Brightman (last seen on Broadway, on this very stage, as Dewey in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">School of Rock</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, another successful film-to-stage transfer), to the catchy, pastichey score from the Australian composer-lyricist Eddie Perfect, to the over-the-top set and staging by designer David Korins (who has a Tony for Hamilton) and director Alex Timbers (who has brought us such wonders as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter and the Starcatcher</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) — all of it builds to a perfectly, wonderfully, showbizzy good time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The script, from Scott Brown and Anthony King, manages to entirely rework the movie’s story while keeping its essence, and hitting all of the required high points. (Brown and King’s previous musical was the downtown charmer </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gutenberg! The Musical</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, directed by Timbers. Brown went on to spend several years as the theater critic at </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> magazine, at which point I — and likely every other reviewer — developed a friendly, nod-across-the-aisle acquaintance with him.) The chain-smoking functionary who runs the underworld is still there, and so are the dead football players and the guy with the shrunken head. The sandworm is still there, though more as a warning than a real threat. (No greenscreen here.) Harry Belafonte tunes are played prominently, as the good time we are to have demands they must.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But much of these things appear not quite where you expect them. Brown and King turn </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beetlejuice</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> into Lydia’s story; it’s driven forward by the sad goth teen who moves into the house Beetlejuice is haunting. It opens at her mother’s funeral (gorgeously staged in purples and blacks, nodding nicely at a Burtonesque world), and it’s her journey to reconnect with her father. (It helps that she’s played by Sophia Anne Caruso, who’s terrific.) And yet despite that opening, and despite Beetlejuice’s repeated, fourth-wall-breaking insistence that this is a musical about death, it actually removes most of the movie’s notes of melancholy. The sudden death of Adam and Barbara, the kind couple who own the Victorian house that Lydia (and Beetlejuice) eventually move into, can’t be a surprise anymore, but here it’s also played for laughs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re probably the weakest part of the show, a sort of dull backup chorus. They’re played by two fine and funny actors, Rob McClure and Kerry Butler, but their characters are too milquetoast to register. (In the movie, it’s their story.) On the other hand, Lydia’s daffy stepmom, Delia — she’s now a life coach having an affair with dad — is here even daffier, and, as portrayed by Leslie Kritzer, a scene-stealer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s those big performances that work best here — Jill Abramovitz, wonderfully ridiculous in a bit part as an investor’s vacant wife, is a standout — because the whole show is so big. William Ivey Long&#8217;s costumes are exaggerated and hilarious; Connor Gallagher&#8217;s choreography almost gets lost among all the movement and exuberance. The movie had some nuance; this pull-out-the-stops musical doesn’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if this </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beetlejuice</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has a flaw, it’s that: In its insistence on entertaining you, it’s a story about death with tons of life but maybe not quite as much soul.</span></p>\n<p><strong><b>Beetlejuice opened April 25, 2019, at the Winter Garden Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Alex Brightman—a chunky lad with a twinkle in his eye and a surname that only begins to describe his abilities—revels in entertaining. He could easily be dubbed our new Master of the Revels. In <em>School of Rock</em>, he ruled the raucous, yet relatively mild proceedings as an obstreperous music teacher. Now he’s back at the Winter Garden (undoubtedly in the dressing room he only vacated some short time ago) as a trouble-making fellow from the netherworld who’s hoping to gain some traction in this world.</p>\n<p>He’s doing his hot thing in the Scott Brown-Anthony King musical adaptation—songs by Eddie Perfect—of Tim Burton’s 1988 flick with the same catchy name. (On the show curtain it’s spelled “Betelgeuse,” if you want to get fussy). Brightman is so good at what he does that bookwriters Brown and King were wise to adjust their script from the one Michael McDowell and Larry Wilson carpentered so that Beetlejuice, wearing his frayed black-and-white striped outfit (suggesting the jailed-criminal aspect of his personality) doesn’t make a late entrance to the shenanigans.</p>\n<p>Beetlejuice starts the action with a meta-theatrical address to the audience during which he says things like any cellphone users will die at his hand. He then goes on to lead cast members in “The Whole ‘Being Dead’ Thing,” a rousing Perfect number that promises several coffins full of eventual fun that, as it turns out, is only partially met. No discredit to the effervescent Brightman, who relishes informing the ticket buyers more than once that “this is a show about death.”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/25/beetlejuice-these-ghosts-are-gonna-live-forever/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Movie-goers making up the <em>Beetlejuice</em> cult (many of them obviously present at the performances I attended) know the initial storyline has it that happily-married Barbara and Adam, in their capacious semi-Victorian home get, themselves deceased in a car accident but stay incorporeally on to see with great chagrin new homeowners Charles, Delia and daughter Lydia move in.</p>\n<p>Adam and Barbara are so outraged in their understated way that they consult The Book of the Recently Deceased, hoping to find a way to dislodge the interlopers. It’s a strategy that to their eventual dismay leads to the calculating Beetlejuice joining them. It also transpires that gloomy Lydia, who can see Barbara and Adam, whereas Charles and Delia can’t, is caught up in the ridding-the-new-family scheme.</p>\n<p>Fooling around with the McDowell-Wilson plot, Brown and King have decided to shift the storyline’s weight around so that Lydia (Sophia Anne Caruso) is equal, if not more so, to Barbara (Kerry Butler) and Adam (Rob McClure) in realizing their disparate needs. (Check the billing of the three to see how that falls out.) Lydia now is mourning her mother, whose burial figures in the kick-off sequence.</p>\n<p>Her dad Charles (Adam Dannheiser) and Delia (Leslie Kritzer) are now only affianced. (Incidentally, <em>Beetlejuice</em> mavens: Barbara and Adam meet their end in this telling not by drowning when their car drops into ol&#8217; man river but by falling through their living room floor. How’s that for a surprise double demise?).</p>\n<p>So with the adjusted book, audiences are now treated to this watered down, gussied up <em>Beetlejuice</em>. The production seesaws somewhat precariously between the dead Adam and Barbara, and the spots-the-dead Lydia. Adam and Barbara, sometimes throwing sheets over themselves to appear as traditional ghosts, seem to be fighting for attention with Lydia’s wanting to resurrect her mother. All the while, the comically desperate Beetlejuice contrives to do his handwringing worst.</p>\n<p>Put another way, <em>Beetlejuice</em> becomes a hodge-podge of events and numbers, some amusing, some not so amusing. Fans of the flick are likely to recall that Barbara and Adam decide one way to get the staunch Charles and the slinky Delia to flee the place is to have them ruin a supper for business guests by segueing into a version of the Jamaican folk song “Day-O (The Banana Boat Song),” Harry Belafonte’s 1956 hit—with the two of them channeling Belafonte’s voice. It’s a sequence that becomes an impromptu group dance, and it retains the capacity to rouse observers—but maybe not so much here as it does in the film, and not just because Dick Cavett is one of the celluloid participants but not present on stage.</p>\n<p>The other first-rate number is “That Beautiful Sound,” which starts act two and refers to the screams ghouls regularly elicit when they’re on form. Otherwise, the Eddie Perfect songs are hit-or-miss, many of the hits in large part due to how they’re sung. Several times Caruso accounts for those with bell-ringers; “Dead Mom” and “Home,” prominent among them. (N.B.: If the number of off-rhymed lyrics were to be tallied, Perfect—who also supplied the ditties for this season’s <em>King Kong</em>—could henceforth become known as Eddie Imperfect.)</p>\n<p>Alex Timbers directs <em>Beetlejuice</em>, and lives up to his (sometimes overrated) reputation. Among other savvy moves, he hires a handful of the above-mentioned Broadway sparkplugs, as well as additional sparkplugs like Danny Rutigliano and Jill Abramovitz, who plays not one, but two chuckle-inducing drop-ins.</p>\n<p>Director Timbers has also relied on the creative team to come across with all sorts of eye-catching and funny-bone tickling special effects. This lengthy and worthy list features choreographer Connor Gallagher, set designer David Korins, costumer William Ivey Long (who from show to show can’t stop topping himself), lighting designer Kenneth Posner, sound designer Peter Hylenski, projection designer Peter Nigrini, puppet designer Michael Curry, special effects designer Jeremy Chernick, and magic and illusion designer Michael Weber. Thanks be to all of them for toiling above and beyond the call of duty.</p>\n<p>Those identified directly above can be considered responsible for what passes by with much more allure than might be attributed to yet another of the many, many popular movies endlessly brought to the stage for nothing more cogent than its being a popular film and therefore impressing producers as a marquee temptation for movie lovers.</p>\n<p>By the way, at the end of a scene wherein the manipulative Beetlejuice hasn’t successfully wheedled what he was after, he goes to exit through a door but before he completes the departure, he swivels to the audience and says, “Fuck <em>Brigadoon</em>.”</p>\n<p>Putting aside the obscenity—always an easy laugh about which Brown and King should be embarrassed—think of what this at-best-mediocre tuner has to say of a predecessor musical comedy that can rightfully boast a top-drawer Alan Jay Lerner-Frederick Loewe score, top-drawer Agnes de Mille choreography, a charming and clever Lerner book, and top-drawer Robert Lewis direction. To play with another cliché: <em>Beetlejuice</em> isn’t worthy to shine the earlier musical’s singing-and-dancing shoes.</p>\n<p><strong><b>Beetlejuice opened April 25, 2019, at the Winter Garden Theatre.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The roaring lion against the timid lamb. The giant Goliath against defenseless David. The Fleet Street hierarchy against an Aussie sheep farmer. Everybody loves the underdog. James Graham, in his play <em>Ink</em>, spins a yarn for our times about a <em>true</em> underdog. A foul, grasping, immoral, and altogether despicable underdog. Against all odds, Graham gets us to vehemently root for this antihero—whose name is, yes, Rupert Murdoch—and vicariously share, from the edge of our seats, in his improbable early victory.</p>\n<p>This is Murdoch in 1969, before—well, before everything. Having built a chain of newspapers in his native Australia, the thirtysomething small-pond magnate comes to London but finds the doors of the journalistic gentlemen’s club barred to him. So he buys a failing paper (<em>The Sun</em>, “a right pile of crap”) being off-loaded by its corporate owner, the top-of-the-line <em>Mirror</em>. He sets out to create “a popular paper to reach the forgotten people,” and—with the help of garish headlines, near-nude models, gossip about the Royals, circulation-boosting giveaways, and features on sex and kittens—proceeds within a year’s time to irremediably alter the genteel world of the fourth estate into a battlefield in which you-know-who cannot fail to win.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/24/ink-springtime-for-murdoch/\"><em>Read Elysa Gardner’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Can Graham, and director Rupert Goold, expect us to <em>root</em> for him?</p>\n<p>No, they don’t expect us to; they more or less <em>force</em> us to. Murdock (Bertie Carvel) joins with Larry Lamb (Jonny Lee Miller), a talented <em>Mirror</em> editor whose working-class Yorkshire background prevents him from getting the top job at any Establishment paper. Murdock offers Lamb control, plus carte blanche;  it’s the rough-and-tumble uncouth against the world. Lamb poaches a ragtag crew of underappreciated (and lower-class) veterans, and from the moment this “ship of undesirables” goes to press—with a blaring and unprecedented new masthead of fiery red—the tabloid wars begin.</p>\n<p>When the reformulated <em>Sun</em>’s daily circulation breaks the million mark, one fogey at the <em>Mirror</em> explains that there’s nothing to worry about, it’s David throwing stones at Goliath. To which owner Cudlipp (Michael Siberry) retorts “David and Goliath? Percy, do you not know how it ends in your own fucking metaphor!” We—at least, most of the audience for <em>Ink</em>—know how it ends, with this charmingly awkward Murdoch ultimately dominating. But Graham is interested only in the beginnings, and it makes a roisterous tale.</p>\n<p>Carvel, as always, is a marvelous chameleon of an actor. He is best known for his Olivier- and Tony-winning performance as Miss Trunchbull in <em>Matilda</em>, but he first came to prominence as Leo Frank in the 2007 Donmar Warehouse production of <em>Parade</em>. (Leo Frank, Trunchbull, Murdoch. Any other actors you can think of likely to shine in these three roles?) In <em>Ink</em>, which won him a second Olivier, Carvel is marvelously slimy: hunched in a forward-leaning slump, hiding behind a permanent false smile, cackling and snapping his way through the evening like Uriah Heep. And powerful: Carvel’s hands look normal enough, but when he extends his forefinger to make a point or issue a command, that finger appears to be a lethal threat and don’t you dare refuse.</p>\n<p>He remains letter-perfect on this side of the Atlantic. But unlike this season’s other sterling London transfers, <em>Ink</em> has traveled with only one cast member. This might ordinarily be a source of concern, even with the complete creative team intact, given how spectacularly dynamic Graham’s play was at the Duke of York’s. But an unexpected thing has happened here at the Friedman. The London Lamb (Richard Coyle) was excellent, perfectly complementing Carvel. But Carvel thoroughly dominated <em>Ink</em>, despite far less stage time. We watched him in rapt fascination and eagerly awaited his next entrance, while Lamb helpfully pushed the plot along.</p>\n<p>For Broadway, Goold has added into the mix Jonny Lee Miller, winner of a 2011 Olivier for his acclaimed performance in the National’s <em>Frankenstein</em> (and best known hereabouts for his starring role as Sherlock Holmes in the long-running TV series <em>Elementary</em>). It becomes immediately apparent that Miller is a phenomenal actor, so much so that he singlehandedly upends <em>Ink</em>. Which is to say that with Miller as Lamb, the character becomes equal. So instead of waiting for the marvelous Carvel to reappear, we remain thoroughly engaged by Miller as he pushes <em>The Sun</em> along its sinuous uphill journey.</p>\n<p>Miller is terrific; always plotting, always thinking, always suspicious of Murdoch. (When excited, Miller’s Lamb actually seems to be dancing in place to silent music.) In my view, this makes Graham’s play even more powerful than in London. The rest of the cast is equivalent to the original group: all quite good, with a few standing out. Here, these include Siberry, most recently prominent in <em>Junk</em>, as the <em>Mirror</em> owner watching his inevitable downfall at the hands of the barbarian; Rana Roy as the cheesecake model, who plays a climactic scene opposite Miller and more than holds her own; Andrew Durand, who started the season adding needed comedy to <em>Head Over Heels</em>, as the gold-tressed photographer called Beverley; and Bill Buell and David Wilson Barnes as ink-stained hacks. It’s Miller who in the heat of the battle finds himself <em>literally</em> ink-stained, a wonderful touch.</p>\n<p>Director Goold (<em>King Charles III</em>) originated <em>Ink</em> at his artistic home, the Almeida, after which it transferred to the West End. His production team is all-round superb, led by scenic and costume designer Bunny Christie. Lights are by Neil Austin; the projections, which cascade up and down the back wall, are by Jon Driscoll; and sound and the exceptionally effective music is by Adam Cork. As an example, they all combine for a bravura sequence in which we see copy go from the reporter’s typewriter through numerous stages to the finished paper, the entire set turned into a frenzied foundry with molten lead funneling down from above and somehow resembling the Frankenstein monster. (One of the last hyper-scenic sequences we&#8217;ve seen on this scale was in designer Christie&#8217;s <em>Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em>.)</p>\n<p>The Manhattan Theatre Club hosts the Broadway run in partnership with the Almeida and Sonia Friedman. Let us add, parenthetically, that three of the supreme highlights of this New York theatergoing season—<em>The Ferryman</em>, <em>The Jungle</em>, and <em>Ink</em>—were produced on the West End and brought stateside by Friedman.</p>\n<p>The evening begins with Murdoch and Lamb, prior to embarking on their venture, considering what makes a good story (or more specifically, in their expletive-laden jargon, “a good fucking story”). After all has been said and seen, the evening ends with Murdoch telling us, “It’s a good story. People like stories.” It is, and we do.</p>\n<p><strong>Ink opened April 24, 2019, at the Samuel J.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Long before Fox News was a twinkle in his eye, an ambitious Australian named Rupert Murdoch set out to remake a British newspaper for fun and profit. He wound up forever changing the media landscape abroad and, eventually, here—and not, most readers of this review would likely agree, for the better.</p>\n<p>But before we judge Murdoch, again, let&#8217;s pause to consider all the abettors he&#8217;s had over the past 50 years, since the time that James Graham&#8217;s <em>Ink</em>, the new play tracing his takeover of <em>The Sun</em> and its subsequent rise as a tabloid, unfolds. Some he could not have foreseen, like the digital advances that have made his give-the-people-what-they-want approach so much easier to monitor. Of course, had at least a good chunk of the people not wanted the sensationalism and bottom-feeding he sanctioned—and editors not been willing to serve it to them—Murdoch might well have become a footnote in history, rather than one of the most successful and controversial moguls of our time.</p>\n<p>As <em>Ink</em> arrives on Broadway, after garnering acclaim at London&#8217;s Almeida Theatre and on the West End, Murdoch&#8217;s empire may be in a tenuous position; Disney now owns much of it. But the populist principles on which he reshaped or founded numerous news outlets are positively thriving, not only in American and British politics but throughout media—including some of the print and online publications and networks that have criticized Murdoch and the politicians and policies he&#8217;s supported, from Donald J. Trump to Brexit, most vociferously.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/24/ink-rupert-murdoch-against-the-world-and-the-mirror/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p><em>Ink</em> opens with a thirtysomething Murdoch, played by English actor Bertie Carvel (last seen on Broadway as the cartoonishly tyrannical school headmistress Miss Trunchbull in <em>Matilda the Musical</em>) appealing to Larry Lamb, a veteran journalist from working-class Yorkshire stock who left another tabloid, the <em>Mirror</em>, after peaking as sub-editor. &#8220;All they’ve ever done is take from you,&#8221; Carvel&#8217;s stridently seductive Murdoch says, pouncing like the snake in the garden. &#8220;That&#8217;s what the Establishment does.&#8221; Sound like a familiar pitch?</p>\n<p>Lamb takes the bait and, under Rupert Goold&#8217;s characteristically flashy direction (a good fit for the subject matter), begins assembling his staff. Nubile female singers in swinging &#8217;60s garb sashay through costume and scenic designer Bunny Christie&#8217;s industrial circus of a set, which has desks stacked on top of each other, as <em>The Sun</em>&#8216;s new editor combs Fleet Street, hopping from bar to bathhouse and forming a dancing line with the fellow vets and newbies who will be his charges. Their directive? &#8220;I just want something &#8230; &#8216;loud,'&#8221; Murdoch tells Lamb. And ideally, the arch capitalist would like to top the<em> Mirror</em>&#8216;s massive circulation—within a year.</p>\n<p>Lamb, played with both increasingly aggressive intensity and a palpable sense of inner conflict by an excellent Jonny Lee Miller, pursues that goal with a vengeance, encouraged by his boss. &#8220;Get the readers to become the storytellers,&#8221; Murdoch urges, again seeming eerily prescient. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that the real endpoint of the revolution? When they&#8217;re producing their own content themselves?&#8221; He seeks a &#8220;disruption,&#8221; that most trendy of terms in 2019.</p>\n<p>But Graham, and Carvel, know better than to make Murdoch a simple prophet of doom, or a two-dimensional villain, for that matter. When the kidnapping of Muriel McKay, the wife of Murdoch&#8217;s deputy chairman, is traced in <em>Ink</em>&#8216;s second act, it&#8217;s Lamb who insists in exploiting the crime to drive up circulation, as a plainly ruffled Murdoch—who has, admittedly, fueled his editor&#8217;s ambition with both positive and negative reinforcement—contests his decisions, if never quite managing to squelch them.</p>\n<p>Another woman&#8217;s plight haunts <em>Ink</em>, as the passing time is cleverly noted by supertitles atop Jon Driscoll&#8217;s headline-blasting projection design. &#8220;Page One&#8221; and &#8220;Page Two&#8221; are naturally followed by &#8220;Page Three,&#8221; which happens to be the feature launched by the new <em>Sun</em> on its first birthday in 1970 (and maintained until 2015), displaying a young woman posing topless. Rana Roy is cast as the first model, Stephanie Rahn, born Kahn, to an Indian father. In a nod to our times, Graham makes Rahn a key character, giving her opportunities to confront Lamb about her exploitation; Miller&#8217;s nuanced reading of his frank, not dismissive response underlines how deeply his character&#8217;s more humane impulses have been challenged.</p>\n<p>Murdoch is also humanized in part by his ironic distaste for <em>The Sun</em>&#8216;s naughtier antics. In one of the play&#8217;s funniest showcases for Graham&#8217;s sharp, rapid-fire dialogue, Murdoch objects to &#8220;Knickers Week,&#8221; a pre-Page Three publicity stunt, pointing out that his then-wife, Anna, is Catholic, and that he&#8217;s uneasy with the gimmick as well. &#8220;A pair of ladies&#8217;&#8230;?&#8221; he begins, then asks Lamb, &#8220;Why did they have to be in a tin?&#8221; Like his sympathy for the McKays, though, Murdoch&#8217;s prudishness could reflect more a sense of loyalty to those who serve him than fellow feeling for the masses he claims to champion.</p>\n<p><em>Ink</em>&#8216;s superb cast also prominently features Michael Siberry as Hugh Cudlipp, chairman of the Mirror Group and then the International Publishing Corporation—the face of the Establishment Murdoch lambasts. Though reluctant, Cudliff finally acknowledges the ground shifting beneath him, but not before offering Lamb, his former colleague and nemesis, a few cautionary words.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pander to and promote the most base instincts of people all you like, fine, create an appetite, but I warn you,&#8221; Cudlipp says. &#8220;You’ll have to keep feeding it.&#8221; If it&#8217;s too late to kill the beast Murdoch has nourished over decades, <em>Ink</em> at least encourages us to reflect on its growth—and, if we&#8217;re fair, our own accountability in that.</p>\n<p><strong>Ink opened April 24, 2019, at the Samuel J.

As the current season whimpers to a close, <em>Tootsie</em> enters the lists with a considerable store of laughter, melody, and charm. In this dismal season—which started with the unconvincing <em>Head Over Heels</em> and the altogether dire <em>Gettin’ the Band Back Together</em>—<em>Tootsie</em>, in that red sequined dress, looks pretty good. From the first blast of the overture, you think: Ah, yes, musical comedy again!</p>\n<p>Composer/lyricist David Yazbek, who now brings forth his fifth Broadway effort, has continually demonstrated craft, skill, and a determination to change course thematically. His most recent musical, last season’s Tony-winning <em>The Band’s Visit</em>, was a new-style musical as exotic as the jasmine-scented breeze he contrived. Here, he is working more in the vein of his early <em>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</em>. The songs are attractive and the lyrics funny, so much so that we look forward to a second hearing. The book comes from Robert Horn, a TV writer whose only Broadway credit is <em>13 The Musical</em>. Don’t let this resume cause trepidation; it turns out that Horn is <em>very</em> funny and has a sharp understanding of how to fashion his libretto. Laughter—from dialogue, lyrics, sight gags, choreography, and even costumes—keeps coming.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/23/tootsie-theyve-got-big-heels-to-fill/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>That <em>Tootsie</em> is laugh-filled is not exactly surprising, given the supremely funny 1982 motion picture from which the musical has sprung. That’s the one in which perennially out-of-work actor Michael Dorsey finds himself auditioning for the role of a nurse on one of those hospital soap operas of the time. He—or rather she, now in the persona of Dorothy Michaels—gets the part. The film is marvelously contrived and successful on all levels. At least by 1982 terms.</p>\n<p>By present-day standards, though, the original plot is problematic. The notion of an assertively aggressive and chauvinistic man masquerading in a dress and taking a job from a woman is, nowadays, less than amusing. Even more treacherous are repeated instances of male behavior that would get a current-day studio executive or corporate leader fired. (A powerful politician, not necessarily.) Once in a dress, the film Dorothy was propositioned by most everybody. “She” fought them off, and it was all played for laughs. Today, though, it’s no laughing matter.</p>\n<p>Rather than simply trying to recreate the film with tempered sexism, Horn and Yazbek—recognizing the danger—have instead taken the gist of the plot and refashioned it. The soap opera milieu has been replaced by a Broadway musical, understandably so as it allows considerable dancing. More specifically, the constant instances of men hitting on Dorothy have been whittled to one, haplessly hangdog suitor. An important and tender film subplot, in which the father of the leading lady falls in love with and proposes to Dorothy, is gone altogether.</p>\n<p>The result is that the plot gears work satisfactorily for today’s audiences, retaining the high jinks and gibes from Larry Gelbart&#8217;s screenplay while hopefully avoiding offense. (A significant portion of the audience early in the run is likely to be familiar with the original, and perhaps miss some highlights; but the vast Broadway audience, nowadays, is likely unfamiliar with the film.) Director Scott Ellis (<em>Kiss Me, Kate</em>) has smoothly wrapped this musical comedy package, while Denis Jones (<em>Honeymoon in Vegas</em>) provides the sterling choreography. A dance combination from the show-within-the-show’s director/choreographer—“bounce bounce bounce bounce, Fosse arm, Fosse arm” etc.—is so outlandishly successful that they manically repeat it several times. Word to the wise: don’t rush out early in the curtain call.</p>\n<p>David Rockwell (<em>Hairspray</em>) provides the versatile set design, while William Ivey Long (<em>The Producers</em>, <em>Hairspray</em>) outdoes himself with gloriously garish ’50s garb for the musicalized <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. Orchestrations are by Simon Hale (from Yazbek’s <em>Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown</em>), and they perfectly highlight the score. Andrea Grody leads the band with aplomb and hair bouncing in the orchestra pit, giving audiences a chance to actually see her after being restricted to a backstage bandbox at <em>The Band’s Visit</em>. For what it’s worth, Grody is the one and only non-male on the creative team of this musical celebrating empowerment.</p>\n<p>The cast is led by Santino Fontana (<em>Cinderella</em>, <em>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</em>). The actor has displayed so much talent over his career that you might well walk in expecting him to shine in the role. He does not disappoint: His acting, singing, and charm allow him to carry the show with the ease of a young Jerry Orbach. We also get welcome glimpses of Dustin Hoffman, who was intrinsically intertwined with the cinema creation of Michael/Dorothy. There is a leading lady on hand, portrayed by Lilli Cooper (<em>SpongeBob Squarepants</em>). Given that she doesn’t have high-comedy material and certain facets of her screen character have been whittle down, she can’t quite compete with the others.</p>\n<p>Fontana is given two altogether perfect foils. Sarah Stiles, a Tony nominee for <em>Hand to God</em>, plays Michael’s non-girlfriend Sandy and is letter perfect. Yazbek starts her off with a rapid-fire song called “What’s Gonna Happen”—a cousin to the “Model Behavior” that Laura Benanti romped through in <em>Women on the Verge</em>—and Stiles can thereafter do no wrong. Andy Grotelueschen (of the 2015 Roundabout <em>Into the Woods</em>) makes an amusing best friend until Yazbek allows him to explode with a showstopper of his own (“Jeff Sums It Up”) at the top of the second act.</p>\n<p>Two veteran character comedians also shine. Reg Rogers plays director/choreographer Ron Carlisle, a newly conceived role replacing what had been the TV director. Rogers plays him as a narcissist at the end of his rope and is altogether droll. Michael McGrath is hardly visible as the agent Stan Fields, but he is a one-man comedy powerhouse and his limited stage time pays off. His &#8220;take&#8221; as he puzzles over the uncanny similarities between Michael and Dorothy is protean, so much so that you wonder if the folks over at <em>Hamilton</em> hear the explosion of laughter. (I suppose we could call this a “door-take,” as McGrath somehow fuels and extends the stream of laughter by hiding behind a door.)</p>\n<p>Is this a potential addition to the list of classic Broadway musicals? No; but <em>Tootsie</em> is fast and funny. Very funny, with a rapid stream of jokes and gags and some of the most mirthful choreography since those <em>Mormon </em>boys went to Uganda. Plus, it&#8217;s got no fewer than five skillful comedy performances. After months in the mirthless Broadway musical desert, let’s be appreciative of the evening’s accomplishments.</p>\n<p><strong>Tootsie opened April 23, 2019, at the Marquis Theatre and runs through January 5, 2020.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>How do you take a 1982 movie about a badly behaved male actor who dresses as a woman for profit and rethink it as a viable property in the #MeToo era? The creators of the Broadway musical <em>Tootsie</em>—librettist Robert Horn (<em>13 the Musical</em>, TV’s <em>Designing Women</em>) and phenomenally versatile composer-lyricist David Yazbek (<em>The Full Monty</em>, <em>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</em>), a 2017 Tony winner for his score for last year’s Best Musical, <em>The Band’s Visit</em>—are no fools: Call out your main character’s outrageous antics.</p>\n<p>“You can’t be serious,” says Jeff (Andy Grotelueschen) to his roommate, Michael Dorsey (<em>Cinderella</em> Tony nominee Santino Fontana, in the role that Dustin Hoffman made famous onscreen). “At a time when women are literally clutching their power back from between the legs of men, you have the audacity to take a job away from one by perpetrating one?” And, adds Jeff for good measure, “you know you’ll have to take a pay cut.”</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/23/tootsie-a-man-playing-a-man-playing-a-woman-playing-a/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Yes, <em>Tootsie</em> has been brought into the 21st century—even if Dorothy Michaels, Michael Dorsey’s alter ego, hasn’t. She still wears a hair helmet, frumpy midcalf skirts, and pantyhose, which no one seems to question. Except Jeff, who describes Dorothy’s style as “Faye Dunaway as a gym coach, glittering clearance sale Jack Sparrow.” One other very smart update: The part Dorothy gets is in a Broadway musical, the destined-for-Joe-Allen’s-wall <em>Juliet’s Curse</em>; she’s cast as the Nurse. (Fans of the film might remember that Dorothy landed a recurring role as a hospital administrator in a soap opera—a very ’80s form of entertainment if ever there was one.) Also: Michael’s love interest, Dorothy’s costar Julie (<em>SpongeBob SquarePants</em>’ Lilli Cooper), turns out to be much more, shall we say, open to experimentation in this incarnation.</p>\n<p><em>Tootsie</em> is full of terrific moments: Yazbek’s delightfully pessimistic lyrics (one song repeats the line “you fucked it up,” to great effect); supporting turns from the sidesplittingly funny Sarah Stiles as hopelessly insecure neighbor Sandy (“My phone no longer recognizes my face I.D. unless I’m crying!”) and perennial scene-stealer Julie Halston as producer Rita, über-chic in an Ann Richards–white wig and a brocade Jackie O–inspired suit (“Dorothy, I’m rich. Not in family or friends. In money, the good rich”); lush—and magically magnetic—costumes by William Ivey Long (they go from the Renaissance to 1950s Cinecittà glam with a mere twirl of a skirt); and, most important, a genuinely believable, winning performance by Fontana, who’s so darn convincing as Dorothy that when he starts to sing as Michael it simply sounds wrong.</p>\n<p>But it’s not all sequins and light. Unlike in the film, the egotistic hack director, here played by Reg Rogers, isn’t dating the leading lady—or treating her worse than anyone else. (Broadway Julie is too smart for that.) Yet during rehearsals of <em>Juliet’s Curse</em>, Julie and Dorothy develop an instantaneous bond—so powerful that Julie helps this bespectacled second banana in sensible square-heeled pumps overhaul the show and usurp her spotlight. Not only that, but the creative team inexplicably jumps on board with Dorothy’s rewrites and design changes. Is <em>Tootsie</em> actually a fairy tale? And on that subject: Regarding Sandy’s comment that “if you lose your shoe at midnight you’re probably drunk”—when did Broadway start quoting Instagram?</p>\n<p>Let’s not kid ourselves—<em>Tootsie</em> will always be a little old-fashioned, no matter how evolved Dorothy and her pals get. But in that famous sparkly red dress, she looks right at home on Broadway.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tootsie</em> opened April 23, 2019, at the Marquis Theatre and runs through January 5, 2020.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The moment when Joe Keller speaks the three words that lend Arthur Miller’s <em>All My Sons</em> its title is, in this reviewer’s opinion, one of the most devastating in American dramatic literature. That’s if it’s not the downright most devastating. Because the 1947 <em>All My Sons</em> is, also in this reviewer’s opinion, Miller’s best play (peace to <em>Death of a Salesmen</em>, <em>The Crucible</em>, <em>The Price</em> partisans), I have seen <em>All My Sons</em> as often as I can and have never heard the three little words spoken without feeling as if they’ve been a deliberate unpulled punch in my gut.</p>\n<p>The Sonny Liston-sized wallop happened again when Tracy Letts, playing Joe in the current revival, uttered his “all my sons.” He is saying the killer phrase in a Jack O’Brien-directed production that’s as close to perfect as it can be for any lover of Miller—and for any believer in the potential of theater to get to you where you live.</p>\n<p>In a season where straight plays—often relegated to second-class Broadway status—have been in unusual number, this <em>All My Sons</em> goes a far way, or further, to reminding audiences what perceptive, inspired, engaged playwriting is. If anyone is leaving the Roundabout’s American Airlines with a blithe ho-hum, I’ll turn in my critic’s spurs. If anyone is exiting the auditorium having seen the drama for the first time and wondering what all the fuss over Miller is about, I’m here to recommend a psychotherapist expert in healing emotional blockage.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/22/all-my-sons-arthur-millers-still-shattering-backyard-tragedy/\"><em>Read Melissa Rose Bernardo’s </em>★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>To remind those who’ve forgotten or those who don’t know, Joe Keller (Tracy Letts) is an airplane parts manufacturer whose pilot son Larry has been missing in World War II action but is still expected to return by his mother (and Joe’s insistent wife) Kate (Annette Bening). Kate is the only one in the family holding on to hope. Son Chris (Benjamin Walker) has accepted the still unconfirmed facts and is intent on marrying Larry’s girlfriend and onetime next-door neighbor, Anne Deever (Francesca Carpanini). In the meanwhile, Anne has her reasons for believing Larry will never come home.</p>\n<p>Though the occasion for<em> All My Sons</em> is a family get-together to which Chris has invited Anne with the aim of proposing marriage, the disturbing issue that emerges is Joe’s connection to deficient airplane parts his imprisoned ex-partner (and Anne’s father) okayed some years earlier, supposedly behind Joe’s back. Airplanes crashed and men lost lives as a result of the unfortunately shipped parts.</p>\n<p>Though assumed to have been dealt with and, if not forgotten, at least laid to rest—along with the deceased pilots—the family secret that’s not so secret in the Kellers’ neighborhood comes out with genuinely shocking repercussions, especially when Anne’s brother George (Hampton Fluker), once Chris’ best friend, arrives to force the truth of the damning incident.</p>\n<p>MiIler brings everything up through any number of beautifully crafted confrontations, some of them involving Dr. Jim Bayliss (Michael Hayden) and his wife Sue (Chinasa Ogbuagu)—they now own the former Deever home—and neighbors on the other side, cheerful Lydia Lubey (Jenni Barber) and hubby Frank (Nehal Joshi), an enthusiastic astrologer busy preparing charts to convince Kate that Larry has to have survived.</p>\n<p>(Douglas W. Schmidt designed the commodious Keller home and the only visible side of the Bayliss home. Natasha Katz is the lighting designer, John Gromada the sound designer. Together they cook up a prologue storm both figuratively and literally an indication of the theatrical storm to follow.)</p>\n<p>In director O’Brien’s cast, they’re all flawless—the lead actors worthy of praise that could go on for many column inches. Letts’ Joe, as initially comfortable as the guy-next-door name he carries, slowly comes apart from the weight of the past he’s been denying. It’s a frightening metamorphosis. Bening’s Kate—how welcome she is back on a New York City stage—shows all the signs of a woman trying to keep herself and her family together while attempting to believe in something that deep down she has to know isn’t so.</p>\n<p>Walker’s strapping Chris wants to convince himself, against his mother’s wishes, that Anne can and should be his. At the same time he’s in the throes of reining in suspicions about his father. Carpanini’s Anne is a young woman coming into her own and increasingly ready to get her proper due. (Incidentally, Jane Greenwood outfits them—and everyone else in the ensemble—with the right, home-y 1947 fashions.)</p>\n<p>As with all classic plays—this one ranks as just that—new revelations pop out with every look. Among the epiphanies for me this time are the number of amusing lines that Miller—often thought to have too much on his mind to be funny—includes in the opening sequence. During it, Joe and neighbors are sitting in the Keller yard to establish the seemingly average-Joe (pun intended) atmosphere on the verge of changing for the worse.</p>\n<p>Also striking me for perhaps the first time, when maybe it should have been glaring before, is how closely Miller hews to his frequent fathers-and-sons theme. Perhaps it’s clearer now after my having seen Miller’s first play, the rarely performed <em>No Villain</em>, in London a few years back. In that early work, a son (clearly Miller’s autobiographical version of himself) joins the 1930s men striking his father’s factory, while his older brother continues toiling there. No need to go into Willy Loman’s relationship with his sons, one of whom is privy to Willy’s extramarital-affair secret.</p>\n<p>Miller goes after the theme with apparent compulsion, while the women—the mothers, the wives—fend for their husbands and themselves as effectively as they can. With this production, I noticed something perhaps I also should have noticed previously: In both <em>All My Sons</em> and <em>Death of a Salesman</em>, the wife has the last word and in just about the same dire situation.</p>\n<p>Am I saying that Miller repeats himself? I am, and as this new take proves, it’s a good—no, superb—thing he does.</p>\n<p><strong><em>All My Sons</em> opened April 22, 2019, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through June 30.

Photo: Joan Marcus</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Capitalism, lies, betrayal, crime, corruption, and cover-ups—just another day on Capitol Hill? Or the issues bubbling beneath the surface of Arthur Miller’s surprisingly vital 72-year-old drama <em>All My Sons</em>, now in a stirring Jack O’Brien–directed Roundabout Theatre revival on Broadway?</p>\n<p>The tidily (some might say even too tidily) structured, Ibsen-esque play—Miller’s second to reach Broadway, and his first success—begins innocuously enough: with 61-year-old Midwestern businessman Joe Keller (Tony-winning actor and playwright Tracy Letts) reading the paper and gabbing about the weather with his neighbors, the astrology-obsessed Frank (Nehal Joshi) and the disillusioned Dr. Bayliss (Michael Hayden). Despite the previous night’s storm, the yard looks welcoming and serene, framed with casual wicker furniture and a cozy wisteria-covered pergola (Douglas W. Schmidt designed the beautifully detailed set). But near the back porch, a blown-over apple tree bows, dripping in symbolism, a portent of the upheaval to come.</p>\n<p>“So much for that, thank God,” says Kate Keller (four-time Oscar nominee Annette Bening, in her first Broadway appearance since her 1987 Tony-nominated turn in <em>Coastal Disturbances</em>), gazing at the busted branches that had served as a tribute to her three-years-missing World War II pilot son Larry. “Everybody was in such a hurry to bury him. I <em>said</em> not to plant it yet.” Kate refuses to believe Larry is dead. His war veteran brother, the idealistic, headstrong Chris (Benjamin Walker, of <em>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</em> and <em>American Psycho</em> fame), is more pragmatic—“I’ve been thinking, y’know? Maybe we ought to put our minds to forgetting him?”—perhaps because he’s about to propose to Larry’s old sweetheart Ann (Francesca Carpanini), the daughter of Joe’s former business partner.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2019/04/22/all-my-sons-arthur-millers-family-secrets-tragedy-in-a-plus-revival/\"><em>Read David Finkle’s </em>★★★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Little by little, the past creeps into the present: Ann’s father is in prison because during the war, his and Joe’s factory produced faulty parts for military fighter jets—cracked cylinder heads that caused 21 P-40s to crash (a detail imbued with a newfound contemporary resonance given the recent Boeing 737 MAX accidents). Joe, meanwhile, was exonerated, and has built up his business—and his bank account—“bigger than ever,” he brags. Yet not everyone believes he was blameless. Ann’s brother, George (Hampton Fluker), steamrolls in during Act 2, intent on exposing Joe’s complicity and dragging his sister away from the murderous, money-grubbing Keller men.</p>\n<p>Kate is also trying to engineer Ann’s departure, but via guilt, insults, and scheming—you know, standard mother-in-law maneuvers. “The night he gets into your bed, his heart will dry up,” she informs Ann. “You’re going in the morning, and you’re going alone. That’s your life, that’s your lonely life.” (Bening has a brilliantly icy way with her character’s innumerable insults. Another breezy zinger to Ann: “You gained a little weight, didn’t you, darling?”)</p>\n<p>As for how this production judges Joe, it’s hard to ignore that Letts bears an eerie resemblance to capitalist warmonger and former Vice President Dick Cheney. Yet even as Joe is careening toward his inevitable fall, he never loses our sympathy. It seems selfish to want to see Letts do more and more stage roles when he could be writing more plays like <em>August: Osage County </em>and <em>Mary Page Marlowe</em>. But he’s so spectacular in <em>All My Sons</em>—even in the simple, speechless act of reading a letter—that you can’t help but imagine him (and Bening) in, oh, say…<em>Death of a Salesman</em>. Hey, a theatergoer can dream.</p>\n<p><strong><em>All My Sons</em> opened April 22, 2019, at the American Airlines Theatre and runs through June 30.
