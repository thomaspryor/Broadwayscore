Photo: Brinkhoff &amp; Mögenburg</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In <em>Hamilton</em>, Aaron Burr gripes that the incipient U.S. Constitution is “full of contradictions,” to which his frenemy Alexander Hamilton replies, “So is independence.” Before that line was likely even a twinkle in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s eye, another future Pulitzer Prize winner was busy exploring the challenges and ironies of being an American, about 200 years on. The resulting two-part epic would prove even more groundbreaking in its sweeping spiritual humanism and sheer creative chutzpah.</p>\n<p>Tony Kushner’s <em>Angels In America: A Gay Fantasia On American Themes</em> blazed onto Broadway in its respective three-hours-plus installments, <em>Millennium Approaches</em> and <em>Perestroika</em>,<em> </em>in 1993. Set in the Reagan era, when go-go capitalism flourished while a strange virus threatened to decimate the gay male population, <em>Angels</em> obviously reacted to then-recent history. But in its breadth of subjects and references, the play also surveys the American Century, its complex roots and its uncertain future; <em>Perestroika</em>’s epilogue unfolds in January 1990, just after the Berlin Wall has fallen.</p>\n<p>The stunning new (and first) Broadway revival of <em>Angels</em> is haunted by everything that’s happened since—especially, and exponentially, in the past few years. The production arrives, it should be noted, via London’s National Theatre, where it played to raves last spring, and is helmed by British director Marianne Elliott, whose previous feats of trans-Atlantic magic include <em>War Horse</em> and <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</em>. Working with a top-rate design team, Elliott mines the daunting structural and supernatural elements of Kushner’s play without a trace of empty spectacle. Ian MacNeil’s stark set evokes a vast, bleak urban landscape, with neon bars marking separate spaces, while Paule Constable&#8217;s lighting also provides breathtaking illumination, and nuance, when required.</p>\n<p>Inhabitants range from a neurotic New Yorker to visitors from Utah and far beyond, and the superb actors here—most juggling two or more roles, as called for—traverse their interwoven paths with the resilient wit and unflagging emotional commitment Kushner’s dense text requires. Elliott has, in particular, culled milestone performances from two of the finest stage actors of their generations: Nathan Lane, cast as closeted uberlawyer and historical bully Roy Cohn, and film star Andrew Garfield, playing the fictional Prior Walter, a young man whose only use for a closet would be to find something fabulous to wear.</p>\n<p>Prior, who lives with his lover, Louis, is diagnosed with AIDS early in Act One of <em>Millennium</em>; Roy receives his death sentence, as it then was, in the act’s final scene. Louis, guilt-ridden but weak in spirit—played by an oddly endearing James McArdle—will soon leave Prior and embark on an affair with <em>Angels</em>’ other closet case: Joe Pitt, a young Mormon lawyer whom Roy is trying to groom for Reagan’s Washington. “America has rediscovered itself,” Joe (a robust, poignant Lee Pace, new to the production) tells his long-suffering, pill-popping wife, Harper. “Its sacred position among nations. And people aren’t ashamed of that like they used to be.”</p>\n<p>These are chilling words in 2018. But however pointed and relevant many of <em>Angels</em>’ political insights remain, the play ultimately celebrates progress in a non-partisan sense, as something that is difficult but necessary and ultimately inevitable. It&#8217;s a timeless and universal message—a refutation to The Angel who declares Prior a prophet, who in this staging hovers and ascends with help from a small band of puppeteers. Wryly played by Amanda Lawrence, she is as glorious a creature as she claims to be, but no match for Garfield’s remarkable Prior; the actor embraces his character’s suffering and indignation and queenly elan without self-consciousness or caricature, giving Prior such vibrant, hilarious, heartwrenching life that his not surviving seems unthinkable.</p>\n<p>Lane, too, delivers a beautifully textured performance, expertly mining the dark comedy in his lines while making us feel the full weight of Cohn’s karmic baggage, and his fury. Confronting his doctor or later, from his hospital bed, the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg—played by Susan Brown, delicate and lacerating— the old Communist hunter (and mentor to Donald Trump) is by turns pathetic, funny, and terrifying.</p>\n<p>Visions, or hallucinations, also appear to the self-medicating Harper (Denise Gough, who starts tepidly but grows and burns), who is obsessed with environmental damage. Like Prior, to whom she is connected in a series of fanciful and tender sequences, she is struggling to make sense of a world where men selfishly abandon the ones who love them most.</p>\n<p>Moral virtue finds an earthier voice in Belize, Prior’s ex and devoted friend, and Roy’s nurse, given spectacular style and substance by Nathan Stewart-Jarrett. “You’re ambivalent about everything,” Belize tells Louis; indeed, amid the many twists in Act Two, Prior finds better and braver support from Joe’s conservative mother, Hannah (Brown, excellent again).</p>\n<p>As Belize explains at one point, “Love is very hard.” But as this majestic <em>Angels In America</em> reminds us, it is worth striving towards, even now. Especially now.</p>\n<p><strong>Angels in America opened March 25, 2018, at the Neil Simon Theatre and runs through July 1.

Photo: Deen Van Meer</i></figcaption></figure>\n<p>A bright, funny, and slightly loopy musical comedy peers out every so often from the stage of the renovated St. James, where Disney’s latest in a line of animated-film-to-live-Broadway epics has opened with typically Disneyan fanfare. These delights are only intermittent, alas; whenever theatrical joy starts to break through, the emotion is flash-frozen as if to extend the moment. But flash-frozen joy inevitably turns to freezer burn, so they just go on and sing another power ballad.</p>\n<p><em>Frozen</em> (the 2013 film, as opposed to <em>Frozen The Broadway Musical</em>) was a worldwide smash; the firm’s largest animated hit, it seems, since 1994’s <em>The Lion King</em>, and we know what happened to that one. <em>Frozen</em> the film was, as it happened, relatively Broadway-friendly; leading roles were voiced by Tony-nominated musical comedy favorites Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad, and Santino Fontana.</p>\n<p>More importantly, the songs upon which the plot is built were written by Broadway’s own Robert Lopez (of <em>Avenue Q</em> and <em>The Book of Mormon</em>) in collaboration with his songwriting spouse, Kristin Anderson-Lopez. All of which added to the allure of the film; and when the couple won themselves a Best Song Oscar, weren’t we all proud of our home-grown lad? (As of this writing, he is not only one of a mere 12 Emmy-Grammy-Oscar-Tony winners; he is the only person thus far to collect <em>two of each</em>.)</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/03/22/frozen-that-old-disney-magic-this-time-on-ice/\"><em>Read Jesse Oxfeld’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>The transformation from screen to stage, though, accentuates the ponderous. What had been a collection of eight songs is herein expanded (or bloated?) to 22. Mr. Lopez is one of our finest musical comedy writers, who seemingly provided much of the canny drollery to his two aforementioned musicals. Which might be why <em>Frozen</em>’s loopy musical comedy moments work so well. A second chief asset is Patti Murin, who as Princess Anna clowns her way through every moment in which she is permitted to.</p>\n<p>But it ain’t all bounce-up-the-lights-and-bring-on-the-charm showmanship. Drab is the mood of most of the evening. We are in an olden-day kingdom in northern climes—the source material comes from Hans Christian Andersen—with dark wood and gray walls omnipresent. (One of the stage musical’s rare peaks, backing the song “In Summer,” features the equivalent of a pop-up greeting card of the beach, complete with sun and surfboard, four minutes of totally extraneous and thoroughly enchanting fun. Let it be added that more than a few theatergoers are likely to think that this beach interlude is more entertainingly sculpted than the whole of <em>Escape to Margaritaville</em>, down the block.)</p>\n<p>The first of these delights comes 20 minutes in, when Murin—with Ado Annie-ish glee, if that reference is not too archaic—breaks through the gloom with “Love Is an Open Door.” The second act opener, too, builds (or almost builds) to musical comedy heights. “Hygge” (pronounced “HUE-gah”) is a term borrowed from the Danish. <em>Frozen</em> uses it in a manner somewhat similar to what Mr. Lopez and his <em>Mormon</em> cohorts did with “Hasa Diga Eebowai.” Not in a scatological vein, mind you; this <em>is</em> Disney. But as a rambunctious kitchen-sink showstopper featuring a blissfully ludicrous chorus line of dancers fresh from the sauna, complete with birch branches and naked bodysuits.</p>\n<p>Murin, a memorable heroine in the underappreciated musical spoof <em>Lysistrata Jones</em>, here bursts into Broadway stardom. She is joined in the <em>Frozen</em> spotlight by Caissie Levy (<em>Les Misérables</em>), who as the ice princess mostly stands around looking glum or menacing except for the first act finale where she gets to sing the Oscar-winning “Let It Go” in a manner which apparently convinced management to give her first-position star billing. (Methinks, perhaps, she takes the &#8220;conceal it don&#8217;t feel it&#8221; mantra too much to her frozen heart.) Greg Hildreth makes an enchanting Olaf, aided by a well-realized snowman design from puppetmaker Michael Curry; Jelani Alladin and John Riddle make attractive-enough suitors; and Kevin Del Aguila comes out of nowhere—like Brad Oscar in <em>Something Rotten!</em>—to enchant us with that sauna song.</p>\n<p>Michael Grandage is a fine stage director, as <em>Frost/Nixon</em>, the Jude Law <em>Hamlet</em> and <em>Red</em> attest to. His two Broadway musicals—the recent revival of <em>Evita</em> and the present opus—suggest that musicals might not be his métier. The same can be said, citing the very same stage credits, for talented scenic and costume designer Christopher Oram. (He might well be saddled here by the needs of the special effects people. All those ice storms, so effective in the animated film, are suggested by exceedingly low-tech ice-cracking projections running up and down the set walls; these projections might have restricted Oram&#8217;s choice of shape and material.) And a few happy moments aside, Rob Ashford’s uneven choreography consists mostly of happy villagers, angry villagers, and lots of twirlin’ around.</p>\n<p>This is not to proffer that <em>Frozen</em> sorely needs more musical comedy; the problem is that the non-musical comedy portions are so—well—frozen. Operetta, melodrama, villagers with pitchforks: whose idea of musical comedy is this? Entering 2020, we are back in the 1920s. We have little nostalgia for <em>Young Frankenstein</em> around here, but on more than one occasion I distinctly felt that they might have profitably called in Mel Brooks and Susan Stroman to goose up the crowd.</p>\n<p>And so we have Disney’s latest, the most recent in a line of stage musicals that began with <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> in 1994, peaked with the still-roaring <em>Lion King</em> in 1997, and continues with the current <em>Aladdin</em>. As for <em>Frozen</em>—which stands in the middle of the studio’s nine Broadway musicals, entertainment-wise—it likely won’t last past 2027. 2029 at the latest.</p>\n<p><strong>Frozen opened March 22, 2018, at the St. James Theatre.

Photo: Deen van Meer</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s hard to think of a new show that has landed on Broadway with more hype behind it than <em>Frozen</em>. There are blockbuster movies that become musicals, sure. There are productions that come in supported by years, sometimes even decades, of Disney marketing muscle and merchandising might, of course. And there are shows that arrive with a blizzard of great word-of-mouth from pre-Broadway tryouts, if their producers are lucky. But it’s rare, almost impossible, for something to come in with all three. (Granted: <em>Harry Potter</em> next month, too.) And so here we are, at last, with this stage spectacular freshly opened at the venerable St. James Theatre, recently rebuilt to accommodate it.</p>\n<p>And it’s… fine. Not transcendent, not even great. <em>Frozen</em> is solid.</p>\n<p>For all the talent that went into it, for all its princesses and folk tales, for all its soaringly anthemic letting-go, <em>Frozen</em>, it turns out, is awfully earthbound. It’s a dark story, both in mood and in stage design, that stubbornly resists the usual megamusical temptation to soar. The very excited little girl across the aisle from me was fast asleep before the end of Act One.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://nystagereview.com/2018/03/22/frozen-animated-blockbuster-turns-icebound/\"><em>Read Steven Suskin’s </em>★★★<em> review here.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Her snooze was a decent commentary, but also a shame. Even if the musical never quite lets go, it also has a lot going for it, including some excellent performances, beginning with its leading ladies.</p>\n<p>I’ve no doubt seen the movie fewer times, and longer ago, than that little girl has. But what stood out most for me in the musical is how much <em>Frozen</em> is Anna’s story. Her sister, Elsa, the icy queen, gets the attention and the big number, but the story is Anna’s quest, to find her sister, to find out the family’s secrets, to save the kingdom, to pick the right man. And Patti Murin is perfect in it. She’s warm and funny, confident and plucky. She goes all in for the physical humor in Anna’s awkwardness, but she’s got the pipes to deliver her big numbers.</p>\n<p>Caissie Levy, as Elsa, has the more challenging part. She gets the signature song, but she spends much of the show hiding from attention. For all her talent and beauty—when Elsa embraces her iciness and comes downstage with platinum hair and a silvery gown, she’s rocking eighties Brigitte Nielsen glamour—Levy’s is a character who evades your grasp and so it is a performance that eludes focus. She’s good but distant. Love may be a force of nature, as the show’s tagline insists, but her “Let It Go” is not.</p>\n<p>Jelani Alladin, whose name makes it seemingly inevitable that he’d be making his Broadway debut in a Disney musical, plays Kristoff, the ice seller and decent guy who joins Anna on her quest to find Elsa and ends up falling in love with her. He’s winning and charismatic, but the star sidekick is Greg Hildreth, the human actor who voices and puppets the goofy snowman Olaf. It’s a tough trick, taking a creation that only works as animation and rendering it corporeal. A wry, bemused Hildreth, with a big assist from puppet designer Michael Curry, pulls it off delightfully, half the time forget the man standing there operating the puppet and half the time making you revel in seeing the man behind the metaphorical curtain.</p>\n<p>I missed the Broadway <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, and so this is the first Disney Theatricals production I’ve seen that aims to bring Disney&#8217;s classic magical kingdoms from film to stage, from animation to reality. It’s fun to see how Christopher Oram’s set and costume design manages that transition, creating tall and ominous eaved sets, with gowns and liveries for the princesses and courtiers.</p>\n<p>There’s a similar animated-to-real challenge in Elsa’s icy powers: How do you ice over a stage set? It’s pulled off here with projections and some sound effects (the special effects design is by Jeremy Chernick and the video design by Finn Ross). This is both slightly cool—crinkle crinkle the whole set instantly turns to ice—and also slightly lame: Elsa’s awesome powers would seem to deserve a more impressive and show-shopping manifestation than a little bit of projected CGI.</p>\n<p>The movie’s creators, scriptwriter Jennifer Lee and songwriters (and musical-theater powerhouses) Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez have reworked the film for the stage version. There are many new songs, including the early “A Little Bit of You,” reprised throughout, that both explains the creation of Olaf and also builds a connection, to be later severed and then rebuilt, between the sisters. That fits into the revised book, which aims to deepen their relationship, further explain their scars, and strengthen them for this me-too era.</p>\n<p>(Really, it seems built for the talk-therapy era: <em>Frozen’s</em> ultimate point is that mom and dad’s insistence on hiding Elsa’s powers caused all the trouble; they should have just <em>talked about it</em>. Which draws a straight line back to Judd Hirsch’s fuzzily besweatered salvation of Timothy Hutton in <em>Ordinary People</em>, rescuing him from his own repressive ice queen, Mary Tyler Moore.)</p>\n<p>The director Michael Grandage has spoken about the Shakespearian themes he saw and underlined in <em>Frozen</em>. That might be the problem. There’s a long (and profitable) history of dark children’s fantasy stories. But it’s usually a darkness leavened with a gleeful sort of wonder. (<em>Matilda</em>, recently, comes to mind.) This isn’t. Alex Timbers, who did the delightful <em>Peter and the Starcatcher</em> with Disney, was early on attached to direct <em>Frozen</em>, and one wonders what sort of whimsy he’d have whipped up.</p>\n<p>As it is, we’re left with a would-be blockbuster that’s good but not great, skillful but not memorable. The little girl across from me dozed, but also, out in the lobby, the merch seemed to move swiftly. The true tween fans will likely be reasonably sated. They’re getting to see Elsa in person, and a pan never bothered them anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Frozen opened <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_350178208\"><span class=\"aQJ\">March 22, 2018</span></span>, at the St. James Theatre.

Photo: Matthew Murphy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>One of the truly stirring moments in the musical theater canon comes at the end of Act 1 of <em>Sunday in the Park With George</em>, as Sondheim’s score swells and the painting Parisians we’ve met over the previous 80 minutes arrange themselves into “A Sunday on La Grande Jatte.” The music and the moment align; George has put it together.</p>\n<p>The effect is similar in kind, if not in transcendence, when we reach the first act closer of Jimmy Buffett’s <em>Escape to Margaritaville</em>, which opens tonight at the Marquis Theatre. <em>Ah yes</em>, you realize as the on-stage band, inevitably and finally, breaks into “Margaritaville.” <em>That’s</em> why the old man drinks stale, decades-old beer, so he can toss aside his pop-tops. And that’s why the burly bartender made clear he was so black-out drunk he didn’t recall getting his brand-new tattoo. It’s why the old man salts all his food, always looking for his missing shaker. And it’s why the heartbroken leading man is seeking solace by nibbling on spongecake. They’re all just wasting away in Margaritaville.</p>\n<p>And you realize something else: Art isn’t easy.</p>\n<p><em>Escape to Margaritaville</em> is perfectly pleasant but not especially good, a watered-down, mostly flavorless, machine-made frozen concoction that does enough to remind you of a better version of itself that you’re left satisfied by default, for lack of another option. You hang on, barely. As directed by Christopher Ashley, who won the best director Tony last year for the equally saccharine—but somehow more genuinely saccharine—<em>Come From Away, </em>it is trying so hard to show you a good time, while also trying so hard to stay true to its tell-it-like-it-is roots, that its tone approaches that of kindergarten class full of goofy uncles: Everything is happy and eager and oh so excited, and also there are Viagra jokes.</p>\n<p>Greg Garcia and Mike O’Malley, experienced TV writers, have crafted a script that uses a straightforward love story as a skeleton for two dozen or so Buffett classics. There’s a live beach band on stage, and, as their Buffett stand-in, the hunky Paul Alexander Nolan, playing a sandy-haired beach-bum singer named Tully Mars, guitar slung over his shoulder. There is also his love interest, Rachel, played by a lovable Allison Luff. She arrives on his island a workaholic control freak, and thus the plot is immediately clear.</p>\n<p>Nolan is winsome and handsome, and he has the musical chops to pull off the rock-star role. Luff is perky and self-assured, and almost manages to sell her character, a hard-charging businesswoman-environmentalist desperately seeking venture financing for her plan to combine potatoes with volcanic ash and thus create limitless, no-emissions power. (I kept waiting for this to be another elaborate set up for a lesser-known Buffett song, “Let’s French Fry and Ketch Up,” or some such. It’s not.)</p>\n<p>But that first act is so obvious, and so labored, that it turns awfully tedious. Its plot is a foregone conclusion, and despite both the high-energy choreography (Kelly Devine, gave <em>Come From Away </em>its Irish-step-dancing Canadians, has created some remarkably kinetic slackers) and crowd-pleasing numbers, it lumbers on. Even the friendly Parrotheads in front of me seemed unmoved.</p>\n<p>The second act is better, because, having already preached the gospel of laidbackedness, <em>Margaritaville</em> finally allows itself to have some fun. After their island is devastated by an inconvenient volcano in the final moment of Act One—<em>deus ex magma</em>, you might say—Tully and his pals take off by rickety aircraft for Cincinnati, Rachel’s home. He has to prove his love to Rachel, and plus his best friend, that bartender, Brick (a funny if thin-voiced Eric Peterson), is in love with her best friend, Tammy (Lisa Howard, excellent as always).</p>\n<p>And so we get a goofy flight in old J.D.’s old airplane, an inspired fantasy tapdance from Brick, simply because he always wanted to tap dance, and a charmingly goofy “Cheeseburger in Paradise,” when Tammy final gives up on the diet her oaf of a fiancé has forced upon her.</p>\n<p>In this second act, finally, is when the Parrotheads around me started singing along.</p>\n<p>A lengthy and delightful recent <em>New York Times</em> profile of Buffett, in anticipation of this show, mentioned that that’s what happens at his concerts: “It was in a unified hum, reminding Mr. Buffett of the recitation of prayers in church during his altar boy days,” wrote reporter Taffy Brodesser-Akner, describing the communal reverence.</p>\n<p>That reverence arrives here, too, a bit. It gives the fans something to go home with. There’s just not a lot of it. For all <em>Margaritaville</em>&#8216;s carefully engineering to appeal to Buffett fans’ pleasure centers, there’s relatively little pleasure to be had.</p>\n<p>Indeed, that same <em>Times</em> profile detailed Buffett’s dedication to delivering to his fans a consistently on-brand, consistently good time. He talked of his desire to turn the Marquis into a big beachfront party, to take advantage of the surrounding Marriott hotel to make it sprawling tailgate.</p>\n<p>But the reality at this mediocre simulacrum of escape is that a few scattered Adirondack chairs give the hotel’s mezzanine of only the barest hint of simulacrum of beachfront tailgate. Otherwise, it’s the usual Marriott lobby, with posters on easels opposite the theater entrance pointing the way to the adjacent Montessori Model United Nations Conference Luggage Check. One hopes the baggage, at least, is having a stimulating and creative learning experience.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Escape to Margaritaville</strong></em> <strong>opened March 15 at the Marquis Theatre.

If you’re a life-long New York Rangers fan, you go to the game in Rangers shirt. If you’re a dyed-in-the-wool New York Yankees fan, you go to the game in a New York Yankees shirt, perhaps still with the name Jeter on the back. And if you’re a Jimmy Buffett Parrot Head, you go to a Buffett concert in a Hawaiian shirt—with or without a fake beak hiding your nose.</p>\n<p>As of now that shirt is also what you wear to <em>Escape to Margaritaville</em>, the musical just perched on Broadway after an ironing-out-the-wrinkles tour. Proud in your shirt (no one donned a beak at the performance this reviewer attended), you’re guaranteed to get everything you hoped for from the production, a slam-bang success sure to keep the adored singer-songwriter in Margaritas for some time to come.</p>\n<p>Director Christopher Ashley—who’s proved he knows how to make a tuner work like gangbusters with Tony-Award winners <em>Come From Away </em>and <em>Memphis</em> as well as <em>Xanadu</em> and the underrated <em>Leap of Faith</em>—proves his prowess with <em>Escape to Margaritaville</em>, which’ll definitely be a Tony nominee in this season of too few new musicals.</p>\n<p>Along with the easy-going, let’s-all-get-drunk Buffett songs, the major contributors to this happy success are bookwriters Greg Garcia and Mike O’Malley, who sharpened their skills on television series like “Yes, Dear” and “My Name is Earl.” Their creditable contribution is closely examining Buffett’s lyrics and finding clever ways to work them into a loosely-based-on-Buffett’s-life plot wherein singer-slacker Tully (sexy, charming Paul Alexander Nolan) and reluctant vacationing scientist Rachel (sexy, strong Alison Luff) meet and instantly look made for each other.</p>\n<p>What keeps them apart longer than many rom-coms would have had the nerve to maintain are Tully’s desire to waste blissfully away at the Margaritaville hotel, a life style at odds with Rachel’s compulsive work ethic. She’s committed to collecting soil from a temporarily quiet Caribbean volcano for creating a new beneficial food. He just wants to sing the tunes he writes for his own amusement and for transient good-time seekers.</p>\n<p>As Tully and Rachel back-and-forth, they’re helped by good pal Brick (the earthy Eric Petersen) and Tammy’s bff Tammy (the strong Lisa Howard). Others on hand for romantic encouragement are hotel-bar owner Marley (stern Rema Webb) and hotel-bar hanger-on J.D. (amusingly world-weary Don Sparks.)</p>\n<p>Notice that Rachel’s interest in volcano dirt and dust conjures Buffett’s “Volcano.” How Garcia and O’Malley mine the ditty for significant volcano developments (and effects by set designer Walt Spangler, lighting designer Howell Binkley, and sound designer Brian Ronan) is delightful.</p>\n<p>And that’s not where the lyric plumbing ends. How they play on the catchy likes of “My Head Hurts, My Feet Stink and I Don’t Love Jesus,” “Grapefruit –Juicy,” “He Went to Paris,” “We Are the People Our Parents Warned Us About” is the best example of a jukebox musical maximizing a songwriter canon since ABBA’s <em>Mamma Mia</em>. Moreover, it looks to have the same long-run potential.</p>\n<p>For “Cheeseburger In Paradise” director Ashley enhances it as one of two sequences calling on Flying by Foy for their wire-belt attachments. Numbers of other numbers are extended as choreographer Kelly Devine’s keeps the troupe shaking their moneymakers. The imaginative creators have even figured out a way to include a tap dance in a story where sand is a more expected element.</p>\n<p>Since Buffet likely wasn’t thinking about dance breaks when writing his Southern comfort songs (some new ones here), he’s lent the soothing oeuvre to Michael Utley for orchestrations, Gary Adler for dance music arrangements, Mac McAnally for music consulting, Michael Keller and Michael Aarons for music consulting, and very much to Christopher Jahnke for music supervision, vocal and incidental music arrangements and additional orchestrations. Each of them has been commendably true to the relaxed Buffett spirit.</p>\n<p>Speaking of breakouts, it’s certainly true of Jack LaLanne-buff Nolan, who made a strong impression in the short-lived Steve Martin-Edie Brickell <em>Bright Star</em> and now establishes himself as, okay, a bona fide bright star. Ruff, who has a natural sparkle, is going places, too, although she’ll be staying right here for lucky audiences during the next while.</p>\n<p>Also keep this in mind: Laidback and kickbacked as <em>Escape to Margaritaville</em> is, it’s vigorously up-to-date on the Time’s Up agenda. A late storyline twist works forcefully as a bow to women today who want to make it on their own before tying any knot.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Escape to Margaritaville</strong></em> <strong>opened March 15 at the Marriott Marquis for an open-ended run.

Not as feel-good nostalgia or a lovingly curated museum piece, heaven forbid; but as a raucous, pull-you-in-and-leave-you-prostrate-with-laughter joyride. The immediate question of the evening, perforce, must be how revered musical comedy-babe Bernadette Peters fares in the shoes (and hats) devised for that comic force of nature formerly known as the Divine Miss M. Answer: We’ll let you know when we wipe clear our blurry eyes and stop laughing.</p>\n<p>If Midler is a fabled comic force, Peters is indeed a musical comedy doll. Not in a sexist manner, mind you; something of a Kewpie doll (which was a cupid-derived cherub, initially devised as a cartoon character in 1909 and memorialized as a popular toy). A child actor, Peters began her musical comedy career at ten as the little girl neighbor in <em>The Most Happy Fella</em> in 1959; achieved widespread acclaim for her wickedly wide-eyed off-Broadway parody of Ruby Keeler in the 1968 <em>Dames at Sea</em>, and was a full-fledged Broadway star the following year (albeit in the one-night-only fiasco, <em>La Strada</em>). Thus, she has been around somewhat longer than the two-year-older Midler, who first achieved notice as a bathhouse chanteuse in 1970.</p>\n<p>This musical-comedy-in-her-plasma DNA sets Peters’ Dolly apart. Dolly Gallagher Levi has walked down that legendary Harmonia Gardens staircase many, many times since the divine Carol first made her entrance to the chorus boy fanfare in 1964. Watching Peters do it, there was something undeniably different although you couldn’t quite qualify it until she started parading around the ol’ passerelle (or ramp around the orchestra pit, to you). Channing was a starry-eyed innocent, amazed at the reaction; Midler was the beloved comic icon, lapping it up; and Donna Murphy, who did an excellent job spelling Midler two times a week throughout her run, was out there not as a star personality but as an actor representing the embodiment of Dolly-the-character herself.</p>\n<p>When Peters makes that second act entrance-to-end-all-entrances, something else jumps to the fore: wide-eyed, giddy, lemme-do-it-again joy. Here we have the kid (yes, at 70) at the peak of the roller coaster, bracing for the wind in her face just before the descent—and then racing around for another turn, and another! Other Dollys have brought a multitude of emotions to the role, most usually with success; but Bernadette on the catwalk is a musical comedy dream, not only for theatergoers with heart-in-mouth but seemingly for the performer herself.</p>\n<p>Let us mention in passing that the production remains the height of jaw-dropping elegance. <em>Dolly</em> was the greatest commercial hit of its day, yes, but few have ever placed it in Broadway’s most rarified class (<em>South Pacific</em>, <em>Guys and Dolls</em>, <em>Gypsy</em>, <em>Sweeney Todd</em> et al). The charms of the show, over many years and many productions, seemed to fade until last April, when we realized that all the Jerry Herman-Michael Stewart musical needed to shine was impeccable showmanship. Director Jerry Zaks and choreographer Warren Carlyle combined to create a perfect musical comedy world, with designer Santo Loquasto bursting the toy-theater box with an endless display of exuberantly-rendered canvas-and-flats along with a cotton-candy world of froth and tutti frutti hued costumes.</p>\n<p>This <em>Dolly</em> remains the visual and comical banquet it was. Along with the star, cast changes include Victor Garber as an irascibly weary Vandergelder and the up-and-coming London song-and-dance farceur Charlie Stemp as Barnaby Tucker. The latter deserves a couple of paragraphs of his own; let’s just say that he is something of a combination of Ray Bolger, Jim Dale and—somehow—James Corden, and fills the stage whenever possible with exuberantly exaggerated dance steps and wall-to-wall teeth.</p>\n<p>Berlin once wrote a song for Jolson called “Let Me Sing and I’m Happy.” It’s that very emotion that we get when Kewpie doll Bernadette in the towering red headdress—face pale as baby powder, with a scarlet smear around the lips—takes her cue and sashays around the orchestra while everyone from the pit to the balcony goes wild.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hello, Dolly! </em></strong><strong>opened April 20, 2017, at the Shubert Theatre, with Bernadette Peters officially debuting on February 22, 2018.

Not, if you’re smart, by trying to repeat it. Midler’s Tony Award-winning turn in Jerry Zaks’s exuberant Broadway revival of <em>Hello, Dolly!</em> was that rare instance of a performer and character, both already larger than life, providing mutual inspiration—not just goin’ strong, but growing stronger under each other’s influence.</p>\n<p>The gale-force of will that the Divine Miss M brought to Mrs. Levi isn’t a quality you’d necessarily associate with Bernadette Peters, who stepped into the role after Midler’s departure in January. Though also a natural and beloved stage animal—with far more musical theater experience than Midler—Peters is a more delicate presence; even at 70, she retains the dainty beauty (and some of the kittenish sexiness) that allowed her to play quirky ingenues well into middle age.</p>\n<p>But as Peters proved with her revelatory take on Momma Rose, in Sam Mendes’s 2003 production of <em>Gypsy</em>, there’s some steel beneath that fair skin. Here, as in that production, she takes a character legendary for her outsized resilience and also emphasizes both the feminine wiles that have served her and the pathos in her journey. And with Dolly, a widowed matchmaker determined to finally find happiness and stability again in her own life, Peters has plenty to work with.</p>\n<p>Midler, too, mined the poignance in Jerry Herman’s ravishing score and Michael Stewart’s book, but differently. When her Dolly addressed her late husband, asking his permission to move on, Midler’s hearty warmth and lusty wit underlined the enduring connection between them. In Peters’ hands, Dolly seems more fragile, and very much alone; when she sings, in “Before The Parade Passes By,” “I’m gonna get some life back into my life,” the lyric is as much a plea as it is a declaration.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say the performance is out of sync with the buoyant tone Zaks has set for this most joyful of musicals. Long the most reliably adorable of leading ladies, Peters brings her own sweetness and warmth to the role, and her own comic panache. Like Midler, she has the audience eating out of her hands from her entrance; but where her predecessor milked applause and guffaws, playing shamelessly (and delightfully) to the crowd, Peters, an instinctive team player after decades in this most collaborative of art forms, gets her biggest and worthiest laughs engaging other cast members.</p>\n<p>And what a cast it is. Gavin Creel won a well-deserved Tony Award and Kate Baldwin a nomination for their effortlessly charming, beautifully sung portrayals of Cornelius Hackl and Irene Molloy, who find love as a result of Dolly’s good-hearted conniving; the eclectic Santino Fontana, a winning lead in several musical productions, steps into the role of Cornelius March 13.</p>\n<p>Victor Garber has replaced David Hyde Pierce as that (ultimately) lovable skinflint Horace Vandergelder, Cornelius’s unyielding boss and Dolly’s credulous client. In their first scene together, as Dolly prepares to whisk Horace away from his Yonkers store and off to New York City—ostensibly to bond with the widowed Irene, though we know Dolly has different plans entirely—Garber and Peters manage the easy, playful rapport you’d expect of two old pros known for their generosity. Garber’s Horace, though not as dry than Pierce’s, has his own delectably deadpan moments, and the actor traces the grumpy miser’s progress under Dolly’s glow just as winningly.</p>\n<p>Other recent additions to <em>Dolly</em>’s cast include Broadway newcomers Charlie Stemp and Molly Griggs, respectively cast as Cornelius’s colleague and pal, Barnaby Tucker, and Irene’s, Minnie Fay, who pair off as well. Stemp is a real find, a spry, athletic dancer who’s also wonderfully funny capturing his 17-year-old character’s gee-whiz artlessness. Griggs’s Minnie is an appealing foil, wry and decidedly more knowing; when Baldwin’s entrance at a recent performance was greeted with applause, Griggs, also on stage, pertly thanked the audience without missing a beat.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that Zaks’s production looks and sounds as unabashedly luscious as it did last spring, from Santo Loquasto’s sparkling sets and candy-colored costumes to the ensemble’s robust singing and dazzling execution of Warren Carlyle’s choreography. When the nattily dressed staff at Harmonia Gardens gathers to welcome Dolly home, you can still sense the chorus members’ tingling pride as a stage legend saunters in their midst. However doll-like her Dolly may be in appearance or affect, Peters is a force that no one could, or would want to, deny.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hello, Dolly! </em>opened April 20, 2017, at the Shubert Theatre, with Bernadette Peters officially debuting on February 22, 2018.
