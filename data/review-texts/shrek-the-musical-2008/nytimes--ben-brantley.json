The 'run in the other direction' language is a clear pan. | GPT-4o: The review uses strongly negative language, comparing the musical to a desperate clown and suggesting it is off-putting. This indicates a strong recommendation to avoid the show. | Gemini: The review clearly expresses a negative sentiment, describing the show as \"desperate to be liked\" and making the reviewer want to \"run in the other direction.\" | Kimi: The critic employs contemptuous language ('flopsweat-inducing', 'desperate') and explicitly states the production induces a desire to flee, indicating a strong recommendation against seeing the show.",
