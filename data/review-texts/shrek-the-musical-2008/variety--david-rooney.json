  "fullText": "“Shrek the Musical,” which received a mixed critical reaction when it opened on Broadway in 2008 and ran for a respectable but unprofitable 441 performances, seems like an ultra-solid road entry with a tour path that mixes big cities and smaller markets. If at first the show attempted to re-create the universal appeal of its edgy but lovable animated progenitor, this touring version feels quite comfortable targeting itself to an audience that was likely born either right around the time of Shrek’s film premiere (2001), or even during the film’s sequel ever after.\n\nEric Petersen as Shrek — leading a cast mostly made up of those who understudied the Rialto stars – comes off as more teddy bear than ogre from the start. When he agrees to march to Duloc to demand that the bevy of fairy tale creatures who’ve been expelled from their home and placed in his swamp, it’s easy to believe that he’s actually doing this as much for them as for himself.\n\nHe also embraces best pal Donkey (Alan Mingo Jr.) quickly, never seeming especially annoyed by him – largely because he’s not especially annoying or cloying. In another clear example of the show’s softer intentions, the dragon’s song “Donkey Pot Pie” has been replaced by a new song from composer Jeanine Tesori and lyricist David Lindsay-Abaire, gently titled “Forever.” This altered sequence plays just fine; designer Tim Hatley’s dragon has been significantly reduced in scale from Broadway, but plenty impressive and expressive.\n\nAs Princess Fiona, Haven Burton delivers the delicious act-two opener, “Morning Person,” with the perfect exaggeration of sunny optimism, leading her into a production number with dancing rats, perhaps the only moment that captures some of the film’s edge.\n\nUltimately, the show is most amusing when David F.M. Vaughn as the miniature would-be-monarch Prince Farquaad was on stage. In addition to being given the best physical shtick, Vaughn has the benefit of remaining mask-less, and he’s able to make the audience hang on his every slight facial gesture.\n\nYes, it would be nice if the show were more imaginative in translating its original filmic fantasy-land into stage terms, and it sure would be great if the show were just plain funnier. But give Jason Moore (“Avenue Q”) and his new co-director Rob Ashford (“Promises, Promises”) credit for their artistic humility. Like its central characters, “Shrek the Musical” ultimately embraces itself for what it is: a polished, rosy-eyed, un-cynical family musical. In this form it will likely find a significantly longer and more appreciated run on tour than it did on Broadway, potentially making possible a happy financial ending for its producers.\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

Stars Jesse Lee Soffer and Tracy Spiridakos Set to Return for Crossover\n\nTo see Mackey walk down the halls of the office of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in jacket and tie was akin to a criminal making his final steps toward the electric chair. For a guy who needed to inhale the soot of L.A.’s grimiest streets to survive, being chained to a desk and forced to ask the human resources supervisor for permission to go to lunch could very well be the proverbial fate worse than death.\n\nIt’s a sentence that Mackey more than earned, of course, and Michael Chiklis deserves hearty applause for his portrayal of a rogue cop who never understood that two wrongs don’t make a right. He earned an Emmy after his first season, and there was never any let-up of the character’s trademark intensity in subsequent years.\n\nThe season-long dance between Mackey and Shane Vendrell came to a sobering close, with Vendrell decided that ending his life, as well as that of his son and wife, was preferable to rotting in jail with the crooks and gangbangers he had put away. Walton Goggins, long underappreciated, deserves kudos recognition that has long eluded him, and it seems a shame that Michelle Hicks, who was mostly underplayed throughout the series, didn’t get to shine until the final few episodes.\n\nJay Karnes — the Barn’s heart-and-soul detective, Dutch Wagenbach, who couldn’t let go of a murder case eating away at him — and CCH Pounder as Capt. Claudette Wyms were also outstanding.\n\nExec producer and writer Shawn Ryan gave Mackey a bit of wiggle room before the credits rolled. As he tucked a gun into his pants and charged out of the office, it’s difficult to say what his intentions were. He might’ve been heading back out to the streets in order to try and reconnect with his transplanted witness-protected family (nice cameo by director Clark Johnson showing Corrine Mackey her new digs), or just maybe he was itching to take down another drug-wielding cartel. But at least the screen didn’t abruptly go black.\n\nBeyond that, there’s little that Ryan left unresolved, and while “The Shield” never reached the same creative stratosphere as “The Wire,” its legacy as a genre-buster is well-earned. The gamble of betting on Ryan and Chiklis paid off handsomely for FX, which became a significanthome for original programming following the show’s early strong ratings and Chiklis’ Emmy.\n\nProduction design and editing, both of which were key in helping the show retain its realism, were stellar.",
