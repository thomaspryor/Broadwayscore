  "bwwExcerpt": "The production has traces of charm, largely thanks to Amanda Holden's gutsy Fiona, who has spent years waiting for a prince with shiny armour and teeth. But there's not much romance here and not a whole lot of comedy, either, though tap-dancing rats liven things up and it's fleetingly funny when Shrek and Fiona burp and fart at each other as a form of courtship.",
