  "bwwExcerpt": "And brash, noisy and full of fart jokes though it is, Shrek will undoubtedly appeal to adults as well as children...It combines an attractive tongue-tied romance with a celebration of lovable losers and odd-bods and David Lindsay-Abaire's book and lyrics have a welcome sense of mischief about them. At its best Jeanine Tesori's score recalls the great soul music of the 1960s and ends with the bubblegum bliss of the Monkees' I'm a Believer.",
