  "bwwExcerpt": "I suspect 20-somethings will extract the most fun from this show. It is cheeky, colourful, camp, shafted by Simpsons-style irony...One touch which captures well the show's wit is when Farquaad perches on a vast white charger, which he names Spearmint Rhino. Sentiment, beauty and haunting melody are absent. But Shrek is energetically amusing.",
