Theatergoers thirsty for something festive, fresh and funny — which is to say, just about all lovers of theater who have endured the drought of the past 18 months — will find much to delight in at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, where the musical “Six” has opened. As Broadway mavens know, “Six” was scheduled to open the very night the industry was, to borrow a handy metaphor, beheaded by the pandemic shutdown. There is a delicious symmetry in this musical being the first new one to open since Broadway has returned. A wave of pure joy rippled across the theater as soon as the first notes of the show were struck at the performance I attended. Already have an account? Sign in Already have an account? Log in",
