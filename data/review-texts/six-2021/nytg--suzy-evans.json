  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The show itself is a retro-mashup with Gabrielle Slade’s bedazzled costumes featuring Reformation-inspired silhouettes; Carrie-Anne Ingrouille’s choreography showcases Tudor-meets-pop moves; and Emma Bailey’s scenery and Tim Deiling’s lighting feels like what a royal ballroom might look like in a techno disco. \n\nUltimately, the queens’ own stories of overcoming struggles and the show’s circuitous journey to Broadway are also beacons for the power of positivity, perseverance, and coming together in times of struggle. Just like these six “ex-wives,” we’ve all had it rough for the past year and a half, and the queens are here to bring in a new regime. Long may they reign.\"",
