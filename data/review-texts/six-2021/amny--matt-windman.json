  "bwwExcerpt": "fully anachronistic, mixing 16th-century marital politics with 21st-century selfies and shade, it suggests a surprising, disturbing and ultimately hopeful commonality. Which shouldn t work, but does. Matt Windman , AMNY : Notwithstanding the dynamic score, \"Six\" is weighed down by a labored book (which is built around a flimsy setup and banal banter), bargain-basement scenic design, and clunky dance choreography. That being said, \"Six,\" which was highly anticipated before the shutdown, still has the makings of a solid hit. The history-meets-contemporary pop concept certainly worked out well for a little show called \"Hamilton,\" and it is easy to imagine \"Six\" appealing to teen girls, history buffs, and many others. Frank Rizzo, Variety : There s the spirit-lifting energy of an arena concert, the humor and sass of a special sisterhood, and a ton of biographical exposition easily received in rap and snap - and which might evoke another recent historical musical. Just as Lin-Manuel Miranda",
