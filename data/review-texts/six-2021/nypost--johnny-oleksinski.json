  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Six\" is more of a concert than a traditional book musical, though, with nine numbers and a megamix crammed into a quick 80 minutes. The songs here, by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, are all whip-smart and catchy. With jukebox shows proliferating like rabbits, audiences are getting used to hearing modern music onstage, but \"Six\" is one of the few original musicals in memory whose score is radio-ready.",
