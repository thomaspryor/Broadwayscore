  "bwwExcerpt": ": The point of Six is its escapism. If you live at the intersection of its interests and can recognize a Spice Girls or Beyonc&eacute; reference (&quot;C&#39;mon, ladies, let&#39;s get in Reformation&quot;), your animal heart will have no choice but to jump up and down with the beat.
