  "fullText": "The point of Six is its escapism. If you live at the intersection of its interests and can recognize a Spice Girls or Beyoncé reference (\"C'mon, ladies, let's get in Reformation\"), your animal heart will have no choice but to jump up and down with the beat. Even the sheer brightness of Six operates as color therapy. Emma Bailey's set is a simple rock stage backed by outlines of Gothic windows covered in LEDs that change and pulse in cheery display. Tim Deiling's lights are red and purple and gold, bathing your hungry pores. The color pours down your eye holes right into your serotonin receptors - all that warmth without heat triggers something deep in your lizard brain that says, \"Vacation.\" So let the cares of this world roll away. Heck, let the cares of 16th-century England dissolve. This is one liberation in which you don't have to lift a finger. Queens are doing it for themselves.",
