  "dtliExcerpt": "As Catherine of Aragon, the first of Henry's wives, Adrianna Hicks evinces the sharp, wounded dignity of a woman not just scorned, but scorned on a historic level. Abby Mueller's Jane Seymour has a gentle piteousness that's entirely apt: She died shortly after giving birth - at last - to a male heir for Henry. Brittney Mack's Anna of Cleves, derided by Henry because in his view she didn't look like the bride he'd been promised in a flattering portrait (or, as she puts it in the contemporary vernacular used throughout, \"I didn't look like my profile picture\"), sings a feisty song reveling in her comparatively fortunate fate - divorced but settled for life in luxury. As Katherine Howard, who was accused of dallying with other men, Samantha Pauly has a fine, steely, to-hell-with-the-judgers edge. And as Catherine Parr, the last wife, who had the good fortune to outlive the odious Henry (only by a year, alas for her), Anna Uzele wraps up the competition by declaring with frank good humor that she knows she's not likely to come out on top in the suffering sweepstakes. Instead, she evinces her strong sense of her own accomplishments, which were indeed many.",
