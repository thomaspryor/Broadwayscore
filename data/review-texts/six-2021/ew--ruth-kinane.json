  "bwwExcerpt": "ering yet another #MeToo story. Those theatrical commonplaces aside, \"Six\" is a needed antidote to \"Anastasia,\" \"Frozen,\" \"Jagged Little Pill,\" \"Wicked\" and other pompous shows of female empowerment. Ruth Kinane, Entertainment Weekly : Sitting in a theater packed with fellow fully-vaccinated, mask-wearing Broadway lovers brings a sense of solidarity and camaraderie to the atmosphere, a vibe mirrored on-stage by the cast s girl-group dynamic.

The songs here, by Toby Marlow and Lucy",
