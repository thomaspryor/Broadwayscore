  "bwwExcerpt": "Each queen gets an absurdly catchy pop-inspired anthem to tell her own (often untold) story. There's a little Beyoncé in Catherine of Aragon's salsa-tinged \"No Way,\" which details Henry's infidelity, his quest for an annulment, and her refusal (\"You must think that I'm crazy/ You wanna replace me, baby, there's/ N-n-n-n-n-n-no way\"). Anne Boleyn's bouncy, electro-pop \"Don't Lose Ur Head\" has a Lily Allen vibe. To play up her sex appeal-and youthfulness-Catherine Parr sings the breathy, Britney Spears-style \"All You Wanna Do.\"",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Six brings together a sextet of badass queens—clad in brilliant chain-trimmed corsets, studded black boots, and spiky crown-like headpieces designed by Gabriella Slade—to compete, American Idol–style, for a somewhat dubious honor: Who took the most crap from that self-serving, Church-splitting, six-times-married monarch?\"",
