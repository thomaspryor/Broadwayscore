  "dtliExcerpt": "Six is not a show that bears too much thinking about. Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss wrote it when they were still students at Cambridge University, and it has the feel of a very entertaining senior showcase. Its 80 minutes are stuffed with clever turns of rhyme and catchy pastiche melodies that let mega-voiced singers toss off impressive \"riffs to ruffle your ruffs.\" The show's own riffs on history are educational, too, like a cheeky new British edition of Schoolhouse Rock. If all these hors d'oeuvres don't quite add up to a meal, they are undeniably tasty.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"At heart, Six is a sparkly lark—Hamilton Extra Lite, with the multiculturalism and anachronism and knowing name-dropping but without the plot, emotion and depth...Six is not deep. Six is fun. Let yourself go and enjoy the finery.\"",
