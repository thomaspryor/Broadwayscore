  "bwwExcerpt": ": &quot;Six&quot; is more of a concert than a traditional book musical, though, with nine numbers and a megamix crammed into a quick 80 minutes. The songs here, by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, are all whip-smart and catchy. With jukebox shows proliferating like rabbits, audiences are getting used to hearing modern music onstage, but &quot;Six&quot; is one of the few original musicals in memory whose score is radio-ready.",
