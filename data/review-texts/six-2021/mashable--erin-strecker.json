  "fullText": "Welcome to Six, the ferocious, feminist, and fun new Broadway musical about the six wives of Henry VIII. But this isn't exactly your mother's Philippa Gregory novel. Yes, these women have been gossiped about about incessantly in both fiction and academic circles over the past 500 years, but this version of the tale, by newcomers Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, gives these ladies a very refreshing 2021 update.
