To play up her sex appeal-and youthfulness-Catherine Parr sings the breathy, Britney Spears-style \"All You Wanna Do.\" Steven Suskin, New York Stage Review : \"It has mass appeal, immediacy, enthusiasm, and an incredibly high sense of style; and it revels in what used to be called \"girl power\" but can now more properly be described as simply, or not-so-simply, power . An audience show for a wide audience, Six is a rafter-raising entertainment that ll get you throwing your proverbial bonnet in the air (but please keep that mask on, for now). Even if, yes, a third of the crowned characters portrayed did indeed-in the plot, and in actual history (and in actual herstory)-lose their heads.\" Juan A.
