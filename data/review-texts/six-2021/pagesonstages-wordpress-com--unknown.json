  "fullText": "SIX: The Musical – 02 November 2021 Stellar vocal performances, glittering costumes, and high energy feminism abound at Six: The Musical, an imagined meeting outside of space and time of Henry XIII’s six ex-wives. This concert-style conceit features a contest between the six ex-wives for who suffered the most in her relationship with Henry XIII. The ex-wives share an opening number, a middle interlude, and a finale, between which each gets a solo moment to shine. The program insert likens each performer’s singing style to a real life pop star and gives a couple of historical details about the ex-wives. Despite the assertion that this show rewrites history, there’s no story line. The show is high energy, full of feminism, and infused with incredible songs that are very relevant to the different ways that women suffer today. But it doesn’t really feel like theatre. There’s no staging, minimal choreography, no real character development, and very superficial interaction between the characters. Six: The Musical is a fun concept and a fun experience. But if you are in town and have never seen a Broadway show, this is not a true Broadway theatre experience. The vocal performances are moving, but there’s not really any acting or dramatic structure. Everything that was enjoyable about the show was equally enjoyable about the cast album. Truthfully, I felt that seeing Six: The Musical live didn’t add very much to the experience. While there was some choreography, none of it was revolutionary. The speaking between the songs was mostly about pumping up the audience. It was a phenomenal concert, but not really a play. I did not attend this performance on a press pass.",
