  "bwwExcerpt": "laring with frank good humor that she knows she s not likely to come out on top in the suffering sweepstakes. Instead, she evinces her strong sense of her own accomplishments, which were indeed many. David Cote, The Observer : The six actresses are tremendous talents, equally skilled at scaling the high notes (solo numbers and beaucoup backup) and executing Carrie-Anne Ingrouille s slinky dance moves. Gabriella Slade s glam outfits are sparkling, jewel-encrusted multi-signifiers: both midriff-baring sexy, but also sharp and stiff like armor; these doomed damsels are going to war. Tim Deiling s stadium-raking lights set the perfect rock concert vibe, and Paul Gatehouse s ace sound design makes sure we get every funky bass lick, as well as each goofy pun. Co-directed by Moss and Jamie Armitage, Six is a glossy, well-engineered Fringe stunt made good. REVIEW ROUNDUP REAL-TIME ALERTS To read more reviews, click here !
