  "bwwExcerpt": "Notwithstanding the dynamic score, \"Six\" is weighed down by a labored book (which is built around a flimsy setup and banal banter), bargain-basement scenic design, and clunky dance choreography. That being said, \"Six,\" which was highly anticipated before the shutdown, still has the makings of a solid hit. The history-meets-contemporary pop concept certainly worked out well for a little show called \"Hamilton,\" and it is easy to imagine \"Six\" appealing to teen girls, history buffs, and many others",
