  "fullText": "The cast of 'Six' Joan Marcus Gallows humor – and after the last 18 months, can there be any other kind? – is in exuberant form at Broadway ‘s Brooks Atkinson Theatre, where the terrific new musical Six just had its long-in-coming opening night. Originally set to open on March 12, 2020 – Covid had other plans – Six and its sextet of singing, dancing queens has lost none of its vitality and charm over the ensuing months of darkness. If anything, the musical seems even more joyous for the time away. Take that, virus. As unlikely a musical as the one with dancing cats, and, if Broadway stays healthy fiscally and otherwise, potentially as durable, Six mashes together history’s most compelling marriage stories with the brightest musical styles streaming today. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article1-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid-article\",\"300x251\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[2,2],[300,250],[620,350],[300,251],[501,282],[3,3],[2,4],[4,2],[620,366]]) .exemptFromSleep() .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Related Stories Casting 'Just In Time': Jeremy Jordan To Succeed Jonathan Groff As Broadway's Bobby Darin",
