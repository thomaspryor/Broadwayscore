  "fullText": "Introducing themselves by both name and fate - \"Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived!\", they chant-sing - the wives, dressed in glitzy, geometric dresses that recall the space-glam flourishes of Lady Marmalade-era LaBelle, take the stage in a non-stop high-energy avalanche of sound. While each of the wives is given a contemporary musical niche - Catherine of Aragon hits the Beyonce-Shakira notes, Jane Seymour goes full Adele, Katherine Howard blends Britney Spears with Ariana Grande - the numbers, distinct and in quick succession, mesh like the colors of a nicely aged tapestry.",
