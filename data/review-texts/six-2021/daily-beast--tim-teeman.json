  "bwwExcerpt": "Of course it's worth the wait. Of course anyone planning their own return to Broadway should buy a ticket. It is one of the cleverest, wittiest, flashiest musicals in town-and sets up home in New York after rave reviews wherever it has played, including the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where it began life in 2017, and London's West End. On Sunday night, over 18 months later than anticipated, Six has its long overdue, much deserved moment to shine.",
