  "bwwExcerpt": ": Of course it&#39;s worth the wait. Of course anyone planning their own return to Broadway should buy a ticket. It is one of the cleverest, wittiest, flashiest musicals in town-and sets up home in New York after rave reviews wherever it has played, including the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where it began life in 2017, and London&#39;s West End. On Sunday night, over 18 months later than anticipated, Six has its long overdue, much deserved moment to shine.",
