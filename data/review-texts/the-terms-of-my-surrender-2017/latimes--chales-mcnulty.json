  "bwwExcerpt": "'The Terms of My Surrender' makes vain gestures in the direction of a variety show. ('Dancing With the Stars,' a silly leitmotif, is both a nightmare and a tempting dream for this capped bear with two left feet.) But Moore isn't the secret vaudevillian no one ever suspected him of being. His comedy (he does a bit on the outlandish items the TSA forbids in carry-on luggage) is as galumphing as his cursory musical interludes.",
