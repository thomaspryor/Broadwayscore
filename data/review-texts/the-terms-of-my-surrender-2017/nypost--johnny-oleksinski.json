The 'but it's also necessary' suggests a reason to see it despite its flaws. | Kimi: The critic balances harsh criticism of the production quality ('sloppy, self-indulgent and often dull') with an acknowledgment of its cultural importance ('necessary'), resulting in an ambivalent assessment that neither fully recommends nor discourages attendance.",
