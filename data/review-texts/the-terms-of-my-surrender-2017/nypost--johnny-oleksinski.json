The word 'but' indicates a shift in perspective, suggesting a balanced view. | Kimi: The critic cites significant flaws in execution (sloppy, self-indulgent, dull) but counters with the show's perceived necessity or importance, creating a mixed verdict that neither recommends nor discourages outright.",
