  "bwwExcerpt": "But Moore is too savvy to end on a down note. The joyous finale, which again relies on the element of surprise, sends the audience out on a high. Despite its title, The Terms of My Surrenderisn't just about Michael Moore. Its theme, which he hammers home again and again, is that \"one person can make a difference.\" By the time you walk out of this inspiring and unexpectedly entertaining show, you'll feel like you can as well.",
