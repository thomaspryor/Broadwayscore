  "bwwExcerpt": "The show marks his U.S. stage debut, and as he mentioned in our interview a few weeks ago, \"For me that makes it thrilling-and dangerous.\" Emphasis on \"for me\"; for the audience, it is neither of those things. In its best moments, The Terms of My Surrender is amusing, informative, even inspiring. But it is also compromised by familiarity, oversimplification and indulgence. Much of the time, Moore's monologue is not fiery enough to even be hot air. It's more like warm wind.",
