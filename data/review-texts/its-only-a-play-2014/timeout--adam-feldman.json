  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Tonight, everyone's a critic,\" says TV actor James Wicker (Lane), in town to celebrate the Broadway debut of his playwright friend Peter (Broderick)...Wicker's line is one of the few honest remarks in Terrence McNally's otherwise cliché-filled It's Only a Play. Mostly plotless and spun from the sketchiest of stereotypes and hoariest of showbiz prejudices, this insider trifle is too long, too shallow and not nearly funny enough...There are the customary paeans to the nobility of theater artists ",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. 'Solid, old-fashioned entertainment' suggests competent but unremarkable, matching the numerical score perfectly. | GPT-4o: The original rating of 60 places it in the Mixed bucket. The review describes the show as 'solid, old-fashioned entertainment' which suggests a moderate recommendation without strong enthusiasm. | Gemini: The review uses the term 'solid' which indicates a mixed to positive review, but not overwhelmingly positive. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60/100 rating places this firmly in the Mixed bucket (55-69), and the review offers measured praise ('solid,' 'old-fashioned') rather than an enthusiastic recommendation.",
