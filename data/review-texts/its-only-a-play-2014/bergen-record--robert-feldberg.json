  "bwwExcerpt": "Mullally, meanwhile, turns Julia into an irritating caricature, affecting a squeaky, drawling, little-girl voice that suggests the character has escaped from a cartoon. The two portrayals aren't the production's only problems. The play, in which nothing much actually happens, requires zippy pacing. But Jack O'Brien's direction is unusually sluggish, especially in the first act, dulling the impact of the script's often-sharp one-liners.",
