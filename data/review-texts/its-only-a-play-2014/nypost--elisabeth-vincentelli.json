Low confidence due to extremely brief excerpt. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the cast's enthusiasm but notes the material feels tired, suggesting a mixed experience with some positive elements. | Gemini: The review indicates that the audience can enjoy the show due to the cast's enthusiasm, even if the material is not great. This suggests a positive, but not overwhelmingly positive, experience. | Kimi: The critic credits the cast's energy for creating moments of enjoyment while explicitly criticizing the material as 'tired,' resulting in a balanced, lukewarm assessment.",
