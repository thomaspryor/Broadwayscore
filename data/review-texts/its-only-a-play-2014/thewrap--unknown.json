  "fullText": "After various incarnations, Terrence McNally’s “It’s Only a Play” has finally made it to Broadway, where it opened Thursday at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater in a production that reunites Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. Back in 1978, this backstage comedy was called “Broadway, Broadway,” starring Geraldine Page and James Coco, and closed in tryouts in Philadelphia, where it didn’t live up to its title.",
