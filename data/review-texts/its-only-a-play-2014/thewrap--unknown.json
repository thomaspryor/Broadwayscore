  "fullText": "After various incarnations, Terrence McNally’s “It’s Only a Play” has finally made it to Broadway, where it opened Thursday at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater in a production that reunites Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. Back in 1978, this backstage comedy was called “Broadway, Broadway,” starring Geraldine Page and James Coco, and closed in tryouts in Philadelphia, where it didn’t live up to its title.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "If only it were a better play...A lot has changed on Broadway in 30 years, but for McNally it all comes down to changing not much more than a few tons of famous names. McNally doesn't just drop names -- he stomps on them, too...These put-downs comprise act one. In act two, the characters take turn reading the bad reviews. Brantley takes more jabs, but frankly, his New York Times reviews are much funnier than McNally's imitations. Many of the jokes would fail if not for Lane, Broderick and their ",

The truncated ending appears to reinforce that the material fails without the star power. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the play for relying on name-dropping and failing to deliver humor, suggesting it does not live up to expectations. The praise for Lane and Broderick is not enough to redeem the overall negative assessment. | Gemini: The review expresses disappointment with the play itself, despite acknowledging the cast's efforts. The critic implies the play relies too heavily on name-dropping and lacks substantial humor. | Kimi: The critic pans the play's writing, finding the name-dropping humor forced and inferior to actual theater criticism, while acknowledging the star cast salvages some laughs.
