No redeeming qualities mentioned. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for being superficial and tone-deaf, reducing a complex figure to clichés, indicating a strong negative assessment. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the treatment of Diana's story is superficial and tone-deaf, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic finds the show's approach shallow and inappropriate ('tone-deaf'), criticizing its reliance on clichés rather than nuanced storytelling. While brief, the language clearly indicates a recommendation against seeing the show.",
