  "bwwExcerpt": "Contrary to the vicious ridicule it was greeted with on social media, \"Diana\" is not a disaster - it's just not very good. If anything, it is an example of what the late composer Mary Rodgers called a \"why musical,\" as in a musical that is completely unnecessary.

However, it avoids calling it a disaster, placing it in the negative range rather than a pan. | Gemini: The review states that the show is \"not very good\" and \"completely unnecessary,\" indicating a negative assessment despite not being a complete disaster. | Kimi: The critic explicitly calls the show 'not very good' and 'completely unnecessary,' labeling it a 'why musical' that has no reason to exist, while conceding it is not an outright disaster.",
