  "bwwExcerpt": "Speaking of day drinking, the best Diana can hope for is that its tackiness will transform, through the magic of mess-addicted theatergoers, into a sort of warmly accepted kitsch. The show's social-media account has been encouraging people to have wine beforehand, cheering \"here for a good time not a long time!\" There's plenty of evidence that the show's creators Joe DiPietro and David Bryan are going for a kind of late-night extended-SNL-sketch vibe.",

The tone indicates a clear recommendation to avoid the show. | Gemini: The quote clearly indicates a negative opinion of the musical, suggesting it lacks genuine emotional depth. | Kimi: The critic delivers a devastating verdict suggesting the musical is emotionally hollow and artificially written, attacking the writers' fundamental inability to convey genuine feeling with no redeeming qualities mentioned.",
