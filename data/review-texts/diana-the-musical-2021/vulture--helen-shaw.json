The tone indicates a clear recommendation to avoid the show. | Gemini: The quote clearly indicates a negative opinion of the musical, suggesting it lacks genuine emotional depth. | Kimi: The critic delivers a devastating verdict suggesting the musical is emotionally hollow and artificially written, attacking the writers' fundamental inability to convey genuine feeling with no redeeming qualities mentioned.",
