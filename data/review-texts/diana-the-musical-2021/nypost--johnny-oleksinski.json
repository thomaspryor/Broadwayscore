    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | No bucket consensus - using median score | Claude: The word 'saved' implies the show needed saving, suggesting problems with the overall production, but the lead performance is praised as redeeming. This indicates a mixed verdict leaning slightly positive due to one strong element. | GPT-4o: The review suggests the show is largely lacking, with only the lead performance being praised. This implies a negative overall impression, with the show needing 'saving'. | Gemini: The review states that the musical is \"saved\" by the leading lady, implying that without her, the show would not be good. This indicates a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates the production is redeemed solely by its lead actress's performance, suggesting a qualified recommendation without broader enthusiasm for the show itself. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Positive, kimi=Mixed",
