  "bwwExcerpt": "I will level with you. Diana, the new musical which just opened at the Longacre Theatre, is not \"good\" by cis-hetero-patriarchal standards of quality. But let's decenter that trade and focus on what it approximates: a maxi-challenge on RuPaul's Drag Race blessedly mixed with a Simpsons parody of Evita (which, of course, they've already done). It has the preposterous high gloss of a Ru production, with The Simpsons' innate understanding of the overly-literal silliness that makes the form work.",
