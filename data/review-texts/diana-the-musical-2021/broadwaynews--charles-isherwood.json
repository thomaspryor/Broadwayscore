  "fullText": "To answer the question that absolutely no one with a Netflix account and an interest in Broadway musicals is asking: Why, yes, “Diana, The Musical” is every bit as abysmal as rumored. To answer the question that absolutely no one with a Netflix account and an interest in Broadway musicals is asking: Why, yes, “Diana, The Musical” is every bit as abysmal as rumored. Social media was briefly aflame with withering descriptions when the show first began streaming in October, so the Broadway opening — long delayed by the pandemic — almost feels like a pointless afterthought. The wedding cake that was flavorless to begin with is now both flavorless and stale. The question more pertinent to those who treasure fond memories of the worst musicals they have seen: Is “Diana” so bad that it simply must be seen, the Playbill kept pristine for future display? Is “Diana” the “Carrie” de nos jours? The answer to both is a qualified yes.",

This is a pan with camp appreciation - negative overall but acknowledging perverse entertainment value. | GPT-4o: The review strongly criticizes the show, calling it 'abysmal' and 'pointless', indicating a clear recommendation to avoid it. The tone is overwhelmingly negative with no redeeming qualities mentioned. | Gemini: The review states the musical is \"abysmal\" and compares it to a flavorless, stale wedding cake. While the critic suggests it might be worth seeing for its badness, the overall tone is negative. | Kimi: The review deploys devastating descriptors ('abysmal', 'flavorless', 'stale', 'pointless afterthought') and only offers a 'qualified yes' for audiences who collect memorably bad musicals, indicating strong artistic disapproval with no genuine recommendation for general theatergoers.",
