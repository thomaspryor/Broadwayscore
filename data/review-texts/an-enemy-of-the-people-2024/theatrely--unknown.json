  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Strong seemed to remain in character, even asking for the protesters to be allowed to speak as Imperioli and others, also in character, helped kick them out.

However, without a clear recommendation or criticism, the overall sentiment appears mixed. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on a specific moment and its impact, suggesting the show has noteworthy aspects but doesn't provide a clear overall recommendation. The single excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation language lead to a 'Mixed' classification.",
