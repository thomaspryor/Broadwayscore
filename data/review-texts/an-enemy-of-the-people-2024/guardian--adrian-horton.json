Photograph: Emilio Madrid This article is more than 1 year oldReviewAn Enemy of the People review – Jeremy Strong impresses in timely Ibsen dramaThis article is more than 1 year oldCircle in the Square Theater, New York\n\nThe Succession star delivers a bravura central turn in a rousing adaptation of a story that carries a discomforting contemporary relevance\n\nFor most people, the draw of An Enemy of the People, Sam Gold and Amy Herzog’s Broadway adaptation of the Henrik Ibsen play, is not so much the chance to see a lesser-known work by the Norwegian dramatist updated for the present so much as the chance to see Jeremy Strong. The ex-Kendall Roy is shedding his suffusive, serious image as Succession’s ex-No 1 boy – or, more accurately, drowning it, as promotional materials show him submerged in a tub – via the stage, in a serious, provocative morality play bound in the decorum of the distant past.\n\nRead moreStill, there are flashes of HBO’s political drama du jour in this 19th-century tale of competing agendas. Strong again plays a lone wolf in a tense sibling rivalry on a doomed crusade, albeit with more ethics as Thomas Stockmann, a provincial doctor in a small Norwegian town who discovers dangerous microbes in its water system. He suspects the bacteria, which require advanced (for the time) scientific instruments to detect, are the product of toxic run-off from new industrial tanneries, owned in part by his father-in-law (David Patrick Kelly); the near-certain likelihood of toxic infection – or, even worse, bad PR – imperils the town’s salubrious spas and thus its local economy, both overseen by his brother Peter (an imposing Michael Imperioli), the mayor.\n\nHerzog and Gold want you to think about the present, though maybe not so specifically or scornfully. Gold has ably directed this version, on the thrust stage at the Circle in the Square Theater, to appear as old-timey; scenic design by the collective dots invoke the Nordic gentry – bespoke meals, inherited cutlery, the lighting of oil lamps used as natural, evocative transitions. (I have to note that, even in 19th-century garb designed by David Zinn, Strong is still wearing all brown.) But Herzog has significantly altered the text. There are superficial changes – Dr Stockmann is now a widower, for one, the flat character of his wife Katherine now folded into that of his loyal, overburdened daughter Petra (You’s Victoria Pedretti), a schoolteacher and staunch supporter, though the juiced-up part still amounts to just a sidekick role in both text and performance.\n\nAnd there are more not-so-subtle inflections meant to appeal to our modern thicket of competing loyalties, psychic bargains and political tangles; the fundamental, scary truth that all of us are acting just as much, if not more, to feeling than to reason. And that in being right, you can also be wrong – a famous passage in which a frustrated Dr Stockmann compares the suitability of mutts to pure-bred poodles to justify his righteousness as a scientist, amended and delivered to the newspaper editor Hovstad, played by the Black actor Caleb Eberhardt, takes on the tinge not just of superiority but eugenics.\n\nThat speech is delivered with the lights up, Strong standing atop the bar used for intermission, audience mixed among the townspeople – as overt as any invocation of the present, and sure to be a polarizing stage decision. It could be viewed as tacky (Linie, a Nordic spirit, is very clearly a sponsor; transitions are soundtracked by castmembers singing Norwegian folk songs). But there’s something to be said for erasing the line between stage and stands, spotlit and shaded, performer and audience, for seeing the reaction on the face of people – wide-eyed shock, grimace, gasp – who know just as much of what’s to come as you do. Just because a point is very on the nose doesn’t make it less salient (though that might be lost on the climate activists who have recently disrupted shows).\n\nWhether such directness is successful in imparting something beyond the thrill of live performance – the cascading second half is, as expected, a showcase for Strong’s ability to portray a man on the brink – is, perhaps, up to the viewer. The appliqué of dialogue clearly invoking our current denial to 1880s Norway is at times jarring, at times moving, but in the hands of some veteran actors and immersive staging, at least a night of good New York theater.\n\nAt any point, you can opt out of the sale of all of your personal information by pressing",

Despite reservations about certain directorial choices, the final assessment is positive - calling it 'good New York theater.' Confidence is medium due to truncated text potentially missing fuller verdict. | GPT-4o: The review praises Jeremy Strong's performance and the immersive staging, indicating a positive experience overall. However, it notes some jarring elements in the adaptation, suggesting reservations. The text is truncated, so the final verdict is missing, leading to low confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges both strengths (Strong's performance, immersive staging) and weaknesses (jarring dialogue). The overall tone suggests a qualified recommendation, but the truncated text makes it difficult to be certain. | Kimi: While the review notes several flaws—jarring contemporary dialogue updates, a thin supporting role, and tacky sponsorship—it consistently praises Jeremy Strong's performance as a 'showcase' and concludes that the immersive staging and veteran cast deliver 'at least a night of good New York theater,' constituting a qualified recommendation.",
