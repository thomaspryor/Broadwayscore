    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic finds the lead character portrayal fundamentally flawed and 'diminished', indicating disappointment with a core element of the production. However, confidence is low due to this being only a single curated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view of the character's portrayal, indicating a diminished impact. However, the single excerpt limits the confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a significant flaw in the portrayal of the lead character, suggesting a negative assessment of the production. | Kimi: The sole available excerpt delivers a clear negative judgment that the production has fatally softened the lead character, stripping away essential traits that leave him diminished. While this indicates a rejection of the show's central approach, confidence is low given the single-excerpt format risks cherry-picking.",
