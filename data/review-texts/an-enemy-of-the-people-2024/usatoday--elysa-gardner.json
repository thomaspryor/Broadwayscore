    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performance with vivid descriptive language ('mesmerizing force of nature', 'huge asset'). However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation and text cutoff. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Boyd Gaines' performance as a significant asset to the production, suggesting a positive view of the show. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the positive aspects of the production, particularly Boyd Gaines' performance. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with a higher score due to the strong praise, but with low confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the lead performance ('mesmerizing force of nature', 'huge asset'), indicating a positive recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt without the critic's full verdict on the production as a whole, confidence remains low.",
