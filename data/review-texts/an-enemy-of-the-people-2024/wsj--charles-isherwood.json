  "bwwExcerpt": "Purists may question Ms. Herzog’s fresh interpretation of Thomas, who in this version is less ornery and scorching in his denunciation of those who oppose him; even in his celebrated speech excoriating the disapproving townsfolk (audience members are recruited to represent them), Mr. Strong, taking his cue from Ms. Herzog, seems befuddled by his rejection, and afterward his designation as an “enemy of the people.” Thomas is notably less contemptuous, and less an advocate for a rigid meritocracy, than Ibsen’s original.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Only one sentence of praise for the lead performance available. No overall verdict or recommendation visible in this excerpt. Confidence is low due to severely truncated text that likely cuts off the critic's full assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Mr. Strong's performance, suggesting a positive impression of his role. However, due to the limited text, the overall verdict is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt only focuses on the performance of one actor. Without a broader assessment of the play itself, it's difficult to provide a strong recommendation, leading to a mixed score with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the lead performance, describing it as serving the character well with nervy intensity, indicating a positive assessment despite the limited context. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Positive, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
