However, calling the revival 'refreshing' and 'continually absorbing' suggests positive assessment beyond just Strong's performance. Given aggregator context shows 'Up' and strong praise language, scoring upper Positive range but with low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Jeremy Strong's performance and describes the revival as 'intimate' and 'refreshing', indicating a positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Jeremy Strong's performance and calls the revival \"refreshing\" and \"continually absorbing,\" suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt describes the revival as 'refreshing' and 'continually absorbing,' with strong praise for the lead performance indicating a clear positive recommendation, though the limited context warrants reduced confidence.",
