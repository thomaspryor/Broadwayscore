    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic uses clearly positive language - 'sustained, contained intensity', 'intimate, refreshing revival', and 'continually absorbing' - indicating recommendation, though the single excerpt limits confidence in the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review highlights a strong performance by Jeremy Strong and describes the revival as 'refreshing' and 'continually absorbing,' indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Jeremy Strong's performance and calls the revival 'refreshing' and 'absorbing,' suggesting a positive experience overall, but the single excerpt and lack of a direct recommendation warrant a score in the middle of the 'Positive' range.",
