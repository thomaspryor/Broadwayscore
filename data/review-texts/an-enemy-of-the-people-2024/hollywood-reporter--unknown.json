  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "It's far from the first time Ibsen and this work in particular has been dragged into the present, but it's urgent and effective. Ultimately one of the key strengths of this bracing revival is that it presents a classic drama as a play for our time.",

  "fullText": "In a clever trick that pulls us into the community about to witness the spectacular downfall of the public figure crusading for truth at the center of An Enemy of the People, a bar descends from above during the pause between acts, with theatergoers filing onto the stage to be served shots of aquavit while musicians and singers perform traditional Norwegian songs. Several audience members stay seated around the periphery when the action resumes. The house lights also remain up, giving us no escape from our complicity as town physician Dr. Thomas Stockmann, played with bristling intensity by Jeremy Strong, is pilloried with ridicule that escalates into physical violence.",
