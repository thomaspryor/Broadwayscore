  "bwwExcerpt": "Never mind that it takes place in 19th-century Norway. The battle between two brothers in An Enemy of the People, Henrik Ibsen's spitting-mad screed against political hypocrisy among polite small-towners, tackles more hot-button election-year issues than an average hour of MSNBC.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the play as a 'spitting-mad screed' that tackles relevant issues, suggesting engagement and contemporary relevance. However, this is purely descriptive content about the play's themes rather than evaluative criticism of the production quality, performances, or overall recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests relevance and engagement with contemporary issues, indicating a positive angle. However, without further context or a clear verdict, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt highlights the play's relevance and impact, suggesting a positive, albeit potentially qualified, recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the play's contemporary political relevance and timeliness ('hot-button election-year issues'), suggesting value in the material, but offers limited evaluation of the specific Broadway production's performances or direction. As a single curated excerpt focused on themes rather than execution, it indicates mild approval.",
