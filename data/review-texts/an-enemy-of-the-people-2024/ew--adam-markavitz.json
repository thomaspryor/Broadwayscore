The phrase 'spitting-mad screed' suggests energetic, engaging theater, but limited text prevents fuller assessment of recommendation strength. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the play's relevance to contemporary issues, suggesting a positive view of its thematic engagement. However, with only one excerpt, the full sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the play is relevant and engaging, but without a clear recommendation or further details, the score is cautiously positive and the confidence is low due to the limited text. | Kimi: The single available excerpt describes the play as a 'spitting-mad screed' addressing timely political issues, indicating mild appreciation for its relevance and energy, though the curated nature of the excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation warrant caution.",
