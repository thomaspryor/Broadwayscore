  "dtliExcerpt": "And Strong grabs that sudden intimate connection like a man holding on to bucking steer, falling ever deeper into his character’s abyss. It is a sight to see. Strong is one of the great American actors of his generation. And Imperioli is no slouch either. He’s as live and present as anyone could ask.",

However, with only one excerpt available, this could be cherry-picked praise from a more mixed review. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the strength of the performances, particularly Jeremy Strong's, suggesting a positive experience, but the limited text and single excerpt warrant a score in the middle of the 'Positive' range.",
