  "dtliExcerpt": "And Strong grabs that sudden intimate connection like a man holding on to bucking steer, falling ever deeper into his character’s abyss. It is a sight to see. Strong is one of the great American actors of his generation. And Imperioli is no slouch either. He’s as live and present as anyone could ask.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Excerpt provides exceptional praise for the lead performances with superlatives like 'great American actors of his generation' and 'sight to see.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation - no context about overall production quality or recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of Strong and Imperioli, indicating a positive view of the acting. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of broader context, the confidence is low and the score is at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on praising the performances of the actors, particularly Jeremy Strong, indicating a positive experience. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the strong praise suggests a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise for the lead performances, describing the acting as essential viewing ('a sight to see') and ranking Strong among the best actors of his generation. While limited to performance praise, the tone is enthusiastically positive.",
