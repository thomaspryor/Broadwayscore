  "dtliExcerpt": "And Strong grabs that sudden intimate connection like a man holding on to bucking steer, falling ever deeper into his character’s abyss. It is a sight to see. Strong is one of the great American actors of his generation. And Imperioli is no slouch either. He’s as live and present as anyone could ask.",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is highly positive about the performances of the two leads, using strong language like \"one of the great American actors.\" Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive with high end score, but with low confidence due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise for the lead performances, describing Strong's work as 'a sight to see' and calling him one of the great American actors of his generation, indicating a strong recommendation to see the show.",
