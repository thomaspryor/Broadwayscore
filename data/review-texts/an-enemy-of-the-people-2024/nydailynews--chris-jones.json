  "dtliExcerpt": "And Strong grabs that sudden intimate connection like a man holding on to bucking steer, falling ever deeper into his character’s abyss. It is a sight to see. Strong is one of the great American actors of his generation. And Imperioli is no slouch either. He’s as live and present as anyone could ask.",

The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on praising the performances of the actors, particularly Jeremy Strong, indicating a positive experience. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers enthusiastic praise for the lead performances, calling Strong one of the greats and the work 'a sight to see,' though the single-quote limitation prevents assessing the full production's verdict.",
