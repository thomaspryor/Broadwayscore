    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises lead performance as 'solid' and another as 'good', but lacks broader context about overall recommendation. With only one curated quote available, this appears mildly positive but incomplete. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises individual performances but lacks a clear overall recommendation for the show. The focus on actors' roles suggests a mixed assessment. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances of two actors, but the overall recommendation is tentative due to the limited text available. The phrase \"is good as\" suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers mild praise for the lead performances ('solid', 'good') without enthusiasm or criticism, suggesting a qualified positive assessment, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence.",
