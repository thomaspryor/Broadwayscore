    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt describes Strong's performance as both 'compelling' (positive) and 'occasionally overwrought' (negative criticism). This balanced assessment with both praise and criticism suggests a mixed verdict, though limited text makes confidence low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights both positive and negative aspects of Jeremy Strong's performance, suggesting a mixed impression. The lack of full context and the single excerpt warning further reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes Strong's performance as \"compelling,\" which is positive, but also \"occasionally overwrought,\" indicating a reservation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers qualified praise for Strong's performance, finding it compelling despite occasional excess, suggesting a cautious recommendation in the lower Positive range. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
