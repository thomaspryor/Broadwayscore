  "fullText": "In a clever trick that pulls us into the community about to witness the spectacular downfall of the public figure crusading for truth at the center of An Enemy of the People, a bar descends from above during the pause between acts, with theatergoers filing onto the stage to be served shots of aquavit while musicians and singers perform traditional Norwegian songs. Several audience members stay seated around the periphery when the action resumes. The house lights also remain up, giving us no escape from our complicity as town physician Dr. Thomas Stockmann, played with bristling intensity by Jeremy Strong, is pilloried with ridicule that escalates into physical violence.",
  "bwwExcerpt": "Unlike the lavish 1997 National Theatre production starring Ian McKellen, this staging is on the minimal side, with an effective revolving turntable set and a relatively small cast in which the understudies also play the townspeople in the pivotal climactic town hall meeting scene.

However, the lack of explicit recommendation language and the focus on the production's setup rather than its overall impact results in a medium confidence level. | Gemini: The review focuses on a specific staging element and Jeremy Strong's performance, but lacks an overall recommendation. The description of the play's events suggests a potentially engaging experience, but the absence of a clear verdict places it in the 'Mixed' category.",
