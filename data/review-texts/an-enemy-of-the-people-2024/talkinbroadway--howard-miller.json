    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view by highlighting how the play resonates with contemporary audiences, despite simplifying its complexity. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context necessitate a cautious, low-confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests that the play is now more relevant, implying a positive, though potentially qualified, recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates the production successfully resonates with modern audiences despite simplifying the source material, representing a qualified positive recommendation. Scored at the lower end of the Positive range due to the single-excerpt limitation and the acknowledgment of reduced complexity.",
