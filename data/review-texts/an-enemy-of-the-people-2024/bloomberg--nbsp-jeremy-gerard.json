  "bwwExcerpt": ": Richard Thomas does everything but twirl his mustache as the bogeyman in the Broadway revival of &ldquo;An Enemy of the People.&rdquo;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s because he doesn&rsquo;t have a mustache to twirl. The other accouterments of villainy -- black top hat and bowtie framing a lip-curling sneer, cape and cane wielded with menacing flourishes -- are all accounted for in Doug Hughes&rsquo;s clipped vaudeville of a production.",
