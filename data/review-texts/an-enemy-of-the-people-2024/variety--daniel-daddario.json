  "fullText": "At various points in \"An Enemy of the People,\" the Jeremy Strong-led production of Henrik Ibsen's classic, the greatest entertainment comes from watching the faces opposite you. That's not a critique of director Sam Gold's work. It's hard to think of a show that could put to better use the unique in-the-round structure of Circle in the Square Theatre than this one. In the story, society closes in on and consumes an innocent man; in the staging, we the audience are society.\n\nStrong plays Dr. Thomas Stockmann, a widower who's landed back home in what's intended to be a cozy sinecure, acting as the chief physician for the town's newly-opened spa. (As adapted by playwright Amy Herzog, the script has been substantially altered; Ibsen's original Thomas, for instance, is married.) Both man and town have seen better days, but both, too, are buoyed by optimism: the doctor, with his daughter Petra (a luminous Victoria Pedretti), opens his home to the town's strata of young and open-minded folk to take his mind off of things. And everyone is hopeful that the spa will bring in tourists, and their money.\n\nThese early moments of flickering possibility are conjured well, and a sharp contrast is established between Thomas' heedless self-belief and the shrewd pragmatism of his brother, the town's mayor. As played by Michael Imperioli, Peter Stockmann has a set jaw and a majestically tufted head of hair; having come to prominence as a young man ultimately too naive and impulsive for the mob on \"The Sopranos,\" Imperioli has aged into the suavity, and the assured menace, of a don.",

But it's hard not to feel as though this \u201cEnemy of the People,\u201d in which as rootable as possible a hero is ground down by the forces of evil, ended up presenting an opportunity for the audience to put themselves on trial, and then, with a sigh of relief, exonerate themselves.",
