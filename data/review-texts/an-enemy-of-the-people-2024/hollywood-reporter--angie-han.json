    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt focuses on praising the lead performance with balanced assessment of the character. Given the excerpt-only warning and moderate praise language, scoring at lower end of Positive bucket with low confidence due to incomplete review text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Strong's performance, indicating a positive view of his role. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a strong performance, but the mention of the character being \"insufferable\" suggests reservations. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as a positive but with lower confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong praise for Jeremy Strong's performance as commanding and charismatic. Per the single excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the upper Positive range (80-84), though confidence is low given only one curated excerpt is available.",
