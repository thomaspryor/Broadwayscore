Single excerpt limits full verdict assessment, but tone suggests solid recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Jeremy Strong's performance and describes the revival as 'intimate' and 'refreshing,' indicating a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Jeremy Strong's performance and calls the revival \"refreshing\" and \"continually absorbing,\" indicating a positive, but potentially qualified, recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for both the lead performance ('sustained, contained intensity') and the production itself ('refreshing revival,' 'continually absorbing'), indicating a solid recommendation despite the limited text available.",
