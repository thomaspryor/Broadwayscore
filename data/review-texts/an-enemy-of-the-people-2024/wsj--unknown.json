However, with only one excerpt available, I score conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises Jeremy Strong's performance and describes the revival as 'intimate' and 'refreshing,' suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Jeremy Strong's performance and calls the revival \"refreshing\" and \"continually absorbing,\" suggesting a positive experience, but the single excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation warrants a score in the lower end of the positive range.",
