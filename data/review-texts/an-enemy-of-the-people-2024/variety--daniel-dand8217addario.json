  "fullText": "At various points in \"An Enemy of the People,\" the Jeremy Strong-led production of Henrik Ibsen's classic, the greatest entertainment comes from watching the faces opposite you. That's not a critique of director Sam Gold's work. It's hard to think of a show that could put to better use the unique in-the-round structure of Circle in the Square Theatre than this one. In the story, society closes in on and consumes an innocent man; in the staging, we the audience are society.",
