  "dtliExcerpt": "This production has much to recommend it, and Strong in particular should return to the stage as often as he can. But it’s hard not to feel as though this “Enemy of the People,” in which as rootable as possible a hero is ground down by the forces of evil, ended up presenting an opportunity for the audience to put themselves on trial, and then, with a sigh of relief, exonerate themselves.",

However, it also notes a conceptual issue with the play's impact, indicating some reservations. | Gemini: The review states that the production has \"much to recommend it\" and praises the actor, but also expresses reservations about the audience's potential reaction. Given the limited text, a score in the middle of the positive range seems appropriate.",
