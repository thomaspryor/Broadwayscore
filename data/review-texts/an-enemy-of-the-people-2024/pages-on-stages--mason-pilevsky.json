    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows strong emotional response ('felt chills') and praise for relevance, but very limited text makes full verdict unclear. Scoring upper end of Positive range given the strong emotional language. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a positive reaction to the show's themes, suggesting relevance and impact. However, with only one excerpt, the overall sentiment is uncertain, leading to a low confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is positive, indicating the show resonated with the reviewer. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low and the score is at the lower end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt demonstrates strong emotional engagement and praise for the show's contemporary relevance, indicating a clearly positive reception. However, as a single curated excerpt, it may not represent the full review's verdict.",
