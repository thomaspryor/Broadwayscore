    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single curated excerpt describing the production as 'intense, immersive experience' suggests positive assessment, but with only one brief quote available and clear truncation ('Read more'), confidence is low and score stays in lower positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'intense' and 'immersive', suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low and the score is set at the lower end of the positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as \"intense\" and \"immersive,\" which suggests a positive experience. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the production as an 'intense, immersive experience,' which constitutes clear positive evaluation. However, with only a single curated excerpt available, confidence must remain low as the full review context is unknown.",
