  "fullText": "Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\n\nPhoto: Emilio Madrid Midway through the new version of An Enemy of the People adapted and directed respectively by the power couple Amy Herzog and Sam Gold, a full bar is lowered from the ceiling. The delights of this moment are manifold: Circle in the Square has no fly space, and we’ve had no hint that the compact, alley-style set created by the design collective dots — with its many real candles and oil lamps and its simple, rustic furnishings suggesting a late-1800s Norwegian home — is hiding anything. Even as we’re enjoying the architectural surprise, the house lights pop up, a couple of bartenders enter the stage, and the actors start beckoning audience members up for a drink. The show has no official intermission, but for the next ten minutes, during this informal “pause,” we’ll be invited to line up for free aquavit, mingle with the cast as they mill easily about the stage, chat with our neighbors, listen to some Norwegian folk music (beautifully sung by Katie Broad), and perhaps even stay on the set as the show continues.\n\nHenrik Ibsen’s play, by that moment, is headed into its fourth act, in which its besieged hero attempts to share a devastating discovery with his fellow citizens. In Herzog and Gold’s rendering, the act emerges organically out of the genial disorder of roughly 700 people jumping at the chance for free drinks. As the play recommences, the space between performers and spectators is naturally, potently blurred. We are all, always, in this together, but we’re not always made to recognize the fact.\n\nShow \n 5 Comments / 5 New\n \n Comment\n \n\n Ibsen, Translated Into American: An Enemy of the People\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n Your product is saved!

The critic highlights the profound impact and pleasure of the production, indicating a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review is largely positive, highlighting the successful adaptation and performances, but it's not a rave. The critic praises the production's ability to make Ibsen relevant and engaging, but doesn't use superlatives that would indicate a 'must-see' recommendation.",
