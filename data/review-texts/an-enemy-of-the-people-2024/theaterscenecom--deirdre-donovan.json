    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive verdict with 'spot on' indicating strong approval. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and extremely limited text - full review could contain caveats or additional context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a clear and strong endorsement of the production, describing it as 'spot on.' Given the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, but the language suggests a highly positive view. | Gemini: The single excerpt available states the revival is \"spot on,\" which indicates a positive assessment. Given the limited information, confidence is low, but the positive language warrants a score in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The phrase 'spot on' constitutes clear, unreserved praise for the production. Given this is a single curated excerpt, confidence is low, but the language warrants the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
