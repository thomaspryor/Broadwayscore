  "bwwExcerpt": ": &nbsp;Ibsen wrote the play, at least in part, as a response to the public outcry against his previous play, \"Ghosts,\" which bashed Victorian morality and made reference to syphilis.&nbsp;Lenkiewicz seems to give special emphasis to Stockmann&rsquo;s conflicting qualities.&nbsp;The problem with that, aside from meshing his contradictions into a single, recognizable human being, is that it sticks out of the play like a sore thumb. None of the other characters are in any way complex. The bad guys",
