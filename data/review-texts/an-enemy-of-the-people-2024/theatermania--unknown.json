However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The phrase \"nigh perfect\" suggests a positive assessment of the performances. The description of the revival as \"zippy\" also leans positive, suggesting a recommendation, though the single excerpt makes it difficult to be certain.",
