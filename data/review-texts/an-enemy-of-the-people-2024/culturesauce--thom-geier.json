    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: 3.5/5 stars indicates a positive but qualified recommendation. Single excerpt focuses on lead performance praise, but the fractional star rating suggests some reservations about the overall production. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a 3.5 out of 5 stars rating, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic review. The praise for Jeremy Strong's performance suggests a recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive assessment with a 3.5/5 star rating and highlights a strong performance, suggesting a recommendation with reservations. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The 3.5/5 star rating indicates a solid but qualified recommendation, focused primarily on the lead actor's praised work; with only one excerpt available, the assessment warrants conservative scoring in the lower Positive range.",
