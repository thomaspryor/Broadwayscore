    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the adaptation's relevance, but lacks detailed evaluative content. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the lower end of the Positive range with low confidence. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests the reviewer found the adaptation timely and relevant. Without more context, it's difficult to assess the overall strength of the recommendation, but the positive framing warrants a score in the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers clear praise for the production's relevance and timeliness, indicating a positive view, but the limited context and risk of cherry-picking warrant a conservative score at the lower end of the Positive bucket.",
