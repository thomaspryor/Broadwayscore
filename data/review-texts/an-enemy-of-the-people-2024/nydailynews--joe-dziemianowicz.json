    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic uses irony to criticize the production for lacking restraint and being overly broad. However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict is unclear, warranting low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the production for lacking restraint, implying that it is overly exaggerated or excessive. This suggests a negative view of the production's execution, although the single excerpt limits the full context of the review. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a lack of restraint and an \"amped-up\" production, suggesting a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production for being 'amped-up' and lacking the restraint mentioned in the text, describing it as 'broader than the Otra River.' This indicates clear disappointment with the directorial approach, though the single-excerpt limitation prevents certainty about whether this represents a total pan or qualified criticism.",
