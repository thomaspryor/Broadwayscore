  "bwwExcerpt": ":&nbsp;Rebecca Lenkiewicz's \"new version\" of \"An Enemy of the People\" is yet another attempt to update Henrik Ibsen's smug 1882 satire about a visionary doctor (Boyd Gaines) who becomes a pariah when he makes a discovery that threatens to gut the economy of the hypocriticAl Small town in which he lives. (Yes, the doctor is a self-portrait of the playwright as genius.)",
