Mixed assessment with low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Strong's performance but notes a significant misalignment with the character's intended complexity, suggesting a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a strong performance but also points out a problematic interpretation, suggesting a mixed assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance ('undeniably magnetic') but levels a significant criticism about the production's interpretation of the character being 'at odds with' Ibsen's complex original, suggesting the show simplifies the source material.",
