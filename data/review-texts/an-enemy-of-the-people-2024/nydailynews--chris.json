Strong is one of the great American actors of his generation. And Imperioli is no slouch either. He’s as live and present as anyone could ask.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows strong praise for the lead performances, calling Strong 'one of the great American actors' and praising Imperioli as 'live and present.' However, with only one excerpt available, I score conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review highlights strong performances by the actors, particularly praising Strong's portrayal. The language suggests a positive impression, though the single excerpt limits the ability to fully gauge the overall verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the performances of the actors, particularly Jeremy Strong, indicating a positive experience, but the limited text and single excerpt warrant a score in the middle of the 'Positive' range.",
