    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performances ('marvelous') and supporting cast ('terrific turns'), plus positive direction assessment. However, single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked praise from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and direction, indicating a positive reception. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the performances of the actors and the direction of the play, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring it on the higher end of positive with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified enthusiasm for the performances ('marvelous,' 'terrific') and direction, using thriller-like pacing as a mark of quality. Score reflects upper Positive range per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, with low confidence due to limited text availability.",
