Upper end of Positive bucket due to clearly positive language. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for Jeremy Strong's performance, describing it as 'electrifying' and 'authentic'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment of the review is uncertain, leading to a low confidence level. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a highly positive assessment of Jeremy Strong's performance, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. However, since it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the lead performance using intensifiers like 'nothing short of electrifying' and 'authentic,' warranting a high Positive score. However, confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
