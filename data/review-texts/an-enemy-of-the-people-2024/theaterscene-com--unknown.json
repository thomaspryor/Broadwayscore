  "fullText": "Editor : Jeannie Lieberman | \n    Submit an Article | \n    Contact Us\n\nJeremy\nStrong (Photo: Emilio Madrid)\n\nHenrik Ibsen's An Enemy of the People comes\nto raw and explosive life at Circle in the Square. Directed by Sam Gold, and in\na smart new translation by Amy Herzog (Gold's real-life\nwife), this 1882 drama about small town corporate corruption and the\nselling of contaminated spa water to the public seems pertinent as ever.\n\nThe action is played out on an in-the-round\nstage, with the actors entering and exiting through the aisles. The handsome set,\nresembling a long narrow barge that has been outfitted with late 19th\ncentury accoutrements, is designed by the\nmultidisciplinary collective dots. The authentic-looking period costumes (David\nZinn) look like they could have been filched from an exhibit at the Met Museum depicting\nthe life of Norwegian people during the same era.\n\nIsabella Byrd's protean lighting washes the\nstage with just the right mix of light and shadow. But a change of tone and\nlighting will come in Act 2 when the house lights are turned up and the\naudience, in effect, will appear to be the town people, intently watching the\ndrama unfold before their eyes.\n\nKatie\nBroad, David Patrick Kelly, and Victoria Pedretti (Photo: Emilio Madrid)\n\nFor those who need a refresher on the plot, An\nEnemy of the People centers on Doctor Thomas Stockmann, a medical\nofficer charged with inspecting the public spa baths from which his small\nNorwegian town derives its revenue. He secretly conducts tests on the spa water\nand finds it to have pathogens. However, a local majority of middle-class people\nwho are pecuniarily interested in concealing\nthe fact that the famous spa baths are contaminated try to hush him. Although Dr.\nStockmann still insists on spreading the truth, the mayor and key community\nleaders persuade the town folk that he is exaggerating about the bacteria in\nthe water. Dr. Stockmann, once a town hero for his advocacy for the spa baths, is\ndeclared an enemy of the people.\n\nThe town meeting scene-the climax of the\nplay--is played out with sound and fury. Dr. Stockmann, who has planned the\nmeeting to read his paper about the contamination of the spa baths to the town people,\nis unable to proceed when Aslaksen, the newspaper printer,\ninterrupts him, pointing out that they ought to elect a chairman for the\nmeeting. Even though Dr. Stockmann rebuts that there is no need for one, the\nmayor, who is his brother, insists that there is, and the consensus is with\nhim.\n\nSince this is an Ibsen drama, characters will\nundergo reversals of fortune and many relationships will change: Hovstad, the cowardly\neditor of the newspaper who regularly published Dr. Stockmann's scientific\nresearch, now refuses to publish his paper on the contaminated water. The mayor\nforbids Dr. Stockmann to read his paper on the spa baths at the town meeting since\nhe knows it could have a devastating impact on the town's commercial interests.\nThe town people, enflamed by the mayor, devolve into a mob, manhandling Dr.\nStockmann at the town meeting and then vandalizing his house that evening. Dr.\nStockmann leaves the town meeting, smarting from the shards of ice heaped on\nhim and his pants ripped.  Outraged, he pointedly remarks to his daughter Petra\non the following morning:\n\n\"Well,\nwhen you're fighting for truth and justice, don't wear your good pants.\"\n\nMichael\nImperioli (Photo: Emilio Madrid.)\n\nThere's been some retooling of the\nplay, most notably with the jettisoning of Dr. Stockmann's wife Katherine. In\nHerzog's version, Katherine has died before the play begins of an unnamed\nillness. Besides deleting Katherine from the dramatis personae, Herzog also has\nsoftened some of the rough edges from Dr. Stockmann's character.  Yes, he still\nis a rebel with a cause but his pride for standing alone is toned down a bit in\nHerzog's version.  In fact, Dr. Stockmann at play's end advises Petra not to\nlook back in anger but forward in hope:\n\n\"We must try not to think that way. And in\nten years, or fifty. . . it will matter that we did what's right. I'll be gone,\nyou may be gone by then too. But maybe Eilif (Dr. Stockmann's son) will be here\nto see it. We just have to imagine, that the water will be clean and safe and\nthe truth will be valued ... We just have to imagine.\"\n\nThe acting is terrific!  Succession's star\nJeremy Strong delivers a top-notch performance as the honest Dr. Thomas\nStockmann. Michael Imperioli is convincing as Dr. Stockmann's overbearing\nbrother and mayor of the town.  Thomas Jay Ryan is well-cast as the influential\nAslaksen, the newspaper printer and chairman of the homeowner's association,\nwhich represent the town's small business class and its largest voting bloc.\nVictoria Pedretti, as Petra Stockmann, is ideal as Dr. Stockmann's\nstrong-minded daughter and dedicated teacher. In fact, there are no weak links\nin this inspired cast.\n\nWhile Gold is a director who often introduces\nunexpected stage business into his productions, the environmental protestors in\nthe audience who interrupted the March 14th preview performance were not\nplanted there by him. That said, they fit right into the warp and woof of\nIbsen's drama with its thematic public health concerns.  Reportedly, the\nprotestors were escorted out, shouting: \"No theater on a dead planet.\"\n\nHenrik Ibsen's play, An Enemy of the\nPeople, was written 142 years ago. But, under Gold's brilliant direction, and\na star turn by Strong, this drama still has its sharp socio-political bite.\n\nAt\nCircle in the Square, 235 W 50th St.\n\nRunning\ntime:  2 hours with one brief pause",
