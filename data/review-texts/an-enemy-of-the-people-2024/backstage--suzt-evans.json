    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('coherent, topical, and thrilling') suggests enthusiastic recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the transformation of the play as 'coherent, topical, and thrilling', suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the transformation of the play into a coherent, topical, and thrilling piece. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with a high score due to the strong positive language, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strongly positive descriptors ('thrilling,' 'coherent,' 'topical') to praise the adaptation, indicating a clear recommendation. However, as a single curated quote, confidence is reduced since the full review context is unavailable.",
