Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the praise is clear and substantive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'gripping and heart wrenching' and highlights its emotional depth, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as \"gripping and heart wrenching\" and containing intimacy, anger, rancor, sweetness and sorrow, indicating a positive, though potentially qualified, recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise with 'gripping' and 'heart wrenching,' indicating a clear recommendation, though the reservation about story familiarity and limited available text warrant the lower confidence level.",
