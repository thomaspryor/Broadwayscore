However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of positive quotes. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play's strength in capturing intimacy and vulnerability, suggesting a positive view. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the play's strength in capturing intimacy and vulnerability, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('exceptionally strong') for the play's emotional depth and relationship dynamics, warranting a high Positive score, though confidence is reduced due to limited available text.",
