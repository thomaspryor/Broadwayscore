    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt suggests the show only succeeds in its final moments, implying the majority falls short. However, with only one curated quote available, the full verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the show only achieves depth in its final moments, indicating a mixed experience overall. The positive note is limited to a small portion of the show, suggesting a generally mixed review. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the show's ending being a high point, but implies the rest of the show is not as strong. This suggests a mixed reaction overall. | Kimi: The critic praises the final ten minutes as 'tender, mournful, gently profound' and notes the show 'finds its way home,' but heavily qualifies this by stating it is 'only in the last ten minutes' that the production achieves this depth, implying the majority of the show falls short.",
