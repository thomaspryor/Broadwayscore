  "showScoreExcerpt": "It mixes dialogue, direct audience address, and copious projections of Sultan’s actual photographs. The result is sometimes entertaining, thanks largely to Nathan Lane.  But….however much a hallmark achievement the book was as a work of photography, the stage adaptation feels less hallmark than at best harmless. Its attempts to replicate the book’s subtexts about aging and mortality, intimacy and facade, art and truth, feel underdeveloped — and they overburden the story.\n\nRead more",

With only one excerpt and clear ambivalence, this falls in mixed territory with low confidence. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some entertainment value, particularly due to Nathan Lane, but criticizes the adaptation for being underdeveloped and overburdened. The single excerpt suggests a mixed verdict with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review states that the show is \"sometimes entertaining\" but that the stage adaptation feels \"less hallmark than at best harmless.\" This suggests a mixed reaction. | Kimi: While acknowledging Nathan Lane makes the show 'sometimes entertaining,' the critic ultimately deems the adaptation 'at best harmless' and underdeveloped, offering faint praise that suggests neither a recommendation nor a complete dismissal.",
