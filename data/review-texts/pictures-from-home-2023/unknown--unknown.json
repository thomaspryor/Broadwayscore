    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Mixed signals - criticizes pacing ('feels padded') but acknowledges specific pleasures (humor, direction). Single excerpt warning applies; this appears genuinely mixed rather than cherry-picked positive. | GPT-4o: The review notes that the play feels padded despite its short runtime, indicating a lack of strong recommendation. However, it acknowledges the play's humor and moving stage pictures, suggesting some redeeming qualities. | Gemini: The review excerpt notes that the play feels padded, but also highlights some positive aspects like humor and stage pictures. This suggests a mixed or lukewarm assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt balances significant criticism (padded runtime for a 105-minute play) against genuine pleasures (humor, staging), indicating a mixed verdict without clear recommendation to see the show.",
