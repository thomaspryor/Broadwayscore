Mixed verdict with more negative weight. Low confidence due to single curated excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges touching moments but criticizes blunt characterizations, suggesting mixed feelings. The single excerpt and lack of a full review text lower confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges touching moments but criticizes the blunt characterizations, suggesting a mixed experience. The truncated text and single excerpt lower the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges emotional resonance and quality acting ('sympathy for actors') but criticizes the characterization as 'too blunt' and suggests the lasting impression is negative ('the arguments we'll remember'). With only one curated excerpt available, confidence is reduced.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "While the intimate and honest views of a family’s inner workings can’t help but touch our hearts at steadily paced moments, Pictures From Home is too blunt in its characterizations, with father and son especially, repeating their arguments and complaints with unstoppable frequency. Lane has the toughest job here, having to convince the audience that we don’t know who he really is, that we haven’t seen a version of this guy displayed and portrayed in everything from An American Family to (at its most extreme) Succession. The challenge proves a bit too tough even for the indefatigable and always appealing Lane, whose left to fill the holes with high-volume point-making.",
