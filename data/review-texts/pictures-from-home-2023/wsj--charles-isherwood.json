  "showScoreExcerpt": "“...’Pictures From Home’ remains two-dimensional. It’s more a comic gloss on the family’s sometimes fractious but loving relationships than the more searching examination of the images we project, in photos and in life, in contrast to the murkiness of our interior lives, that the play seems to be striving toward.”\n\nRead more",
  "bwwExcerpt": "When contemplating the talent involved in Broadway’s “Pictures From Home”—a cast comprising Nathan Lane, Danny Burstein and Zoë Wanamaker, under the direction of Bartlett Sher—managing expectations is hard. But necessary. For while the production is impeccable and the performances polished and funny, the play, adapted by Sharr White from Larry Sultan’s memoir-cum-photography book, feels like a snapshot that hasn’t been fully developed, to borrow the handiest simile. Diffuse and sometimes repetitive, it uncomfortably resembles the scrapbook of sorts on which it is based.",
