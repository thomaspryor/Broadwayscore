    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the comedy is lively but implies a disconnect or pretentiousness due to the source material. The tone is not clearly positive or negative, leading to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a mixed reaction, implying the comedy is present but weighed down by its source material. Without more context, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation, but it leans towards a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The single curated excerpt describes 'boisterous comedy' (positive) with a 'heavy patina of high-mindedness' (suggesting superficial or artificial intellectual pretension). With only one sentence available and no clear recommendation language, the overall verdict is indeterminate but leans neither strongly positive nor negative.",
