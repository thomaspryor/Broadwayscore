    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the play as 'a celebration' focused on love and family, which indicates positive sentiment. However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt presents a positive evaluation of the play, highlighting it as a 'celebration' and emphasizing themes of love and family. The tone suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, calling the play a \"celebration of a life, of family, and the most important truth of all: namely, love.\" Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive sentiment warrants a score in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers warm, unambiguous praise calling the play a 'celebration' focused on emotional truth and love, indicating a clear positive recommendation. However, confidence is low given only one curated excerpt is available.",
