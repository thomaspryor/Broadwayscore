    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt describes show as 'thin' requiring heavy lifting to be 'watchable', with only 'flashes of promise' - suggests mixed reception with significant reservations. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights Nathan Lane's performance as a bright spot in an otherwise thin show, indicating a mixed review. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the show is thin but Lane's performance makes it watchable, implying mixed feelings overall. The single excerpt and truncated nature lower confidence. | Kimi: While the critic praises Nathan Lane's performance as the saving grace, the show itself is described as 'thin' requiring significant effort to become merely 'watchable,' indicating an overall negative recommendation.",
