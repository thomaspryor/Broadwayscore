  "fullText": "The playwright Sharr White set the difficulty high for his latest Broadway play: he adapted Larry Sultan’s 1992 photo-memoir, a gorgeous (and groundbreaking) collage of portraits of his parents, taken in the course of nearly a decade in their Southern California home; stills from old home movies; and commentary, including some from his parents, who questioned his quasi-documentary project. Unfortunately, White and the show’s director, Bartlett Sher, embraced shtick and sentiment, casting the beloved vaudevillian throwbacks Danny Burstein and the great Nathan Lane as son and father (Zoë Wanamaker is underused as the mother), even though we can see—thanks to enormous projections of the original photos—that the actors’ instincts aren’t in tune with the source. Sultan’s complexity has been downgraded, by audience-courting ingratiation, to sugared family-comedy formula. The photographs also damn by way of comparison. Sultan’s portraiture was a combination of candid and staged, exquisitely composed in a way that Sher’s production is not, and the pictures glow with a baked Los Angeles palette: jacaranda light, golf-green carpeting, and the parents’ burnished, teak-dark tans. Everything onstage looks cold by contrast. (2/27/23)",

However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may be more nuanced. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the production's visual impact, comparing it unfavorably to the subject's work. The original 'D' rating suggests a negative review. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt compares the show unfavorably to the subject's work, stating that the production looks \"cold by contrast.\" Given the limited text, a negative classification is most appropriate. | Kimi: The critic assigned a D grade and specifically criticized the production's visual composition as inferior to the source material, describing the staging as cold and lacking the exquisite qualities of Sultan's original portraiture.",
