  "bwwExcerpt": "There are lots of ballads, and the singers - besides J&H, the only significant character is a prostitute (played by pop performer Deborah Cox) - increase their intensity as they go along until they're shouting at us full blast. It's like being trapped at an audition for 'American Idol' (on which Maroulis, who grew up in Wyckoff, appeared in 2004). I've seen a few worse shows than 'Jekyll & Hyde,' but none as dispiriting.",
