    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Strong negative language ('problems are legion') and fundamental criticism of the show's structure, but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights significant issues with the show, describing it as having 'legion' problems and lacking cohesion as a musical. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a negative assessment, stating the show feels more like a concert than a musical, suggesting a fundamental flaw. Given this single negative excerpt, a negative score is appropriate, but with low confidence due to the limited information. | Kimi: The excerpt identifies fundamental structural flaws, describing the work as a themed concert rather than cohesive musical theater with 'legion' problems, indicating a clear negative verdict despite limited context.",
