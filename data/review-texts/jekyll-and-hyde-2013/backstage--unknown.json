  "bwwExcerpt": "The bill for stage smoke must be a big one over at the Marquis Theatre. The stuff billows forth in unrelenting profusion during director-choreographer Jeff Calhoun's expressionistic, would-be steampunk revival of 'Jekyll & Hyde'...Unfortunately, it never achieves the critical mass necessary to obscure the proceedings...Neither Maroulis, as Dr. Henry Jekyll and his evil twin Edward Hyde, nor Cox, as London prostitute Lucy Harris, is a stranger to the Broadway stage, which shows in their committed performances. That they are one-note performances is the fault of the writing, not the stars. Both struggle with uncomfortable-sounding English accents, which they happily divest themselves of when singing-and boy can they sing.",
