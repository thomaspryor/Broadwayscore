  "bwwExcerpt": "A trouper, Maroulis sings more than a dozen songs. He and the rest of the cast, as directed and choreographed by Jeff Calhoun ('Newsies'), have survived 25 weeks on tour. With two of the show's catchier numbers ('Someone Like You' and 'A New Life') Deborah Cox is a lovely, nuanced singer. She rises above her part as a prostitute who loves Jekyll and enjoys being tied up by Hyde.",
