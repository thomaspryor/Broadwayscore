  "bwwExcerpt": "Unbelievably enough, it is actually easier to watch YouTube clips of Hasselhoff than Jeff Calhoun's re-conceived, garish and extremely unnecessary revival with 'American Idol' alumnus Constantine Maroulis and R&B singer Deborah Cox, which is playing a short run on Broadway following a national tour. Calhoun makes many unfortunate choices, including over-stressing the score's rock elements and using both nauseating video graphics and violent sexual imagery...Maroulis...uneasily alternates between being a geeky Jekyll and a vulgar Hyde. Cox sings well enough but hardly acts at all in the role of the prostitute Lucy, which may be for the better. No stars.",
