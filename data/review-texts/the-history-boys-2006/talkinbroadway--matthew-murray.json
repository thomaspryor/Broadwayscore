However, the lack of superlatives or detailed praise suggests a solid but not enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the play is brought to Broadway with intelligence and wit intact, which is a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic praises both the play's thematic content and the Broadway production's execution, noting the 'intelligence and wit' remain intact, indicating a clear recommendation despite the brevity of the excerpt.",
