However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"deeply personal\" and \"surprisingly moving,\" suggesting a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, the confidence is low, but the language points to the upper end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise with strong positive qualifiers ('deeply personal', 'surprisingly moving'), indicating a clear recommendation. However, confidence is low due to limited available text.",
