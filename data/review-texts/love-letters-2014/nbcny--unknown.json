  "bwwExcerpt": "To truly appreciate all that 'Love Letters' has to offer, just sit there and listen...Dennehy and Farrow have chemistry in abundant supply...Their rhythms--the hurried back-and-forths in the heat of an argument, the pregnant pauses, when someone's feelings have been injured--are a testament to strong direction by Gregory Mosher...I thrilled at Farrow's relief when Melissa hears from Andy after a prolonged absence. I felt the agony to my bones when Melissa realizes Andy has abandoned her...Dennehy, with his gruff mannerisms and scowl, is excellent in a role that is, in ways, the more complex. Andy proves partly responsible for Melissa's descent--yet the play can only stay on solid ground if Andy is ultimately likable. He pulls it off with authority. Dennehy and Farrow are simply well-matched.",
