  "fullText": "The most remarkable thing about A.R. Gurney’s two-hander “Love Letters,” which opened Thursday at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, is that it was first performed professionally in 1988, years before email was a common form of communication.\n\nAlthough the two characters, Melissa and Andrew, read aloud letters and postcards they’ve shared for decades, most of those missives emerge as the kind of short “dialogues” people today have via email.",
