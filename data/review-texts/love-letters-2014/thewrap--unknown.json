  "fullText": "The most remarkable thing about A.R. Gurney’s two-hander “Love Letters,” which opened Thursday at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, is that it was first performed professionally in 1988, years before email was a common form of communication.\n\nAlthough the two characters, Melissa and Andrew, read aloud letters and postcards they’ve shared for decades, most of those missives emerge as the kind of short “dialogues” people today have via email.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Aside from being prescient, Gurney is not a subtle playwright. Melissa and Andrew's childhood exchanges are as cute as they are dull...She's born rich, he services the rich. So what's their problem? Unlike Farrow, Dennehy doesn't affect a kid-like sing song voice for his early readings. But this actor could read the phone book and be engaging. Instead, he's performing 'Love Letters,' so we don't have a choice. Farrow has the far juicier part...Farrow gets to show evidence of alcoholism, substance abuse, artistic failure, and the pressures of being the Other Woman to a well-known politician. Gurney may have written a caricature, but Farrow colors it with a heartfelt performance...Hopefully Farrow's month-long stint in 'Love Letters' leads to future Broadway assignments.",

Mixed assessment with no clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the prescient nature of the play and praises Farrow's performance, but also criticizes the play's lack of subtlety and the dullness of the exchanges. The tone is mixed, with positive notes on performances but no strong recommendation for the show itself. | Gemini: The review praises the actors, particularly Dennehy, but is critical of the play itself, describing it as unsubtle and dull. It doesn't strongly recommend or discourage seeing it. | Kimi: While the critic praises both lead actors—calling Dennehy engaging and Farrow's performance heartfelt—these compliments are delivered as concessions against the play's weaknesses. The script is described as 'dull,' 'not subtle,' and a 'caricature,' with the reviewer noting Dennehy is wasted on such material. Without a clear recommendation to attend, the review balances good acting against disappointing writing.",
