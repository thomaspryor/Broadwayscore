This indicates a mixed assessment, with no strong recommendation or discouragement. | Gemini: The review suggests the production is more about the celebrity aspect than the theatrical experience, indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the production's effectiveness as a celebrity showcase but explicitly states it fails as meaningful theater, creating a balanced but unenthusiastic assessment that neither fully recommends nor dismisses the show.",
