  "bwwExcerpt": "The grip it maintains for much of its 90 minutes is partially due to Gurney's shrewd employment of tried-and-true dramatic elements. The passage of time - people going from youth to late middle age - is always poignant. And so is the notion of two individuals failing to recognize the true love they're meant to share. But the playwright also deserves credit for a crisp, amusing and actor-friendly script. He gives skilled performers such as Farrow and Dennehy the opportunity, under limiting circumstances, to bring characters to vivid life.",
