  "fullText": "Mia Farrow and Brian Dennehy star in \"Love Letters.\" \n Carol Rosegg \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You can see why everyone loves doing “Love Letters”: A.R. Gurney’s 1988 play requires no special set or costumes, and the cast of two, reading from scripts, doesn’t need to memorize lines.\n\nNow the show’s back on Broadway, with a cavalcade of stars taking turns over the coming weeks, beginning with Brian Dennehy and Mia Farrow.\n\nOn the surface the plot is banal as can be, tracking the relationship between Farrow’s Melissa Gardner and Dennehy’s Andrew Makepeace Ladd III from their meeting as children to the death of one of them nearly five decades later.\n\nTheir story is told exclusively via their letters to each other. Melissa and Andy spend the entire show sitting shoulder to shoulder behind a large wooden table, but their gazes don’t cross. They are close but not together, which pretty much sums up their shared history.\n\nAfter meeting in the second grade, the pair are hardly ever in the same city. Over the years they update each other the old-fashioned way: by putting pen to paper.\n\nAn artist and a rebel, Melissa has a hard time finding her bearings — her wealthy parents have divorced and remarried, her own marriage is a failure, she battles addiction.\n\nAndy is more grounded, and more driven. He attends Yale, joins the Navy, enrolls at Harvard Law, starts a family and winds up in Congress.\n\nAs craftily written as “Love Letters” is, it’s also static: There’s not much director Gregory Mosher can do with this setup. The show lives or dies by its actors.\n\nSurprisingly, Farrow — who has considerably less stage experience than Dennehy — is the stronger.\n\nShe looks slightly nerdy, as if she hasn’t changed her eyeglasses since the 1980s, and still has a waifish, diffident presence.\n\nYet she also easily handles Melissa’s flip, seemingly insouciant personality, as when blithely dismissing one of her friend’s letters: “I guess you have a lot of interesting things to say, Andy, but some of them are not terribly interesting to me.”\n\nGranted, Melissa is more colorful — she goes through a greater variety of emotions, and has all the good lines.\n\nBut Dennehy’s Andy remains pretty much the same throughout, while Farrow subtly suggests the arc from child to teen to college student to grown woman.\n\nIt should be fun to see how her replacements — who include Diana Rigg and Angelica Huston — will step up to the challenge.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review acknowledges the play's limitations ('static', 'banal plot') but praises the craft of the writing and especially Farrow's performance. The critic finds merit in the execution and expresses anticipation for future cast changes, indicating a positive recommendation despite reservations. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, highlighting Farrow's performance. However, it also notes the static nature of the play and Dennehy's less impactful performance, leading to a score on the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The review praises Mia Farrow's performance and calls the writing 'craftily written,' but criticizes the play's static nature and Brian Dennehy's one-note performance. Without a clear recommendation to attend, the assessment balances positive and negative elements equally.",
