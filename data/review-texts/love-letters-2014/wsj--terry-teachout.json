  "bwwExcerpt": "One reason why 'Love Letters' is so frequently produced is that it's written in such a way as to facilitate both come-and-go celebrity casting and bargain-basement staging. Not only is there no set, but the actors sit together at a table and read from scripts instead of memorizing their lines. But the enduring success of 'Love Letters' is far more than a mere matter of logistical convenience. It's one of Mr. Gurney's best plays, a tender study of thwarted love: Melissa is a scatty upper-class rebel, Andy is a stuffy upper-middle-class striver, and as they read a lifetime's worth of letters out loud, you come to know them so well that their parallel sorrows seem as familiar as your own.",

However, with only one curated quote, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive aspect of the play, but without more context, it's hard to determine the overall recommendation strength. I'm placing it in the positive bucket with a low score due to the limited information. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the show's minimalist concept, stating it 'work so well,' indicating a clear positive recommendation despite being a single curated quote.",
