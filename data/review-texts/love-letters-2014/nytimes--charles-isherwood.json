    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mildly positive, praising the performers and direction, but uses measured language ('benefits from') rather than enthusiastic endorsement. Given single excerpt limitation, scoring at lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performers but lacks a clear recommendation or overall assessment of the production. With limited context, it suggests a mixed impression. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performers and direction, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic review. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers mild, qualified praise focused specifically on the performances rather than overall excellence. With only one curated quote available, confidence is low, but the tone suggests a solid if unspectacular recommendation.",
