    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the revival as 'inventive' with 'unusual intimacy and emotional depth' - clearly positive language. However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential for cherry-picking from a longer review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the revival as 'inventive' and highlights its 'unusual intimacy and emotional depth', suggesting a strong positive impression. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the revival as \"inventive\" and transforming the musical into a piece of \"unusual intimacy and emotional depth\". Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I'm scoring it as positive with a slightly higher score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the revival's inventiveness and emotional resonance, using words like 'transforms' and 'unusual intimacy' that indicate a clear positive recommendation.",
