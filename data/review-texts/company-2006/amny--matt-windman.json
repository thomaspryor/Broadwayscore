  "bwwExcerpt": "The production (which is a bit overlong, at just under three hours) contains superb staging, visual design (including oversized party balloons, an \"Alice in Wonderland\" motif, and even a rainfall effect), music direction, and casting - with one notable exception in its leading lady, Tony winner Katrina Lenk (\"The Band's Visit\"), who is plainly miscast as Bobbie, lacking both the vocal chops and emotional vulnerability for the role.",
