However, this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review verdict, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises LuPone's performance as 'extraordinary' and 'showstopping,' indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a standout performance by LuPone, using strong positive language like \"showstopping\" and \"extraordinary,\" suggesting a positive recommendation despite the limited text. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains enthusiastic praise for lead performances using superlatives like 'showstopping' and 'extraordinary,' warranting upper-positive range, but limited context and truncation prevent Rave classification.",
