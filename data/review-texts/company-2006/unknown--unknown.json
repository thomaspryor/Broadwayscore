  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"In that sense, this “Company” is perfectly in line with his intentions: It’s new. And truth be told, I was never less than riveted — if usually in the way Bobby is, eyeballing messy marriages. Nor is the chance to hear the great score live with a 14-piece orchestra to be taken lightly; is there a more exciting opening number than the title song?\n\nSo I guess I’m sorry-grateful. Sorry for not liking this version of “Company” better — and grateful to Sondheim for providing the chance to find out.\"\n\nRead more",

The excerpt suggests engagement but with reservations, fitting a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review expresses mixed feelings, using the phrase \"sorry-grateful.\" While praising the score and orchestra, it also indicates a lack of strong positive feelings for this particular version of \"Company.\" | Kimi: While the critic praises the orchestrations and admits to being 'riveted,' the closing sentiment explicitly apologizes for not liking this specific production better, indicating significant reservations. The use of 'sorry-grateful' signals genuine ambivalence rather than a clear recommendation.",
