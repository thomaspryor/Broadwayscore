  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Vogel’s script creates its own piercing language for assault, harassment and all the ways our society reinforces regressive ideas about gender, sex and consent. The play is structured as an intimate collection of memories roughly organized around a set of rules about the basics of driving, as if someone had sneaked in a series of watercolor portraits between the pages of a driver’s manual. So the warnings about idling and using the reverse gear, which function as clever subtitles announcing the scenes, become subtly tied to the ways Li’l Bit fits those years of assault into her memory.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises Vogel's script as creating 'piercing language' and describes the structure as 'clever' and 'subtle.' However, this is only one curated excerpt discussing the writing, so confidence is low and the score reflects strong praise within the positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the script's language and structure in addressing difficult themes, suggesting a positive assessment of the play's writing and approach. Given that it is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt uses clearly positive evaluative language ('piercing', 'clever', 'intimate', 'subtly tied') to praise the script's writing and structural ingenuity. However, confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt which may not represent the full review's verdict.",
