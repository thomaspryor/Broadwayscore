  "bwwExcerpt": "It is a very happy silver anniversary for a number of talented artists in the theater. Twenty-five years ago, Paula Vogel's 'How I Learned to Drive' opened Off Broadway starring Mary-Louise Parker, David Morse and Johanna Day under the direction of Mark Brokaw. They're all back, looking better than ever - and that includes the play itself - only now they're on Broadway, where 'How I Learned to Drive' opened Tuesday at MTC's Samuel J. Friedman Theatre.",
