  "bwwExcerpt": "Dame Angela's first return to the London stage for 40 years provokes applause at her entrances and exits. One usually tends to associate that sort of thing with American theatres. A man in the stalls whooped her for completing her first scene. Had he expected her to keel over mid-line? Instead of patronising her for making it to 88, let us hail her vocal projection (in the stalls I had no trouble hearing her, despite much scuttlebutt on the internet that she is inaudible).",
