  "bwwExcerpt": "The whole show is a treat and Blakemore's production, elegantly designed by Simon Higlett with spookily billowing curtains, splendidly captures the bracing heartlessness of the comedy. Charles Edwards brings out both the urbane wit and the vanity of Condomine, who doesn't love either of his wives nearly as much as he loves himself, and gets maximum value from the comedy's disconcertingly bitter ending.",
