    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Praises Lansbury's performance but criticizes the revival as 'tired and overly familiar.' Single excerpt warning applies - this mixed sentiment could represent either a disappointed positive or qualified negative review. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges Lansbury's performance but criticizes the revival as 'tired and overly familiar,' indicating a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review praises Lansbury's performance but ultimately finds the revival \"tired and overly familiar,\" suggesting a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and truncated nature lower the confidence. | Kimi: While praising Angela Lansbury's performance skills, the critic delivers a clear negative verdict on the production itself, stating her talents 'cannot disguise' that the revival 'feels tired and overly familiar.' | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
