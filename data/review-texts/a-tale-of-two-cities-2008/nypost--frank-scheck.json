Single excerpt limits confidence in full review assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a significant flaw in the production, describing the book as 'bewildering' and the effort as 'misguided', despite praising the score. The overall tone suggests a negative verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the score but criticizes the book, indicating a negative overall assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: While acknowledging a 'soaring score,' the critic deems the production a 'misguided effort' with a 'bewildering book,' indicating the weaknesses outweigh the strengths.",
