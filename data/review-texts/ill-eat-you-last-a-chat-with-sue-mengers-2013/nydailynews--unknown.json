  "fullText": "Bette Midler plays superagent Sue Mengers in the new one-woman show written by John Logan. (Richard Termine/Photo by Richard Termine) Bette Midler didn't become the Divine Miss M by idling. She strutted, boogie-woogied and gunned it — at times on wheels in mermaid drag.\n\nMidler does none of that playing the late-'70s Hollywood talent agent Sue Mengers in the funny but vaporously thin solo show, \"I'll Eat You Last.\"\n\nFor 85 minutes, the caftan-clad Midler, back on Broadway after 30-plus years, remains rooted to a salmon-colored sofa. It's central in Scott Pask's rendering of Mengers' deluxe Beverly Hills digs.\n\nFortunately, Midler is a riot simply sitting still and dishing the dirt. Mengers dug doing that.\n\nMidler has Rolex-precise comic timing and, as she proved in her own bawdy revues, is fearless; she'll say anything.\n\nBoth traits are handy to play Mengers, who was known for clever quips and a potty mouth. She was willing to take risks. That began as a girl, when, though frightened, she \"crossed the playground\" to befriend the most popular girl — and it worked.\n\nYears later, Mengers pushed her way to power, thanks to her stable of then A-list clients, like Faye Dunaway and Ali MacGraw, and died at 81 in 2011.\n\nWriter John Logan, who won a Tony for his Mark Rothko drama, \"Red,\" keeps Mengers glued to her couch for a reason: Entitlement. If you're powerful (as Mengers was for a while), you can bid someone else to fetch your marijuana — which inspires a tasty bit of audience participation.\n\nThe action unfolds in 1981 a few hours before one of Mengers' acclaimed dinner parties. Only the famous were invited.\n\n\"Honey,\" says Mengers, \"my own mother couldn't get in if she were standing outside in the rain.\"\n\nGossip is the main course at these shindigs. The title refers to cannibalism, which seems fitting for eat-or-be-eaten showbiz.\n\nMinutes into the play, Mengers reveals that she's just been fired by longtime client Barbra Streisand — a big loss after a number of other defections.\n\nIt's the beginning of the end of the power trip for Mengers — a good time to rewind.\n\nWe hear snippets about: Mengers fleeing Nazi Germany as young Jewish girl with her parents; life in upstate New York, then the Bronx; secretarial jobs and hitting it big in Hollywood.\n\nDirection by Joe Mantello consists of having Midler cross her legs, flip her hair, light a joint and then a cigarette, and repeat.\n\nMengers recalls adventures with her clients like Julie Harris and Gene Hackman and trying to poach Sissy Spacek from another agent by going to the actress' farm.\n\n\"I had mud up to my #$%^,\" declares Mengers.\n\nThat's the state of the art in \"I'll Eat You Last.\" It goes down like a bucket of hot-buttered popcorn, with about that much nutritional value.\n\nBut Midler is delicious and worth crossing the playground to get a ticket.",
