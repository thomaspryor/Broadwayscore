    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for Midler's performance ('glorious form', 'larger than life and surprisingly intimate') suggests positive recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Midler's performance highly, describing it as 'glorious' and highlighting her skill. The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, though the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a highly positive assessment of Midler's performance, suggesting a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I've placed it in the upper range of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: Single available excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for Midler's performance using superlatives like 'glorious form,' but limited context prevents assessing the full production or determining if this represents the overall verdict.",
