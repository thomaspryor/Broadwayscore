  "bwwExcerpt": "Under the astute direction of Joe Mantello, Mengers' story develops as its own kind of Hollywood yarn, with struggle, success, hubris and downfall. Midler even makes her bombastic character somewhat touching, although Mengers' last line to the audience - \"Now get the (bleep) out of my house\" - puts a stop to such nonsense.",
