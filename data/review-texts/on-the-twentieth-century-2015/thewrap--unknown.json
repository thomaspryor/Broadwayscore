And the current Broadway revival, which opened Sunday at the American Airlines Theatre, has at least one in tip-top form, Kristin Chenoweth.",

Mixed assessment with both negative and positive elements. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the musical's shortcomings but highlights the opportunity it provides for actors, with specific praise for Kristin Chenoweth. The overall tone is mixed, neither strongly recommending nor discouraging attendance. | Gemini: The review states the musical isn't great but highlights Kristin Chenoweth's performance as a reason to see it, indicating a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic dismisses the musical itself as not great, they praise Kristin Chenoweth's performance as 'tip-top form,' implying her star power elevates the material enough to warrant a recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
