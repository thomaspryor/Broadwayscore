  "bwwExcerpt": "Scott Ellis's dazzling production of 'On the Twentieth Century' looks like one of those legendary Broadway musicals that exists largely in our collective memory of great shows we never saw. Like those phantom productions, this 1978 tuner comes with a fine pedigree (book & lyrics by Comden & Green, music by Cy Coleman), has been mounted in high style and is performed with manic energy by a super cast toplined by charismatic stars Kirsten Chenoweth and Peter Gallagher. For a lot of us, this is the show of our dreams.",

However, the text is an excerpt, so confidence is set to low. | Gemini: The review praises Kristin Chenoweth's performance in glowing terms, highlighting her vocal abilities and comedic timing, suggesting a positive experience. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers enthusiastic praise for the lead performance ('glorious voice', 'radiant form', 'pyrotechnics') and describes the show as a successful musical comedy, indicating a clear positive recommendation despite the brevity of the provided text.",
