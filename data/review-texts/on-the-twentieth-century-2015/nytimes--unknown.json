I am delighted to report that this latter art is being practiced in altitudinous-high style...Scott Ellis’s ripping, lavishly appointed revival of this 1978 musical about dueling giant egos knows that when it comes to being hyperbolic, there’s no people like show people...sit back, relax and savor the blissfully bumpy ride in luxury accommodations.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows enthusiastic praise ('delighted to report', 'ripping, lavishly appointed', 'blissfully bumpy ride in luxury accommodations') but low confidence due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly enthusiastic language ('over-the-moon acting', 'lavishly appointed revival', 'blissfully bumpy ride') indicating a strong recommendation. The single excerpt warning suggests using the upper end of the bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses highly positive language, describing the acting as \"over-the-moon\" and the revival as \"ripping\" and \"lavishly appointed.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing the score at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise ('over-the-moon acting', 'ripping, lavishly appointed revival') and an explicit recommendation to savor the production, though the single-excerpt format warrants caution about potentially cherry-picked quotes.",
