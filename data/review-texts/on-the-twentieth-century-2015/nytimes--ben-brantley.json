  "bwwExcerpt": "Perhaps best of all, this 'Century' brings Ms. Chenoweth and Mr. Gallagher back to Broadway, where they can demonstrate the subtleties of being larger than life. These fine performers have been largely confined to television screens in recent years. And they grab the chance to chew (and devour) some real live scenery - and in Ms. Chenoweth's case, hit pretty much every note on the scale, musical and otherwise - with the ecstatic vengeance of genies let out of their bottles.",

However, the lack of further evaluative content or context about performances or direction results in a medium confidence level. | Gemini: The review excerpt is positive, highlighting the lavish production design. However, the 'theme party' comparison suggests a lack of depth or substance, leading to a lower score within the positive range. Confidence is low due to the truncated text. | Kimi: The critic offers enthusiastic praise for the production design with superlative language ('swankiest theme party'), indicating strong appreciation for the visual elements, though the extreme brevity of the text prevents assessment of the overall recommendation.",
