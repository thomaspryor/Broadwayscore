    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('delicious', 'assured', 'success') praising direction and performances, but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness of full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction and cast, describing the comedy as 'delicious' and 'dexterous'. The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt limitation. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"delicious\", \"assured balance\", and praises the cast. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise using words like 'delicious,' 'success,' and 'dexterity' to commend the direction and performances, indicating a strong recommendation at the upper end of the Positive range.",
