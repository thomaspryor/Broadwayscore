  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Allegedly a comedy-thriller, it comes up short on both laughs and thrills...The characters are little more than one-note tics and their interactions just aren’t that funny. The romantic subplot is half-hearted. At no point does the play even remotely approach...slapstick farce...The direction...seemed a bit listless. Rockwell’s set is a transforming wonder...Once again MTC has lavished first-rate production values on second-rate material. I was very disappointed.”\n\nRead more",
