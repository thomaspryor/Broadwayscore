  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Bean's script has plenty of weird and funny bits, but far too much falls flat. Sullivan, usually so reliably excellent, fails to bring the necessary fizz and fun to the proceedings...Things pick up considerably in the second act, when the plot finally kicks in...Ultimately, ‘The Nap’ seems full of potential, but doesn't fully deliver. Fans of off-beat humor and groan-worthy gags will find some of those pleasures here, but overall the play is overcome by sluggish pacing and hit-or-miss laughs.”\n\nRead more",
