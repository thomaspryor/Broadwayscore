  "bwwExcerpt": "Happily, Bean has a sense for balance, and doesn't let his farce linger too long over romance. He soon gets back to the table: '[Play] with the nap,' Dylan tells us, 'the ball will run straight with the natural line. [Play] against the nap, the ball can deviate and drift...' For Bean, the nap is a straight line to a good joke. He knows his game.",
