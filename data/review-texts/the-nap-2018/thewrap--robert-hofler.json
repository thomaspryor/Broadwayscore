  "bwwExcerpt": "Little surprises lead up to a very big one in Richard Bean's new comedy 'The Nap,' which had its American premiere Thursday at MTC's Samuel J. Friedman Theatre. This review won't disclose the Big Reveal, which is right up there with the one in David Mamet's 'House of Cards.' However, it's the many little surprises of the first act that most intrigue and delight.",
