And it is very, very funny...’The Nap’ is totally original and thoroughly modern...Bean has populated his play with a classic set of comic characters...The performances are uniformly top notch...The real hero of this production is Bean. He has intertwined a hilarious comedy with a thriller filled with surprises. What more could we ask of a play designed to simply entertain? Pure comedy is back on Broadway.”\n\nRead more",
