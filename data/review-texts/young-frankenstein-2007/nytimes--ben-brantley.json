The phrase \"stopping dead in its tracks\" further suggests a lack of consistent momentum or quality. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unambiguous criticism of the show's structure and pacing ('overstuffed and undercooked,' 'stopping dead in its tracks') with no redeeming qualities mentioned, indicating a clear recommendation against seeing it. Confidence is low as this appears to be a brief excerpt rather than a complete review.",
