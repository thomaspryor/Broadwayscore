    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows measured criticism of lead performance, comparing unfavorably to another Broadway star. Text cuts off mid-sentence making full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed assessment, highlighting a lack of charisma and chemistry in Clarke's performance compared to Johansson. The tone is neither strongly positive nor negative, indicating a mixed review. | Gemini: The review excerpt compares the lead actress unfavorably to Scarlett Johansson, suggesting a lack of charisma and chemistry. This indicates a negative assessment of the performance, and thus, the show. | Kimi: Single available excerpt criticizes the lead performance as lacking charisma and chemistry, comparing it unfavorably to a nearby production. Text truncation prevents assessment of full verdict. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Negative",
