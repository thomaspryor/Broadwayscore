  "bwwExcerpt": "Five days before the show's premiere, Sean Mathias sat in front of me at \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\" The British director had a pen in his hand and a notebook in his lap. By rights, Mathias should've been drafting an apology letter for stirring up this half-baked rehash of Truman Capote's singularly quirky book about Holly Golightly.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Pan) - using median score | Claude: The critic calls the show a 'half-baked rehash' and suggests the director should apologize, indicating clear disappointment. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is strongly negative, suggesting the show is a 'half-baked rehash' and implies it warrants an apology. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is clearly negative, calling the production a \"half-baked rehash.\" Given that this is the only excerpt available, I am scoring it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Pan",
