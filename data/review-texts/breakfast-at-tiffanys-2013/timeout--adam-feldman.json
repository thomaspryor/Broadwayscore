Here is a story that-in both Truman Capote's 1958 novella and Blake Edwards's 1961 film-relies on the restive charm of its central figure: Holly Golightly, a beauteous young courtesan in 1940s New York, who conceals her hillbilly roots beneath a blithe, insouciant manner and a cultivated voice flecked with faux French. \"She isn't a phony because sh",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Pan | Claude: The opening sentence delivers a devastating verdict calling the show 'meager and stillborn' - extremely harsh language that indicates a pan. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and text appearing to be cut off mid-sentence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'meager and stillborn,' indicating a strongly negative assessment. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is set in the lower Pan range with low confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the production as \"meager and stillborn,\" which is a strongly negative assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the language points to a negative recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt employs devastatingly negative language ('stillborn') to characterize the Broadway production as a complete failure, warranting a deep Pan score. Confidence is low due to availability of only a single excerpt, though the evaluative phrasing is unambiguous.",
