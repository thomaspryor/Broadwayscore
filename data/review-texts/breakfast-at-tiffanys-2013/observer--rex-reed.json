Clear pan despite acknowledging cast talent. | GPT-4o: The review strongly criticizes the production as a 'lumbering, lifeless disaster' and 'shrill, charmless cipher,' indicating a deep pan with no redeeming qualities. | Gemini: The review uses strong negative language like \"lifeless disaster\" and criticizes the show's handling of the source material and cast. This clearly indicates a pan. | Kimi: Rex Reed delivers a devastating pan using words like 'disaster,' 'lifeless,' and 'charmless,' explicitly stating the production wastes its cast's talents. Even acknowledging the 'superb cast' cannot redeem the overwhelmingly negative verdict.",
