    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt with no clear recommendation. The comparison to 'Woolworth's' vs presumably 'Tiffany's' suggests disappointment, and the final question 'Can't a girl be left to her dreams?' reads as wistful criticism, but without full context this could be part of a larger positive or negative assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed tone, comparing the show unfavorably to a less glamorous setting. The lack of aspiration implies a lack of strong recommendation, but without more context, it's unclear if the overall sentiment is more negative or positive. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the show is not aspirational and gritty, implying a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt and lack of context, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic employs a dismissive comparison to suggest the show lacks the glamour and aspirational quality expected, instead offering a disappointing, downmarket experience that denies the audience escapist dreams. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Negative",
