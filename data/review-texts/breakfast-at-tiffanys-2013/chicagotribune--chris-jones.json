  "bwwExcerpt": "The problem here is of simpler vintage: There's no palpable connection between Fred and Holly, the unlikely and surely ill-fated couple of Capote's imagination...The other problem with Mathias' show...is that it misses the exuberance of the \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" novella...Capote understood the dangers of trying to start from scratch - the past will come out, and all that - but he also knew its appeal...Greenberg tries to underscore this crucial ambivalence in his text, and he tries to set out",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt focuses on fundamental problems with the show - lack of chemistry between leads and missing the source material's exuberance. However, with only one truncated excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may not be represented. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights significant issues with the production, such as a lack of connection between characters and missing the novella's exuberance. The tone suggests disappointment, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt identifies key problems with the production, including a lack of connection between the leads and a failure to capture the exuberance of the source material. Given the limited text, a negative score seems appropriate. | Kimi: The critic identifies fundamental flaws including a lack of chemistry between the lead characters and a failure to capture the exuberance of Capote's source material, indicating the production falls short of success.",
