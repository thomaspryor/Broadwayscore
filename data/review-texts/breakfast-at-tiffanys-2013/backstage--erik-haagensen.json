  "bwwExcerpt": "Playwright Richard Greenberg has adapted Truman Capote's novella \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" for the theater with remarkable fidelity-and that's the problem. Capote's wispy memory tale, told principally in carefully carved prose, may be hypnotic on the page, but it's dull onstage, with too much narration and not enough drama. Greenberg and director Sean Mathias haven't rethought it in theatrical terms. Add to that a game but awfully artificial performance by Emilia Clarke as Holly Golightly, and it",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear criticism of fundamental adaptation problems ('dull onstage', 'not enough drama') and lead performance ('awfully artificial'). Text appears cut off mid-sentence, limiting confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the adaptation for being dull onstage and lacking drama, with an artificial performance by Emilia Clarke. The tone suggests a negative assessment of the production. | Gemini: The review excerpt is negative, citing dullness, lack of drama, and an artificial performance. The truncated nature lowers confidence. | Kimi: The critic finds the adaptation fails to theatricalize the source material, resulting in a dull production with excessive narration, and criticizes the lead performance as artificial, indicating a negative recommendation.",
