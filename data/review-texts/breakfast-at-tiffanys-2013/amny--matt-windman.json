    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt clearly criticizes the adaptation as 'drab and dragging' with 'very little excitement' and faults the writing approach as 'awkward.' However, confidence is low due to truncated text and single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The review describes the adaptation as 'drab and dragging' with awkward narration, suggesting a negative overall impression. However, there is some praise for Clarke's performance, which slightly tempers the negativity. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the production as \"drab and dragging\" and states that there is \"very little excitement to be found.\" While Clarke's performance is acknowledged, the overall tone is negative, suggesting a lack of recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as 'drab and dragging' with 'very little excitement,' criticizing the writing and direction despite praising Emilia Clarke's performance. As a single curated excerpt, the full verdict may differ, but the available text indicates a negative assessment.",
