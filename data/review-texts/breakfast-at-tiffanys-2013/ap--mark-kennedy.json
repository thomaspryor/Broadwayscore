  "bwwExcerpt": "The cat is just one of the problems in this ill-conceived and poorly executed adaptation of a classic American tale that opened Wednesday at the Cort Theatre...The many scenes stubbornly refuse to add up to much and it remains as flat as Golightly is supposed to be effervescent. Richard Greenberg's adaptation of Truman Capote's classic 1958 novella is extremely faithful - some chunks of dialogue have been lifted directly from the book - without adding much.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative language throughout: 'ill-conceived and poorly executed,' 'stubbornly refuse to add up to much,' 'flat' when it should be 'effervescent.' Even with truncated text, the verdict is consistently negative. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the adaptation as 'ill-conceived and poorly executed' and describes it as flat and unengaging. The negative tone suggests a recommendation against seeing the show. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses negative language such as \"ill-conceived and poorly executed adaptation\" and \"refuse to add up to much\". Given the negative tone, I've classified it as negative, but with low confidence due to the truncated text. | Kimi: The critic describes the adaptation as 'ill-conceived and poorly executed,' with scenes that fail to cohere and a flat tone that misses the source material's spirit. As this is a single truncated excerpt, confidence is reduced, but the visible text offers no recommendation.",
