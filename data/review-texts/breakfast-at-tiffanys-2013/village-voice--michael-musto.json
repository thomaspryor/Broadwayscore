  "bwwExcerpt": "Richard Greenberg's adaptation of Truman Capote's classic novella Breakfast at Tiffany's turns out to be earnest, talky, and rather lifeless despite its good intentions. Telling the story of a chirpy socialite/hooker in 1943 New York and her interaction with a writer who isn't exactly straight, this production stays faithful to the book without turning it into a persuasive piece of theater.",
