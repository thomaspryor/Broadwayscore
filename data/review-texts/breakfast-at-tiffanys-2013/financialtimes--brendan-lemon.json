  "bwwExcerpt": "In Richard Greenberg's elegant Broadway adaptation of Breakfast at Tiffany's Holly Golightly has morphed into Holly Godarkly. I refer not merely to the tresses of Emilia Clarke, who plays her, which have gone from the porn-star blonde of her Daenerys in Game of Thrones to a lush brunette here. The tone of Tiffany's has also darkened...If the shift is truer to the spirit of Truman Capote's 1958 novella, it also makes for a rather dispiriting evening. So quickly apparent is Holly's phoniness...tha",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic calls the evening 'dispiriting' and criticizes Holly's 'quickly apparent phoniness.' However, this is a single truncated excerpt that may not reflect the full verdict, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative tone, describing the evening as 'dispiriting' and highlighting Holly's phoniness. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review states that the adaptation makes for a \"rather dispiriting evening,\" indicating a negative experience. The truncated text and single excerpt lower confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt acknowledges the adaptation's elegance and fidelity to Capote's novella, but explicitly describes the theatrical experience as 'dispiriting'. Truncated text and single-excerpt format create uncertainty about overall verdict.",
