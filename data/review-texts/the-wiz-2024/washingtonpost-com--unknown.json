  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessReview by  Gloria OladipoThe latest revival of “The Wiz” just wants to be fun. And that’s a problem.\n\nThe original was a rarity. When it launched in 1975, the musical won the Tony Award for best musical and was among a handful of Broadway productions at the time to feature an all-Black ensemble. Soulful, rich, drenched in color and magic, the original offered a vibrancy unseen before. Songs like “Home” and the funky “Ease on Down the Road” are etched into the American songbook.",
