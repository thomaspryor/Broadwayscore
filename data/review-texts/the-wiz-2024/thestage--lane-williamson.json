  "bwwExcerpt": "Now, they’re playing on Broadway for the first time since its original production in an energetic, charming new staging from director Schele Williams. Cheers erupt. Charlie Smalls’ score is packed with infectious grooves and the cast delivers some fine singing. JaQuel Knight’s choreography physicalises the music and the show ascends when the full ensemble is in motion.",

However, with only one curated excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights positive aspects such as the energetic and charming staging, fine singing, and effective choreography. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"energetic, charming\" and \"fine singing,\" suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given the limited text, a score in the middle of the positive range is appropriate.",
