  "fullText": "'The Wiz' review — musical revival celebrates a history of Black creativity and cultureRead our review of The Wiz on Broadway, a 50th-anniversary revival of the 1974 musical, now starring Wayne Brady as the Wiz and directed by Schele Williams.\n\nThere’s a lot to enjoy in the revival of The Wiz, the “super soul musical” retelling of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz first staged on Broadway in 1975. There are sparkling costumes by Sharen Davis, additional book material by Amber Ruffin, and a charming ensemble including Avery Wilson (Scarecrow), Phillip Johnson Richardons (Tinman), Kyle Ramar Freeman (Lion), and newcomer Nichelle Lewis (Dorothy). But the subtext is most compelling about this revival.\n\nThe last few years on Broadway have seen more efforts to make audiences more inclusive, with a 2023 report identifying 29% of attendees as Black, Indigenous, or people of color. As recently as 2019, Black audiences made up only 2.9% of Broadway theatregoers. But the culture of Broadway has always been, and continues to be, shaped by Black creativity and cultural expression, from the rise of ballroom to the return of house music in a post-COVID world.\n\nThe Wiz firmly reconnects the disco and Motown sounds that were coming out of other, white-led 1970s shows (like Grease and Thank God It’s Friday) back to their Black roots. It's compelling that, 50 years later, the musical returns to subtly reconsider the ways those sounds have changed. The Wiz is at its best when it revels in these Black musical styles and choreography by JaQuel Knight, from trap-influenced moments to bits of Afrobeats to flourishes of ballroom movement. In these sequences of ecstasy, it feels like these forms of artistic expression are coming home.\n\nDorothy arrives back on the farm discouraged and feeling like an outcast when her schoolmates tell her she doesn’t belong, as if cementing her inability to make friends or carve a path out for herself. But when a tornado hits the house and drops her in the bizarre land of Oz, it’s up to her and her new friends, who seek a brain, heart, and courage from the Wiz (Wayne Brady), to brave the uncertain world and find those things for themselves.\n\nThe show's cast also features Deborah Cox as Glinda and Melody A. Betts as Aunt Em and Evillene.\n\nThe border of the stage displays African art featuring sketch-like triangles and little rectangles resembling sound speakers, nodding to the simple and expressionist set design by Hannah Beachler. The ensemble bounce off one another with ease and infuse their characters with personality and humor.\n\nThe maximalist approach that the show clearly aspires to is not quite executed with enough actual stagecraft, but a lot of that spectacle gets folded into the giant video design by Daniel Brodie, which, although imaginative, feels like it undermines some of the show’s inherent magic.\n\nOut of 196 ratings, The Wiz has an 84% approval rating from audiences on Show-Score at the time of publication. Audiences largely praised the cast and classic material but shared mixed opinions on the new elements of this production.\n\nRead more audience reviews of The Wiz on Show-Score.\n\nWhile this production, directed by Schele Williams, could have been more spectacularly maximalist (not relying on a video background), its gentle updates to the music as an indication of The Wiz’s legacy nonetheless offer an entertaining time at the theatre.\n\nLearn more and get The Wiz tickets on New York Theatre Guide. The Wiz is at the Marquis Theatre.\n\nPhoto credit: Kyle Ramar Freeman as Lion, Nichelle Lewis as Dorothy, Wayne Brady as The Wiz, Phillip Johnson Richardson as Tinman, and Avery Wilson as Scarecrow in The Wiz.
