  "dtliExcerpt": "The new revival of the 1975 musical by Charlie Smalls (et al) and William F. Brown updates some references (with the help of Amber Ruffin, fresh off her success with Some Like It Hot) and takes what worked from the 1978 movie (namely the Michael Jackson-as-Scarecrow solo “You Can’t Win”) and the popular TV musical (the swag, my god, the swag) to produce what may be the best version of The Wiz to date.",
