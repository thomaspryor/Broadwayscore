  "bwwExcerpt": "But the bigger question is what took Jane Fonda 46 years to come back to Broadway, where she's giving a robust and confident performance in the play that opened last night. Fonda plays Katherine Brandt, a music scholar with a progressive, degenerative condition who's determined to understand Beethoven's fixation before her time is up.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising Fonda's performance as 'robust and confident' suggests positive reception, but limited text and lack of broader show evaluation requires cautious scoring at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights Jane Fonda's 'robust and confident performance,' suggesting a positive view of her role. However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious, lower-end score within the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on Jane Fonda's performance and the play's premise, describing her performance as \"robust and confident.\" While limited, this suggests a positive, though not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt provides clear, enthusiastic praise for Jane Fonda's performance as 'robust and confident,' suggesting a positive recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced due to the risk of cherry-picking.",
