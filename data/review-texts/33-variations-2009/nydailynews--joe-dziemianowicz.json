However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious, lower-end score within the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on Jane Fonda's performance and the play's premise, describing her performance as \"robust and confident.\" While limited, this suggests a positive, though not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt provides clear, enthusiastic praise for Jane Fonda's performance as 'robust and confident,' suggesting a positive recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced due to the risk of cherry-picking.",

  "fullText": "Tuesday, March 10th 2009, 12:06 PM\n\nThere's a mystery humming in \"33 Variations.\"\n\nWhy did Ludwig van Beethoven spend his final years feverishly rewriting a mediocre waltz by his publisher Anton Diabelli?\n\nBut the bigger question is what took Jane Fonda 46 years to come back to Broadway, where she's giving a robust and confident performance in the play that opened last night.\n\nFonda plays Katherine Brandt, a music scholar with a progressive, degenerative condition who's determined to understand Beethoven's fixation before her time is up.\n\nThe Oscar winner brings everything to this role that's made her an iconic film star: Pure enthusiasm, toughness tempered by vulnerability, and that distinctive voice which makes every line fascinating.\n\nToo bad this handsomely designed but unconvincing drama isn't as big an event as Fonda's return. Writer-director Moises Kaufman (\"Gross Indecency,\" \"The Laramie Project\") is known for visually inventive works that blend fact and fiction.\n\nHe delivers both in this play, seen earlier in San Diego and Washington, D.C. But what begins as an exciting journey of discovery, with hints of \"Amadeus,\" sinks into a conventional Lifetime momand-daughter reconciliation.\n\nAnd Katherine's conclusion about Beethoven is as sketchy as her character.\n\nThe action takes place in the past and present and tells three stories: The ailing Katherine's research in Bonn, Germany; Beethoven's stages of dementia and illness while writing the variations in the 1820s; and the growing romance between Katherine's nurse, Mike (Colin Hanks) and her daughter Clara (Samantha Mathis).\n\nTwo strands would have sufficed, since the third is contrived. Also distracting is Kaufman's tendency to hammer the paral lels between the two eras, including when characters speak lines in unison and Katherine is chided for treating Clara like \"a second rate waltz.\" Nope, not subtle.\n\nDespite the script's weaknesses, the cast is strong.\n\nZach Grenier's bluster and brooding are the right notes for the tempestuous genius and Mathis' quiet realism works wonderfully for Clara. As Gertie, a German archivist helping Katherine, Susan Kellermann employs light touches that take the role beyond stern stereotype.\n\nHanks, as Mike; Erik Steele, as Beethoven's assistant; and Don Amendolia, as Diabelli, are all engaging.\n\nThe stylish staging tickles the senses. Derek McLane's set, which features twirling panels covered in sheet music, and David Lander's beautiful lighting are first-rate. Adding another layer of interest is concert pianist Diane Walsh, who accompanies the action by playing Beethoven's variations.\n\nFeds eyeing the couple's assets 'round the world.\n\nAuthorities say Anna Nicole Smith's boyfriend supplied the former Playmate.\n\nThe First Lady visited with hard hit families of men and women fighting overseas.\n\nOh, if walls could talk! Take a look inside Lohan's NYC home.\n\nCheck out the 10 young stars whose talent translates to box office bucks - and seem destined for success.\n\nSee which celebrities were caught on candid camera.\n\nThey were as much a part of your childhood as homework. Will you recognize them now?\n\nMandy Moore and Ryan Adams just married... See other head scratching celeb pairings.\n\nThe web giant's corporate motto may be \"Don't Be Evil,\" but has Google become just that?\n\nDid Kelly Bensimon beat her BF to ensure a return to \"Housewives\"?
