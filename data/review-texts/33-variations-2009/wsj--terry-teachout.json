However, this is only a single excerpt which limits confidence in the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises both Jane Fonda's return and the play itself, describing it as 'thoughtful' and able to stand on its own merits, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. The single excerpt warning suggests using the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights Jane Fonda's return as a draw, but also notes the play's own merits as a thoughtful meditation. This suggests a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers clear praise for the play's substance beyond its star attraction, describing it as a 'thoughtful meditation' that 'stands on its own merits,' indicating a solid recommendation despite limited excerpt availability.",
