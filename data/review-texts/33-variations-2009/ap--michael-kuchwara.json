  "bwwExcerpt": "Moises Kaufman's earnest, plot-heavy \"33 Variations\" swirls with big ideas about big subjects - life, death, art to name three - and how they intersect and illuminate each other. Yet the play, which opened Monday at Broadway's Eugene O'Neill Theatre often seems dramatically tepid and slow moving. And this, despite the efforts of a hardworking cast that includes Jane Fonda, returning to the New York after an absence of more than four decades.\"",
