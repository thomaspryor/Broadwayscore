Single excerpt with truncated text makes full assessment difficult. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights issues with the play, particularly the believability of Fonda's character's illness. The tone suggests mixed feelings, with no clear recommendation or discouragement. | Gemini: The review identifies issues with the show, but also praises Fonda's performance. The overall sentiment is mixed, leaning slightly negative due to the identified problems. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly cites 'quite a few issues' with the writing and direction, specifically criticizing the believability of the central illness plotline, while acknowledging Jane Fonda's poised performance. As a single truncated excerpt, the full verdict is unclear but the criticism of the material dominates.",

  "fullText": "Last updated: 10:57 amMarch 10, 2009 Posted: 12:25 amMarch 10, 2009\n\nJANE Fonda, is that really you? How long has it been since we've last caught up on Broadway? Forty-six years? You look great! And your character has a fatal illness? No way!\n\nThere are quite a few issues with \"33 Variations,\" written and directed by Moisés Kaufman. But the biggie is the difficulty of believing that anything, including Lou Gehrig's disease, could slow down Fonda's character, Katherine Brandt. The patrician actor remains poised until the very end. Her Katherine just doesn't like taking orders, even from death.\n\nKatherine is a musicologist obsessed with figuring out why Beethoven came up with 33 different variations of a minute-long waltz by Anton Diabelli. The action toggles back and forth between Katherine's research - and her physical degradation - in the Beethoven archive in Bonn, Germany, and the increasingly deaf composer's creation of the Diabelli Variations. The budding relationship between Katherine's daughter (Samantha Mathis) and nurse (Colin Hanks) provides welcome levity.\n\nFonda's seemingly congenital inability to suggest weakness undermines both her character and the play's dynamics. We are very far from the emotional and intellectual punch of \"Wit,\" in which Kathleen Chalfant memorably bared body and soul as a John Donne expert dying of cancer.\n\nBut the star also struggles to suggest, in the beginning, that obsession can create its own thrills. This leads to a deep imbalance onstage because Zach Grenier isn't afraid to go over the top as an entertaining, somewhat hammy Beethoven.\n\nWhen he fervidly guides us through Variation No. 32 (with help from pianist Diane Walsh, providing live accompaniment from the side of the stage), it's the only time in which the \"transfiguration\" Katherine wonders about, the movement \"from the banal to the exalted,\" is articulated in purely theatrical terms.\n\nMostly, however, there's talk, talk and more talk, with occasional snatches of music. The author of fact-based works like \"The Laramie Project\" and \"Gross Indecency,\" Kaufman regurgitates his considerable research in artless chunks. And it often feels as if he didn't trust his premise's innate pull: The friction between Katherine and her daughter, for instance, seems little more than a forced attempt to create more drama.\n\nThe piece is quite effective when Kaufman-the-director takes over for Kaufman-the-writer: when Fonda shows a glimpse of fear as Katherine submits to strobe-like X-rays, or when Mathis silently suggests apprehension and sorrow, arms folded and shoulders hunched. Derek McLane's library boxes, stacked on floor-to-ceiling shelves, also make a powerful statement, simultaneously suggesting claustrophobia and the joy of discovery.\n\nAs her body inexorably degenerates, Katherine asks herself, \"How does one begin to let go?\" If Kaufman and Fonda truly addressed this question, \"33 Variations\" could live up to its considerable potential.\n\n33 VARIATIONSEugene O'Neill Theatre, 230 W. 49th St.; 212-239-6200.\n\nHome|News|Sports|Page Six|Business|Entertainment|Opinion|TV|Classifieds|Blogs\n\nNEW YORK POST is a registered trademark of NYP Holdings, Inc.
