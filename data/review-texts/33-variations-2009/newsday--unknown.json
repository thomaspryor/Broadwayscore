  "bwwExcerpt": "Jane Fonda is lanky and wry, with a great chin and a flat, deep voice that, more than once in her return to Broadway, may make you think about her late father, Henry. By opening last night at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre in an ambitious new work - rather than in a brand-name vehicle or a star-driven fluff ball - she is also very brave. This does not make \"33 Variations\" a good play or suggest that the actress, 71, has bounced back onto the stage with all the easygoing confide",
