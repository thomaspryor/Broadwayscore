  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Jane Fonda is 71. I'm trying to process this preposterous fact as I watch the actress, still svelte and radiant, portray a musicologist dying of a wasting disease in \"33 Variations,\" the earnest new Broadway play about the inscrutable progress of illness and genius. Fonda's agelessness owes something to both the longevity of her fame and the intensity of her struggle against physical decline. (No one did more for the workout -- or a leotard -- than Jane Fonda.)",
