    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clear praise - 'intellectually stimulating' and 'emotionally satisfying' indicate strong positive verdict. Given single excerpt warning and positive tone, scored in upper Positive range, but confidence is low due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation, highlighting both intellectual and emotional satisfaction. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"welcome return\", \"intellectually stimulating\", and \"emotionally satisfying\", suggesting a strong positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it towards the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strong positive descriptors ('intellectually stimulating,' 'emotionally satisfying,' 'welcome return') indicating a clear recommendation in the upper Positive range, though confidence is reduced due to availability of only a single curated quote.",
