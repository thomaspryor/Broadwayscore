    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Uses strong positive language ('triumphant return', 'thoughtful meditation') but this is only one excerpt from a longer review, so confidence is medium. The praise suggests solid recommendation territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('triumphant return', 'thoughtful meditation') suggesting a highly favorable view. Despite the single excerpt limitation, the tone indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"triumphant,\" which indicates a strong positive sentiment. Given that it is only a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt uses strongly positive language ('triumphant,' 'thoughtful meditation') warranting the upper Positive range per protocols for limited excerpts, though the lack of full context necessitates low confidence.",
