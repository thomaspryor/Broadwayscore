However, with only one excerpt available and text appearing truncated mid-sentence, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests an attempt to create a theatrical event but describes the play as 'muddled,' indicating a mixed assessment. The lack of a clear positive or negative verdict and the single excerpt warning lead to a low confidence mixed score. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the word \"muddled\" to describe the play, indicating a negative assessment. Given the truncated text and single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly labels the play 'muddled' and criticizes the director's attempt to combine academic material with melodrama, suggesting a failed execution. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning and truncated text.",
