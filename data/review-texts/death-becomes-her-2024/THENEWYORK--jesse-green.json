Credit... Sara Krulwich/The New York Times By Jesse Green Published Nov. 21, 2024 Updated Dec. 24, 2024 Death Becomes Her Not since Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne themselves performed there in 1958, leaving a trail of scrapes and bite marks in their wake, has Broadway’s Lunt-Fontanne Theater housed such equal-billing dragons as the ones Megan Hilty and Jennifer Simard play in “Death Becomes Her.” The musical, which opened on Thursday, stars the two comic treasures as lifelong frenemies for whom the “lifelong” part is an understatement. Their animosity is eternal. That Hilty and Simard make it so jolly is a big relief and a big surprise. The 1992 Robert Zemeckis movie on which the show is based may be a queer camp classic , but its misogynistic ick factor is high. The leads — Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn — are shot leeringly yet unflatteringly, a queasy combo. The violence they do to each other is more vivid than the vanity at its root. What binds them, even in acrimony, goes largely unexplored. And, fatally, the film is not very funny. For its first 30 minutes, the musical is nothing but. When introduced, Hilty’s Madeline Ashton is a star of a certain age being hoisted by chorus boys in a creaky vehicle called “Me! Me! Me!” Its opening number, “For the Gaze,” establishes her epochal narcissism while also winking, in its title pun, to the material’s cult audience. The staging, by Christopher Gattelli, goes so breathtakingly over the top — costume changes, key changes, cameos by both Liza and Judy — that half the lyrics get lost in the laughs. Though best known for her vocal chops — fully exploited here in glossy songs by Julia Mattison and Noel Carey — Hilty is an inventive and beguiling comedian, putting a warm spin on even the meanest zingers. Indeed, one of the improvements in Marco Pennette&#x27;s book for the musical is that those zingers seem like love pinches, painful but titillating. They are often self-directed, too, and thus a kind of self-pleasure. When Simard’s Helen Sharp tells Madeline she’s stunning, the diva responds, with evident delight, “Well, thanks to my hair, makeup and neck team.” She also credits “that tapeworm diet.” Simard is simply brilliant. I say “simply” advisedly; it takes a lot of craft and homework to stand next to Hilty and not be outdone. Happily, her Helen is an astonishing creation of disappointment and disparagement: Dorothy Parker boiled down to a syrup, spitting takedowns like sour candies. “Love her like a twin,” she says of Madeline, in a voice of squeaky chalk. “Who stole my nutrients in the womb.” The wit of her delivery (she belts well too) helps us see that the pair’s connection is based on mutual admiration that amounts to a sense of completion: Each needs the other to shine. That’s a formula with no room for a man, as Ernest Menville — Helen’s fiancé, later Madeline’s husband — soon discovers. Cursed with that name, and despite Christopher Sieber’s nerdy charm, he is mostly a tool and a prop for the women. At the end of the show, they even upstage his arc’s clever punchline. What takes up most of the action until then is the surely familiar story of a miracle elixir that reverses aging and obviates death. In the musical, this potion is dispensed by a creature called Viola Van Horn, who emerges at the start of the show from an amethyst geode. As Viola, Michelle Williams, in spectacular gowns by Paul Tazewell, is something of an amethyst geode herself: sparkly, spiky, glassy, mystical. “I have a secret you would die for,” she sings in the show’s first lyrics. The choice to forefront that theme, a big change from the movie, could have backfired, delaying the plot and elevating to prominence a character it returns to only periodically. But in fact it works well, orienting the audience to the story’s critique of youth at all costs while putting the characters’ nastiness in a broader cultural context.

Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Well, perhaps “critique” and “cultural context” are too highfalutin for a musical that operates mostly at low comedy levels. Once Viola has transformed the women into glamazombies, the show has no choice but to serve up facsimiles of the movie’s special effects. This is, after all, a ",
