This suggests a mixed reception with positive elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a significant flaw (\"doesn't have a discernible heartbeat\") but highlights the strengths of the performers, suggesting it's still \"fun and fabulous.\" This indicates a positive but not rave recommendation.",
