    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review acknowledges a fundamental flaw (no discernible heartbeat) but finds redeeming value in the lead performances that keep it entertaining. Single excerpt warning requires conservative scoring within Mixed range. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that while the musical lacks depth ('doesn't have a discernible heartbeat'), the performances by Hilty and Simard make it enjoyable ('fun and fabulous'). This indicates a mixed sentiment with positive elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a significant flaw (\"doesn't have a discernible heartbeat\") but praises the performances, suggesting it's still enjoyable. Given the single excerpt and negative acknowledgement, I'm placing it in the lower end of the positive bucket.",
