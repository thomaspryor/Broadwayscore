However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment may not be fully captured, leading to a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review highlights positive aspects of the performances, suggesting a positive experience overall. However, due to the limited text, a more conservative score is appropriate.",
