  "fullText": "In the new Broadway musical \"Death Becomes Her,\" a so-so 1992 movie gets a stunning makeover.\n\nHeadlined by Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and a slew of special effects, the film followed two vain women in their desperate quest for eternal youth and beauty — with a supernatural twist. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the black comedy earned mixed reviews and middling B.O., but there was something about its mix of camp and surreal, body-contorting special effects that developed a following over the years.",
