  "fullText": "The new Broadway musical Death Becomes Her bursts onto the scene with excellent homophone humor: \"We all know that this whole damn show is for the gaze!\" Or, depending on how you hear it, the \"gays.\" It's kind of the perfect summary. The show is a musical adaptation of the 1992 film, which explores the lengths women will go in the face of societal pressure about aging. But its status as a cult classic in the LGBTQ community has given it an afterlife most movies can only dream of, which may be how it ended up on Broadway.\n\nIt's hard to follow the film's leading ladies Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn, but if anyone is up for it, it's Megan Hilty and Jennifer Simard. Hilty bursts with star power as the glamorous and self-indulged actress Madeline Ashton, and Simard's dry delivery is hilarious in author Helen Sharp's meeker getup — and even better after she transforms into a femme fatale to show up Ashton.\n\nChristopher Sieber is the perfectly bumbling plastic surgeon Ernest Menville, who can't get a song in edgewise when Madeline and Helen are at their finest - though he manages to sneak away for a ludicrously funny song of his own in one of the campiest scenes of the show. Michelle Williams, a Broadway veteran and former Destiny's Child member, opens the show and is ever-present as the otherworldly Viola van Horn. Aloof in contrast to the hotheadedness of the main characters, with a voice to bring the house down, she is a fitting choice for a character offering eternal youth.\n\nThere is love and fandom in every element of this show, like recreations of the movie's outfits and iconic lines, but the story is also amplified for a 2024 audience. Madeline feels the external pressures of being a woman of a certain age more acutely than her movie counterpart. Josh Lamon as Stefan, Madeline's long-suffering assistant, both grounds the story and contributes to its camp with zingy interjections. And maybe most importantly, the ending is touchingly optimistic without letting go of the absurdity of it all.\n\nIn my audience, Madeline Ashton's opening number earned a standing ovation from several audience members. Many of the references and direct quotes from the film were also met with a lot of clapping and whooping. Homages to the movie are part of what make this show so fun, so theatregoers who have never seen the original might want to watch it first in order to fully appreciate the callbacks.\n\nTrue to its name, Death Becomes Her revolves around some deadly, supernatural happenings. The musical pulls these off with unmatched scenic design by Derek McLane and illusions by Tim Clothier, costumes by Paul Tazewell and makeup by Joe Dulude II - all of which create flesh-and-blood theatre magic just as impressive as the movie's computer-generated visual effects were in 1992.\n\nDecadent and a lot of fun, Death Becomes Her is a musical that knows what it is and what its audience wants. For that it just may \"siempre viva\" — live forever.",
