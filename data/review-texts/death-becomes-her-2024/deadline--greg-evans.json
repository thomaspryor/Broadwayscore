  "dtliExcerpt": "A perfect rejoinder to the ubiquitous Broadway Sucks These Days gripe about the too-many movie-to-stage adaptations has arrived at long last, and it's a simple three-word response: Death Becomes Her. A virtually perfect big-budget, broad-appeal musical comedy that improves in every way over the 1992 film, director-choreographer Christopher Gattelli's wildly entertaining vehicle for two of our best singer-actor-comedians on any stage today renders the movie-as-source snipe worthless.\n\n\tDon't waste a minute's thought on which of the two – Megan Hilty or Jennifer Simard – come out on top with this delight of a holiday gift (let Tony voters lose sleep over that one next spring). The two work together like the ingredients of a dangerous magical potion, each delivering precisely nuanced yet stupendously big performances in amounts that, were they off by so much as a fraction, would thoroughly undo the magic.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\n\tCasting\n\n\t\t\t\t\t&#039;Just In Time&#039;: Jeremy Jordan To Succeed Jonathan Groff As Broadway&#039;s Bobby Darin",
