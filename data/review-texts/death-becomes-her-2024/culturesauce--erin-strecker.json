Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances and humor, suggesting a positive experience, but the truncated nature and single excerpt lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production design and the 'rapier-sharp repartee' between leads, describing 'hilarious results' and gut-busting comedy, indicating a strong recommendation despite the limited single-excerpt context.",
