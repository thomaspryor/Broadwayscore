    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a focus on the set rather than the music, implying a lack of memorable songs. This indicates a mixed impression, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The quote is a positive assessment of the set design, suggesting a memorable and enjoyable aspect of the musical. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt with backhanded praise — 'humming the set' implies the visuals outshine the score/performances. Mildly positive but clearly qualified. Low confidence due to single excerpt warning.",
