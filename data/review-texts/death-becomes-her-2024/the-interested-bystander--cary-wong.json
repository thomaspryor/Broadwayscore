Granted'), but low confidence due to extremely limited text that may not represent full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances as 'unforgettable' and suggests a highly enjoyable experience ('permission to laugh non-stop'). Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone is clearly positive. | Gemini: The excerpt is extremely positive, highlighting unforgettable performances and non-stop laughter. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it high within the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers enthusiastic praise for the lead performances and explicitly endorses the show's comedic entertainment value with playful, high-energy language, though as a single curated quote it may not capture the full review's balance or any reservations.",
