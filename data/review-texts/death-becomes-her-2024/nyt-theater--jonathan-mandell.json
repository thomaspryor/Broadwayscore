    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed tone, appreciating the style but also indicating a self-awareness of being over-the-top. Without a full review, it's unclear if this is a positive or negative verdict, leading to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The quote suggests an enjoyable, albeit potentially flawed, experience. The description is positive, but the limited text makes it difficult to assess the overall strength of the recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear appreciation for the production's aesthetic ('stylishly macabre') and its meta-theatrical self-awareness, indicating a positive response, though the limited excerpt prevents a fuller assessment of the critic's ultimate recommendation.",
