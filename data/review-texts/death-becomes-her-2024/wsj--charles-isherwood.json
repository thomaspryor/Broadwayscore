Mixed verdict with no clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The review praises the performances of Hilty and Simard but criticizes the plot for becoming ludicrous and losing its fun, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review praises the performances of the leads but notes that the plot becomes convoluted and the fun diminishes. This indicates a mixed reaction. | Kimi: The critic praises the show's humor and the lead performances as 'boisterously funny' and 'seductive,' but notes significant flaws including a convoluted plot that causes the fun to 'peter out' and a lack of thematic depth. The final verdict recommends the show primarily for its stars' compelling work.",

And if the show intended to make any pertinent commentary on the uselessness or dangerousness of chasing after one’s vanishing youth, it is swallowed up in the glossy production. Ms. Hilty and Ms. Simard are sufficiently seductive performers to hold our attention and affection through their witty work.",
