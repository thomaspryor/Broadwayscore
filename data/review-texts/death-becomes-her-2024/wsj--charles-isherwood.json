But perhaps none of its ample array of gags, whether low, high or occasionally borrowed, is quite as ingenious as the joke supplied by Megan Hilty, one of the show’s two bright-burning female stars.\n\nCopyright ©2025 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

  "bwwExcerpt": "As the plot grows more ludicrous and convoluted, the fun peters out like a slowly deflating helium balloon sagging to earth. And if the show intended to make any pertinent commentary on the uselessness or dangerousness of chasing after one’s vanishing youth, it is swallowed up in the glossy production. Ms. Hilty and Ms. Simard are sufficiently seductive performers to hold our attention and affection through their witty work.",
