  "bwwExcerpt": "Act one was pretty bullet-proof. Tight pacing, hilarious dialogue, and they nail the big moments. It ends with the stairs (which is staged BRILLIANTLY) and I was very satisfied during intermission. Special shout out to the writers for ridding of the infamous fat-shaming suit bit with Goldie Hawn in the movie too. I really like the direction they took with Helen’s downfall. Act two definitely needs some tweaking before Broadway.",
