    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clearly positive language ('hearty laughs', 'gutsy, zesty and highly skilled lead performances') but excerpt cuts off mid-sentence. Single excerpt warning suggests upper end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'silly, campy, go-for-broke' with 'hearty laughs' and praises the lead performances. This suggests a strong positive tone, but due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as \"silly, campy, go-for-broke\" and filled with \"hearty laughs\" with strong lead performances, indicating a positive but not rave review. Confidence is low due to the truncated text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the show's comedic energy and lead performances, calling it 'filled with hearty laughs' with 'highly skilled' stars, though the note that Act 1 is 'stronger' suggests some reservations about the second act. Given this is a single curated excerpt that is truncated, confidence is low, but the tone is clearly positive.",
