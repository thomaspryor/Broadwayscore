    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'great art' with enthusiastic tone, but this is only a single excerpt so confidence is low and the full review verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'witty fun' and highlights the performers' contribution to elevating it to 'great art,' indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is highly positive, calling the show \"witty fun raised to great art.\" Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I am scoring it at the higher end of the Positive bucket. Confidence is low due to the limited text. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
