    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of Megan Hilty and Jennifer Simard, suggesting a positive view of their contribution to the show. However, the lack of full context and the single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious, low-confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the leads, but it's too brief to determine the overall recommendation strength. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as a barely positive review. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the two lead performers ('musical comic legends'), indicating they provide a strong foundation for the production. Per the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the upper Positive range, though confidence remains low given the limited available context.",
