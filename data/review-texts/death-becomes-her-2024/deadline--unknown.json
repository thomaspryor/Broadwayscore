However, the single excerpt and lack of a full review necessitate a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the performances but also suggests a delicate balance that could easily be disrupted, indicating a positive but potentially flawed experience. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring conservatively.",
