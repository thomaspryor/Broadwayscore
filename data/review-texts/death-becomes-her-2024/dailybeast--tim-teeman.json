However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is highly positive, describing the show as a \"skillfully executed riot\" with \"relentless, deliciously played, perfectly directed hilarity.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic, unqualified praise with superlatives like 'perfectly directed' and 'skillfully executed riot,' placing it at the high end of Positive. Confidence is low due to the single-excerpt format and truncated text.",
