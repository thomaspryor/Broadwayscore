  "bwwExcerpt": "\"You may be grabbing tickets for \"A Steady Rain\" simply to bask in the movie-starry presence of Daniel (\"007\") Craig and Hugh (\"Wolverine\") Jackman on Broadway. But skip the celebrity angle and prepare to be ensnared by some sharp acting and an absorbing story as Keith Huff's two-character drama relentlessly darkens over the next 90 minutes.\"",
