  "bwwExcerpt": "\"You may be grabbing tickets for \"A Steady Rain\" simply to bask in the movie-starry presence of Daniel (\"007\") Craig and Hugh (\"Wolverine\") Jackman on Broadway. But skip the celebrity angle and prepare to be ensnared by some sharp acting and an absorbing story as Keith Huff's two-character drama relentlessly darkens over the next 90 minutes.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('ensnared', 'sharp acting', 'absorbing story') with enthusiasm that goes beyond celebrity appeal. Single excerpt warning suggests this could be cherry-picked, so scoring in upper Positive range but with low confidence due to incomplete text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the acting and story, suggesting a strong recommendation beyond the celebrity appeal. The language is positive and engaging, indicating a high score within the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive experience due to the acting and story, but the initial focus on celebrity presence implies a potential reservation. Given the single excerpt and the positive tone, I'm placing it in the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The critic advises audiences to look past the celebrity casting and praises the 'sharp acting' and 'absorbing story,' clearly recommending the production for its artistic merits rather than just star power.",
