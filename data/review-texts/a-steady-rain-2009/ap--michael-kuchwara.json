    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise for the stars but dismisses the overall production as merely 'pulpy entertainment' and celebrity watching. With only one excerpt available, this could represent a larger mixed or negative review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that while the performances are competent, the production itself is not elevated beyond its star power and plot-heavy nature. The lack of a clear recommendation or discouragement places it in the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review acknowledges good performances but suggests the show is ultimately just a showcase for movie stars in a pulpy story, indicating a mixed or lukewarm reception. The limited text makes confidence low. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the lead actors perform well but explicitly states they cannot elevate the material beyond superficial star-gazing, dismissing the show as merely 'pulpy, plot-heavy entertainment' with limited theatrical value.",
