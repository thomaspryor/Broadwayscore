  "bwwExcerpt": "\"But under John Crowley's spare and precise direction, the actors earn their adulation, magnifying what's most gripping about Huff's writing even when the drama, stretched thin with bang-bang incident, becomes considerably less believable over time. And for those worried about authenticity, fear not: Although Jackman is from Australia and Craig is from England, they slip into the American reality of their characters as if it were a second skin.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises direction and performances while acknowledging the drama becomes 'less believable over time.' Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction and performances, noting the actors' ability to embody their characters convincingly. However, it also mentions that the drama becomes less believable, indicating some reservations. | Gemini: The review praises the direction and acting, but notes that the drama becomes less believable over time. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the direction and performances ('earn their adulation', 'magnifying what's most gripping') but includes significant criticism of the drama's believability. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is low, but the tone suggests a qualified recommendation.",
