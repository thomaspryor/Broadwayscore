This is a clear case where performer praise does not redeem the overall negative assessment. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the actors' efforts but ultimately criticizes the material as shallow, leading to a negative recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the actors' efforts but ultimately states they are fighting a losing battle against the material, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the lead actors are 'agreeable company' working hard, the decisive verdict is that they are 'fighting a losing battle' against shallow material that prevents any depth. Performer praise does not redeem the overall negative assessment.",
