    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the play as keeping audiences 'in its thrall from start to finish,' which is clearly positive language suggesting engagement and recommendation. However, confidence is low due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a strong positive reaction, highlighting the play's ability to captivate the audience throughout. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt is strongly positive, indicating a recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the language suggests the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single excerpt uses strong positive language ('thrall') indicating the production is captivating and engaging. However, confidence is low due to the availability of only one curated excerpt.",
