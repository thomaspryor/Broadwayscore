  "bwwExcerpt": "The Roundabout Theatre Company's flawless revival of A Soldier's Play is such good medicine for Broadway's January blues that it might be enough just to tick off its merits: a gripping murder mystery heightened by crackling dialog, a first-class ensemble of actors in symphonic harmony, staging that audaciously adds a pinch of sex appeal to heat up its social consciousness, and just enough music to give it a pulsing rhythm and beat that delivers us to its shocking conclusion in just under two hou",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows unqualified praise with 'flawless revival' and 'good medicine', listing multiple superlative qualities. However, confidence is low due to truncated text and potential for cherry-picked quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('flawless revival', 'gripping', 'first-class ensemble') indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a rave review. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"flawless revival\", \"gripping murder mystery\", \"first-class ensemble\", and \"symphonic harmony\", indicating a strong recommendation. Given that it is only one excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong unqualified praise, describing the production as 'flawless' with 'crackling dialog' and a 'first-class ensemble,' warranting a high Positive score per the single-excerpt guidance, though confidence is reduced due to the truncated, curated nature of the text. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
