The mention of the cast's understanding of the play's elements suggests a high level of praise for the production. | Gemini: The review states that the production brings the play 'roaring back to life' and praises the cast's understanding of the text, indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the revival ('roaring back to life') and the cast's understanding of the material, indicating a strong recommendation despite the brevity of the text.",
