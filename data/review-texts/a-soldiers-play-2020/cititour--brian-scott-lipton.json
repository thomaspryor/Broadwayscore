    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Clear rave language with 'must-see' and 'riveting,' calling it a 'first-class work' that was 'worth the wait.' However, this is a single excerpt which may not represent the full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('riveting', 'must-see') indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the phrase \"must-see production,\" indicating a strong positive recommendation. The word \"riveting\" further supports this classification. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers enthusiastic endorsement with 'must-see' and 'riveting,' but limited context requires conservative scoring at high end of Positive range. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
