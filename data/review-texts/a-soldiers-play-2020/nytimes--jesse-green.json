  "bwwExcerpt": "Onstage, though, the loud ticktock of the investigation too often drowns out the emotion - an effect perhaps enhanced by the flattening of the genre brought on by endless \"Law & Order\" spinoffs and reruns. In any case, whether \"A Soldier's Play\" is a great stage drama regardless of its flaws is something its bumpy but worthy Broadway debut, directed by Kenny Leon for the Roundabout Theater Company, cannot answer. Despite some powerful acting, it is too distracted to make the case.",
