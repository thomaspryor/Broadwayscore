    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'so good' and 'riveting' with appreciation for the 'fine production.' Single excerpt warning applied - using upper end of Positive range given clear enthusiasm. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the production, describing it as 'fine' and 'riveting', indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the play as \"so good\" and \"riveting\" even if the audience knows the ending, indicating a strong positive recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the language suggests the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt provides strong praise ('fine production,' 'so good,' 'riveting') for this Broadway production, though limited context necessitates low confidence.",
