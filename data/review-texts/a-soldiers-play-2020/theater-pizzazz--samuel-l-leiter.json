    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite opening with 'Cavils aside' (indicating reservations), the critic finds sufficient merit to recommend the show with qualified praise for its dramatic interest and energy. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a positive view with phrases like 'dramatic interest' and 'charismatic energy', but the presence of 'cavils aside' suggests some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, the score leans towards the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that despite some 'cavils,' the show has enough positive qualities to keep the audience engaged, suggesting a positive but not rave recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: While acknowledging minor flaws ('cavils aside'), the critic praises the production's 'dramatic interest,' 'socio-historical dynamite,' and 'charismatic energy,' clearly recommending it as an engaging evening.",
