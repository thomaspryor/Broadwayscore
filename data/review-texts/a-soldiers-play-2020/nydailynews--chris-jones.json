  "bwwExcerpt": "Kenny Leon's lively, broadly staged Roundabout revival, which stars a savvy Blair Underwood and a bold-faced David Alan Grier, plays a kind of sly homage to the erotic legacy of that Oscar-nominated film, the stage being filled with a plethora of stunningly buff and good-looking guys - there are no women in the play, but there were plenty around me in the audience at the American Airlines Theatre on 42nd St.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with positive descriptors ('lively', 'savvy', 'bold-faced') suggests recommendation, but limited text and potential cherry-picking warrants lower confidence and conservative scoring within Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'lively' and 'broadly staged' with positive mentions of the cast. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"lively\" and \"savvy\" to describe the production and performances, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt uses clearly positive descriptors ('lively', 'savvy', 'bold-faced') and praises the staging and performances, indicating a solid recommendation despite the limited context of a single curated quote.",
