    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed assessment - acknowledges quality ('well-written drama') but notes it 'doesn't register as strongly,' suggesting disappointment. Direction praised for supporting actors but not leads. Low confidence due to single curated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests mixed feelings about the production, praising the direction of supporting actors but indicating a lack of impact compared to the original 1981 production. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence in the score. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the play is well-written and praises the direction of the supporting actors, but states it doesn't resonate as strongly as it did previously. This suggests a mixed reaction, not strongly positive or negative. The excerpt-only nature lowers confidence. | Kimi: The critic finds the direction uneven (praising lower-tier actors but noting the leads seem disconnected) and explicitly states the production doesn't measure up to the 1981 original, though acknowledges the script's quality. With only one excerpt available, confidence is low.",
