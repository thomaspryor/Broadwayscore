    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'fantastic' and highlights its significance as a landmark Pulitzer winner, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. | Gemini: The title suggests a positive review, but without the full text, it's hard to gauge the strength of the recommendation. The phrase \"fantastic\" indicates a positive leaning, but the rest of the title implies there's more to it than just one aspect. | Kimi: The headline explicitly describes the show as 'Fantastic', indicating strong enthusiasm for this Broadway debut, though the single excerpt format limits assessment confidence.",
