Low confidence due to single curated quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the play's themes are still relevant and impactful, indicating a positive view. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the play's themes are still relevant and convincing, indicating a positive assessment. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt praises the play's lasting insights as 'dismayingly convincing,' indicating strong appreciation for the material's power and relevance. Limited to one curated quote, confidence is reduced despite the clearly positive assessment.",
