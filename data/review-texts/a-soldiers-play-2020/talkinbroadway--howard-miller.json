Given the single excerpt warning, this suggests a strong positive sentiment, placing it in the upper range of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The quote is short but clearly positive, praising both the cast and production quality. Given the limited information, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt employs enthusiastic praise ('rock solid,' 'spit-shine') for both the performances and production values, placing it in the upper range of the Positive bucket per the single-excerpt guidance, though confidence is low due to the limited available text.",
