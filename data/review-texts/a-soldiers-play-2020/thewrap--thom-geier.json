  "bwwExcerpt": "Grier returns in the first Broadway production of \"A Soldier's Play,\" which opened Tuesday at Roundabout's American Airlines Theatre - this time as the fearsome, foul-mouthed Sgt. Vernon Waters, who commands his all-black troops as if their every move was a reflection on the future of the race.

However, this is only one curated excerpt, so confidence is low and the overall verdict remains uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Grier's performance as 'searing' and notes a strong match with Blair Underwood, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of a full review, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Grier's performance as \"searing\" and highlights Underwood's contribution, suggesting a positive overall assessment. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with high end score. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong praise for the lead performances ('searing', 'well-matched'), indicating a clearly positive assessment, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the overall verdict.",
