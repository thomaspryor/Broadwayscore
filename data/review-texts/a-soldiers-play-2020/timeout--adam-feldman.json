At the start of the play and during transitions between scenes, the servicemen-played by Nnamdi Asomugha, Rob Demery, Billy Eugene Jones, McKinley Belcher III, Warner Miller and tap dancer Jared Grimes-raise their voices into rich, deep blues.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single curated excerpt praises the direction and performances but is too limited to determine full verdict. Set at lower end of Positive range due to excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a positive aspect of the direction, emphasizing beauty and richness. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the positive aspects of the direction and the performances, suggesting a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, review. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the director's vision and the cast's vocal performances ('rich, deep blues'), indicating a positive response. However, as a single curated excerpt without a stated verdict or rating, the overall recommendation strength is uncertain.",
