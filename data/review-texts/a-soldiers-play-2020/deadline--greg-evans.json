  "bwwExcerpt": "With three-time Tony nominee David Alan Grier and a commanding Blair Underwood leading a first-rate, 12-member cast, this Soldier's Play (adapted as A Soldier's Story for the 1984 film) moves with all the precision of a military cadence. The production is not without its missteps - a few self-conscious moments seem like gratuitous elbow jabs to make sure we understand the contemporary relevance - but director Kenny Leon drives the narrative with a solid feel for momentum.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises the lead performances and cast as 'first-rate' and notes strong direction with good momentum, but acknowledges some missteps. Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds clearly positive so scored at upper end of bucket. | GPT-4o: The review praises the cast and direction, indicating a strong production overall, but notes some missteps. The single excerpt suggests a positive review with some reservations. | Gemini: The review praises the cast and direction, but notes some missteps. Given the limited excerpt, a score in the middle of the Positive range seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the first-rate cast and director's skilled pacing, with only minor caveats about self-conscious moments, indicating a clear recommendation despite reservations.",
