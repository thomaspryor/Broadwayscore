    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('quite powerfully', 'still hits home') praising the production's emotional impact and enduring relevance. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's powerful impact and emotional resonance, indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"powerfully\" and \"hits home\", suggesting a positive review. Given it is a single excerpt, I am scoring at the higher end of the positive range but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the production's emotional impact and execution, describing it as powerful and affecting. However, as a single curated excerpt, the confidence is low regarding the full review's sentiment.",
