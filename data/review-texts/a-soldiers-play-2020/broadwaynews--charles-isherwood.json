    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as 'captivating' which is positive praise, but with only one curated quote available, confidence is low and score stays in lower positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'captivating', indicating a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The title excerpt indicates a positive review. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing the score at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt uses unambiguously positive language ('captivating') to describe the production, indicating a clear recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence remains limited regarding the full review's assessment.",
