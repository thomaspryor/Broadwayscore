    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it a 'stellar revival' which is clear praise. However, this is only one curated excerpt so confidence is low - the full review may contain reservations not shown here. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'stellar,' indicating strong praise. The use of 'reminds audiences' suggests an impactful and meaningful experience. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper range of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"stellar\" to describe the revival, indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing the score at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('stellar') indicating a clear recommendation, but limited context from a single curated quote necessitates conservative scoring in the upper-positive range.",
