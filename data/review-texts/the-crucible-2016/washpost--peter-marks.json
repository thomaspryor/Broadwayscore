  "bwwExcerpt": "For God's sake -- or maybe the devil's -- don't mess with Abigail. The look of feral resolve in Saoirse Ronan's eyes is so intense that an audience has not a moment's hesitation believing in the havoc at her fingertips in director Ivo van Hove's stunning new Broadway revival of 'The Crucible.' Her Abigail...is one of the many coups in van Hove's transfixing modern-dress production...The portrayals across the board infuse Arthur Miller's 1953 drama of vengeful mass hysteria with a stomach-knotting urgency that doesn't dissipate until well after the last of the evening's wrenching twists.",
