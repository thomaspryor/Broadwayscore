    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single sentence praising the lead performance and making the production feel contemporary, but lacks broader evaluation of the overall production. Low confidence due to extremely brief excerpt. | GPT-4o: The review praises Ben Whishaw's performance and describes the revival as feeling 'urgently contemporary,' suggesting a strong, enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review highlights a strong performance and suggests the revival is worth seeing due to its contemporary relevance. However, it's a single sentence, so it's hard to gauge the overall strength of the recommendation. | Kimi: Although brief, this excerpt offers strong praise for both the lead performance ('feverish intensity') and the production's contemporary impact ('urgently contemporary'), indicating a clear recommendation. Confidence is low due to the text's brevity.",
