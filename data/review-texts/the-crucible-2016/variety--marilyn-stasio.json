  "bwwExcerpt": "There's bound to be head-scratching over Ivo van Hove's peculiar Broadway production of 'The Crucible,' Arthur Miller's towering 1953 drama about the infamous 17th-century Salem witch trials - and so much more. The ensemble, led by Ben Whishaw, Sophie Okonedo, Ciaran Hinds, and Saoirse Ronan, is superb, and the play sustains its power to shock and thrill. But the directorial concept is baffling. In stripping down the context of 'A View from the Bridge' earlier this season, van Hove did a brilliant job of isolating and illuminating the internal battle waged by its tormented hero to save his own soul. 'The Crucible' resists that treatment. It's too big, too complex, too philosophical to deconstruct and reduce to its 'essence.'",
