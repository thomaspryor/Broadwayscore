  "bwwExcerpt": "The fire-starter is 17-year-old Abigail Williams (Saoirse Ronan), impelled at least in part by her anger at John Proctor's refusal to resume their brief sexual relationship. That pivotal core of passion isn't given much emphasis. Whishaw underplays for much of the evening, while Ronan - one of Hollywood's current \"It\" girls following her performance in the film \"Brooklyn\" - gives a fierce but emotionally opaque performance in her stage debut.",
