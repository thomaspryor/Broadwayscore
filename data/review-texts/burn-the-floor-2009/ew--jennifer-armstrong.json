    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for storytelling and pacing being 'worthy of any Broadway musical' suggests strong recommendation, though single excerpt limits full context assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's storytelling and pacing, suggesting a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is very positive, praising the storytelling and pacing. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence due to the limited information. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the show's pacing and storytelling quality, suggesting an engaging, well-crafted production. However, as a single curated quote, it may not represent the full complexity of the critic's overall assessment.",
