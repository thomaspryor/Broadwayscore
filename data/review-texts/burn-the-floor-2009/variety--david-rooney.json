But if you’re going to invade the turf of Bob Fosse, Jerome Robbins and Michael Bennett, you need to bring something beyond adrenaline and aggressive sizzle. Something like grace, style or wit. While there’s only about 15 ounces of collective body fat onstage, there’s also about 15 ounces of imagination.\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Timothée Chalamet's 'Marty Supreme' to Get China Theatrical Release \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Box Office: ‘28 Years Later: The Bone Temple' Scares 'Avatar: Fire and Ash' Off Top Spot Friday With $5.6 Million\n\nThe show’s most ostentatious bid to ride the TV wave is its recruitment of “Dancing With the Stars” judge Carrie Ann Inaba as a producer, and of Karina Smirnoff and Maksim Chmerkovskiy, two of that show’s regular professional dancers, as special guests for the first three weeks of the 12-week New York engagement. The fact that America is on first-name terms with Karina and Maks, a couple onscreen and off, is some indication of the feverish following dance competitions have generated.\n\nBut the duo is both an asset and a burden to “Burn the Floor.” They are dazzling to watch, but superior on so many levels to the other robotic performers onstage that you wait impatiently for them to resurface in another routine. Their moves are more defined; they have star quality, a sense of humor and genuine chemistry.\n\nNot that the other nine couples, plucked from the international championship ranks of ballroom dance, aren’t impressive. They sweat up a storm, gyrate and vibrate at warp speed throughout the juiced-up production. But even when they’re gliding across the floor in a Fred-and-Ginger homage, the dancing is effortful — more athletic than fluid or expressive. Passion often comes across as hostility, suggesting the kind of crazed determination you’re more likely to find in a wrestling match than on a dance floor.\n\nSerenity and poise barely get a look in before sexually charged attitude, whip-pan head moves, hair-tossing and booty-popping take over again with numbing repetitiveness. It’s as if the cast is auditioning for “Showgirls: The Musical.” (If only.) Dancing on air this is not.\n\nDirected and choreographed by former “Burn” ensemble member Jason Gilkison, the show whirls through the 10 standard disciplines of ballroom, initially in a dance-through-the-ages sequence that segues from “Let’s Face the Music and Dance” into Shirley Bassey/Propellerheads number “History Repeating.” But those 10 basics — waltz, foxtrot, Viennese waltz, tango, quickstep, cha cha, samba, paso doble, rumba and jive — all tend to blur into one when performed with the same hyper-accelerated flamenco intensity. There’s so much random cross-pollination among styles, and so many garish theatricalized flourishes, that technique and subtlety disappear along with modulation.\n\nAmong the more unfortunate routines is a number featuring a single blindfolded female dancer being tossed around by a group of shirtless guys, a cheesy sex fantasy that plays like camp without irony. Many of the visual correlations are beyond elementary: The paso doble as a bullfight?\n\nGenerally, the show is more convincing in exuberant than sultry or dramatic mode. The jive, lindy and swing sequence near the close of act one stirs some excitement and gives the dancers some freedom to express a personality (American Giselle Peacock is a firecracker), as does the infectious cha cha of the finale, “Turn the Beat Around.” There’s also a frenzied “Proud Mary” that owes much to Tina Turner’s shimmy, right down to the fringed mini-dresses.\n\nHowever, the songs of female vocalist Rebecca Tapia tend to opt for the same overkill as the dances, with everything from “I Just Want to Make Love to You” to “Nights in White Satin” given similar big, growly treatment. Tapia’s male counterpart, Ricky Rojas, is a touch more restrained. The show employs two percussionists, a horn player and fiddler/guitarist onstage, augmenting canned music played at maximum volume.\n\nEven louder are Janet Hine’s costumes. Based on John Van Gastel’s designs for the show’s earlier incarnations, they favor a lurid, Donatella Versace/Eurotrash aesthetic, with lots of sheer fabrics, skintight trousers and slutty backless prom dresses.\n\nThe production manages to be slick and tacky at the same time — it’s a vulgarized dance marathon as ’80s Vegas variety show, lacking only a topless girl in body glitter emerging from a volcano. Still, much of the press-night crowd seemed to eat up every skyward leg extension and death-defying dip. Nobody even appeared to mind the shower of sweat when the dancers hit the aisles. Maybe TV dance fans will flock. Others might require more finesse and less flash in their bend-and-snap.",

  "wrongFullText": "Pic showcases the acting chops and engaging screen presence of Ksenia Rappoport.\n\nA foreign-born chambermaid working in a plush Turinese hotel finds love but then seems to lose her way in “The Double Hour,” the effective debut feature of Italo musicvid helmer Giuseppe Capotondi. Pic further showcases the acting chops and engaging screen presence of Ksenia Rappoport (“The Unknown Woman”) as her character undergoes various shocks and transformations. Not so much a genre movie as a movie that switches between genres — and comes out on top — this film will be tough to market but should find a home at passionate distribs and fests. It goes out locally Oct. 9.\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n YouTube Revenue for Full-Year 2025 Topped $60 Billion, Making Video Platform Bigger Than Netflix \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Apple Revenue Pops 16% to Nearly $144 Billion in Year-End 2025 Quarter on iPhone 17 Sales Blitz, Services Biz Hits $30 Billion\n\nA far cry from his work as a pro shutterbug for glossy mags such as Vanity Fair and Marie Claire, and his musicvideos for Keane, the Spice Girls and others, Capotondi’s first film has a measured pace, a deceptively simple and unglamorous look, and an admirably complex (though never complicated) narrative.\n\nThe title refers to any time when the hour and minute indications consist of the same numbers (i.e., 10:10). According to serial speed-dater Guido (Filippo Timi, Mussolini in “Vincere“), each time one catches a clock showing the double hour, you can make a wish. Or at least, that’s what he tells his latest conquest, Italo-Slovenian chambermaid Sonia (Rappoport).\n\nSonia is new to the northern industrial town of Turin and the speed-dating scene, and has just started working at a local hotel. Against all odds, the two hit it off straight away and a romance quickly develops. But about 20 minutes in, the lovebirds find themselves held at gunpoint during a burglary, and shots are fired.\n\nRemaining 75 minutes detail the bumpy road to Sonia’s (and the audience’s) understanding of what really happened, with Capotondi and the screenwriters going through different genres — horror, mystery, psychodrama — and their required elements in rapid succession. Though info is only gradually parceled out and backtracking is necessary several times, editor Guido Notari and the screenwriters keep things impressively lean and uncluttered. Only in a few instances do the jumps and twists attract so much attention to themselves that they impede the natural flow of the story.\n\nNarrative glue is provided by Capotondi’s mastery of tone and Rappoport’s magnetic perf. Her sheer screen presence and ambiguous take on Sonia will, much like in her star-making turn in “The Unknown Woman,” have auds sticking with her no matter what. Timi, in a smaller role, oozes macho sexuality; Antonia Truppo adds some lightness as a saucy colleague of Sonia’s.\n\nShot in widescreen by d.p. Tat Radcliffe, the film has a deliberate, slightly rough look that imparts an air of apparent normality that works well. Production designer Totoi Santoro’s work on Sonia’s barely furnished working-class digs speaks volumes about her life. Sound work is also strong, and other tech credits are fine.\n\nPic hides quite a few pleasures that might only become apparent on multiple viewings. In a nod to the title, the screenplay’s biggest twist is revealed exactly one hour and one minute into the film.",
