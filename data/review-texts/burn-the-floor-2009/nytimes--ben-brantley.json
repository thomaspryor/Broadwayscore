    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The fire hose metaphor clearly criticizes the show's lack of subtlety and overwhelming force as negative qualities, indicating the critic does not recommend it. | GPT-4o: The review uses a metaphor that suggests the show is overwhelming and lacks subtlety, implying a negative experience. However, the review is brief, so the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review uses a simile to negatively describe the show's lack of subtlety, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The single sentence uses harsh imagery ('fire hose,' 'force') to criticize the show's lack of subtlety. While brief, the tone is clearly dismissive and negative, suggesting the production is overwhelming rather than artful. The truncated nature limits confidence, but the available text indicates a negative verdict.",
