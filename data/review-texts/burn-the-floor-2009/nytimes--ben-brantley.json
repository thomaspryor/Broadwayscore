  "fullText": "The good news about “Burn the Floor,” a ballroom dancing extravaganza that opened Sunday at the Longacre Theater, is that it is every bit as flashy and tacky as you would expect.\n\nDo I need to add that this is also the bad news?\n\nTiming may not be everything in dance, but it is certainly crucial. The arrival on Broadway of this two-hour exhibition of swiveling hips and steamy embraces, directed and choreographed by Jason Gilkison, an Australian former dancing champ, is undoubtedly propitious. “Burn the Floor” has been tangoing around the globe for a decade. It made its debut in 1999 in Bournemouth, England, before touring to more than 20 countries.\n\nHere in the United States the huge popularity of ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars,” in which celebrities skidding toward oblivion attempt to halt the process by hooking up with professional dancers in a prime-time competition, has recently given new gloss to a sport  for it is really more sport than art  once relegated to more obscure regions of the television airwaves.\n\nThat show’s success has spawned several similar pop dance competitions, including another big hit, “So You Think You Can Dance,” on which Mr. Gilkison has worked as a guest choreographer. And you would have to be living pretty far off the grid to be unaware of the sensation caused by the YouTube video of that wedding party boogieing down the aisle.\n\nIn short, our woe-ridden world suddenly seems to be dance crazed. So much so that I wouldn’t be surprised to hear Russian ice skaters have taken to the streets to protest the sudden global shortage of leopard-print Lycra blends. More soberly I should report that “Burn the Floor” will not disappoint the stalwart fans of “dancesport,” as competitive ballroom dancing is sometimes known, according to a program note. Headlined for now by the sexy Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Karina Smirnoff, regulars on “Dancing With the Stars,” the show features nine more dance couples (as well as a pair of vocalists) in a nonstop display of pop variations on classic ballroom-dancing styles, from relatively sedate waltzes to the lindy, the rumba and the sangria-scented paso doble.\n\nWhile it has been spruced up for its arrival in New York with new sets and costumes, the production still looks more ripe for Bournemouth than for Broadway. The set consists of little more than a bandstand with steps, some flimsy-looking backdrops and a disco ball. (Maybe in Bournemouth the disco ball was smaller?) The costumes, clingy sequin-spattered and fringe-trimmed dresses for the women and tight black slacks (and the occasional shirt) for the men, sometimes look cheap. Two percussionists and two other musicians perform live, but much of the music is recorded.\n\nA little tacky too is the brevity of Mr. Chmerkovskiy and Ms. Smirnoff’s tenure with the show. They will appear only through Aug. 16 before they cha-cha off to other pursuits. That is a shame, because they provide “Burn the Floor” with a jolt of real charisma and heightened style in their duets. One flashy dance finishes with an electric flourish, as Ms. Smirnoff suddenly kicks up a heel and slings herself upside down over her partner’s arm. And Mr. Chmerkovskiy surfs the high-velocity, intricate choreography with a legato ease that makes it seem effortless.\n\nAmid the general frenzy, his smooth operating comes as a distinct relief. So do the slower-tempo waltzes performed with a debonair sweep by the Australian couple Damon and Rebecca Sugden, although their peculiar facial expressions  his waxen affect and her open-mouthed rapture  can be a little distracting.\n\nWhich is not to suggest that all the dancers, who together have collected more than 100 titles on the competition circuit, are anything less than skilled technicians. Hailing from various countries  among them New Zealand, Britain, Italy, Slovenia and Malaysia  they perform with the precision and polish this athletic dancing all but demands. Tight footwork, tight abs and tight smiles are all on resplendent display, although much of the ersatz eroticism requires not smiles but look-ma-I’m-smoldering glares at the audience.\n\nSome of Mr. Gilkison’s attempts to vary the mood are a little dubious. A steamy rumba in the first act, in which the statuesque blonde Peta Murgatroyd cavorts blindfolded with six oily-chested men, seems like a scene from a gay porn movie, only with better music  well, slightly better music  and dry ice (and a woman). Much better is the lively Act I finale, set in a 1940s nightclub, featuring period costumes and bursts of big band brass. It’s an enjoyable romp through World War II styles, and it allows some of the dancers to display a little individuality, the impish Sasha Farber in particular.\n\nBut competitive ballroom dancing is more about regimentation than personal expression, both in terms of steps and performance. As a result it can come to feel monotonous and mechanical, at least to this viewer. The accent on high-octane tempos and audience-dazzling athleticism ultimately left me feeling more dazed than elated.\n\nAs the performers stormed the aisles during the finale, spinning and tumbling and twisting their hips ferociously, inches from us aisle-sitters, I felt relieved to have escaped without a sequin in the eye, or a French-tipped fake nail embedded in the forehead. Presumably this sense of stunned relief is what more adventurous people experience after surviving the running of the bulls in Pamplona. I think I will check that off the to-do-before-dying list.\n\nDirected and choreographed by Jason Gilkison; creative consultant, Raj Kapoor; scenic design by Ray Klausen; lighting by Rick Belzer; costumes by Janet Hine, based on the original design by John Van Gastel; sound by Peter J.
