    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges flaws (tiresome explanations, overused mist effects) but concludes positively that 'the dance speaks eloquently for itself.' Single excerpt warning applies - treating as qualified positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt acknowledges the eloquence of the dance but also criticizes the need for explanations and overuse of effects. The single excerpt provides a mixed impression, with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a mixed opinion, acknowledging both tiresome aspects and eloquent dance. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to a \"mixed\" classification with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows qualified praise—critic finds mist effects tiresome but praises the dance as speaking 'eloquently for itself,' indicating a mild recommendation based on performance quality. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
