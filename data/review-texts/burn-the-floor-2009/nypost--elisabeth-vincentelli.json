    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic describes the show neutrally as 'breathless, plotless succession of routines' and explicitly states it depends on audience taste rather than making a clear recommendation. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that enjoyment of the show depends heavily on personal preference for ballroom dancing, indicating a neutral stance. The lack of plot and the description as 'breathless' could be seen as either positive or negative, leading to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The review states that the show is a succession of routines and that it depends on the viewer's love for this type of dancing, indicating a mixed or neutral stance. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as 'plotless' and explicitly qualifies its appeal based on the viewer's pre-existing interest in ballroom dancing, indicating a mixed verdict with niche rather than universal recommendation.",
