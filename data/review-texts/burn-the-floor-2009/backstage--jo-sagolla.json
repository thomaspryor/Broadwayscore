    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt describes an 'electrifying finale' that will 'surely inspire' action - strong positive language. However, with only one excerpt available, this could be cherry-picked from a mixed review, so confidence is low but the language suggests upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the finale as 'electrifying' and implies a strong positive impact on the audience. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review mentions an \"electrifying finale,\" which suggests a positive experience. However, the reference to the dance studio coupon implies a slightly less enthusiastic recommendation, so I've scored it as positive with reservations and low confidence due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: The critic uses the strong positive descriptor 'electrifying' for the finale and suggests the performance inspires action, indicating a clear recommendation despite limited excerpt availability.",
