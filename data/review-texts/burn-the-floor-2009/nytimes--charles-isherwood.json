    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt presents a backhanded compliment where 'flashy and tacky' is both good and bad news. This suggests a mixed response - acknowledging entertainment value while criticizing quality. Low confidence due to limited excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed sentiment, noting both 'good news' and 'bad news' about the show's flashy and tacky nature. Without a clear recommendation or discouragement, it falls into the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt presents a mixed view, acknowledging the show's expected qualities but questioning their overall value. The 'good news...bad news' structure suggests a lack of strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as 'flashy and tacky,' employing ironic wit to suggest that the production's defining spectacle is simultaneously its only attribute and its fundamental flaw, indicating a negative verdict.",
