The arrival on Broadway of this two-hour exhibition of swiveling hips and steamy embraces, directed and choreographed by Jason Gilkison, an Australian former dancing champ, is undoubtedly propitious. “Burn the Floor” has been tangoing around the globe for a decade. It made its debut in 1999 in Bournemouth, England, before touring to more than 20 countries.",

The critic doesn't explicitly recommend or discourage seeing it. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show delivers exactly what it promises—flashy, tacky ballroom dancing—but explicitly frames this quality as 'bad news,' suggesting a dismissive attitude toward the production's artistic value. However, given the truncated text, the final recommendation remains ambiguous.",
