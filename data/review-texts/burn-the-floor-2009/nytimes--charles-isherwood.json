The arrival on Broadway of this two-hour exhibition of swiveling hips and steamy embraces, directed and choreographed by Jason Gilkison, an Australian former dancing champ, is undoubtedly propitious. “Burn the Floor” has been tangoing around the globe for a decade. It made its debut in 1999 in Bournemouth, England, before touring to more than 20 countries.",
