  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The play is cleverly staged. The brick wall curtain serves as a screen between scenes showing how things have changed over the years in Greenwich Village from the 1960s to 1980s. Daniel speaking directly to the audience is very affecting. Allen & Hedges are excellent in their roles. May gives a powerhouse performance. Lonergan's brilliant play is a potent reminder to listen to each other...A masterpiece and May is a miraculous force of nature.”\n\nRead more",
