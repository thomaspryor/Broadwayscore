  "bwwExcerpt": "Lonergan designed this as a memory play and Lucas Hedges's restrained narration offers welcome distance. Joan Allen wrenchingly evokes Ellen's conflicting emotions. And who can't relate to David Cromer's Howard, with his clumsy but well-intentioned efforts to communicate. And Michael Cera is almost unrecognizable with his subtle turn as a sympathetic artist without a lot of talent.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Lonergan's shattering portrait of a woman's descent into senility is painful to watch, but its heartfelt honesty sets the stage for a very talented company to remind us to cherish the time we've got...Neugebauer's sensitive direction feels so natural, it's almost like eavesdropping. And while the entire cast is superlative, the show belongs almost entirely to May's beautifully measured performance...A play that delivers the hard truth about aging with eloquence and empathy.”\n\nRead more"
