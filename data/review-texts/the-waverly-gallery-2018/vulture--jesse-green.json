However, the lack of superlative language and the focus on a single performance suggest some reservations. | Gemini: The review highlights the play's power and Joan Allen's \"devastating\" performance, indicating a positive, though perhaps not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: Though brief, the excerpt offers strong praise for the production's emotional power and the lead's 'devastating' performance, indicating a clear recommendation.",
