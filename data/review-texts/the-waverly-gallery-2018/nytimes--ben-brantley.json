  "fullText": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/theater/review-waverly-gallery-elaine-may-kenneth-lonergan.htmlShare full article36Advertisement\n\nFrom the moment Gladys Green opens her mouth — which is the moment that the curtain rises on Kenneth Lonergan’s wonderful play “The Waverly Gallery” at the Golden Theater — it’s clear that for this garrulous woman, idle conversation isn’t a time killer. It is a lifeline.\n\nAn octogenarian New Yorker, former lawyer and perpetual hostess for whom schmoozing and kibitzing have always been as essential as breathing, Gladys operates on the principle that if she can just continue to talk, she can surely power through the thickening fog of her old age. That she has clearly already lost this battle makes her no less valiant.\n\nThat it’s Elaine May who is giving life to Gladys’s war against time lends an extra power and poignancy to “The Waverly Gallery,” which opened on Thursday night under Lila Neugebauer’s fine-tuned direction. Long fabled as a director, script doctor and dramatist, Ms. May first became famous as a master of improvisational comedy, instantly inventing fully detailed, piquantly neurotic characters who always leaned slightly off-kilter.\n\nHer partnership with Mike Nichols is still considered the gold standard for such quick-sketch portraiture. And their appearance on Broadway together in the early 1960s is recalled by those who saw it as if they had been divine visitations, blazing and all too brief.\n\nOne can imagine Gladys Green having attended “An Evening With Mike Nichols and Elaine May,” and saving the program. She might even have perceived a glimmer of her own vivacious self in that couple’s determined loquacity.\n\nIn any case, the Gladys we meet in “The Waverly Gallery” — the title comes from the small rented Greenwich Village space where she shows art of dubious distinction — is conducting what might be called extreme improvisation. She’s bluffing, fabricating, groping for a direction in what must often seem like a void.\n\nTrying to convince her family and herself that she’s still capable of navigating the flux of urban life, Gladys always fills in the verbal gaps that confront her, even with words that may not be the right ones. At 86, Ms. May — in her first Broadway appearance in more than 50 years — turns out to be just the star to nail the rhythms, the comedy and the pathos of a woman who’s talking as fast as she can to keep her place in an increasingly unfamiliar world.\n\nFirst staged Off Broadway in 2000, with a very fine Eileen Heckart as Gladys, “The Waverly Gallery” was inspired by the final years of Mr. Lonergan’s own grandmother. It is a memory play in both its structure and its subject.\n\nRendered through the retrospective gaze of Gladys’s grandson — Daniel (a first-rate Lucas Hedges), who lives down the hall from Gladys — it recalls Tennessee Williams’s guilt-drenched “The Glass Menagerie.” But Mr. Lonergan’s lens on the past is sharper and harsher.\n\nHe is trying to capture, with almost clinical precision, the patterns of speech of a willful woman sliding into senility. At the same time, he is assessing the impact of such disjointedness on the helpless members of her family, who without even being aware of it sometimes find themselves adopting Gladys’s fragmented worldview.\n\nIn other words, “The Waverly Gallery” is very much a group portrait, in which everyday life is distorted to the point of surrealism by the addled soul at its center. And Ms. Neugebauer has assembled a dream cast to embody the collective madness that seems to descend on those closest to Gladys.\n\nThey include Gladys’s daughter (and Daniel’s mother), Ellen (Joan Allen, who wrenchingly combines filial devotion and resentment); her psychoanalyst husband Howard (an impeccably tactless David Cromer); and Don (Michael Cera, doing confident but clueless), a young painter from Massachusetts who stumbles into Gladys’s gallery one day and winds up showing — and living — there.\n\nPart of the painful pleasure of “The Waverly Gallery” is listening to how these characters listen to Gladys, and how, in responding to her, they come to question the reliability of their own words. As a screenwriter (“You Can Count on Me,” “Manchester by the Sea”) and dramatist (“This Is Our Youth,” “Lobby Hero”), Mr. Lonergan has always portrayed human communication as an imperfect compromise.\n\n“The Waverly Gallery” is his most literal presentation of that inadequacy. Gladys crams all silences with increasingly disconnected bits of autobiography and with peppy questions and catchphrases that she has probably used for decades. (“Got any coffee lying around?”)\n\nShe’s so convinced that Daniel writes for a newspaper (he’s a speechwriter) that he no longer bothers to correct her. By the end, the identities of those around her blur with those of people long dead. But that doesn’t stop Gladys talking, even in her sleep.\n\nDaniel’s crystalline monologues of recollection aside, “The Waverly Gallery” often has the ostensible waywardness of recorded conversations. But no word is randomly chosen here, starting with Gladys’s opening line: “I never knew anything was the matter.”\n\nShe’s talking about the end of Helen’s first marriage, to Daniel’s father, but it comes to suggest a more willful oblivion. And when she whimsically describes the loneliness of Ellen’s dog, who just wants a little attention, you know exactly what Gladys really means.\n\nAlways stylishly dressed (Ann Roth did the costumes), Ms. May’s Gladys retains her coercive hostess’s charm. She ends most of her sentences with a practiced winning smile that now seems to be searching anxiously for affirmation.\n\nAll the cast members function beautifully as quotidian detectives, looking for the patterns in the pieces. In a shattering moment, a teary Daniel hugs his mother tight, and you know that he’s wondering if his relationship with Ellen might one day mirror that of Ellen’s with Gladys.\n\nAs near perfect as the performances are, the physical production occasionally lets them down. David Zinn’s urban set, with its vistas of the city beyond, weighs heavily on the playing area. And the intervals between scenes — which feature vintage street photography projections (by Tal Yarden) — feel ponderously long.\n\nSuch objections dissolve as soon as Gladys and her clan reassemble into groupings that convey both claustrophobic intimacy and tragic, unbridgeable distance.\n\nMr. Cera’s homey painter may be no Picasso. But in describing his domestic portraits and local landscapes, he sums up the essence of the play. “I tried to get the details right,” he says, “because that’s what you remember when you think about something, so I tried like hell to get them the way they are.”\n\nSo did Mr. Lonergan. That’s what makes “The Waverly Gallery” a work of such hard, compassionate clarity.",
