  "bwwExcerpt": "This nearly plotless drama probably had more of an impact two decades ago, before stories of Alzheimer's patients in movies like 'Iris,' 'Away from Her' or 'The Notebook' were more common. Lonergan's writing, with its rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue meant to evoke the chaos inside Gladys' mind, also demands a precision that director Lila Neugebauer (making her Broadway debut) isn't able to bring. The comedy played at the expense of Gladys' struggles is handled too broadly, particularly in the first act, and the show occasionally flirts with tastelessness.",
