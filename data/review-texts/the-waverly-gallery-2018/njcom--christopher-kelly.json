  "bwwExcerpt": "This nearly plotless drama probably had more of an impact two decades ago, before stories of Alzheimer's patients in movies like 'Iris,' 'Away from Her' or 'The Notebook' were more common. Lonergan's writing, with its rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue meant to evoke the chaos inside Gladys' mind, also demands a precision that director Lila Neugebauer (making her Broadway debut) isn't able to bring. The comedy played at the expense of Gladys' struggles is handled too broadly, particularly in the first act, and the show occasionally flirts with tastelessness.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“There's much to admire about ‘The Waverly Gallery’...May's portrayal of Gladys is persuasive and moving...But at times, it's a struggle to hear her; other times, her grasp of this complicated character feels uncertain. This may very well be the point...but still the performance comes off as not entirely controlled...This nearly plotless drama probably had more of an impact two decades ago...The actors are endearing and intermittently affecting, but never quite click as an ensemble.”\n\nRead more"
