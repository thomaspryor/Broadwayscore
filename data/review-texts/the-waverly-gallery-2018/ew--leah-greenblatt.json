  "bwwExcerpt": "The Waverly Gallery never quite builds to the emotional power of his most memorable screen work like You Can Count On Me and Manchester by the Sea; its stakes are lower, its humor quieter, and its tragedies less piercing. But it does have a movie-star cast - and a bona-fide living legend, in Elaine May - as well as a low-key, humor-laced melancholy whose impact accumulates as the play goes on.",
