  "bwwExcerpt": "Despite the interminable scene changes set against black-and-white video of the bygone New York of Gladys' younger days, director Lila Neugebauer's production boasts fine details of its own, including evocative sets and costumes true to the time, place and character. One small but essential detail comes when the four family members sit down for a meal. They face each other, not the audience, in what recalls a real group portrait. And that's what 'The Waverly Gallery' is all about.",
