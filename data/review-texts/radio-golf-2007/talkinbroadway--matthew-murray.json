    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the play as a 'fitting capstone' that 'stands confidently' - clearly positive language, but limited text prevents full assessment of recommendation strength. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation of the play as a 'fitting capstone' that stands 'confidently,' suggesting a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, calling the play a 'fitting capstone' and noting its confident stance. Due to the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise, calling the play a 'fitting capstone' that 'stands confidently,' indicating a clear recommendation. Per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, score placed in the 80-84 range.",
