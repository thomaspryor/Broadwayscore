    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the play as a 'fitting capstone' that 'stands confidently,' indicating clear approval. However, with only one curated quote available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review's verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive assessment of the play, describing it as a 'fitting capstone' and 'confident,' which suggests a solid recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language like \"fitting capstone\" and \"standing confidently,\" suggesting a positive assessment. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing the score at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise describing the play as a 'fitting capstone' that stands 'confidently,' indicating a solid recommendation. However, confidence is reduced due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
