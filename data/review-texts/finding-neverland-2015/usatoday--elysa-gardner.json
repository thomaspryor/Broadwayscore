  "bwwExcerpt": "Here, unfortunately, Paulus is saddled with a lackluster score -- by pop veterans Gary Barlow and Eliot Kennedy, who provide mostly syrupy ballads and vaguely peppy production numbers. The book, by rising playwright James Graham, is better -- hokey at points, but offering enough playful wit and compassion to make this story about the creation of Peter Pan fly...Glee alum Matthew Morrison...is predictably likable, and credible, as a man who rediscovers the boy inside himself...Gemme convincingly shows us how Peter's skepticism toward Barrie turns into affection and trust. His moments with Morrison are some of the truest and most poignant in the show...Special effects are on hand, as you might expect, to make these sequences more vivid...In the end, though, this Neverland is most charming in subdued moments, when the emphasis is on human connection and, eventually, loss.",
