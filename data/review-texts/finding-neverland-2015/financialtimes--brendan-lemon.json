  "bwwExcerpt": "The Broadway Finding Neverland is swift-moving, playful, and appealing to children. This production is more extravagant than its American premiere last summer in Cambridge...This is not to say that Finding Neverland, to switch metaphors of movement, remains consistently airborne. The music and lyrics, by Gary Barlow...are redolent of pop-chart uplift and fail to contribute to character development. No matter how many emotionally effective touches the actors and their director, Diane Paulus, provide, the evening keeps returning to those mostly forgettable tunes. The lapses are especially apparent because this is, at heart, a show about artistic inspiration...the show's simplest moments, from Peter Pan itself, prove more entrancing than the giant, high-flying whirligig that's been built around them.",
