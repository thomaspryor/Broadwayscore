  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Diane Paulus coaxes compelling character portrayals. But the work fails to live up to the story's promise. Sure, there are lovely sprinklings of golden fairy dust and actors who take flight. But the music and lyrics by Gary Barlow and Eliot Kennedy...too often lean towards syrupy ballads riddled with clichés...Morrison's Scottish accent sometimes flags and his presence in romantic scenes can seem a little under-energized. Still, there's more depth to his singing voice than one might expect from his TV role, and he has a fine rapport with the children...Gemme, as the serious-minded Peter who needs to find his childlike sense of play again, is especially moving and sings with strength and purity.",
