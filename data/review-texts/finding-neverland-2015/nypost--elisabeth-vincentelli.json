  "bwwExcerpt": "Surprisingly, there's no riff on singing at regionals, even though this new musical also stars Matthew Morrison, a?k?a Mr. Will Schuester of 'Glee.' That's pretty much the only sign of restraint in this overstuffed production...Holding it all together is Morrison. Sporting a beard and Scottish burr, he's tireless, if not especially charismatic, as J.M. Barrie...Barlow and Kennedy dutifully deliver the obligatory power ballads...but their heart is in the faster, livelier ensemble songs...Too bad Michaels' choreography has all the zest of vintage MTV. What's most striking is how a show about the power of whimsy and imagination is so lacking in both. Paulus and Company don't trust intimacy and charm, so everything is overplayed -- despite the advice to an actor rehearsing Barrie's 'Peter Pan' to go 'smaller.' Peter Pan taught others to free themselves and fly. For most of its running time, 'Finding Neverland' remains stuck to the ground.",
