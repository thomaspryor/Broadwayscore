Mixed reception with slight negative lean. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that while the show tries hard to entertain, it ultimately lacks substance, leading to a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"empty calories\" to describe the show, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show's entertaining intentions but dismisses the result as insubstantial 'empty calories,' indicating it fails to provide meaningful theatrical value and is not recommended.",
