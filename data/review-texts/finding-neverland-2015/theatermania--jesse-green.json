Mixed reception with slight negative lean. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that while the show tries hard to entertain, it ultimately lacks substance, leading to a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"empty calories\" to describe the show, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show's entertaining intentions but dismisses the result as insubstantial 'empty calories,' indicating it fails to provide meaningful theatrical value and is not recommended.",

  "wrongFullText": "More than a year after opening, the Tony-winning show is in the black.\n\nTony-winning musical A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder has officially recouped its $7.5 million capitalization. The production, which opened on November 17, 2013, also holds the house records at the Walter Kerr Theatre for both the highest single-week gross ($1,062,740.60 over eight performances on the week ending December 28, 2014) and total cumulative gross, which now stands at $51,557,644.05.\n\nA Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder tells the story of Monty Navarro, who has received the news that he is descended from a noble family and could become the next Earl of Highhurst. There are only eight issues standing in his way: the other heirs (all played by a single actor) who precede him in line for the title. What does Monty choose to do? Eliminate them, of course. It features a book and lyrics by Robert L. Freedman, and music and lyrics by Steven Lutvak. Darko Tresnjak directs, with choreography by Peggy Hickey.\n\nA Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder stars Tony winner Jefferson Mays, Jeff Kready, Scarlett Strallen, Catherine Walker, and Carole Shelley, with Sandra DeNise, Joanna Glushak, Kristen Hahn, Greg Jackson, Eddie Korbich, Mark Ledbetter, Kevin Massey, Michael McCorry Rose, Jennifer Smith, Kathy Voytko, and Price Waldman.\n\nFor tickets and more information, click here.\n\nReview: Jason Alexander Leaves a Little Gristle in New Production of Sweeney Todd \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: Manon!, Opera’s Have-It-All Girl \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: In The Porch on Windy Hill, Bluegrass Heals a Broken Family \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: Power Slips Away, One Lear at a Time, in King Lear at La MaMa \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: Blackout Songs, When Your Life Is One Long Night Out \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: Stories of Childhood Told Through Dance in BLACK GIRL: Linguistic Play \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Theater News & discounts\n \n Get the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania's newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre."
