  "bwwExcerpt": "Diane Paulus, the show's current director, has kept this musical tale about J. M. Barrie's creation of 'Peter Pan' magnificently low tech...As Barrie's American producer Charles Frohman (and his Captain Hook), Kelsey Grammer far surpasses his stage work in 'La Cage aux Folles.' No one knows how to massage a laugh line better than Grammer, and rightly so, Morrison lets his co-star provide most of the night's humor. The 'Glee' star, on the other hand, keeps it very low-key, giving real heart and enormous grace to Barrie...While Paulus has kept 'Finding Neverland' relatively small, there's still some pandering to modern taste for the overblown, if not the entirely inappropriate...The rousing ensemble numbers by Gary Barlow and Eliot Kennedy could be lifted from a 1950's musical...Overall, however, Weinstein's gamble has paid off. This production may not be total perfection, but it works real magic with its child's play.",
