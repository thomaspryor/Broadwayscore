  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Paulus keeps throwing in magic tricks and storybook set changes, but no amount of illusionism can make the songs any better or the script and style seem any more definite. 'Don't lose faith,' Sylvia comforts Barrie. 'You'll get there.' Finding Neverland tries to find the way - second star to the right and straight on till morning - but it never quite arrives.",
