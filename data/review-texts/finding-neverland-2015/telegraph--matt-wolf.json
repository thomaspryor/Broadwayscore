  "bwwExcerpt": "One can't fault the know-how of director Diane Paulus, a proven hit-maker with revivals (Hair, Pippin), here marking her first original Broadway musical. The tale is of how an unhappily married Barrie (a bearded, convincingly Scottish-accented Morrison) came upon the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Hampshire's Laura Michelle Kelly, in shimmering voice) and her four young sons. It gives audiences the back story of sorts to Peter Pan in much the same way as the musical Wicked functions as a prequel to The Wizard of Oz.",
