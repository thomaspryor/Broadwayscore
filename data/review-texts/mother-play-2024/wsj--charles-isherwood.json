  "dtliExcerpt": "But while the final scene—Phyllis, in a nursing home, repeatedly wails, “I want to go home,” and fails to recognize Martha as her daughter—has a piercing sadness as Ms. Lange’s performance reaches a rending climax, too much of “Mother Play” feels evanescent, more a personal exercise in exorcising ghosts than a play that resonates on deeper levels.",

This indicates a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review highlights a powerful final scene but ultimately suggests the play doesn't resonate deeply, indicating a mixed assessment. The 'Flat' aggregator verdict reinforces this classification.",
