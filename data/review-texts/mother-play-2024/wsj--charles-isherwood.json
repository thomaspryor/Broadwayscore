  "dtliExcerpt": "But while the final scene—Phyllis, in a nursing home, repeatedly wails, “I want to go home,” and fails to recognize Martha as her daughter—has a piercing sadness as Ms. Lange’s performance reaches a rending climax, too much of “Mother Play” feels evanescent, more a personal exercise in exorcising ghosts than a play that resonates on deeper levels.",

The final scene is noted for its emotional impact, but the play overall is seen as lacking depth. | Gemini: The review describes the play as \"funny and affecting\" which indicates a positive experience, but the terms \"slight and fragmentary\" suggest reservations, placing it in the lower end of the positive bucket.",
