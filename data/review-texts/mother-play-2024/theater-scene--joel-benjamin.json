    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Negative | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a lack of depth in the play, indicating a mixed review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the play as schematic and barely fleshed out, indicating a negative assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the play as schematic and underdeveloped, comparing it to an unfleshed outline. This indicates the critic does not recommend the show due to structural weaknesses, though the single-excerpt limitation requires low confidence.",
