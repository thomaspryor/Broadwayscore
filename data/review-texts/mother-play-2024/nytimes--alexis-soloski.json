  "fullText": "In the first scene of “Mother Play: A Play in Five Evictions,” Paula Vogel’s antic, mournful new drama, Martha, a character modeled on the playwright, offers a version of Ecclesiastes.\n\n“There is a season for packing,” Martha (Celia Keenan-Bolger) says as she slits open a cardboard box. “And a season for unpacking.”\n\nVogel, 72, has spent the majority of her career unpacking. Her work is not strictly autobiographical, but as in the plays of Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee or Adrienne Kennedy, she has a canny way of rearranging the emotional furniture of her lived experience into tragicomedy.\n\nHere, at Broadway’s Helen Hayes Theater, that furniture includes a mother, Phyllis (Jessica Lange), and a brother, Carl (Jim Parsons), named for Vogel’s own family. The story begins in 1964 with the family moving into a basement apartment in a Washington, D.C., suburb; Carl is 14, Martha 12. Phyllis is in her mid 30s, barely treading water after a foundered marriage. At times, when she can pry her hands from a gin bottle, she clings to her children as if they are life rafts. Otherwise, she regards them as jetsam. Phyllis, we learn, never wanted to be a mother.\n\nOn finding herself pregnant: “I thought: Other women aren’t mother material, but they get through it. Just hang on, Phyllis, hang on. But it is never over. It’s a life sentence.” How’s that for a bedtime story?\n\nAs a single working mother, Phyllis can afford only custodial apartments, and those early evictions come when she complains too loudly about the roaches and maggots. The vermin are brought to life, extravagantly, in Shawn Duan’s projections. And David Zinn’s flexible set nimbly conveys each new abode. The later, more fraught expulsions come when Phyllis rejects first Carl, who comes out as gay in college, and then later Martha, who is also queer.\n\nAlexis Soloski has written for The Times since 2006. As a culture reporter, she covers television, theater, movies, podcasts and new media.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Thirty or so years ago, Vogel told a reporter, “I like theater that makes me feel like it’s a healing.” That’s what “Mother Play” is, a balm that comes in cardboard boxes and packing tape. It honors the dead by making them alive again and nurtures the living by providing a place to put a daughter’s love and rage. Martha’s box is not Pandora’s. It’s just another way of organizing a life.",

However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review's verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'balm' and highlights its emotional impact, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the word \"healing\" and describes the play as a \"balm,\" suggesting a positive and comforting experience. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring on the higher end of positive. | Kimi: The excerpt uses warmly appreciative language ('balm,' 'healing,' 'honors,' 'nurtures') to describe the show as an emotionally resonant and nurturing experience, indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited context of a single curated quote.",
