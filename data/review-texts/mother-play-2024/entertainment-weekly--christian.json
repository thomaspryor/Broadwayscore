  "dtliExcerpt": "First of all, it feels like we could’ve taken another crack at this title. A play about a mother and her relationship to her children, and it’s just called Mother Play? There’s minimalism, and then there’s calling Moby-Dick “Whale Book.” This complaint isn’t incidental, but indicative of how the new work by esteemed playwright Paula Vogel excels in some aspects, but feels incomplete in other regards.",
