    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performance using vivid, appreciative language ('tears into', 'genteel ferocity'). However, this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's verdict, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a strong performance by Jessica Lange, suggesting a positive view of her role. However, with only a single excerpt available, the overall tone of the review is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The single excerpt focuses on a strong performance by Jessica Lange, suggesting a positive, if limited, assessment. Given the single excerpt, I am placing the score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Jessica Lange's lead performance using words like 'tears into' and 'genteel ferocity,' suggesting a strong positive recommendation, though limited context prevents definitive assessment of the full production.",
