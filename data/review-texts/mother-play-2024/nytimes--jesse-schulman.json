    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single curated excerpt with clear praise ('deeply personal and universally resonant', 'commanding performance') suggests positive reception. Low confidence due to limited text and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as 'deeply personal and universally resonant' and highlights Jessica Lange's 'commanding performance.' However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, and the score is set at the lower end of the positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the play's resonance and Jessica Lange's performance, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the play's emotional impact and lead performance ('deeply personal', 'universally resonant', 'commanding'), warranting an upper Positive score. Single-excerpt limitation reduces confidence.",
