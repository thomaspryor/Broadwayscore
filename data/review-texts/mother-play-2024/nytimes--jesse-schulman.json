    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with positive descriptors ('deeply personal and universally resonant', 'commanding performance') suggests recommendation, but limited text prevents assessment of full verdict. Single excerpt warning applies - cautious scoring in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as 'deeply personal and universally resonant' and highlights Jessica Lange's 'commanding performance', suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt highlights the play's resonance and Lange's performance, suggesting a positive experience, but the lack of a definitive recommendation and the single excerpt warrants a score on the lower end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the play's emotional resonance and uses the superlative 'commanding' for Lange's performance, indicating a clear recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, it may not capture the full nuance of the review.",
