  "dtliExcerpt": "With “Mother Play,” playwright Paula Vogel has created a deeply personal play about life with her late mother, Phyllis Rita. She surely would have been delighted to be portrayed by no less than Jessica Lange, an actress fully capable of turning her into a boozy but sympathetic hybrid of Mama Rose in “Gypsy,” Joan Crawford in “Mommie Dearest” and Tennessee Williams’ Amanda Wingfield.",
