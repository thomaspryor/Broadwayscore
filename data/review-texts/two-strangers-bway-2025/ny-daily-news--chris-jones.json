Tutty’s appealing looks, pure voice, comic instincts, and obvious acting skills, and somehow resemblance to a living Teletubby make him the huge plus for a vital Two Strangers (Carry a Cake Across New York) run.",

  "dtliExcerpt": "So while this show held me for Act One with its considerable charm, by Act Two, it was hitting turbulence. 90 minutes and out would have been a better plan. On the plus side, “Two Strangers” does have quite a witty book and a few sticky tunes. Dougal will be a dreamboat, I suspect, for some teen theatergoers, and there is an amusing set from Soutra Gilmour that imagines New York entirely through carry-on luggage, spinning on a turntable that resembles baggage claim. It’s cool.",
