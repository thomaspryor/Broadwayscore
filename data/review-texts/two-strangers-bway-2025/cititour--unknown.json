(Again, it ain't \"Chess.\") Most of all, I can think of no two people better equipped to carry this delightful musical than Sam Tutty and Christiani Pitts. Let's hope they don't stay strangers to the Broadway stage.",

However, this is only a single excerpt so I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review praises the performances of the leads and describes the musical as 'delightful,' indicating a positive recommendation. However, the mention of simplicity suggests some reservations, leading to a mid-range positive score. | Gemini: The review praises the leads and calls the musical \"delightful,\" but also notes it's simple and not particularly deep. This suggests a positive but not rave recommendation.",
