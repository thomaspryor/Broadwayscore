Two Strangers Carry a Cake Across New York, which opened Thursday at Broadway's Longacre Theatre, is a modern musical romance that has the feel of an old-fashioned movie but also the look and sound of a story that could only take place in 2025.",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses positive language like \"enchanting new musical classic\" and describes the show as a \"modern musical romance.\" Given the single excerpt warning, a score in the middle of the positive range is appropriate.",
