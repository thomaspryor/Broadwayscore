  "bwwExcerpt": "nvincing, and it’s more effective in its comic than emotional beats. But no matter. This is a show so charming, so adorable, that you can easily overlook its flaws. A little bit like falling in love. David Finkle, New York Stage Review: Then there’s the acting, singing and brief dancing.

Tutty’s appealing looks, pure voice, comic instincts, and obvious acting skills, and somehow resemblance to a living Teletubb",
