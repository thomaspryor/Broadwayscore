  "fullText": "“Two Strangers” is one of those rom-coms where the two lovers are wrong for each other. He’s too boyish, she’s too brittle. It’s a new soul/old soul dynamic. That frisson works initially because, in a story too complicated to tell here, he sets her up with another guy on a dating app. Maybe Dougal and Robin will just become very good friends. Unfortunately, no.",
