  "bwwExcerpt": "for dinner in midtown Manhattan? To see a Broadway show? New York is just money, that’s all it is.” Consider, instead, seeking out one of the best cake slices in New York City and calling it a night. Brian Scott Lipton, Cititour: Admittedly, though, there isn’t a lot to unpack here (it ain’t “Chess”), but the show thankfully feels both simple and honest. (Again, it ain’t “Chess.”) Most of all, I can think of no two people better equipped to carry this delightful musical than Sam Tutty and Christiani Pitts. Let’s hope they don’t stay strangers to the Broadway stage. Thom Geier, Culture Sauce: Every now and then, an enchanting new musical classic comes along out of nowhere. Two Strangers Carry a Cake Across New York, which opened Thursday at Broadway’s Longacre Theatre, is a modern musical romance that has the feel of an old-fashioned movie but also the look and sound of a story that could only take place in 2025.
