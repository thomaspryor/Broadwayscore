  "fullText": "The recently opened new Broadway musical “Two Strangers Carry A Cake Across New York” leans towards the formula of a savvy rom com that is unassuming and charming, thanks to Christiani Pitts and Sam Tutty, who star in this two-hander. They are challenged by the superficial and at times rambling script penned by Jim Barne and Kit Buchan, who are also credited for the music and lyrics. Other two-handed Broadway musicals such as “The Last Five Years” and “I Do. I Do” unfold over years or even decades, but in this case the time allotted to develop a character and relationship is confined to forty-eight hours. It is a difficult task and becomes more problematic when scenes and songs exist without furthering the already slim plot or providing any insight into the characters’ development. Most of the material provided is there to purely entertain the audience and, in this respect, it succeeds. The show revolves around the naïve Dougal, who has just arrived from the UK to attend his father’s wedding. He works in a movie theater and most of his knowledge of New York comes from watching movies, so he is a prime candidate for an annoying but enthusiastic tourist. He is met at the airport by Robin, a cynical Brooklynite, who happens to be the bride’s sister. They are the same age, which suggests the bride—Robin’s sister—is also young, making this a May-December marriage for Dougal’s father. This would also make Robin Dougal’s aunt after the nuptials. The first meeting is more of a battle, but some progress is made when Dougal shows up the next day at the coffee shop where Robin is a barista, and she agrees to let him accompany her to Brooklyn to pick up the wedding cake. Rather than carrying it across town, they take an Uber. Spending the day together leads to spending the night together but not in the romantic sense. Secrets are revealed, they bond, and Dougal flies back home to the UK. That’s the basic plot that is infused with a lot of unnecessary banter filled with comic gestures and situations. There would be no reason to reveal the twists and turns that attempt to flesh out the characters or the plot. Ms. Pitts shines in her interpretation of Robin, peeling off the layers of her character to reveal herself. She changes from hard and cynical to mellow and insightful, but in the process understands the transformation. She provides a pure tonal quality and emotional content to her vocals, helping to define the character. Mr. Tutty is a brilliant comedian, exudes warmth and charm, and produces strong vocals. Their chemistry is able to avoid a romantic venture, while discovering themselves and each other. The scenic design by Soutra Gilmour consists of two mini skyscrapers of baggage, perhaps referring to the amount of baggage that each character is carrying from their past. At times different pieces of luggage are opened to reveal something new to accompany each scene, just as the characters reveal their deep secrets. Lighting design by Jack Knowles is precise as it reflects the mood and emotion of each sequence and location. Director Tim Jackson moves the action along at a quick pace with the use of a turntable stage but is sometimes burdened by some superfluous content. The greatest assets of this musical are the performances, the entertainment value, and light tone. If you are looking for great structure and exhilarating drama, look elsewhere. If you need an easy, sweet and somewhat uncomplicated musical comedy, get to the box office now and prepare yourself for an evening of great entertainment. It is difficult to imagine that anyone would not know the story of “King Kong” since the first film release was in 1933 and many new versions being released with the most recent in 2017, as well as being broadcast on television for the first time in 1956. In 1998,… Broadway Bound Theatre Festival is proud to announce its 2025 Season, showcasing the brand-new works of playwrights from across the country at AMT Theater on 45th Street. “We’re so excited to announce this season with some very strong staged work,” said Lenore Skomal, Festival Director. “We commit to our participants… Manhattan Theatre Club’s New York premiere of The Cake, written by Bekah Brunstetter (“This Is Us,” “American Gods,” The Oregon Trail) and directed by MTC’s award-winning Artistic Director Lynne Meadow (The Assembled Parties, The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife, The Commons of Pensacola), opens tomorrow at MTC at New York…",
