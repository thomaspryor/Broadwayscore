  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "As gleefully as the musical follows the formula of the rom-com genre, it also has a welcome comfort with ambiguity and, stashed up its sleeve, some psychological bombs. The action floats along so comfortably, both in and out of song, that it seems odd to interrupt that momentum with an intermission. But the second act brings a stark shift in tone, getting darker for a while before rebounding with great silliness and gratifying sympathy.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review praises the musical's comfort with genre conventions and psychological depth, noting smooth pacing and effective tonal shifts, though the single excerpt limitation and mixed tonal elements warrant a conservative positive score. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the musical's comfort with ambiguity and its ability to handle shifts in tone, ultimately rebounding with 'great silliness and gratifying sympathy.' This suggests a positive experience with some reservations about pacing, leading to a positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review notes the musical's comfortable flow and enjoyable aspects, but also mentions a stark shift in tone and some psychological elements, suggesting a recommendation with reservations. Given the limited text, a score in the middle of the 'Positive' range seems appropriate.",
