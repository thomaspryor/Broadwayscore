  "dtliExcerpt": "Two Strangers could have sunk into treacly territory, but it stays afloat on a banter-filled book and twinkling contemporary score by Jim Barne and Kit Buchan. While the lyrics aren't groundbreaking, the sonorous ballads play to the stratosphere even when patter songs register as clunky. In less competent hands, this modest musical (one that could play well in smaller theatres) would drag at two hours, but luckily, Two Strangers intersperses its reveals with stirring emotion and rich humor.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"For an optimist, this is a rom-com recipe where familiarity is a feature, not a flaw...is like a warm hot chocolate as respite from the snow.\"",
