The musical comes dangerously close to cloying sentimentality at times, but Dougal’s dry sense of humor and Tutty’s first-class delivery prevents the story from ever getting too soupy.",

Johnny Oleksinki, The New York Post: The musical comes dangerously close to cloying sentimentality at times, but Dougal’s dry sense of humor and Tutty’s first-class delivery prevents the story from ever getting too soupy. Chris Jones, The New York Daily News: Stories with odd couples on the edge of Eros, so to speak, can be very effective (see the movie “Lost in Translation” or the musical “The Band’s Visit“) but if writers choose to have their couple get naked and hit the sheets, in this case at the Plaza Hotel, since we’re all about New York aspiration here, they struggle to know where to go. So while this show held me for Act One with its considerable charm, by Act Two, it was hitting turbulence. 90 minutes and out would have been a better plan.

At the Longacre Theatre, 220 W. 48th Street. Like unwrapping a present under the tree, you’re not quite sure what you’re in for at the start of “Two Strangers (Carry A Cake Across New York),” the little musical from London that opened Thursday night. Will I need to keep the gift receipt? By the end of the feel-good holiday comedy, though, it’s been a great Christmas. We’ve got a brand new Broadway star. His name is Sam Tutty , the 27-year-old British actor who is making a must-see NYC debut at the Longacre Theatre. With a crisp pop voice — he played the title role in “Dear Evan Hansen” in the West End — he’s hilarious, Shirley Temple endearing and effortlessly magnetic as a puppy-dog Englishman who’s just landed in the five boroughs for the first time. Tutty’s co-star in the two-hander, Christiani Pitts, is lovely as the Brooklyn-born city dweller who picks him up at JFK. Chemistry is essential here, and the well-cast pair blindingly spark. But the truth is that Tutty is not only carrying a cake, but an entire show. More From Johnny Oleksinski Will Timothée Chalamet and Leonardo DiCaprio score Oscar nominations?
