  "dtliExcerpt": "What elevates the show from an assembly-line rom-com is the way Barne and Buchan balance the genre’s baked-in cliches with sharp left turns and nuanced commentary about life experience and personal connection. “Two Strangers” ain’t packing snow, but it’s not powder either. The musical comes dangerously close to cloying sentimentality at times, but Dougal’s dry sense of humor and Tutty’s first-class delivery prevents the story from ever getting too soupy.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"We’ve got a brand new Broadway star. His name is Sam Tutty...he’s hilarious, Shirley Temple endearing and effortlessly magnetic as a puppy-dog Englishman who’s just landed in the five boroughs for the first time.\"",
