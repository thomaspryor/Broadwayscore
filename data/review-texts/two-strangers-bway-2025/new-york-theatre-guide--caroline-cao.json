  "bwwExcerpt": "Tutty (who wears his role like muscle memory, having originated it in London) and Pitts flex their chemistry as scene partners: Dougal is an animated, British chatterbox who views the Big Apple through a lens of pop culture, while she’s the exhausted New York native who rolls her eyes at his touristy prattling. Their adventure involves Tinder matchmaking, nods to rom-com tropes, some verbal and physical stumbles, and a spending spree with a borrowed American Express. The writers get plenty of mileage from quips about the taboo that the pair are soon to be in-laws.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"For an optimist, this is a rom-com recipe where familiarity is a feature, not a flaw...is like a warm hot chocolate as respite from the snow.\"",
