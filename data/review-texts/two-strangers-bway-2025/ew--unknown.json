  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "As for the stage itself, the design (also by Gilmour) consists of two towers of silver painted luggage of various sizes on a turntable. It's not the most visually exciting backdrop, but the suitcases do prove inventive, opening at various points to reveal props, a closet, a bed, a vanity, and even a noodle shop. The turntable also leads to lots of dramatic walking in place. Not highly original, but effective enough. The same could probably be said of the entire romantic comedy genre, but when you have the right stars and the right songs, it doesn't really matter. If it works, it works. And Two Strangers (Carry a Cake Across New York) definitely works.",
