  "fullText": "Just as it's true that \"if it's not on the page, it's not on the stage,\" it's equally important that the people on the stage command your attention, especially when it's only two of them. Fortunately for audiences, the new musical \"Two Strangers (Carry a Cake Across New York),\" now at the Longacre Theatre, fulfills both of those objectives, which may allow this low-key charmer to become a big-time hit.\n\nThe show features an adorable, romcom-like book and a sophisticated score by the writing team of Jim Barne and Kit Buchan, smart direction by Tim Jackson, and, above all, superstar-making performances from British actor Sam Tutty (who has been with the show since its London debut in 2023) and American Christiani Pitts (who may seem familiar if you remember the short-lived \"King Kong.\")\n\nIn addition to their formidable singular talents, the pair (who previously did the show together at A.R.T in Cambridge) have genuine chemistry, which is hard to come by these days and makes this fairy tale go down smoother than an aged Irish whiskey.\n\nIndeed, only in a musical (or movie) would Dougal, a puppyish Brit who works in a cinema and lives with his mom, connect so quickly with Robin, a spunky African American coffee shop worker who suffers from a lack of purpose and more than a shred of remorse for an ill-considered love affair. While the pair are contemporaries, Robin is about to become Dougal's \"auntie\" due to the impending marriage of his father Mark to her slightly older sister Melissa.\n\nDougal, who is aptly described by Robin as \"a golden retriever,\" is so smitten with being in New York and meeting his father for the first time (!), as well as with Robin's singular mixture of warmth and chilliness, that he couldn't care less about their \"familial\" bond. Further, he's a stranger in a strange land, and for all his bravado, wants someone to share his sightseeing adventures.\n\nIt takes more time for Robin to appreciate Dougal's charms – and even after she does, she ends up rejecting him after a stupid fight that threatens to derail any kind of future relationship. Yet, even at that horrible moment, one suspects there may be a happy ending in their future.\n\nA twinkish blond with seemingly endless energy and the just-right hint of vulnerability, Tutty is perfection. He uses his golden throat to excellent effect on such solos as the exuberant \"New York\" and the wistful \"About to Go In.\" Meanwhile, the steelier, big-voiced Pitts, a first-rate actress, shines just as brightly on Robin's bittersweet solos, \"What'll It Be,\" \"He Doesn't Exist\" and \"This Time Next Year.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, most of the score is comprised of duets, including the chirpy \"Under the Mistletoe,\" the manic \"The Hangover Duet\" and the beautiful \"If I Believed.\" You may not be able to hum any of these songs while you leave the theatre, but you'll probably want to hear them again as soon as you can. (I do suspect a couple of them will end up shortly in audition rooms, cabarets, and on YouTube.)\n\nHaving seen (and enjoyed) the show on the West End, I was hoping for some changes for a New York run – most notably a shorter running time (the tale really doesn't warrant two acts running for 2 1/4 hours) and a more expansive set than the ever-revolving piles of luggage designed by Soutra Gilmour (and lit by Jack Knowles), a clever concept that nonetheless doesn't provide quite enough visual appeal for a Broadway musical.\n\nAdmittedly, though, there isn't a lot to unpack here (it ain't \"Chess\"), but the show thankfully feels both simple and honest. (Again, it ain't \"Chess.\") Most of all, I can think of no two people better equipped to carry this delightful musical than Sam Tutty and Christiani Pitts. Let's hope they don't stay strangers to the Broadway stage.",
