    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows measured praise for structure and craft, but qualified language ('many will value') suggests reserved recommendation. Low confidence due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the structure but notes a disruption in the final third. The phrase 'many will value' suggests a mixed reception, as it implies not everyone may appreciate the change. | Gemini: The review notes a precise structure but also mentions a disruptive final third, suggesting a mixed assessment. The truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers solid praise for the play's precise structure, though the analytical tone and 'prima facie' qualifier suggest mild rather than enthusiastic recommendation. With only one curated excerpt available per the warning, confidence is reduced. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
