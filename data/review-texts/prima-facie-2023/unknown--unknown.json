    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows measured praise for structure and craft, but notes disruption in final third. Positive assessment but qualified, and low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the structure but notes a significant change in the final third, suggesting a mixed view. The excerpt's tone is not clearly positive or negative, leading to a mixed classification with low confidence due to limited context. | Gemini: The review excerpt notes a positive structure but also mentions a disruptive final third, suggesting a mixed experience. The truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the play's structure as 'precise' but employs distanced language ('many will value') regarding the final third, suggesting a mild, qualified recommendation rather than an enthusiastic endorsement. Single-excerpt limitations warrant conservative scoring in the lower Positive range. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
