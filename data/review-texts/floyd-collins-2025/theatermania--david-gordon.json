    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, this contains exceptionally strong praise with vivid, poetic language ('reach the heavens', 'crystal-clear', 'sumptuously') and positions the production as revelatory. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the production's emotional impact and clarity. The language suggests a highly positive view, though the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt is highly positive, using phrases like \"sumptuously desolate,\" \"charged with enough emotion to reach the heavens,\" and \"crystal-clear revival.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the revival's emotional impact and clarity, using superlatives like 'reach the heavens' and 'crystal-clear,' indicating a strong recommendation despite the limited available text.",
