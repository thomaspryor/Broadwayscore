  "bwwExcerpt": "Still, Floyd Collins is no feel-good entertainment, a rarity in a spring season that has already given us Boop!, Smash, and Operation Mincemeat. But theatergoers seeking more challenging fare are encouraged to dig into Floyd Collins... The sublime Jeremy Jordan is in top form as the overly optimistic Floyd... While film director Billy Wilder was inspired by the ‘media circus,’ Landau and Guettel are more interested in Floyd’s existential dilemma as he realizes he might die, as well as the ever-fracturing relationships above ground that develop during Floyd’s final days.",
