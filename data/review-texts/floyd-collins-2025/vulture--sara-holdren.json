However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as the full review sentiment is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a lack of impact and engagement with the show's themes, indicating a negative impression. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is negative, stating the show \"leaves far too soft an impression.\" Given the lack of additional context, confidence is low, but the statement is clearly a negative assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production for lacking sufficient impact and failing to engage with the emotional depths of its subject matter, indicating a negative verdict against the show.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Floyd Collins leaves far too soft an impression. It never really joins its hero in the depths... For a show with such a potentially powerful symbol at its core — a man trapped in the rock, singing as he’s crushed by America — the production feels like it’s skimming the surface. Visually beautiful at times, but the horror of Floyd’s situation is never truly realized, and the people above ground feel more like concepts than characters. I felt more fear reading a sketch of the real entrapment than during the entire two-plus hours of the musical.",
