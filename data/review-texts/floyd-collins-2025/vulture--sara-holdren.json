However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as the full review sentiment is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a lack of impact and engagement with the show's themes, indicating a negative impression. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is negative, stating the show \"leaves far too soft an impression.\" Given the lack of additional context, confidence is low, but the statement is clearly a negative assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production for lacking sufficient impact and failing to engage with the emotional depths of its subject matter, indicating a negative verdict against the show.",
