Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone suggests a rave review. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"glorious-sounding\" and \"thoroughly winning\" to describe the production and Jeremy Jordan's performance, indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I've set the confidence to low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production ('wonders,' 'glorious-sounding,' 'exalted evocation') and lead performance ('thoroughly winning'). Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this scores in the 80-84 range, though confidence is low given the curated nature of the excerpt.",

One of the wonders of the show’s glorious-sounding new production... is how far from claustrophobic it feels... Jordan swiftly makes us want that for Floyd... Suddenly, powerfully, Floyd was all of us, waylaid mid-pursuit of happiness, uncertain how to proceed... Inside that tiny, frightening pocket of earth, Floyd needs an echo. To cry out and get only silence back: There would be heartbreak.",

  "fullText": "Headlines at the time called Floyd Collins a “cave captive,” a “prisoner of nature’s dungeon” — dramatic language, but accurate, and the American public was obsessed. In a nail-biting news saga that lasted just over two weeks in the winter of 1925, Collins, a cave explorer, was pinned deep under the cold Kentucky soil. Inside a narrow, precarious passageway, his left foot was snared by a rock.\n\nAs one of the rescue team members says in “Floyd Collins,” the 1994 musical that Tina Landau (“Redwood”) and Adam Guettel (“Days of Wine and Roses”) adapted from the story: “It’s a real chest compressor down there.”\n\nYet one of the wonders of the show’s glorious-sounding new production, which opened on Monday night at the Vivian Beaumont Theater with a thoroughly winning Jeremy Jordan in the title role, is how far from claustrophobic it feels. Lincoln Center Theater’s vast and airy Broadway stage becomes an exalted evocation of the enormous cavern that Floyd discovers, delighting in its echoing acoustics, just before he gets into his ultimately fatal jam.\n\nBit of a grim subject for a musical, though, isn’t it? Especially now, when so many headlines fuel anxiety. Even so, there is comfort in it, and not just for those of us who are always up for a tale involving a hero journalist. That would be the adorably named Skeets Miller (Taylor Trensch), a cub reporter from Louisville who is small enough, and bold enough, to reach Floyd and interview him while trying to dig him out.\n\nBut neighbors and family are the first to come to the aid of the inquisitive, intrepid Floyd, who is forever landing in scrapes that he needs saving from. Eventually, even the governor becomes involved.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",
