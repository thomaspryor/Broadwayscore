  "bwwExcerpt": "Sure, this show is about more than Floyd Collins. It has much to say about how America exploits human and familial tragedy, then and now, but it just cannot work fully without a deep connection taking place between the audience and the main character... In this new design by the team known collectively as dot, you don’t so much see the real hills of Kentucky as a kind of surreal dreamscape that looks cool in an arty kind of way, but still doesn’t truly connect you to Floyd himself... Simply put, the emotional waves that all musicals need to surf in order to fully work just seem here to stop at the surface. We understand the issues, but don’t feel all the feels underground.",
