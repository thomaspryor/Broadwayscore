    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic describes the show as 'aloof' and finds the ideas underdeveloped, suggesting significant reservations without a clear recommendation either way. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a lack of engagement and underdeveloped ideas, indicating a mixed review. The single quote and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the reviewer found the show lacking in substance, but it's not overtly negative. Given the single excerpt and the phrase \"needs more flesh on their bones,\" I've classified it as mixed. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates the critic sees conceptual potential ('ideas') but finds the execution emotionally distant ('aloof') and insufficiently developed ('need more flesh'), suggesting an uneven, mixed assessment rather than a clear recommendation.",
