  "fullText": "Read our review of Floyd Collins on Broadway, a folk and bluegrass musical starring Jeremy Jordan and Lizzy McAlpine and created by Adam Guettel and Tina Landau. “It is a depressing subject for a musical,” my seatmate said to me, and yet, this shouldn’t dissuade you from attending the uneven but ambitious Floyd Collins, a musical based on the attempted rescue of the titular cave explorer in 1925. Director Tina Landau, who also wrote the book and lyrics alongside composer/lyricist Adam Guettel, manages tricky meditative beats in the slow-burn show, whose doomed protagonist is wedged in a cave hole for the majority of the run time. I imagine that when the musical premiered in 1996 off Broadway, a smaller theatre serviced the claustrophobia of the situation, a tougher sell on the gargantuan stage of the Vivian Beaumont Theater. Jeremy Jordan, as Floyd, lingers on a stony chaise lounge in the open air. While Scott Zielinski’s lighting suggests the darkness that enfolds Floyd, it’s visually silly that he is “trapped” in a chair purposed for relaxation. The first act may frustrate with its lagginess and scant urgency, and yet it complements the second act’s tragic turns as Floyd’s ordeal inflames a media circus — considered the first one to erupt following the emergence of radio — and attracts opportunistic reporters and vendors who turn the site into a carnival for tourists. It’s the musical’s searing critique of a tragedy industrial complex. Comedic quips keep the musical from sinking into bleakness, and Guettel’s folksy bluegrass score, complete with yodeling, is a remarkable one. The yodeling is its own indecipherable language, and it's also the sound of Floyd’s communion with the very forces of nature that lured and then trapped him. A musical in two acts, Floyd Collins is based on a real-life tragedy where a Kentucky explorer crawls into a cave, planning to carve it out into a fortune-making attraction called the Sand Cave. An unlucky slip ends up wedging his leg into a hole for days. His brother Homer (Jason Gotay), reporter Skeets Miller (Taylor Trensch), and other community members can only visit and argue over how to free him safely, all while the town and the Collins family process the imposing media circus. The stakes ratchet up when a cave-in cuts him off from any potential rescue route. Pinned in isolation, he tries to make sense of his thwarted dreams and his near-certain death. Audiences have anecdotally called Floyd Collins “the yodeling musical,” but people may be surprised the show is actually a sobering procedural-rescue musical. In an early number, Jordan’s Floyd impressively spelunks around the dark of the cave, letting Jordan exert physical action before his character becomes stuck and then seated for much of the show, occasionally leaving this prison in a few fantasy numbers. Ruey Horng Sun’s projections are modest colors of sky. By the second act, the stage floor is muddy and sandy, conveying the public and the media’s trampling of the town. My performance had spurts of jumbled sound mixing in the ensemble moments. As of publication, the review aggregator Show-Score displays a 67% average audience rating based on 139 member reviews.
