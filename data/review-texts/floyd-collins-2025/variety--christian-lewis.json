    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges strong elements but finds the show fundamentally flawed as a cohesive work. The metaphor about treasure being 'too dark and difficult to fully extract' suggests neither recommendation nor strong discouragement. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review with some positive elements but overall difficulty in appreciating the production. The language indicates a lack of coherence and effectiveness, placing it in the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review acknowledges some positive aspects but ultimately finds the show difficult to grasp and not entirely successful, indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges scattered strong elements and hidden merit but finds the show incoherent and too difficult to access as a whole, resulting in a neither-here-nor-there verdict.",
