However, this is only one curated quote that may not represent the full review verdict, hence low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the orchestra and lead performances, indicating a positive view. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment is uncertain, warranting a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the orchestra and the singing of the leads, indicating a positive assessment. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the content is clearly positive. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strong positive evaluative language ('superb', 'full-bodied') regarding the orchestra and principal performances, indicating a positive assessment of the production's musical elements.",
