    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Critic's Pick designation plus calling the show 'sublime' and 'a rare achievement in any work of art' indicates exceptional praise warranting Rave territory, though single excerpt limits full context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as reaching 'the sublime,' indicating a high level of praise. The 'Critic’s Pick' designation further suggests a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning reduces confidence. | Gemini: The phrase \"reaches the sublime\" and \"rare achievement\" indicates a rave review. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the lower end of the rave bucket. | Kimi: The 'Critic's Pick' designation combined with superlatives like 'sublime' and 'rare achievement' indicate the highest possible recommendation, placing this firmly in the Rave bucket despite the limited excerpt available.",
