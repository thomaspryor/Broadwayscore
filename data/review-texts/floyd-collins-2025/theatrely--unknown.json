  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"[Trensch] and Jordan (and that opening sequence) are worth the price of admission, as are Ted Sperling's music direction and Bruce Coughlin's orchestrations. Floyd Collins is an odd piece which, staged, asks a little too hard that we mine through dense earth to reach its goal. But this Broadway premiere makes a solid case for its beauty, found through a gorgeous score that draws opera from Americana.\""
