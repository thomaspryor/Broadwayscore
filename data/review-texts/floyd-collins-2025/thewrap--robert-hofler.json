  "fullText": "Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas’ “The Light in the Piazza” remains the greatest musical of this century. It opened on Broadway in 2005 at Lincoln Center Theater, and endured a few bumpy weeks at the box office, dampened by decidedly mixed reviews, before the New York Times’ Stephen Holden gave its cast recording a money notice.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Whatever its deficiencies, Floyd Collins delivers a mighty central character that musically, if not dramatically, is the male equivalent of Rose in Gypsy. Jordan’s magnificent work here is one for the record books, one of the all-time great musical performances. Don’t miss it... The Broadway debut of Floyd Collins makes a good case for the musical without being a revelation... Landau’s book doesn’t really take off until the second act... Her staging calls out the crass American commercialism by giving us a crass Broadway circus-style production number... It is unfortunate that someone with a fresher take wasn’t engaged for this major revival.",

The verdict is mixed, acknowledging strengths but also significant shortcomings. | Gemini: The review recommends seeing it due to Jordan's performance, but also notes deficiencies in the book and staging, resulting in a positive but not rave score. | Kimi: While the critic criticizes the book, direction, and staging as uninspired ('without being a revelation'), the extraordinary praise for the lead performance ('magnificent,' 'don't miss it') drives a clear recommendation to see the show.",
