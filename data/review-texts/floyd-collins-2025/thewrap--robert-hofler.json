  "fullText": "Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas’ “The Light in the Piazza” remains the greatest musical of this century. It opened on Broadway in 2005 at Lincoln Center Theater, and endured a few bumpy weeks at the box office, dampened by decidedly mixed reviews, before the New York Times’ Stephen Holden gave its cast recording a money notice.",
