  "bwwExcerpt": "Matt Shingledecker is well cast as Roger, the HIV-infected songwriter who sings of the pretty boy front man wasting opportunity in \"One Song Glory.\" Annaleigh Ashford plays Maureen, the feisty bisexual performance artist, more for laughs than did Idina Menzel. (Menzel is among the original cast members in the 2005 movie.) Adam Chanler-Berat is a low-key Mark, the documentarian narrator, who bears a slight resemblance to Larson himself. Nicholas Christopher as Tom Collins inspires awe and empathy",
