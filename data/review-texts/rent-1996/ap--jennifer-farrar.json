  "bwwExcerpt": "Greif has fully utilized the small theater, creating a dynamic flow of quick scene changes on Mark Wendland's intimate set. Vertical and multi-tiered, it's a clever maze of fire escapes, ladders and window gates, rising against a backdrop of urban projections by Peter Nigrini. With lighting by Kevin Adams and Brian Ronan's sound design, the production elements nicely establish quicksilver mood and location changes.",

  "dtliExcerpt": "You wouldn't think a musical about struggling artists facing an imminent threat of death could possibly be uplifting. But the new off-Broadway revival of the popular rock musical \"Rent,\" loosely based on the Puccini opera \"La Boheme,\" radiates energetic optimism, musicality and humor, even though several of the youthful characters are HIV-positive.",
