  "bwwExcerpt": "Greif has fully utilized the small theater, creating a dynamic flow of quick scene changes on Mark Wendland's intimate set. Vertical and multi-tiered, it's a clever maze of fire escapes, ladders and window gates, rising against a backdrop of urban projections by Peter Nigrini. With lighting by Kevin Adams and Brian Ronan's sound design, the production elements nicely establish quicksilver mood and location changes.",
