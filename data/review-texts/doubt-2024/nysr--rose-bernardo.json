Truncated at key moment, so scored conservatively in lower positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Shanley's text for its truthfulness and efficiency, suggesting a positive view. However, the lack of tension and the single excerpt warning indicate a cautious approach, leading to a lower positive score. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the playwright's writing, suggesting a positive, though possibly qualified, recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Shanley's writing ('rings truer than ever,' packs more into 90 minutes than most playwrights do in 150) with only a minor caveat about tension levels, indicating a solid recommendation.",
