While brief, the praise is clear and unqualified. | Gemini: The review calls the revival \"excellent\" and \"gripping\", indicating a positive experience. However, the phrase \"without any intentional new slant\" suggests it's a faithful but not groundbreaking production, justifying a score in the middle of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic explicitly calls the revival 'excellent' and describes the original play as 'taut' and 'gripping,' indicating a clear recommendation. However, the text appears truncated before the final verdict, and the note that the production offers 'no intentional new slant' suggests qualified rather than ecstatic enthusiasm.",
