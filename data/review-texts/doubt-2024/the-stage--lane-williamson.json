  "bwwExcerpt": "With an imbalance between them, as well as between Ryan and Quincy Tyler Bernstine (excellent in a single scene as Donald’s mother), the production wobbles. The electric confrontation between Aloysius and Flynn is underpowered and prevents the play from reaching its climax. Ryan should be applauded for learning this titanic role and creating her portrayal in what limited time she had. But everything about the world of Ellis’ production is calibrated for a different performance.",
