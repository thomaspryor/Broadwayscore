  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"This revival is so magnificent and so emotionally rich, anchored by performances by Gyllenhaal and Annaleigh Ashford...Gyllenhaal’s gifts as an actor are well-documented by now, so it’s his vocal talents that may come as a surprise...This production, so deftly directed, emphasizes both the value in the struggle, and the timelessness of great art. It’s powerful indeed to have the experience, even briefly, of seeing the world through the eyes of a visionary.\"\n\nRead more",
