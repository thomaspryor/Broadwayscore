  "showScoreExcerpt": "“In my opinion, this is the most perfect score ever written for the musical theatre. The complexity of Stephen Sondheim's work, and the way in which it mimics Seurat's pointillistic style, is a marvel. It is highbrow and cerebral, yet also emotionally resonant and accessible...Ashford was able to mine out every little nugget of comedy…Jake Gyllenhaal is thoroughly impressive as George. You'll be shocked when you hear him sing.”\n\nRead more",
