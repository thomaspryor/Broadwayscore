  "showScoreExcerpt": "“I find this musical so brilliant, it's hard to even write about it coherently…It was extremely intimate and personal and made each performance choice and song lyric stand out…Each of the performances were also so detailed and so lovingly portrayed...I thought Gyllenhaal was amazing and I just can't get over his wonderful singing. Not only does he have lovely tone, but his diction of the incredible lyrics was perfect…Annaleigh Ashford was a wonderful Dot.”\n\nRead more",
