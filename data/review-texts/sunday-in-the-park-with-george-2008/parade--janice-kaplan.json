  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Gyllenhaal turns out to have a wonderful singing voice that brings passion to Sondheim’s complicated (and glorious) score. This musical may be about art, but the terrific chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Ashford makes it more than ever about love, too...'Sunday In the Park with George' is such a gorgeous musical that I worried if it could be as good as I remembered it.
