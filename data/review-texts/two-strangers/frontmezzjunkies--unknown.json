  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "What ultimately makes Two Strangers such a winning Broadway arrival is its belief that tenderness is still theatrical currency. Jackson's direction keeps the show surefooted, even at its most delicate, allowing Tutty and Pitts, and the entire creative team, to craft something that sneaks up on you. As we saw with Maybe Happy Ending, audiences are hungry for productions that treat emotion as serious craft, and hopefully, with these delightfully engaging Two Strangers, the much-needed emotional connection will deliver the Tony Award goods once again.",

However, with only one curated quote, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"winning Broadway arrival\", \"delightfully engaging\", and praises the direction and creative team. The excerpt suggests a strong recommendation. | Kimi: Single excerpt describes the show as a 'winning Broadway arrival' with 'delightfully engaging' performances and 'surefooted' direction, recommending it as emotionally satisfying craft. Score reflects upper Positive range per excerpt guidance, with low confidence due to limited text availability.",
