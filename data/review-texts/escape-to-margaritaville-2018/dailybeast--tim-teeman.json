However, this is only a single excerpt, so confidence is low as the full review context is missing. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the show is not enjoyable unless one is a fan of Jimmy Buffett, and implies that alcohol is needed to endure it. This indicates a negative view of the production. | Gemini: The review suggests enjoyment is heavily reliant on being a fan, and the critic implies needing drinks to endure it, indicating a mixed to slightly negative experience. | Kimi: The critic suggests intoxication is necessary to endure the show, indicating a tedious or unpleasant experience and a clear recommendation against seeing it sober.",
