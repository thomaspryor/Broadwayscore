  "bwwExcerpt": "That a fairly large percentage of the crowd at a recent Wednesday matinee enthusiastically shouted out those lyrics indicates that the show may find its audience, even if New York is probably not the epicenter. But even those unfamiliar with Buffett's songwriting oeuvre (I know, not a word usually associated with the composer of 'Cheeseburger in Paradise') should find the proceedings relaxedly enjoyable. This jukebox musical is the theatrical equivalent of sipping on a frozen drink while lying on a beach chair in the blazing sun. It's not good for you, but it feels good.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Even those unfamiliar with Buffett's songwriting oeuvre should find the proceedings relaxedly enjoyable…It's only when the writers attempt to provide literalism to the lyrics...that the show feels hopelessly strained…Nonetheless, the overall silliness goes down fairly easily, and even easier if you partake of the frozen margaritas...The show exudes an affable likability that's hard to entirely resist…It also helps immeasurably that such a talented cast of Broadway veterans has been assembled.”\n\nRead more"
