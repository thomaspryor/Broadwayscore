They may work well enough on the radio or in concert but, conscripted for theatrical service, grow quickly monotonous.\"\n\nRead more",

While the score is praised for being beautifully sung, the songs are criticized as monotonous in a theatrical setting. | Gemini: The review uses phrases like \"awfully lowbrow\" and \"grow quickly monotonous,\" but also notes that the score is \"beautifully sung.\" Due to the limited excerpt, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation, but it leans towards mixed. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the show as 'awfully lowbrow,' lazy, and monotonous, warning it will 'extinguish your IQ' despite acknowledging the score is beautifully sung, indicating an overall negative verdict.",
