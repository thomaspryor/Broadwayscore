  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Very loosely formed plot...Feels more like a concert...The book is certainly a corny mess...None of the actors are safe from this hackneyed style of writing...They all trying to make the best with what they have been given...It does not matter that the musical is not well-written, has problematic lyrics, is very white, and has some horribly crafted jokes...'Escape to Margaritaville' is critic-proof...Has a very clear fan base and they do not care if it is a quality piece of musical theater.\"\n\nRead more",
