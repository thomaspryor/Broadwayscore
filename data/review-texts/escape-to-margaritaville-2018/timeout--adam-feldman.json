  "bwwExcerpt": "What do you expect from a Jimmy Buffett jukebox musical? The alley outside the Marquis Theatre has been done up as an empty stretch of beach, and that pretty much sums up Escape to Margaritaville, which seems intended to be watched with your feet up and a melting frozen drink in your hand. Along with more than two dozen songs from Buffett's tropical-burnout catalog, the show offers steel drums, jean shorts, palm trees and dancers dressed as fluffy white clouds. It's often hokey and sometimes pokey. But I'll level with you: I had fun.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Hokey and sometimes pokey. But I’ll level with you: I had fun…The show doesn’t shoehorn Buffett’s songs into a story so much as cobble a story around them, extrapolating characters and situations from details in the lyrics, which is more successful in small ways than in large ones…Performed by a vocally overqualified cast…the score is pleasantly catchy…'Escape to Margaritaville' revels in its own goofiness. It’s not trying to be paradise; it’s fine with being a cheeseburger.”\n\nRead more"
