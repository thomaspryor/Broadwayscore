  "bwwExcerpt": "For the show's investors, it may not matter that Escape to Margaritaville isn't very good. It blends the greatest hits of Jimmy Buffett, a set of cheery cardboard characters, and a simple-if occasionally demented-plot into a concoction syrupy enough to taste sort of like a Broadway show. But like the worst versions of its namesake beverage, it's too watered-down to be much fun.",
