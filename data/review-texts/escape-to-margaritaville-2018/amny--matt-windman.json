However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic suggests that the audience would be better off doing something else, which indicates a negative review. The confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: The critic explicitly advises against seeing the show, suggesting audiences would have a superior experience simply listening to the artist's album at a bar instead. The observation that alcohol is required to tolerate the production indicates a fundamentally flawed theatrical experience.",
