  "bwwExcerpt": "Yes, Jimmy Buffett, it's your own damn fault. Oh, I know, you had help in the commission of 'Escape to Margaritaville,' the lamely antiseptic musical that had its official Broadway opening Thursday night at the Marquis Theatre. But it's your songs that book writers Greg Garcia and Mike O'Malley have spun into this insufferably dumb show, about a beach bum guitarist who falls for an environmental scientist while his bartender buddy suffers flashbacks filled with tap-dancing life insurance agents. (Yup, you read that right.)",
