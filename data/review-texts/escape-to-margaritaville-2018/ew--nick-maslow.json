  "bwwExcerpt": "Is it possible to make Jimmy Buffett music both sexy and funny in 2018? That's apparently the goal of Escape to Margaritaville, a new musical featuring his hits that opens on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre on Thursday night. Unless you've never been in a dive bar and Instagram accounts for the majority of your cultural exposure, you'll recognize early on the high degree to which Buffett's music and lyrics inform the plot, ultimately with humorous and uplifting - but not-so-groundbreaking - results.",
