  "bwwExcerpt": "The delightful, energetic frothy drink of a show that just opened at the Marquis Theatre is exactly what you'd expect given its inspiration - a predictable romantic comedy that celebrates the music written and/or performed by the renowned singer who's turned his laid-back island sound into a serious corporate empire.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it 'delightful' and 'energetic' with positive tone, though notes it's predictable. Single excerpt warning suggests this represents a positive assessment, placing it in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'delightful' and 'energetic', indicating a positive experience. The use of 'frothy drink' suggests a light, enjoyable show. However, the single excerpt warning reduces confidence. | Gemini: The review calls the show \"delightful\" and \"energetic,\" but also \"predictable,\" suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as 'delightful' and 'energetic,' offering a clear recommendation while acknowledging its predictable nature. The single excerpt suggests solid entertainment value despite formulaic elements.",
