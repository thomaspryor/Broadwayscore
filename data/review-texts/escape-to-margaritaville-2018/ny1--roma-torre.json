  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The show is cleverly built around more than two dozen songs...It nicely captures Buffett's signature style - that laid back, tropical vibe...Exuberantly transports audiences on a satisfying high from start to finish...The story breezes along with snappy humor and even manages to get a little deep...The cast is ideal...As predictable as they come, but Ashley's lively staging makes it all go down quite smoothly.
