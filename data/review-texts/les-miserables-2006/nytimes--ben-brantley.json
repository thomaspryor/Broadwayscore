    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise for the production values and emotional core, but lack of stronger superlatives or explicit recommendation language suggests measured positivity rather than enthusiasm. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's visual and emotional qualities, suggesting a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, describing the production as 'handsome' and noting that it keeps the show's heart intact. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the physical production and emotional core ('handsome', 'epic sweep', 'heart intact'), indicating a clear recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is low but the language warrants the upper end of the Positive range.",
