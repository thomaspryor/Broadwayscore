Single excerpt limits confidence but tone is unambiguously positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the revival's focus on story and characters over staging, stating it 'works beautifully'. The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses a strongly positive sentiment, stating that the revival \"works beautifully.\" Given the limited text, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the revival's approach and explicitly states it 'works beautifully,' indicating a clear recommendation, though the single-excerpt limitation requires caution.",
