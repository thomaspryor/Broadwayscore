  "bwwExcerpt": "Director John Rando does an adroit job of blending dance and comedy, with the aid of a dynamic cast (that includes a pleasingly large chorus). Things do run aground, though, in the relatively short second act. While most stories speed up as they near a climax, 'On the Town' slows way down, with a series of repetitive nightclub scenes - primarily excuses for specialty numbers - before Gabey and Ivy reunite for their final clinch.",
