  "bwwExcerpt": "On the Town is a heartbreakingly youthful work: both about youth and by youth. Watching its three sailors pursue a lifetime of adventure while on 24-hour shore leave in New York, New York, you can't help sensing the shadows of the three giddy pals who knocked the show together in 1944...And yet here it is, 70 years later, in its third Broadway revival, as big and breakneck and beautiful as ever. As imperfect, too; the revival, like the original, triumphs over some insufferable missteps...Everything great in On the Town, including the dances, begins in his score, and flowers from it, in alternating colors of blue and brass...So it's a pleasure to report that the musical aspects of the revival...are first-rate...The huge stage allows more room for Joshua Bergasse's choreography, which bows but does not scrape to the Robbins originals and is often quite gorgeous, especially in the self-contained numbers.",
