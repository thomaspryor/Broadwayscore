  "fullText": "ExpandFrom left, Jay Armstrong Johnson, Tony Yazbeck and Clyde Alves as World War II sailors in the city (©2014 Joan Marcus)\n\nThree footloose sailors aren't the only ones who get lucky in \"On the Town.\"\n\nDirector John Rando has assembled a great cast for this fizzy and frisky revival of the 1944 musical by Betty Comden, Adolph Green and Leonard Bernstein. Tracing a tale of World War II tars on leave in the big city, the production feels like a big, juicy kiss. So pucker up, New York.\n\nThe 28-piece orchestra brings out all the splendor in Bernstein's rapturous, red-blooded score. Musical gems sparkle, starting with the rousing \"New York, New York\" (\"it's a helluva town\"), which gets things going. The playful \"I Can Cook Too\" and wistful \"Some Other Time\" follow in short order.\n\nComden and Green's story unfolds as lighthearted episodes. The Navy men set out to see the sights — architectural and anatomical.\n\nRomantic Gabey (Tony Yazbeck) dashes in hot pursuit of dream girl Ivy (Megan Fairchild), who he spies on a poster.\n\nMeanwhile, naive Chip (Jay Armstrong Johnson) gets hijacked by randy cabbie Hildy (Alysha Umphress). And goofy seaman Ozzie (Clyde Alves) and hot-to-trot anthropologist Claire (Elizabeth Stanley) sing about getting \"Carried Away\" and do just that. They jump each other's bones near a dinosaur skeleton at the Museum of Natural History.\n\nThe whole cast is excellent, but Yazbeck (center) is a standout. (©2014 Joan Marcus)\n\nRando (\"Urinetown\") mines the script for all its boisterous humor and smartly makes space for hushed interludes, including a touching version of the melancholy \"Lonely Town.\" That one spills into the audience.\n\nThe show is based on a ballet by Jerome Robbins. Choreographer Joshua Bergasse keeps the fleet of agile and athletic dancers leaping, kicking and spinning like a top.\n\nThe cast is top-to-bottom excellent. In sailor suits and stripped to their skivvies, Johnson and Alves are adorable and able-bodied. Umphress adds sass and brass as the go-for-it taxi driver, and Stanley is delicious as the oversexed scientist. Jackie Hoffman is a hoot-and-a-half playing a boozy voice teacher and a few more small roles.\n\nYazbeck is a very appealing and persuasive song-and-dance man. His pas pas de deux with Fairchild, dancing dynamite from New York City Ballet, is poignant and sexy.\n\nThe look of the show is chipper and bright, including Jess Goldstein's perky costumes and Jason Lyons' lighting. Beowulf Boritt's sets, though, are head-scratchers. Set pieces add modern flourishes but overdo the cartoonishness. That includes clear plastic skyscrapers and a lemon-yellow T. rex.\n\nEven so, it's a helluva entertainment.",
