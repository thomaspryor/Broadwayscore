  "bwwExcerpt": "Living in New York City, day in and day out, it's easy to forget the fun of experiencing it all for the first time. The wonder of looking up at the skyscrapers from the streets below. The excitement of being among the diversity of its residents. It's the sort of childlike discovery that makes even a crowded subway seem like a magical place. That unmitigated glee is alive and well at the Lyric Theatre, where the Broadway revival of the they-don't-make-'em-like-they-used-to musical 'On the Town' is now open. Tony-winning director John Rando ('Urinetown') has embraced the classic tale...and staged a joyous production that'll make you want to fall in love with the city -- and musical theater -- all over again.",
