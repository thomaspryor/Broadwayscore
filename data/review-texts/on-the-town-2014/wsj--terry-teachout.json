  "bwwExcerpt": "You will note the total absence of grudging qualifications. That's because I haven't any: This show is that good. To be sure, 'On the Town' is one of the Broadway musicals that I love best, and I've been hoping to see a strong New York revival ever since New Jersey's Paper Mill Playhouse gave it the deluxe treatment in 2009. That production could have worked on Broadway, too, but Barrington Stage's version was equally fine, and now that it's here, I urge you to see it as soon as you possibly can. With Broadway increasingly dominated by rubber-stamp commodity musicals, less familiar shows are a tough box-office sell, but 'A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder' managed to ring the gong through sheer excellence last season. If there's any justice at all, so will 'On the Town.'",
