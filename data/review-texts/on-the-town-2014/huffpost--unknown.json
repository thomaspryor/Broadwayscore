  "bwwExcerpt": "Playgoers who haven't walked away from a Broadway musical beaming since before they can remember should head over to Times Square for On The Town...The correct approach, it turns out, is to play down all those layers of camp and nostalgia and let Bernstein, Comden & Green speak for themselves...Director John Rando (Urinetown) and choreographer Joshua Bergasse (Smash) have precisely the right touch, milking every ounce of fun out of the material while treating it with respect. Bergasse is not quite the choreographer that Robbins was, naturally; but he does well in places and even better in others...Where this revival hits the jackpot is in the six leading players.",
