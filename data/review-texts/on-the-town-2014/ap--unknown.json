  "bwwExcerpt": "The webs have been swept away, the comic book villains are long gone and even the name of the theater has changed. So what better way to bid farewell to the doomed 'Spider-Man' musical at the re-christened Lyric Theatre than with a pure American classic? An exuberant, dazzling revival of 'On the Town' opened Thursday, filling Broadway's biggest theater with big, crowd-pleasing dance numbers, lavish and clever visuals and superb performances from a massive cast. It's simply a helluva show...The revival seems to have tapped into the youthful exuberance at the time of its creation -- Bernstein, Comden and Green were still in their 20s in 1944...Bergasse has hewed close to Jerome Robbins' original choreography and he's been blessed by dancers who make mincemeat of several pas-de-deux. Fairchild, a principal dancer at the prestigious New York City Ballet, makes her Broadway debut and is impossible to stop watching.",
