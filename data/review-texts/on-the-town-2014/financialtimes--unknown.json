  "bwwExcerpt": "A New York City Ballet principal, [Megan Fairchild] is known for her sparkling footwork. Here she displays unexpected comic finesse, especially in her voice-lesson scene with Madame Dilly, one of many cartoon roles mastered by Jackie Hoffman. If Fairchild's acting lacks projection, especially compared to the other two female leads -- Alysha Umphress as Hildy and Elizabeth Stanley as Claire -- she compensates during the dance numbers. The choreography, by Joshua Bergasse, is inspired, though Robbins would have cracked the whip harder on the ensemble during the door-slamming number. All three male leads blend sweetness with virility. Clyde Alves is a swaggering Ozzie, Jay Armstrong Johnson a pratfall-mastering Chip, and Tony Yazbeck a deservedly centre-stage Gabey.",
