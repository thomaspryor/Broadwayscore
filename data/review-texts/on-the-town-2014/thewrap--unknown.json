  "fullText": "From “Urinetown” to “On the Town,” director John Rando has finally returned to Broadway with another big hit. There’s a nice symmetry to the bookends of those two Gotham “town” tuners, the Leonard Bernstein revival having opened Thursday at the Lyric Theatre.\n\nRando brings a whimsical irreverence to everything he directs, often with a healthy dollop of vulgarity, and for “On the Town” he doesn’t stint on emphasizing the randiness of the New York City streets during World War II.",
