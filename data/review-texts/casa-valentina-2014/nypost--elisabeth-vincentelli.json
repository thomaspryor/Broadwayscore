This indicates a negative assessment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a strong premise but ultimately states the play doesn't fully capitalize on it, indicating a mixed or lukewarm reception. | Kimi: The critic praises the concept as 'terrific' but finds the execution lacking, indicating the play fails to capitalize on its strong premise.",
