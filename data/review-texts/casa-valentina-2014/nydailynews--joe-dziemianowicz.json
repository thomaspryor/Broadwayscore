  "bwwExcerpt": "With 'Torch Song Trilogy,' 'La Cage aux Folles' and 'Kinky Boots' to his credit, playwright Harvey Fierstein knows a thing or three about the fluidity of gender, identity and sexuality -- and about men raiding women's closets. His fact-inspired story -- directed with sensitivity and style by Joe Mantello -- unfolds at a Catskills bungalow colony that caters to heterosexual transvestites. Very niche.",

The play is noted for having 'heart and humor' but is criticized for lacking cohesion, described as 'a collection of vignettes.' | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects ('heart and humor') but also points out a significant flaw ('feels more like a collection of vignettes'). This indicates a mixed or neutral recommendation. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
