  "bwwExcerpt": "Under the direction of Joe Mantello, the play benefits from superb acting, with each male character creating a strongly individual, convincing female self. Westrate's tough Gloria, Birney's careerist Charlotte and Ebert's awkward Miranda are all particularly vivid. 'Casa Valentina' is very uneven, with abrupt changes in mood, action and attitude. But its illumination of a neglected corner of human activity is diverting, and often thought-provoking.",
