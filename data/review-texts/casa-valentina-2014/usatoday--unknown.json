  "bwwExcerpt": "Fierstein's compassion for his characters never flags, and director Joe Mantello juggles the vivacious and bleak elements of the play -- its warmth and wryness, both characteristic of the playwright -- adroitly. He has the benefit of a superb ensemble cast. Patrick Page and Mare Winningham have a poignant rapport as George/Valentina and his wife, Rita...Tom McGowan is an immensely endearing Bessie, one of several characters we only meet in their feminine guises, while Gabriel Ebert brings a goofy sweetness to the role of first-timer Jonathan/Miranda. Vets John Cullum and Larry Pine are predictably supple as, respectively, mother figure Terry and The Judge/Amy, who may harbor a dangerous secret. Reed Birney is hilariously starchy as George's aforementioned friend, Charlotte, who at one point declares that in 50 years homosexuality will still be shunned, while 'cross-dressing will be as everyday as cigarette smoking.'",
