The lack of a clear positive or negative verdict and the single excerpt warning lead to a low confidence score in the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a somewhat neutral perspective, suggesting the play raises questions about drag without explicitly endorsing or condemning it. The mention of a psychotherapist acquaintance adds a layer of complexity, making it difficult to classify as purely positive or negative. Given the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single truncated excerpt presents thematic interpretation without clear evaluative stance; the 'yet' qualifier suggests mixed perspective on the show's message.",
