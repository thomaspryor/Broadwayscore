  "bwwExcerpt": "While the play is heart-felt and enjoyable, it doesn't feel quite finished, and it ends on a rash and depressing note. Since this is the world premiere production, one hopes that Fierstein can continue to develop it. And given his experience in drag performance, maybe he can even join the cast of a future production.",
