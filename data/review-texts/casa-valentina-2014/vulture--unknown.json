  "bwwExcerpt": "But even within the new play's sampling of seven cross-dressers, the meaning of the act varies widely. For some it's a hobby, for some a sexual fetish, for some a substitute for the worse sin of gayness, and for some an expression of deep allegiance to the feminine side of their soul. For most, regardless, it's also a jumble...In any case, the way these motives come together, or don't, to advance the cause of liberation for 'self-made women' is the subject of this fascinating if somewhat musty play...Luckily, Joe Mantello's disciplined direction pulls the script swiftly past its punch lines and sops up some of its sentimentality as well. The design and the cast (which also includes John Cullum, Larry Pine, Nick Westrate, and Lisa Emery) are up to the Manhattan Theatre Club's usual high standards. Still, none of these fine attributes can quite disguise the odor of over-ingratiation that clings to Casa Valentina like day-old Prince Matchabelli.",
