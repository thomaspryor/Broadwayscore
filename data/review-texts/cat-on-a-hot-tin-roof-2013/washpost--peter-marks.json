  "bwwExcerpt": "At least in the new 'Cat,' the sense of menace activated by Hinds's Big Daddy provides a rationale for the mean-spiritedness spreading through his household like an oil slick. The husky-voiced Johansson, who won a Tony for her performance two years ago as the all-too-desirable dockworker's niece in Arthur Miller's 'A View From the Bridge,' holds her own here, managing a persuasive account of Maggie's quick wits and pragmatic focus. What's missing, though, is her drawing a bead on the character's insecurities, the desperation that compels Maggie to cling to a lie - and to a man who reviles her. (Walker, who played a rock star president in the irreverent-history musical 'Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,' lives up to his character's name here, imbuing Brick with a stony, one-note sullenness.)",

With only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The review praises certain performances, particularly Johansson's, but notes significant shortcomings in character portrayal and emotional depth. The excerpt suggests a mixed impression overall. | Gemini: The review praises Johansson's performance but also notes what's missing in her portrayal and criticizes Walker's performance. The overall sentiment is mixed, with both positive and negative aspects highlighted. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for Hinds's menace and Johansson's surface-level portrayal, but emphasizes significant shortcomings: Johansson misses the character's desperation and Walker delivers a 'one-note' performance, suggesting an uneven production.",
