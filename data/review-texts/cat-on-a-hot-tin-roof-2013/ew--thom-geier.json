    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The B grade indicates positive territory, but the excerpt emphasizes that despite 'intoxicating individual moments,' the production 'never quite clicking' suggests qualified praise with reservations. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some positive aspects ('intoxicating individual moment') but ultimately suggests the production does not fully succeed ('without ever quite clicking'). The single excerpt and lack of a full review text lead to a low confidence in the verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges \"intoxicating individual moment\" but states that the production \"never quite clicking.\" This suggests a mixed or neutral assessment. | Kimi: While praising 'intoxicating individual moments,' the critic's observation that the production 'never quite clicking' indicates significant reservations. The B grade suggests a mild recommendation rather than an enthusiastic endorsement. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
