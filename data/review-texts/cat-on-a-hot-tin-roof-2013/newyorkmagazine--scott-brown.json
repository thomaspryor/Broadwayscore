  "bwwExcerpt": "Even now, audiences are lining up to see Scarlett Johansson challenge the structural integrity of her slip as Maggie the Cat, Tennessee Williams's most bodacious creation: ambitious, lubricious, sex-starved, and ovulating. Your hundred-clams'-worth seems all but guaranteed. And yet the scene-stealer of the evening turns out to be a $5 bath towel. It's worn by Benjamin Walker, who plays Maggie's beautiful, inert husband Brick, broken plantation scion, shattered ex-gridiron star, and now celibate ",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt suggests value for money despite focusing on spectacle elements. However, limited text makes full verdict assessment difficult. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive recommendation, highlighting Scarlett Johansson's performance and implying value for the ticket price. However, the mention of a bath towel as a scene-stealer introduces some reservation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review suggests the show is worth seeing, but the focus on individual elements and lack of a clear overall verdict indicates a recommendation with reservations. The single excerpt and truncated nature lower confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly guarantees entertainment value for the ticket price and praises a scene-stealing supporting performance, indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited available context.",
