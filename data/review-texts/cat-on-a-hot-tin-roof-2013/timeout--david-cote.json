  "bwwExcerpt": "The night may be unsatisfying, but it's not a total loss. Ciarán Hinds's Big Daddy offers some goatish fun; Debra Monk's Big Mama bustles and blubbers amusingly. And Emily Bergl's Mae (Maggie's sister-in-law and rival for Big Daddy's inheritance) is deliciously bitchy. Johansson could take a few pointers from Bergl on the fine art of purring",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Opens with explicit statement that the show is 'unsatisfying' but acknowledges some good performances. Praises supporting actors but implies the lead (Johansson) needs improvement. Single excerpt limits full assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, noting some enjoyable performances but an overall unsatisfying experience. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning suggest caution, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review states the night is \"unsatisfying\" but highlights some positive performances. This suggests a mixed experience, leaning slightly negative. | Kimi: While the critic judges the overall experience as 'unsatisfying,' they qualify this by noting it is 'not a total loss' and cite specific enjoyable performances from supporting cast members, suggesting a mixed rather than wholly negative assessment.",
