    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic finds the show 'compelling' but explicitly calls it 'flawed.' This balanced assessment with no clear recommendation places it in Mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'flawed but compelling,' indicating a mixed review. The mention of 'occasional staging touches' suggests some positive elements, but the overall tone is not strongly positive. | Gemini: The review calls the show \"flawed but compelling\", which indicates a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges flaws but uses 'compelling' to indicate the show is engaging and worth watching, placing it in the qualified-positive range. However, with only one excerpt available per the warning, confidence must remain low. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
