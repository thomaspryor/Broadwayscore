  "bwwExcerpt": ": It is meticulously cast and everyone shines. Nikki M. James as sweetly naive Nabalungi has a gorgeous voice. Andrew Rannells plays golden boy Elder Price with divine versatility; and as misfit Elder Cunningham, Josh Gad is truly blessed with outsize talent. Casey Nicholaw shares directing credit with Trey Parker. Along with Stone and Lopez, their \"Book of Mormon\" is an inspired collaboration made in theatre heaven.",
