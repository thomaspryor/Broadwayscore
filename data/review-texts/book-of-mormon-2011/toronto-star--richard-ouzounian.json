  "fullText": "Rema Webb, Andrew Rannells, and Josh Gad in The Book of Mormon.\n\nNEW YORK — When the most outrageous comedic minds writing today decide to unleash their energies in creating an irreverent Broadway musical to end all irreverent Broadway musicals, it’s very disappointing to have to ask one question.\n\nAnd, perhaps even more to the point, why isn’t it more outrageous?\n\nThe Book of Mormon, which opened on Thursday night at the Eugene O’Neill Theatre, is the long-awaited creation of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, best known as the brains behind South Park and Robert Lopez, one of the creators of Avenue Q.\n\nWith parents like that, you expect something that would cause shivers of outrage to run like seismic shocks throughout the cultural landscape.\n\nBut instead, we get a good-natured, jocular, look at religion that — with only a few exceptions — wouldn’t cause much indignation anywhere.\n\nA great deal of attention was devoted to the one of the show’s opening numbers, in which a duo of misguided Mormon missionaries in Africa learn to sing a scatological song about the great omniscient deity.\n\nYes, that number occurs and it’s pretty darn funny and certainly outrageous, but the truly distressing news is that it’s all downhill from there, both in terms of scandal and comedy.\n\nParker, Stone and Lopez seem to be so giddily self-congratualtory over the fact that they’re mocking religion in a musical that they seem to have missed the fact that their reputations were built on saying the unsayable and doing the undoable.\n\nThere is more edgy satire in any of the episodes of South Park about the Catholic Church or the Church of Scientology than you’ll find on stage in The Book of Mormon.\n\nThe kind of head-shaking “Did they really say that?” reaction that any good episode of their TV series provokes is sadly lacking.\n\nWhat’s left is a lot of Grade B, vaguely amateurish musical comedy antics, the kind of thing that director Casey Nicholaw is now making his stock in trade.\n\nIt worked in Spamalot, where the writing actually had more snap and verve and genuine outrage behind it. But here, it all starts to look like a campy collegiate revue making fun of black culture.\n\nThe Book of Mormon treats political revolution, female circumcision and other serious issues as the topics for cheap one-liners, neither offering searing social commentary nor boffo laughter.\n\nThe cast all work hard, but one starts to wonder what for. Josh Gad plays the Seth Rogen Mormon, while Andrew Rannells is the Bradley Cooper one. Rannells earns points for his unswerving intensity and clean-cut charm, but it’s all to little avail.\n\nThe bottom line is that the show we all hoped would set Broadway on its ear, simply pats it on its back, providing us with generic pastiche comedy and timidly tepid satire.\n\nO tempora, o mores! O Parker, o Stone! We expected so much more,\n\nRema Webb, Andrew Rannells, and Josh Gad in The Book of Mormon.",

Despite some praise for the cast's efforts, the overall tone is negative. | Gemini: The review expresses disappointment that the show isn't more outrageous, finding it to be a 'good-natured, jocular look at religion' that lacks the edgy satire of South Park. While acknowledging the cast's hard work, the reviewer ultimately finds the show to be a 'generic pastiche comedy and timidly tepid satire.' | Kimi: The critic expresses profound disappointment that the show fails to deliver the expected edgy satire, calling it 'tepid,' 'amateurish,' and 'generic' despite acknowledging the cast works hard. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Pan",
