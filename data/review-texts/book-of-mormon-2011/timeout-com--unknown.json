We knew that the show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone (South Park) and Robert Lopez (Avenue Q), could be counted on to bring the comedy. But nothing could prepare critics or audiences for the blasphemous hilarity and zestful vulgarity of The Book of Mormon. Two squeaky-clean missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are sent from Utah to proselytize in Uganda; set down in a beleaguered village terrorized by a local warlord and suffering from disease and other horrors, our Mormon boys find their work cut out for them. Parker, Stone and Lopez gleefully lampoon Mormonism as well as African stereotypes—and they do so in the framework of a traditional book musical that references a host of canonical musicals, from The Lion King to The King and I. Smart, vicious but surprisingly sweet at its center, The Book of Mormon is New York theater lovers’ heaven and one of the best Broadway shows.\n\nThe Book of Mormon is a musical comedy by Trey Parker, Robert Lopez and Matt Stone. It is directed by Trey Parker and Casey Nicholaw. It began previews on February 24, 2011, and opened on March 24, 2011. It is the winner of nine 2011 Tony Awards, including Best Musical.\n\nThe Book of Mormon plays at Broadway's Eugene O'Neill Theatre, located at 230 West 49th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue.\n\nThe Book of Mormon plays eight times a week, on the following schedule: Tuesdays through Thursdays at 7pm; Fridays at 8pm; Saturdays at 2pm and 8pm; and Sundays at 2pm and 7pm.\n\nTickets to The Book of Mormon are sold online. They can also be purchased by phone (877-250-2929) or in person at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre box office. Tickets cost $89–$172, and premium tickets cost $199–$299. A limited number of $32 tickets are sold via lottery; entries are accepted at the box office two and a half hours before each performances, and the drawing takes place two hours before curtain time. Standing-toom tickets cost $27 and are sold at the box office directly following the lottery drawing. If you're looking to buy last-minute Broadway tickets and don't want to risk losing the lottery, you can try your luck on the secondary or resale market.\n\nThe running time of The Book of Mormon is 2 hours and 35 minutes, with one intermission.\n\nThe cast of The Book of Mormon currently includes Nic Rouleau (Elder Price), Christopher John O'Neill (Elder Cunningham), Nikki Renée Daniels (Nabulungi), Grey Henson (Elder McKinley) and Daniel Breaker (Mafala Hatimbi).\n\nIf theater is your religion and the Broadway musical your sect, you've been woefully faith-challenged of late. Venturesome, boundary-pushing works such as Spring Awakening, Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson and Next to Normal closed too soon. American Idiot was shamefully ignored at the Tonys and will be gone in three weeks. Meanwhile, that airborne infection Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark dominates headlines and rakes in millions, without even opening. Celebrities and corporate brands sell poor material, innovation gets shown the door, and crap floats to the top. It's enough to turn you heretic, to sing along with The Book of Mormon's Ugandan villagers: \"Fuck you God in the ass, mouth and cunt-a, fuck you in the eye.\" Read the full review by David Cote\n\n• Josh Gad as Elder Cunningham • Andrew Rannells as Elder Price • Nikki M.
