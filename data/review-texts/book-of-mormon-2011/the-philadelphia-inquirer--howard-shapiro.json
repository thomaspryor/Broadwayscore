  "bwwExcerpt": "The show is a hoot - and a literal guilty pleasure. Parker and Stone have made their names by pushing the line between irreverence and offense until it stretches into a blur. It's impossible not to laugh at their two mismatched Mormon guys (played for maximum ingratiation by the wonderful Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells) as they run up against every cultural barrier they confront at a Ugandan village (where Nikki M. James and Michael Potts gamely play the main roles.)",
