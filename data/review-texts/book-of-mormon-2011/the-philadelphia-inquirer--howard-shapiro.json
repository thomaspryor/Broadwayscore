  "bwwExcerpt": "The show is a hoot - and a literal guilty pleasure. Parker and Stone have made their names by pushing the line between irreverence and offense until it stretches into a blur. It's impossible not to laugh at their two mismatched Mormon guys (played for maximum ingratiation by the wonderful Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells) as they run up against every cultural barrier they confront at a Ugandan village (where Nikki M. James and Michael Potts gamely play the main roles.)",

Single excerpt warning applied - using upper end of Positive range, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'a hoot' and a 'guilty pleasure,' indicating a strong positive reaction. The performances are praised, and the humor is highlighted as a key strength. Despite the limited excerpt, the tone suggests an enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language such as \"a hoot\" and \"guilty pleasure\" and praises the actors. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the language suggests a strong positive review. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as 'a hoot' and 'impossible not to laugh,' praising the 'wonderful' lead performances, indicating a clear recommendation despite the provocative humor.",
