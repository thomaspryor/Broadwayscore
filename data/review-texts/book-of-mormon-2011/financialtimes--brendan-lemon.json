  "bwwExcerpt": "Stretched to Broadway length, the duo's patented gags pall: in this surprisingly old-fashioned show, when we get to a trimmable production number called \"Spooky Mormon Hell Dream\", the comparisons to South Park reach their apogee, and not in favour of the stage musical. The audience devours all the antics. Casey Nicholaw, who co-directed with Parker and whose previous safe-for-your-teenage-son Broadway musical credit was Spamalot, keeps his actors, especially the terrifically game ensemble who play a chorus of young Mormon missionaries, in whirring motion.",

With only one curated excerpt available, scoring conservatively in middle of Mixed range. | GPT-4o: The review notes some negative aspects, such as the gags becoming stale and unfavorable comparisons to South Park. However, it also highlights the audience's positive reaction and the energetic performances, suggesting a mixed but somewhat engaging experience. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive and negative aspects. While the critic notes that some gags \"pall\" and the show is \"surprisingly old-fashioned\", they also acknowledge the audience's enjoyment and the energetic performance of the ensemble. The overall tone suggests a mixed experience, leaning towards slightly positive due to the audience reception and ensemble performance.",

Blame The Producers, the last Broadway musical to achieve such sustained and uproarious audience delight, for dispatching the idea of genuine shock: once you have laughed at the idea of a master race, the sights and sounds of a small village of northern Ugandans singing “F**k you, God” in nonsensical patois is unlikely to aggrieve. Especially when the presentation is so cosy and sweet.\n\nIt was on South Park, their long-running animated television show, and in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, their sublime screen musical, that Parker and Stone perfected the formula of sugar-coating the sour.
