However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive shift in perception, indicating the creators have found success on Broadway. Given the single excerpt and aggregator context, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with a middling score.",
