  "bwwExcerpt": "Like several shows this season, “Book of Mormon” is too long and comes close to wearing out its welcome before redeeming itself with a strong second act. And like most 12-year-old-boys, it isn’t nearly as nasty as it would have us believe. Not that there’s anything wrong with that.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic notes pacing issues in the first act but says the show 'redeems itself' with a strong second act, suggesting overall recommendation despite flaws. Single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges issues with the show's length but notes a redeeming second act. The tone is ambivalent, suggesting a mixed impression overall. | Gemini: The review notes the show is too long and almost wears out its welcome, but it is redeemed by a strong second act. The final comment, \"Not that there's anything wrong with that,\" suggests a mixed but ultimately acceptable experience. | Kimi: The critic notes significant flaws—the show is too long and nearly wears out its welcome—but ultimately praises the strong second act and delivers a gently approving verdict with the final defensive shrug. As a single excerpt, this represents a qualified positive recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
