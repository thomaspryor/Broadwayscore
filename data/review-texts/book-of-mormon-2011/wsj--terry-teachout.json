The lack of a full verdict and the single excerpt warning suggest a conservative score within the mixed range. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as \"slick and smutty,\" which suggests a generally positive, albeit potentially controversial, experience. Given the limited text, a score in the lower end of the positive range is appropriate.",
