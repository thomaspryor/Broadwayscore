  "fullText": "Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the naughty boys of \"South Park,\" have teamed up with Robert Lopez, one of the co-creators of \"Avenue Q,\" and the results of their collaboration are pretty much what you'd expect: slick and smutty. \"The Book of Mormon\" is the first musical to open on Broadway since \"La Cage aux Folles\" that has the smell of a send-in-the-tourists hit. Casey Nicholaw (\"The Drowsy Chaperone\") has staged the musical numbers with cheery energy, and the cast, especially Nikki M. James, is terrific. But don't let anybody try to tell you that \"The Book of Mormon\" is suitable for anyone other than 12-year-old boys who have yet to graduate from fart jokes to \"Glee.\" A couple of reasonably effective production numbers notwithstanding, it's flabby, amateurish and very, very safe.",
