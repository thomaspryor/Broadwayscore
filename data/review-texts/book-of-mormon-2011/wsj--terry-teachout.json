However, the lack of a complete verdict and the single excerpt warning reduce confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as \"slick and smutty,\" which suggests a positive but potentially controversial experience. Given the limited excerpt, a score in the lower end of the positive range is appropriate. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers qualified praise ('slick') tempered by content description ('smutty'), suggesting the show meets expectations without exceeding them. Truncated text and single-quote limitation warrant low confidence and lower-end Positive score per guidelines.",
