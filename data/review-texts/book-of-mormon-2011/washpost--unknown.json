    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt uses ecstatic language ('premier-class cabin of delirium') and directly tells readers they've 'wisely secured' tickets, indicating strong enthusiasm. However, confidence is low due to single cherry-picked quote warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is highly enthusiastic, suggesting a must-see experience. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The quote is very positive, suggesting a highly enjoyable and worthwhile experience. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise and a clear recommendation to see the show, describing it as a 'premier-class' theatrical experience. As a single curated quote, the full context is unknown, warranting a high-end Positive score rather than a Rave. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
