  "bwwExcerpt": "Stretched to Broadway length, the duo's patented gags pall: in this surprisingly old-fashioned show, when we get to a trimmable production number called \"Spooky Mormon Hell Dream\", the comparisons to South Park reach their apogee, and not in favour of the stage musical. The audience devours all the antics. Casey Nicholaw, who co-directed with Parker and whose previous safe-for-your-teenage-son Broadway musical credit was Spamalot, keeps his actors, especially the terrifically game ensemble who play a chorus of young Mormon missionaries, in whirring motion.",
