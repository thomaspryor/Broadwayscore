    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it a 'brilliant show' with 'wonderful zest' and expressing hope for more work from the creators. Single excerpt warning means this could be cherry-picked, but the language is clearly enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses strong enthusiasm for the performances and the show as a whole, using words like 'wonderful zest' and 'brilliant show'. The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses strong positive sentiment, calling the show 'brilliant' and praising the performances. The request for another musical from the creators suggests high satisfaction. | Kimi: The critic uses strong praise ('brilliant show', 'wonderful zest') and expresses enthusiasm for the creators' work, indicating a clear recommendation despite limited excerpt availability.",
