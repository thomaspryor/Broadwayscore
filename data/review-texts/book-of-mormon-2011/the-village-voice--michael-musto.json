    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Positive language describing the show as managing a 'high-wire feat' and noting 'virtually everyone leaves happy.' However, this is only a single curated excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's ability to handle controversial topics with humor and notes that 'virtually everyone leaves happy,' indicating a strong positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as successfully spoofing sensitive topics and leaving audiences happy, indicating a positive recommendation. Given it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production's ability to successfully navigate difficult satirical material while maintaining audience satisfaction, indicating a clear recommendation. However, confidence is low given only one curated excerpt is available.",
