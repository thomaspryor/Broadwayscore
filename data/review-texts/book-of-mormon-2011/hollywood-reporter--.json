However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning necessitate a conservative score within the positive range. | Gemini: The phrase \"comedy faithful flocking\" suggests a positive but potentially niche appeal, indicating a recommendation with reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, a score in the middle of the positive range is appropriate.",
