However, confidence is medium due to limited text availability. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('new gold standard', 'march into legend') suggesting a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language such as \"gold standard\" and \"on its march into legend,\" indicating a positive review. However, due to the limited text available, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt employs extreme superlatives ('gold standard,' 'march into legend') and promises iconic status, indicating an unqualified rave despite the limited text available.",
