  "bwwExcerpt": "Told the creators of \"South Park\" were making a Broadway musical, you'd naturally expect a broad, foul-mouthed, juvenile, scatological, irreverent satire. Sure enough, \"The Book of Mormon,\" which opened last night, is all that - and much, much more. It's a fiendishly well-crafted, hilariously smart - or maybe smartly hilarious - song-and-dance extravaganza. The show's a hoot. The show's a hit. Charles McNulty, The LA Times: But for all its irreverence - and there's enough off-color insouciance to offend church ladies of every denomination - \"The Book of Mormon\" has the old-fashioned musical comedy heart of adults who spent much of their adolescence lip-syncing to original cast albums in their finished basements. Roma Torre, NY 1: It is meticulously cast and everyone shines. Nikki M. James as sweetly naive Nabalungi has a gorgeous voice. Andrew Rannells plays golden boy Elder Price with divine versatility; and as misfit Elder Cunningham, Josh Gad is truly blessed with outsize talent. Casey Nicholaw shares directing credit with Trey Parker. Along with Stone and Lopez, their \"Book of Mormon\" is an inspired collaboration made in theatre heaven.",
