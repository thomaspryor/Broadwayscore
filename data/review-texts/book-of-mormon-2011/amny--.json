The lack of protest from the Mormon faith is mentioned humorously, implying the show's success in handling its subject matter. The single excerpt warning suggests scoring conservatively within the bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the musical as \"tuneful, unabashedly silly and absolutely uproarious,\" which suggests a positive experience. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range.",
