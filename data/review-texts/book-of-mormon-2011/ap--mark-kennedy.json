  "fullText": "\"The Book of Mormon,\" which opened Thursday at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre, is inventive and slick and subversive. It is funnier and smarter than \"Monty Python's Spamalot,\" managing to offend, provoke laughter, trigger eye-rolling, satirize conventions and warm hearts, all at the same time.",
