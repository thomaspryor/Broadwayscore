  "fullText": "ARTSASU GammageAdd TopicReview: 'Book of Mormon' is gloriously juvenile, surprisingly sincereKerry LengelThe Republic | azcentral.comUpdated Oct. 22, 2015, 6:11 p.m. ETPacked with F-bombs, blatant blasphemy and enough potty humor to make a 13-year-old boy hyperventilate, Broadway’s “The Book of Mormon” is every bit as outrageous as its reputation.\n\nUnderneath all that, however, it is also surprisingly sweet, and it's even one of the most traditional musicals to hit it big in recent memory.\n\nIt is, in short, a five-star knockout, and it has finally come to Tempe’s ASU Gammage, three years after the national tour launched and after pretty much every other market in the country has seen it (sometimes twice). Heck, the show even went first to Salt Lake City, home base of the religion that it mercilessly — and lovingly — lampoons.\n\n'Mormon' star Alexandra Ncube is from Tempe\n\nThe 2011 Tony Award winner for best musical, “The Book of Mormon” was created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the dirty minds behind TV’s “South Park,” along with “Avenue Q” and “Frozen” songwriter Robert Lopez. It tells the story of two young missionaries sent from Utah to Uganda, only to find that the locals are too worried about poverty, violence and disease to listen to teenage boys preaching about “Another Testament of Jesus Christ.”\n\nThe putative hero of the story is Elder Price, a gung-ho alpha Mormon who’s certain he’s destined for greatness. His assigned companion, Elder Cunningham, on the other hand, is a needy nerd who knows more about “Star Wars” and “The Lord of the Rings” than the gospel he is preaching. (“So the Bible is actually a trilogy, and the Book of Mormon is ‘Return of the Jedi’,” he enthuses during “All American Prophet.”)\n\nOn Broadway, these roles were originated, respectively, by Andrew Rannells and Josh Gad, both of whom have moved on to more star turns on stage and screen. Yet their current stand-ins on the first national tour, Billy Harrigan Tighe and A.J. Holmes, don’t merely do justice to the characters, they make them their own.\n\nTighe preens hilariously in his dance numbers and displays a soaring tenor on numbers such as “I Believe.” And Holmes, looking a bit like Jimmy Fallon’s awkward kid brother, has mastered the art of playing a lovable loser. (He sings less but has pipes to match his co-star as well.)\n\nThe excellent cast also features Arizona State University alumna Alexandra Ncube as the leading lady, a sweetly naïve villager named Nabulungi. She is as winsomely sincere singing a wistful ode to the paradise known as “Sal Tlay Ka Siti” as you could ask, earning much-deserved hometown cheers from the audience.\n\nDespite the R-rated content, “Book of Mormon” is not as unlikely a hit as might first seem to be the case. Parker and Stone had plenty of practice parodying show tunes on “South Park,” and here they rise above mere parody. Yes, there are jokey nods to “The Lion King” and “Annie,” but this show’s eminently hummable tunes stand on their own, especially the first-act showstopper “Turn It Off,” which features a tap-dance break worthy of “42nd Street.”\n\nThe production values are great, but this show doesn’t rely on elaborate spectacle to keep eyeballs glued to the stage. Instead, it uses expert storytelling, deftly doling out information, particularly about the Mormon faith, that the audience needs to understand the jokes. (No, not every detail is accurate, but if you don’t know anything about church doctrine, this musical definitely qualifies as a crash course.)\n\nNew York Times critic Ben Brantley declared “The Book of Mormon” to be the best musical of the century. That, of course, was when the century was only 10 years old. Now, it already has competition from acclaimed hits such as “Hamilton.” But even if it doesn’t hold its title as the best musical in a hundred years, it will probably be remembered as the funniest.\n\nThe laughs roll nonstop, from the manic fantasia of “Spooky Mormon Hell Dream” to the Up With People-esque “We Are Africa,” sung, of course, by a bevy of very White boys. Yet there is also a heart-felt message to this story, which is that even if religion — any religion — doesn’t always stand up to logical scrutiny, it can still be a force for good in people’s lives, and in the world.\n\nThere are many, of course, who will find this kind of irreverence and shock value to be disrespectful and even hateful. But for those who sympathize with the show’s unexpectedly tender humanism, “The Book of Mormon” just may be, well, a religious experience.\n\nReach the reporter at kerry.lengel@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.

  "bwwExcerpt": "This buoyancy is enhanced by a game young cast, under Parker and Casey Nicholaw's sprightly direction. Andrew Rannells is picture-perfect as the square, hyper-ambitious Elder Price, whose frustrated wish to transfer to Disney/boy-band capitol Orlando is a running joke. As Cunningham, Price's portly, socially inept partner and foil, Josh Gad overdoes the sloppy-sidekick shtick a bit, but not so much that he doesn't make us laugh and, eventually, cheer his progress. In fact, regardless of your spiritual inclinations - or lack thereof - you're likely to leave The Book of Mormon a little happier for the experience. Seriously.",
