'The Book of Mormon' is the funniest religious spoof since Monty Python and the Holy Grail...A creative watershed in Broadway history...Directors Casey Nicholaw and Trey Parker make all the action, songs, and the actors’ fluid repartee blend together into a harmonious, uproarious evening of theater that, for many, will make one an instant convert to the genius of 'The Book of Mormon.'\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, this contains extremely strong superlatives ('watershed in Broadway history', 'genius', 'harmonious, uproarious') with unqualified praise and religious metaphor of conversion to the show's brilliance. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong superlatives ('funniest', 'creative watershed') and praises the direction and overall experience, suggesting a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using superlatives like \"funniest\" and \"creative watershed.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the high end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives ('creative watershed in Broadway history', 'genius', 'uproarious') and explicit enthusiasm ('Hallelujah!'), indicating a rave review. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt limitation.",
