The score, although snappy and humorous, isn’t exactly filled with memorable showstoppers, although every number lands. We can safely say, that with the astonishing 'The Book of Mormon' Broadway will never be quite the same again!\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('wild, outrageous ride', 'exuberant and amusing', 'astonishing') with exclamation point finale declaring the show transformative for Broadway. Despite noting the score isn't filled with 'showstoppers', the critic says 'every number lands' and uses superlatives throughout. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the choreography and humor, and concludes with a strong positive statement about the show's impact on Broadway. Despite noting the score's lack of memorable showstoppers, the overall tone is enthusiastic. | Gemini: The review describes the show as a \"wild, outrageous ride\" and praises the choreography. While noting the score isn't filled with memorable showstoppers, it says \"every number lands,\" indicating a positive overall experience. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the single excerpt notes a reservation about the score lacking memorable showstoppers, the overall tone is exuberant ('wild, outrageous ride', 'exuberant and amusing') and the final verdict is strongly endorsing. Per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, this falls in the upper Positive range.",
