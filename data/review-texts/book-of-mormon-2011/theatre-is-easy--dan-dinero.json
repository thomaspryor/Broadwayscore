  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Somehow both jaw droppingly ill-mannered and adorably innocent, not to mention one of the best new musicals in recent memory...While 'The Book of Mormon' is foul-mouthed, offensive, blasphemous, and incredibly rude, it is also one of the sweetest, most innocently hopeful musicals I have seen in a long time. And the fact that it manages to be both is a key factor in its success.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, the critic uses superlative language ('one of the best new musicals in recent memory') and frames apparent negatives (foul-mouthed, offensive) as positives that contribute to success. The tone is clearly enthusiastic praise warranting Rave bucket, though single-excerpt limitation prevents highest confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'one of the best new musicals in recent memory' and highlights its dual nature as both offensive and sweet, suggesting a strong positive impression. The curated excerpt implies a rave review. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, calling it \"one of the best new musicals in recent memory\" and highlighting its unique blend of offensiveness and sweetness as a key factor in its success. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: Single curated excerpt contains superlative praise calling the show one of the best new musicals in recent memory and one of the sweetest, most hopeful in a long time, warranting upper Positive range per single-excerpt guidelines. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
