  "bwwExcerpt": "the sharp-edged book and fun score by Parker, Stone, and Lopez offer a screamingly funny yet sharply insightful full-length take on religion in general and Mormonism in particular. There are also pointed but loving tributes to musical comedy conventions, shockingly vulgar humor, and that rarity on Broadway these days: topical and effective satire.",

However, with only one curated excerpt available, I score conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the show for its humor, insight, and effective satire, indicating a strong positive reaction. The use of 'screamingly funny' and 'sharply insightful' suggests a high level of enthusiasm, though the single excerpt warning suggests a conservative score within the Rave range. | Gemini: The review highlights the show's humor and insightful commentary, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range.",
