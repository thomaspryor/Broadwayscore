    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Unqualified enthusiasm with 'fantastic show' and 'ecstatic' language indicates a rave, but single excerpt warning and limited text prevents higher confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt contains strong positive language ('fantastic show', 'ecstatic to have you'), indicating a highly favorable review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, calling the show 'fantastic' and welcoming the creators to Broadway. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains enthusiastic praise ('fantastic', 'ecstatic'), warranting upper Positive range per instructions for clearly positive isolated quotes, though limited context keeps confidence low. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
