  "dtliExcerpt": "If any show could make the case that you can have fun with absolutely anything in the oft-painful run of human experience — AIDS, genocide, genital mutilation, poverty, religion, “The Lion King” — then that show is “The Book of Mormon,” the shrewd, remarkably well-crafted and wholly hilarious new Broadway musical from the creators of “South Park” and the composer of “Avenue Q.”",

Despite the single excerpt warning, the language used suggests a high level of enthusiasm. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as \"shrewd, remarkably well-crafted and wholly hilarious\", suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range.",
