    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic calls it 'a must' for essentially everyone ('South Park' fans as well as the rest of mankind), which is strong universal recommendation language typical of a rave review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses 'a must' which indicates a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The phrase \"a must\" indicates a strong positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single available excerpt delivers an enthusiastic universal recommendation ('a must'), but the limited context of one curated quote warrants conservative placement in the upper Positive range rather than Rave. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
