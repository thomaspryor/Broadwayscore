    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, the language is unmistakably enthusiastic - 'delivers even more than promised', 'uproarious', 'felicitous'. This indicates a rave review that exceeded high expectations. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as exceeding high expectations and being 'uproarious' and 'spiritually up-tempo', indicating a highly positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"delivers even more than its ridiculously felicitous advance buzz promised\" and \"often uproarious, spiritually up-tempo satire\". Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic praises the show as exceeding its 'ridiculously felicitous' advance buzz, calling it 'often uproarious' and a successful satire, though as a single truncated excerpt, the full verdict scope is uncertain. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
