    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt acknowledges potential offense but emphasizes the show's authentic musical theater heart and nostalgic appeal. However, with only one curated excerpt available, the full verdict is unclear - this could be from a more positive or mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as having an 'old-fashioned musical comedy heart,' suggesting a positive view despite its irreverence. The tone implies a strong recommendation, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt limitation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's irreverence but ultimately suggests it has a classic musical comedy heart, implying a positive experience. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt validates the show's musical comedy credentials while acknowledging its edgy humor, indicating appreciation. However, as a single curated excerpt, it may not capture the full scope of the critic's verdict.",
