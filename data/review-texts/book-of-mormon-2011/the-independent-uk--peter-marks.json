    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show's provocative humor but finds it has 'a suspiciously tender core,' suggesting appreciation for deeper qualities. However, this is only one excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the show's popularity and suggests a deeper, positive element beneath its humor. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests that despite potentially offensive jokes, the show has a \"tender core\" and is popular, implying a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the show's unexpected emotional depth beneath its crude comedy, suggesting a positive verdict. However, with only a single curated quote available, confidence must remain low regarding the full review's sentiment.",
