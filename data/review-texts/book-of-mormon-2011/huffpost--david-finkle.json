However, confidence is low due to limited text - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show with terms like 'uproarious' and 'highly entertaining', suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language like \"uproarious\" and \"highly entertaining\", suggesting a positive recommendation. Given it's the only excerpt, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains enthusiastic praise ('uproarious', 'highly entertaining', 'rousing') for the show's writing and musical numbers, warranting a high-positive score, though limited context requires low confidence.",
