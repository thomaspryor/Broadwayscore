  "dtliExcerpt": "If the sound of doorbells has ever provoked bigger guffaws in the theater, there must be some forgotten comedy gem about Avon ladies. But it’s hard to imagine anyone topping the ding-dong hilarity set off by the missionaries-in-training of “The Book of Mormon,” which had its Broadway opening Thursday at the Eugene O’Neill Theatre.",

The phrase 'hard to imagine anyone topping' indicates a high level of praise. Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone is clearly enthusiastic. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights the hilarity of the show, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt and aggregator context, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with a score in the middle range.",
