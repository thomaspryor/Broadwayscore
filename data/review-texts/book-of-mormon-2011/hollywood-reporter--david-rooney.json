Gad (a correspondent on The Daily Show With Jon Stewart) may be giving the single funniest, most endearing performance on Broadway. But Rannells is not far behind, his character's righteousness at war with his inflated ego.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Critic calls it 'brilliant' and 'ridiculously entertaining' - clear positive recommendation. The 'raunchy, offensive' descriptors are content warnings, not criticisms of quality. Medium confidence due to excerpt-only format. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt uses strong positive language ('brilliant', 'ridiculously entertaining') indicating a highly favorable opinion. However, due to the text quality warning and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the word \"brilliant\" and describes the show as \"ridiculously entertaining\", which indicates a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs unambiguous superlatives ('brilliant', 'ridiculously entertaining') indicating an enthusiastic recommendation typical of a rave review. While the excerpt nature limits certainty, the evaluative language is strongly positive. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
