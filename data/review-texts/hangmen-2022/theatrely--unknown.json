  "bwwExcerpt": "Fleischle's set, stunningly lit with bisexual lighting by Joshua Carr, screams money - the turn from prologue to pub is mesmerizing - but not distractingly or crassly so. Under Matthew Dunster's attentive direction, McDonagh's play unfolds with the breezy, engaging tension of the mod rock guitars that punctuate scenes (sound design by Ian Dickinson for Autograph). Hangmen is the kind of play we don't really see anymore. There's no immediate hook for our present day situation; it doesn't bend over backwards to make itself relevant. But it's a welcome callback to the plays that built contemporary theatre: sturdy, well-observed, and vividly performed.",
