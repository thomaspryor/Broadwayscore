  "bwwExcerpt": "'Hangmen' also contains some hanging plot threads that are not truly resolved or adequately explained. There may be a theme here about miscarriage of justice and toxic masculinity, but don't strain your neck too hard looking for it. A looser directorial hand would have made these nitpicks moot, because if there's a commitment to the ridiculous, a coherent story is less important. As it is, 'Hangmen' thoroughly wrings its premise dry, but anyone trying to find deeper meaning in McDonagh's play will be left hanging.",
