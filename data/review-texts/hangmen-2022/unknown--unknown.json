  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Four years later, the world feels coarser — perhaps it always does — and not just because death has become much more visible in streets and wards and wars. So has people’s indifference to it, and to all kinds of suffering and unfairness. McDonagh’s cynicism feels closer to our own, or rather we to it. 'Hangmen' now plays less like a clever exercise and more like news, with an unnerving headline.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt suggests the production has gained relevance and impact since its original run, with the critic finding it more compelling ('plays less like a clever exercise and more like news'). However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the play resonates with contemporary issues, implying relevance and engagement. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context necessitate a cautious approach, placing it at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review suggests the play resonates more now than before, implying a positive, albeit reserved, recommendation. Given the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic praises the play's heightened resonance and impact, noting it has transcended being merely clever to become urgently relevant, though this single excerpt limits certainty about the full verdict.",
