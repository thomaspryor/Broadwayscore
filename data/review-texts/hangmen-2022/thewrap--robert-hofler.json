  "fullText": "The one thing you can count on with a Martin McDonagh play or movie is that there will be no time to relax and settle in before the real story begins. McDonagh grabs our attention not only in the first scene but early in the first scene. In his 2017 movie “Three Billboards in Ebbing, Missouri,” a distraught mother rents roadside advertisements to protest the unsolved murder and rape of her daughter.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "In the Atlantic Theater production, some of the pub's hangers-on were played too broadly. A few of them seemed left over from McDonagh's 'Leenane' trilogy. That's not the case on Broadway. Owen Campbell, Jeremy Crutchley, Josh Goulding, Richard Hollis, John Horton and Ryan Pope complete the near-perfect ensemble under Dunster's direction. 'Hangmen' is this Broadway season's best play.",
