  "bwwExcerpt": "Though Rogers' voice isn't strong, her singing has a raw ache and folky authenticity. She also moves like a gazelle, reinforcing Eva's beguiling sensuality and adding further sparkle to Ashford's earthy, vibrant dance numbers. The narrator, Che, isn't presented as the flamboyant revolutionary (based on Che Guevera) he became under Harold Prince's original direction. A charming Ricky Martin plays the character more as an amused, sometimes sympathetic spectator; though critical of Eva, as Rice's lyrics demand, he also conveys a certain tenderness.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: This appears to be a truncated excerpt. The phrase 'passionate, if not always polished' suggests mixed evaluation - acknowledging positives (star wattage, passion) while noting flaws (not polished). Without the full review's verdict, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The review highlights Ricky Martin's star power and passion but notes a lack of polish, suggesting a mixed impression without a clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges Martin's star power and passion, but also notes that his performance isn't always polished, suggesting a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges Martin's 'star wattage' and passion but qualifies the praise with 'if not always polished,' indicating a qualified recommendation in the lower Positive range. The excerpt's brevity necessitates low confidence. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
