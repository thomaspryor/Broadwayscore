  "fullText": "The first Evita, Patti LuPone, was a force of nature. The latest Evita is a pretty cipher.\n\nThat assessment is not a slam on Solea Pfeiffer’s sly incarnation of Eva Perón. She wears the role with high-fashion hauteur in the new, insightful revival of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Evita,” which opened Thursday at the New York City Center and continues through November 24.",
