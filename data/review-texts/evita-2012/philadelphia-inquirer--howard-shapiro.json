  "bwwExcerpt": "The 1979 Broadway debut of “Evita” catapulted the careers of Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin, and the 1996 movie version gave pop singer Madonna a boost in respect. I’m not sure this revival will do much for anyone, except for the people who would come see Ricky Martin whether he were performing in “Evita” or a one-man concert. Come to think of it, for them he may be performing in what essentially turns out to be both.",
