  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Michael Grandage scores with a dynamic new 'Evita,' graced by an impressive performance from Argentinean actress Elena Roger and the ticket-selling presence of recording star Ricky Martin, who acquits himself nicely if not remarkably. The 1979 Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice poperetta comes off fairly well in its first Broadway revival, thanks to a director who doesn't seem crimped or intimidated by Hal Prince's striking original staging. That said, the flaws inherent in the material -- typified by grasping-at-straws rhymes like 'That's what they call me/so Lauren Bacall me' -- remain. Look for boffo biz so long as Martin chooses to stay.",
