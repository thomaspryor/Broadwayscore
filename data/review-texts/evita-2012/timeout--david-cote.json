The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the production's polish and professionalism but delivers a significant criticism regarding its lack of emotional resonance ('mostly soulless'), resulting in a mixed assessment that aligns with the 60/100 rating.",
