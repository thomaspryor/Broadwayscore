  "bwwExcerpt": "Much of the buzz coming from the new revival 'Evita' has been about the spitfire Argentine playing the title role. But all of the heat actually comes from the guy shaking his bon-bon. Ricky Martin is easily the best thing about this revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's bio of Eva Peron, which opened Thursday at the Marquis Theatre. He sings beautifully, dances gracefully, athletically climbs ladders, plays his role with a knowing sneer and elicits drools in his suspenders and tight white shirt. He even makes a mustache work. In fact, maybe it's time for Broadway to have a new rule: Put Ricky Martin in everything. He would fit in happily at 'Newsies.' He would definitely enliven 'Death of a Salesman.' Heck, put him in 'Mary Poppins' and watch the roof really lift off.",
