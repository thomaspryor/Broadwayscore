However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses negative imagery (\"gilded mummy\") and suggests the show lacks warmth. While truncated, the excerpt leans negative. | Kimi: The excerpt praises Michael Cerveris as 'sterling' and suggests the signature song remains effective, but offers a damning critique of the overall production as lifeless. With only one truncated excerpt available, the full verdict remains unclear.",
