  "bwwExcerpt": "Neil Simon's Plaza Suite is back on Broadway, and the title character looks great. When the curtain goes up, the set gets entrance applause; designed by John Lee Beatty, that master of envy-inducing decor, it has a golden glow of classic luxury. Simon's hit 1968 trilogy of short comedies, about three different couples in Room 719 of the ritzy Manhattan hotel, is perhaps less timeless in its appeal. Its main characters are mostly middle-aged, and so is the writing; it is now over 50, and its comic cheek is showing some laugh lines. But the vestiges of laughs are nice wrinkles, as wrinkles go, and while this production doesn't leave you rolling in the aisles, it is likely to at least leave you smiling.",

The critic's own 60 rating confirms this as mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the appeal of the lead performances but notes that the material is not consistently strong. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the charm of the leads but notes the material doesn't always match their level, indicating a mixed experience. The 60 rating aligns with the mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60/100 rating falls in the Mixed range, and the text reflects this balance: acknowledging the charm of the lead performances while criticizing the material as inferior to the actors.",
