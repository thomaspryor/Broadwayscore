  "bwwExcerpt": "Co-starring Parker's husband Matthew Broderick, the 1960s-set comedy is an old-fashioned affair to be sure, but a sparkling one. 'Sex and the City' fans will certainly enjoy it more than HBO's weirdly woke and clunky 'And Just Like That.' And, for everybody else, Simon's middle-drawer play is a relaxing vacation from our overly serious theater season.",
