Rather, it seems to hope we will look forgivingly enough on our benighted past to excuse it with a 'that’s how things were' shrug and laugh.\"\n\nRead more",

However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict may be more nuanced. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt expresses significant criticism of the production, suggesting it is outdated and not effectively revived, despite the efforts of the cast. The tone is negative, with no clear recommendation to see the show. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the play is dated and not particularly enjoyable, despite the cast's efforts. The overall tone is negative, indicating a lack of recommendation. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the cast is 'likable' but finds the material 'uninhabitable' and the efforts 'wearying,' clearly advising against seeing this outdated production despite the star power.",
