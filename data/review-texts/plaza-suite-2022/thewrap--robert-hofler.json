  "bwwExcerpt": "On stage now, Parker is as hard-working as Broderick is relaxed. She's always engaging because she's always coming up with some novel bit of business or an unusual line reading to keep us distracted from the fact that what she's doing and what she's saying is often not very inspired on the part of Simon. Congrats are in order here for Parker's director, John Benjamin Hickey.",
