  "bwwExcerpt": "If anyone was going to make his 1968 Plaza Suite a hit in 2022, it's Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick. Two longtime Broadway darlings, they are as 'classic New York' a couple as they come. To say their name is to invoke visions of champagne-washed elegance, of well-heeled strolls through the city's tony avenues, of effortless bliss. And yet not even SJP's incandescent star power can brush off the dust settled on this three-act look at marriage in the late '60s. Unadorned by John Benjamin Hickey's straightforward direction, the highly anticipated, pandemic-delayed production does only improve as it goes on, so long as you make it past its dreadful first act.",
