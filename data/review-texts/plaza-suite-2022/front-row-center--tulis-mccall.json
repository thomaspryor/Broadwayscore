This production directs our attention to what was: the depressing, the embarrassing and the dumb-ass of the late 1960s. This production also reminds us of what still is. People are still clinging to empty marriages; people are still making unwise sexual choice; terrified twenty years-olds (and older) are still getting married. Simon lays it out like a buffet.\"\n\nRead more",
