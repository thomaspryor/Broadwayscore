  "bwwExcerpt": "In the midst of domestic political tensions, overseas conflict, the pandemic, and emotionally-charged cultural debates, 'Plaza Suite' offers sitcom comedy, sharp one-liners, sentimental and nostalgic touches, straightforward direction (by actor John Benjamin Hickey), and performances by two familiar stage and screen stars. It's the equivalent of feel-good comfort food, like grandma's chicken noodle soup - at least until it becomes clear that the production is not as good as it ought to be.",
