  "bwwExcerpt": "So thank goodness for Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick - the two contemporary stars perhaps most apt for an exercise in squareness. To call their work in the new Broadway revival of 'Plaza Suite' at the Hudson Theatre 'diligent' is to suggest a leaden night out. But the real-life married couple bring a serious commitment to the spirit of the work, allowing their own personas to throw some metatextual sparks without overtaking the spirit of Simon. As directed by John Benjamin Hickey, Parker and Broderick provoke, alienate and woo one another, and provide a strong argument for a playwright whose work seems next-to-impossible to subvert.",

They almost entirely resist looking at 'Plaza Suite' through a 2022 lens.\"\n\nRead more",
