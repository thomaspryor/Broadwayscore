  "bwwExcerpt": "One might question whether the grim inevitability of such a punitive ending was necessary, and whether the play might have gained complexity without diluting its message by subverting audience expectations with a different, less predictable outcome. But this is tense theater designed to shake up our complacency and make us think. In that aim, it succeeds.",

Single excerpt warning applied - this sounds like qualified praise from a larger review. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges potential issues with the play's ending but ultimately praises its ability to engage and provoke thought. The excerpt suggests a positive recommendation despite reservations, but due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review questions some aspects of the ending but ultimately concludes that the play succeeds in its aim, indicating a positive, though not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic questions whether the grim ending was necessary, they ultimately affirm that the play succeeds in its goal to shake up complacency and provoke thought.",
