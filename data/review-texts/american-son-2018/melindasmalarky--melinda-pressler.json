There are many subtle & overt racist comments spewed from all parties that strike like a lightning rod...When the facts are read to Kendra & Scott by Lt. Stokes the pain is piercing yet it leaves lingering doubts as to the culpability of the officer involved. The play is stirring drama with a superb cast.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Final verdict clearly positive with 'stirring drama' and 'superb cast' praise, but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness of full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the play's potent social message and strong cast, indicating a positive review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"potent social message\", \"strong messages driven home\", \"stirring drama\", and \"superb cast\", indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production's social impact and quality, describing it as 'stirring drama' with a 'superb cast' and 'potent social message.' However, confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt, which may not represent the full review.",
