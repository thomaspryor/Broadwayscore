  "showScoreExcerpt": "“’American Son’, a gripping new play...is piercingly of the moment, thunderously bleak, written in all caps, and indulgently depressing. Washington gives a devastating performance...but blunt writing provides shorthanded dialogue and characterizations that are unrealistic and convenient—tooled for the sake of advancing arguments, and provoking the audience, rather effectively serving a coherent social or political mission.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Praises Washington's performance as 'devastating' and calls the play 'gripping' and 'of the moment,' but criticizes the writing as 'blunt,' 'unrealistic and convenient.' Single excerpt with clear mixed signals - positive elements balanced by significant structural criticisms. | GPT-4o: The review praises Washington's performance but criticizes the writing as blunt and unrealistic. The excerpt suggests a mixed reception, with strong elements countered by significant flaws. | Gemini: The review praises Washington's performance but criticizes the writing as unrealistic and convenient. Given the limited text, it's hard to determine the overall recommendation, but it leans towards mixed. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the lead performance and timely subject matter but delivers substantial criticism of the writing as blunt, unrealistic, and more interested in provoking than coherent storytelling, resulting in an ambivalent assessment.",
