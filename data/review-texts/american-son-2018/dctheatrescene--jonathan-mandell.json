    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges the drama's timeliness and praises Washington's performance, but identifies major structural problems (filler moments, forced scenes, implausible confrontations) and unfavorably compares it to other recent works on similar themes. The overall assessment is balanced but leans slightly negative due to the significant criticisms. | GPT-4o: The review highlights flaws in the drama, describing it as having filler and forced moments, and being less effective than other similar stories. While Kerry Washington's performance is praised, the overall tone suggests a negative view of the play's execution. | Gemini: The review praises Kerry Washington's performance but also points out flaws in the drama, such as filler moments and implausible confrontations. The critic also mentions seeing other stories that cover similar ground more effectively, leading to a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt praises Kerry Washington’s performance and the timeliness but heavily criticizes the play for filler, forced moments, and implausible plotting, while noting superior similar works exist. With only one curated excerpt available, the overall sentiment appears mixed.",
