  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The action takes place in real time. The tension steadily builds until the sudden shattering climax. It’s a play that grabs your attention and never lets go. What it lacks in artistry and subtlety, it makes up for in audience involvement. The choice of a story about a mixed-race son may add dimension to the plot, but the distinction between mixed-race and black is not significant to the police. The acting is uniformly strong...The direction by Kenny Leon is brisk.\" \n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning requires caution - this sounds mildly positive with reservations, placing it in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong audience engagement and effective direction, despite noting a lack of artistry and subtlety. The overall tone suggests a positive recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review states the play grabs your attention and never lets go, and that the acting is uniformly strong. The reviewer also notes that the direction is brisk, which indicates a positive experience despite some reservations about artistry and subtlety. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the tension, acting, and direction, acknowledging that the play compensates for its lack of artistry with strong audience involvement.",
