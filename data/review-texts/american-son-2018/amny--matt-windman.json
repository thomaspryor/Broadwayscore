    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The phrase 'At its best' suggests qualified praise, but calling it 'smart, mysterious and engrossing' with praise for Washington's 'revealing, sympathetic performance' indicates a positive recommendation. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the tone is clearly positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'smart, mysterious and engrossing' and highlights Washington's performance as 'revealing' and 'sympathetic'. The positive language suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights positive aspects such as being 'smart, mysterious and engrossing' and praises Washington's performance, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise ('At its best') describing the show as 'engrossing' with a strong lead performance, suggesting a positive but not unreserved recommendation. Scored conservatively within the Positive range due to the qualification and single-excerpt limitation.",
