It might make some people uncomfortable, but if you are a theater lover, you should put this down as a must-see show.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite noting the proceedings 'may not feel all that new,' the critic delivers a clear recommendation calling it 'must-see' with praise for 'exceptional performances' and 'sterling performances.' The strong endorsement outweighs the mild reservation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and recommends the show as a 'must-see' for theater lovers, indicating a strong positive verdict. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights exceptional performances and recommends it as a 'must-see' for theater lovers. Given the single excerpt and 'must-see' language, I'm scoring it in the upper end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the 'exceptional' and 'sterling' performances and explicitly recommends the show as a 'must-see,' though with slight reservations about the material feeling familiar.",
