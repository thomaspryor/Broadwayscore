  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Washington gives a totally riveting performance in Christopher Demos-Brown’s taut, intermission-less play that intensely builds toward its climax in real-time. It is sternly trying to depict a recurring problem in America, but spins the tale via dramatic portraits and confrontations rather than by sermonizing. Under Kenny Leon’s sizzling direction, this is an unrelieved, high-tension drama with a stalwart cast that never falters.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance ('totally riveting'), direction ('sizzling'), and overall production ('stalwart cast that never falters'). Language suggests strong recommendation despite single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Washington's performance as 'totally riveting' and describes the play as 'taut' and 'high-tension', indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is highly positive, praising the performance, play, and direction. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring at the higher end of the 'Positive' bucket, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('totally riveting', 'sizzling direction', 'never falters') indicating a strong recommendation, but confidence is reduced due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
