  "bwwExcerpt": "It's an interesting piece of writing that has opened at the Booth Theatre. The four characters are less fully-fleshed out humans than they are representations of types created to express four sides of what is arguably the most controversial issue facing America today; the combination of social media and cell phones with video recorders increasing the country's visibility of black men being killed by police officers.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic describes the work as 'interesting' but notes significant dramatic limitations (characters as 'types' rather than 'fully-fleshed out humans'). This suggests intellectual merit but theatrical shortcomings. Single excerpt warning requires caution - this could be setup for either direction. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as 'interesting' but focuses on the characters being more symbolic than fully developed, suggesting a mixed evaluation. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the play as an \"interesting piece of writing\" but doesn't offer a clear recommendation. The description of the characters as \"representations of types\" suggests a lack of depth, which leans towards a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers faint praise ('interesting') paired with criticism that characters are schematic 'representations of types' rather than fully developed humans, suggesting a mixed reception with significant reservations.",
