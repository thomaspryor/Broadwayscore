  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Leon directs with his usual taut hold on the play's intent, his understanding of the characters and the distinctions between them, particularly the prevalent racial divide. The relationships between a black mother and a white father, between police and community, between experience and inexperience are key here. The cast members are all in firm control of their characters and the specificity of Demos-Brown's book.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows praise for direction and cast control, but with only one curated quote available and text cut off mid-sentence, the full verdict is unclear. Scoring conservatively in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction and the cast's control over their characters, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the direction, the actors' control of their characters, and the specificity of the book. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the direction, acting, and script without reservations, suggesting a clear recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the overall verdict.",
