However, the review is brief and lacks detailed context, leading to medium confidence. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the play feels more like a thesis than a story, indicating a lack of engaging narrative and overall negative assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a fundamental criticism of the play's dramatic construction, finding it too didactic and insufficiently experiential. However, given the extreme brevity of the provided text and lack of clear final verdict, confidence is low.",
