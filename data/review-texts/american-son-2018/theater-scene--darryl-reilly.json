  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Kerry Washington and the fine cast make the most of their choice roles under Kenny Leon’s solid direction...Demos-Brown’s biting dialogue, smartly delineated characters, and the propulsive real-time action all have their technical virtues but in totality add up to a mechanical and unsatisfying experience. It’s ultimately a rote exploration of contemporary issues that pushes the right buttons to little impact...A decent police procedural with political overtones.\"\n\nRead more",

This represents a mixed assessment that leans negative. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges strong performances and direction but criticizes the overall impact as 'mechanical and unsatisfying'. The excerpt suggests a mixed verdict with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges strong performances and direction but ultimately finds the play itself \"mechanical and unsatisfying,\" leading to a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the excerpt praises the cast as 'fine' and direction as 'solid,' the critic's ultimate assessment describes the show as a 'mechanical and unsatisfying experience' that pushes buttons 'to little impact,' ultimately dismissing it as merely 'decent.' The technical competence noted does not translate to a recommendation.",
