    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for writing ('takes a pick-axe to our identity'), performances ('mutual open heart surgery'), and direction ('fuels the raw situation better than any stormy display'). Single excerpt warning noted, but consistent positive language throughout suggests genuine recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play's lasting impact and the effective use of silence and simplicity, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong praise for the writing and performances, indicating a positive recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the language suggests a strong positive leaning. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strong praise for the playwright's provocative writing, the lead performances, and the director's restrained approach, all indicative of a powerful, memorable production. As a single curated excerpt, it suggests clear positivity but warrants reduced confidence.",
