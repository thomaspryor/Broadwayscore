Single excerpt warning suggests this positive assessment may not represent the full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Washington's performance as riveting and powerful, suggesting a positive view of the show. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment might not be fully captured, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses heavily on Washington's performance, praising its power and emotional depth. While the text is truncated, the strong positive description suggests a recommendation, albeit with reservations due to the limited context. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Kerry Washington's performance ('agonized ferocity', 'powerful effect'), but limited context and truncation warrant low confidence.",
