Single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges strong performances and a relevant plot but criticizes the play for lacking depth and character development. The mixed evaluation suggests neither a strong recommendation nor discouragement. | Gemini: The review praises the performances and staging but criticizes the writing and lack of depth. The overall assessment is mixed, as it acknowledges strengths but ultimately finds the play lacking. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the lead performances and staging but criticizes the writing as superficial and archetypal, ending on a note of disappointment about the play's missed potential.",
