    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise ('blistering, explosive', 'dynamic, honest performances') with minor criticism about emotional manipulation that's quickly dismissed. Single excerpt warning requires caution - setting confidence to low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the play's impact and performances, with minor reservations about emotional manipulation. The tone is overall positive, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"blistering, explosive play\" and \"searing deep dive\". Despite the mention of \"emotional manipulation\", the reviewer finds it easy to look past, suggesting a positive overall experience. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('blistering,' 'explosive,' 'searing') for the play's impact and performances, dismissing the minor caveat about emotional manipulation as easy to overlook. Scored at the upper end of Positive per single-excerpt guidance, with low confidence due to limited text availability.",
