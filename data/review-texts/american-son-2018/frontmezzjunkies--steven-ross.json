  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Deep inside this tightly crafted 100 minute play, we can barely find a moment to look away from this fast-moving automobile...It falters in scope and speed at moments, here and there, struggling awkwardly to shift gears and directions with each new driver, but as directed with skill and precision by Kenny Leon, the vehicle never stalls or drops below the speed limit...That last 15 minutes of that slightly too drawn out evening of a short one-act play is worth the wait.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Mixed signals with both praise ('tightly crafted', 'skill and precision') and criticism ('falters', 'slightly too drawn out'), but concludes it's 'worth the wait'. Single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes a well-directed play that maintains interest despite some pacing issues. The positive elements outweigh the negatives, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges some flaws but ultimately states the ending is worth the wait, suggesting a positive but not rave recommendation. Confidence is low due to the excerpted nature of the text. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows clear recommendation ('worth the wait', 'tightly crafted', 'skill and precision') alongside minor criticisms about pacing and scope, indicating a solid positive review with reservations.",
