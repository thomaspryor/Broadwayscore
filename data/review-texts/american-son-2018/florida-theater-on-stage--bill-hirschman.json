  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"What Demos-Brown wrought on the page is a fusion of the intense racial issues with the universal terror of parents struggling to prepare a teenager to graduate into an antagonistic and unforgiving world. With those two elements intertwined and acidly eating into other, 'American Son' produces a far more complicated tale than simply an emotion-suffused polemic about overt and subtle manifestations of racism in the 21st Century.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic praises the playwright's work as sophisticated fusion creating a 'far more complicated tale' than simple polemic, suggesting artistic merit. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation - this could be setup rather than verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the complexity of the play's themes, suggesting a positive view of its depth. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context necessitate a cautious, low-confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the play as a \"complicated tale\" with intense racial issues and universal parental struggles. This suggests a positive, albeit potentially challenging, experience, but the single excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation lead to a lower confidence score. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the playwright's sophisticated fusion of racial themes with universal parental anxiety, highlighting the work's complexity and emotional resonance. As a single curated excerpt with clearly positive tone, it scores at the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
