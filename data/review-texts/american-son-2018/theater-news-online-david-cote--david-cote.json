  "bwwExcerpt": "There's a box of doughnuts center stage in Derek McLane's set for American Son that, try as I might, I couldn't ignore. Other than a momentary gag about cops liking them, they don't matter in the play. But I kept thinking about those baked goodies. First: Because their warm, cinnamon smell wafted across the orchestra. And second, unfortunately: They reminded me that American Son is likewise appealing, but hollow inside.",
