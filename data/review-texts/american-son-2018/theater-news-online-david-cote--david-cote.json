  "bwwExcerpt": "There's a box of doughnuts center stage in Derek McLane's set for American Son that, try as I might, I couldn't ignore. Other than a momentary gag about cops liking them, they don't matter in the play. But I kept thinking about those baked goodies. First: Because their warm, cinnamon smell wafted across the orchestra. And second, unfortunately: They reminded me that American Son is likewise appealing, but hollow inside.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic uses the doughnut metaphor to conclude the show is 'hollow inside' despite being 'appealing.' However, with only one excerpt available, this could be taken out of context from a more balanced review. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt compares the play to doughnuts that are appealing but hollow, suggesting a negative view of the play's substance. The tone is not strongly negative, hence a score in the mid-range of the Negative bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt compares the play to doughnuts, saying it's appealing but hollow inside, indicating a mixed reaction. The limited text and negative comparison prevent a higher score. | Kimi: The critic employs a damning metaphor comparing the show to doughnuts, acknowledging surface appeal (like the set design and sensory elements) but ultimately judging the work as empty and lacking substance at its core. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Mixed",
