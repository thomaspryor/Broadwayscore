    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Critic acknowledges the play is 'well-made' but criticizes it as overly didactic with characters serving the message rather than being authentic. The conditional 'might reverberate more loudly' suggests unfulfilled potential. Single excerpt warning applies - this could be from a longer mixed review. | GPT-4o: The review suggests the play has a clear message but is criticized for its character development and narrative structure. The excerpt indicates a mixed reception, with some positive elements but significant reservations. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the play's message but criticizes its characters and execution, suggesting it could have been more impactful with stronger elements. The overall tone is neither strongly positive nor negative. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges the play is competently constructed ('well-made') but criticizes the characterization as artificial ('chess-piece-moving') and suggests it fails to achieve its full emotional impact, indicating a mixed reception.",
