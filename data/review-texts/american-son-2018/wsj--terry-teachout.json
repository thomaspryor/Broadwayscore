  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A couple of stagy but nonetheless head-turning 'surprises' notwithstanding, what happens thereafter is understandably predictable, since the purpose of the play is to dramatize and illuminate a story that has become all too familiar. What we have here, in short, is an earnestly meant, soundly made commercial stage drama of the kind that used to play Broadway regularly, one that is overly inclined to TV-type clichés but proves to be unexpectedly good about not stacking the deck.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt showing qualified praise ('soundly made', 'earnestly meant') but with clear reservations about predictability and TV clichés. Positive assessment tempered by structural criticisms suggests lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the play's predictability and reliance on clichés, but also notes it is 'soundly made' and 'unexpectedly good' in some aspects. The overall tone suggests a mix of positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges clichés but ultimately describes the play as \"soundly made\" and \"unexpectedly good.\" Given the single excerpt and the caveat about TV-type clichés, a score on the lower end of the Positive bucket seems appropriate. | Kimi: While the critic notes the predictable plot and TV-type clichés, the phrases 'earnestly meant,' 'soundly made,' and 'unexpectedly good' indicate a qualified recommendation of this commercial drama.",
