The comparison to 'a very long short story' suggests the critic found it lacking as theatrical drama. | Gemini: The review offers a descriptive assessment without a clear recommendation, suggesting it's neither strongly positive nor negative. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a formal critique suggesting the work lacks theatricality, but appears truncated without a clear recommendation verdict.",
