    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges the play raises important questions and holds attention, but criticizes it as contrived, implausible, and artificially drawn. This balances positive elements with significant structural flaws, placing it in mixed territory. Low confidence due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the play's topicality and ability to hold attention but criticizes it for melodrama, overwrought acting, and implausibility, leading to a negative assessment. The excerpt suggests more negative than positive elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the topicality and attention-grabbing nature of the play, but criticizes it for melodramatic contrivance, overwrought acting, and implausibility. This suggests a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the excerpt grants that the play holds attention and raises important questions, the bulk of the critique focuses on melodramatic contrivance, overwrought acting, and implausible character mechanics, indicating the critic ultimately does not recommend the production. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
