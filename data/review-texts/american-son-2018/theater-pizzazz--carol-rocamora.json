Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the direction, ensemble, and lead performance, describing the production as emotionally devastating and transcendent. Following the single excerpt protocol, this is scored at the upper end of the Positive bucket with low confidence due to limited context.",
