  "bwwExcerpt": "Tony winner Kenny Leon (A Raisin in the Sun) directs with the smooth efficiency befitting this procedural-style work, and the cast-Washington and Pasquale are especially fine as parents whose emotions ricochet from angry to anguished to afraid and back again-wrings just about all the drama they can out of the newsprint-thin script. Hopefully they'll both be available for the inevitable small-screen adaptation (Netflix, perhaps?). And expect regional theaters and college campuses to jump at Ameri",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises director and lead performances but criticizes the script as 'newsprint-thin.' The phrase 'wrings just about all the drama they can' suggests performers are working with weak material. Single excerpt warning and truncated text require low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction and performances, particularly highlighting the cast's ability to evoke drama from a thin script. However, the mention of the 'newsprint-thin script' suggests some reservations, leading to a lower-end Positive score. The single excerpt and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the direction and performances, but notes the script is \"newsprint-thin.\" This suggests a positive but qualified recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the direction ('smooth efficiency') and cast ('especially fine'), but criticizes the script as 'newsprint-thin,' indicating a mildly positive recommendation based on strong execution of weak material.",
