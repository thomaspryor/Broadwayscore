This implies a mixed reception, as it doesn't clearly recommend or discourage attendance. | Gemini: The review states the play is difficult to watch, but also implies that this is intentional. This suggests a mixed reaction, as it neither recommends nor discourages seeing the play. | Kimi: The excerpt validates the play's difficult nature as intentional and notes the quick pacing, but provides no explicit recommendation to see or skip the show, suggesting this is a truncated review missing the final verdict.",
