  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'American Son' is not about the narrative, which has a few too many theatrical 'gotcha' moments for my taste. Instead, it is interested in airing an argument about the pervasiveness of racism...I thought a lot about Washington's performance....There's little humor and almost no nuance, just 90 minutes of close-to-tearful raging. It can feel one-noted...And yet, her character is not irrational...'American Son' may have a shaky narrative, but it is a searing political argument.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic finds significant flaws (shaky narrative, too many 'gotcha' moments, one-noted performance) but acknowledges the show's power as political theater and praises Washington's performance despite reservations. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges issues with the narrative and a lack of nuance, but highlights its effectiveness as a political argument. The mixed evaluation of the narrative and performance suggests a balanced view, neither fully positive nor negative. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws in the narrative but praises the performance and describes the play as a \"searing political argument.\" This suggests a mixed but ultimately thought-provoking experience, placing it in the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt criticizes the theatrical execution ('gotcha' moments, 'one-noted') but validates the core experience as a 'searing political argument' and praises Washington's performance. Per excerpt guidance for mildly positive single quotes, scored at lower end of Positive bucket.",
