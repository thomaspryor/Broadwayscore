  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The slowly uncovered revelations are at times too heavy handed...especially Kendra's lengthy monologue about...her feelings of victimhood...I thought Jamal always being the single non-white student at the private schools he attended a bit of a stretch. Still Demos-Brown is to be commended for the interesting and highly dramatic way he draws us into the conundrum of race as it affects all Americans and their sons and daughters.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt shows significant criticisms ('too heavy handed', 'a bit of a stretch') but ends with commendation for the playwright's dramatic approach. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mixed-leaning-negative given the substantial critiques. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges heavy-handedness and some implausibility but also commends the dramatic exploration of race. The single excerpt and lack of full context suggest a mixed review with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review has some reservations, but ultimately commends the playwright for drawing the audience into the discussion of race. Given that this is a single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: While noting specific flaws including heavy-handed revelations and a plot stretch regarding the protagonist's schooling, the critic ultimately commends the playwright for an interesting and highly dramatic treatment of race, indicating a qualified but clear recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
