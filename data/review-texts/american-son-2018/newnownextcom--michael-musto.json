Yes, they are emotionally miles apart, but there are times when you’d barely feel they even met...Fortunately, complexity emerges, but overall, this dire American crisis deserves stronger treatment.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic explicitly states this is not the great play needed for the subject matter, criticizes dialogue as unnatural, and concludes the crisis 'deserves stronger treatment' - a clear negative assessment despite acknowledging some complexity emerges. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the play for not being the great work needed to address its serious themes, and notes issues with character interactions. The mention of 'complexity emerges' suggests some redeeming qualities, but the overall tone is negative. | Gemini: The review expresses reservations about the play's treatment of the subject matter, suggesting it could be stronger, but also acknowledges emerging complexity. Given the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges some thematic complexity but ultimately finds the play inadequate for its serious subject matter, criticizing the character writing and concluding that the crisis 'deserves stronger treatment' than this production provides.",
