  "bwwExcerpt": "Enhancing the production is an outstanding company of A-listers: Jeremy Jordan as a young white cop limited by his narrow world view; Eugene Lee providing the pragmatic voice of a black man who's learned how to straddle both sides to survive; Steven Pasquale as a member of the ruling class who's never had to compromise; and Kerry Washington - at times combative and emotionally overwrought - reflects the soul-crippling history of the black experience in America.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises an 'outstanding company of A-listers' and provides detailed appreciation of each performance. However, this is only one curated excerpt, so confidence is low and the verdict may not represent the full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast as 'outstanding', indicating a positive view of the performances. However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning suggest caution, leading to a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the cast as \"outstanding\" which suggests a positive experience, but without more context, it's hard to gauge the overall recommendation strength. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the cast, describing them as 'outstanding' and 'A-listers' with specific accolades for each performance's emotional depth and authenticity.",
