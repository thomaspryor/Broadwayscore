With its unrelentingly high tension on every level — maternal, marital, societal — it’s more like a slice of a nightmare, with few contours despite its surprises.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises director's work as his 'best to date' and calls performances 'big but nuanced,' though notes the play itself is 'not subtle.' Single excerpt with mixed signals but overall positive tone toward the production elements. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the director's work as his best to date and describes the performances as big and nuanced, suggesting a positive view. However, it also notes the play's lack of subtlety and describes it as a 'slice of a nightmare,' indicating some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review praises the direction and performances, but notes the play is not subtle and feels more like a nightmare. Given the limited excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers high praise for the direction ('best work to date') and performances ('nuanced'), but criticizes the play itself as unsubtle and lacking contours. Given the single-excerpt warning and mixed signals, this represents a qualified positive recommendation.",
