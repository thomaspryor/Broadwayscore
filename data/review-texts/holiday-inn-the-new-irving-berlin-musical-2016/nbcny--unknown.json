  "bwwExcerpt": "'Holiday Inn\" is a lovely excuse to get lost in the Berlin chestnuts, particularly as they've been reimagined by choreographer Jones (\"Honeymoon in Vegas\"). The new story sometimes tries too hard to be charming and old-fashioned, but overall \"Holiday Inn\" is a satisfying autumn offering.",
