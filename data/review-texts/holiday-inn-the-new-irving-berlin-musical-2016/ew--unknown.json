You’ve heard the Tin Pan Alley tunes, including “White Christmas” and “Easter Parade,” dozens of times — perhaps in the 1942 Berlin-scored Bing Crosby-Fred Astaire silver-screen source, Holiday Inn. Or in his 1948 movie Easter Parade. Or in 1954’s White Christmas. (Berlin was recycling even before it was trendy!) The hey-kids-let’s-put-on-a-show trope is as old as movie musicals themselves. The characters — who include song-and-dance journeymen Jim and Ted (Bryce Pinkham and Corbin Bleu, taking on the Crosby and Astaire roles, respectively), fame-hungry bleached blonde Lila (Megan Sikora), and fame-shy mousy brunette Linda (Lora Lee Gayer) — are so stock they’re practically cardboard. And the “plot” — ex-showbiz star opens a Connecticut country inn — is pretty much just a clothesline on which to hang Berlin’s songs.\n\nStill, you’d have to be a total Grinch not to melt even a little during Berlin’s comforting-as-cocoa Christmas ballad. And who couldn’t succumb to the charms of the tap-happy “Shaking the Blues Away,” a massive tree-trimming production number led by that comic dynamo Megan Lawrence as a Rosie the Riveter-meets-Lucille Ball scene stealer?\n\nBut wait, “Shaking the Blues Away” wasn’t in the movie! And it’s not a Christmas song! (That was an actual complaint overheard at intermission.) Yes, movie fans, the creators — director-librettist Gordon Greenberg and co-librettist Chad Hodge (TNT’s Good Behavior) — have taken liberties. They’ve added some new tunes, including, most notably, the little-known gem “Nothing More to Say.” They’ve replaced and expanded characters: the stereotypical black housekeeper, Mamie (played on screen by Louise Beavers) here becomes Lawrence’s Louise, a trouser-wearing farmhand and Jill of all trades. Linda is no longer a wannabe actress/flower-shop salesgirl; now she’s a schoolteacher who just happens to sing like a dream and do a mean foxtrot. Oh, and they’ve cut the minstrel show number “Abraham” — the one Crosby famously performed in blackface. (You’ll hear no complaints about that.)\n\nOne thing that didn’t change: Ted’s famous firecracker solo. And thank goodness! It’s nothing more than a chance to showcase some majorly fancy footwork courtesy of choreographer Denis Jones, but High School Musical alum Bleu, a charmer with a toothpaste commercial-ready smile, makes the most of every explosive step.\n\nSaddled with the less flashy role, Pinkham, a standout in 2013’s A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder, tends to blend into the background. In his defense, it’s hard to compete with a stuffed bunny Easter bonnet. (Alejo Vietti created the witty costumes — especially of note are the red skirts that lace up like a baseball in “Song of Freedom” and horn of plenty headpieces in “Plenty to Be Thankful For.”)\n\nFor some reason, the book doesn’t have Jim’s whole showbiz-themed-inn idea taking root until right before intermission. But once the tap dancers break out the jump ropes — well, that’s all it takes to get the audience immediately into the Holiday spirit. B\n\n(Tickets: RoundaboutTheatre.org or 212-719-1300)",

Despite noting the show's formulaic nature and stock characters, the critic finds it charming and gets 'into the Holiday spirit.' The positive elements outweigh the criticisms. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's lack of originality and some character and plot weaknesses, but ultimately highlights its charm and entertainment value. The critic's B rating suggests a positive recommendation with some reservations. However, the text is truncated, so the final verdict may be missing. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's reliance on familiar tropes and songs, but highlights charming performances and production numbers. The 'B' grade and positive tone suggest a recommendation with reservations, but the truncated text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The review acknowledges the show's unoriginal plot and stock characters but praises the choreography, Irving Berlin's songs, and specific performances (particularly Corbin Bleu and Megan Lawrence), ultimately awarding it a 'B' grade and noting that audiences will be won over by the holiday spirit.",
