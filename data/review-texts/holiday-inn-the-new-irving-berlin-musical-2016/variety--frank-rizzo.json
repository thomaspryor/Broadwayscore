  "bwwExcerpt": "Choreographer Denis Jones is the star player of the production, keeping things playful by finding dance opportunities with wheelbarrows, firecrackers and Christmas garlands - and nearly stopping the show with the exuberant \"Shaking the Blues Away,\" which evokes the best of MGM musicals. Terrific also are Alejo Vietti's costumes and fab Easter hats, which embrace '40s swank, showbiz glitz and stylish down-on-the-farm casual. (It's Connecticut, after all.)",
