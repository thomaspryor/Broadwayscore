It’s slick, synthetic and soulless, a musical full of robotic jokes and devoid of genuine romance. The uncharismatic leading men, Bryce Pinkham and Corbin Bleu, are to Crosby and Astaire what a Whopper is to a New York strip. The only noteworthy thing about “Holiday Inn” is Megan Lawrence, who makes something extra-special out of the thankless part of the smart-ass second banana who doesn’t get the guy. She was terrific in the 2006 Broadway revival of “The Pajama Game” and is stupendous here. They should have made her the star.",
