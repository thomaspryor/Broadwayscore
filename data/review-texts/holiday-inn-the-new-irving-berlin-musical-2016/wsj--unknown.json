  "fullText": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/holiday-inn-the-new-irving-berlin-musical-review-1475800201\n\nShareResize4Megan Lawrence and Bryce Pinkham Joan MarcusNew York\n\nHoliday Inn, the New Irving Berlin Musical\n\nRoundabout Theatre Company, Studio 54, 254 W. 54th St., New York\n \n \n \n $47-$152, 212-719-1300, closes Jan. 15, 2017\n\n“Holiday Inn, the New Irving Berlin Musical” (that’s the official title, which tells you all you need to know) is less a show than a cash machine, a cynical repurposing of the beloved 1942 Bing Crosby-Fred Astaire film that exists solely to make as much money as possible for the Roundabout Theatre Company. It’s slick, synthetic and soulless, a musical full of robotic jokes and devoid of genuine romance. The uncharismatic leading men, Bryce Pinkham and Corbin Bleu, are to Crosby and Astaire what a Whopper is to a New York strip. The only noteworthy thing about “Holiday Inn” is Megan Lawrence, who makes something extra-special out of the thankless part of the smart-ass second banana who doesn’t get the guy. She was terrific in the 2006 Broadway revival of “The Pajama Game” and is stupendous here. They should have made her the star.",

Only praise is for one supporting performer, which doesn't redeem the overall pan. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show as a 'cash machine,' 'slick, synthetic and soulless,' with uncharismatic leads. Despite praise for Megan Lawrence, the overall verdict is strongly negative. | Gemini: The review is largely negative, describing the show as a cynical cash grab. While Megan Lawrence's performance is praised, the overall assessment is unfavorable. | Kimi: The review excoriates the production as a mercenary, soulless repurposing of the film with robotic humor and uncharismatic leads, offering praise only to a supporting performer in a thankless role. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Pan",
