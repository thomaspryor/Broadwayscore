  "bwwExcerpt": "The interpolated songs are integrated into the plot smoothly enough, without lifting the show's mild temperature or bringing new definition to the characters. And unfortunately the choreography, by Denis Jones, features numerous tap routines that are more workmanlike than inspired, and occasionally seem to go on forever. A spirited jump-roping number is the freshest novelty.",
