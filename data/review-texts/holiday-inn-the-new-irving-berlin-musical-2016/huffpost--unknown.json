  "bwwExcerpt": "We now have a second Irving Berlin movie-turned-musical, this one derived from the 1942 \"Holiday Inn,\" which also starred Crosby (with Fred Astaire as his song-and-dance partner/rival). A decidedly better and more enjoyable film than \"White Christmas,\" it is rather surprising to find that Holiday Inn-offered as the Roundabout's big fall musical-makes a decidedly weaker stage attraction.",
