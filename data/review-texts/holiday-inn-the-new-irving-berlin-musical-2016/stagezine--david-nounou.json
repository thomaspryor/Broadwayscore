  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Besides the proven Irving Berlin score, the most enjoyable part of the show is Bryce Pinkham as Jim...It is pure pleasure watching him sing and dance...Although the show never hits peaks, it does hit a middle of the road of enjoyable entertainment, with a wonderful songbook, some good performances and an eager cast that aims to please. 'Holiday Inn' is fluff that you enjoy while watching but won’t retain for long after leaving the theater.\"\n\nRead more",
