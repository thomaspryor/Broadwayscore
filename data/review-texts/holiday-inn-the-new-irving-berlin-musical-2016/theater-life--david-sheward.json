  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"This new edition is pleasant enough, featuring a treasure trove of Irving Berlin tunes..,All are delivered with charm by a smiling ensemble and directed with precision by Gordon Greenberg. But everyone is such a darned nice gal or fella, there’s no tension or sizzle...They have all been directed and written with no darkness to contrast the constant cheerful light...There are mildly enjoyable musical consolations, but the numbers don’t really take off until late in the first act.\"\n\nRead more",
