But the final production of the Goodspeed Opera House season — and of Michael P. Price’s 46-year tenure as executive director — manages to step nimbly around the pitfalls. It avoids both desecrating the movie that gave the world “White Christmas” and distressing a contemporary audience with “Abraham,” the film’s appalling blackface number (sometimes omitted from TV broadcasts, as it is here).\n\nThe writers, Gordon Greenberg and Chad Hodge, have taken a mix-and-match approach to “Irving Berlin’s Holiday Inn,” as this world premiere is called. They’ve retained Berlin’s original concept, a musical about an idiosyncratic country hotel — in Connecticut, where else? — that opens only on holidays, providing guests with holiday-specific shows, not to mention holiday-specific songs by Irving Berlin. But Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Hodge have interpolated other tunes from earlier and later in Mr. Berlin’s unparalleled output; they’ve smartly shored up the flimsy story; and they’ve given the movie’s bland female characters some personality while also strengthening the men, who were originally little more than outlines filled in by the charm and star power of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire.\n\nMr. Greenberg, doing double duty as the show’s director, has wisely enlisted the services of Denis Jones, whose lively choreography keeps the show bouncing along. It is, after all, just an excuse for a string of holiday tunes, some now classics and some not. (Sorry, Irving, but “I’ve Got Plenty to Be Thankful For” and “Let’s Start the New Year Right” are not on a par with “White Christmas” and “Easter Parade.”) And the showbiz milieu allows for the inclusion of songs, like the opening tap number, that have nothing in particular to do with the plot — who would argue with five jaunty men in gray suits and fedoras, hands plunged into pockets, singing “Steppin’ Out With My Baby”? Mr. Jones’s dances, and Alejo Vietti’s costumes, too, borrow overtly from the past while making standard ’40s nightclub routines look fresh. But not all the additions are as well-integrated: Mr. Berlin’s most beautiful lament, “What’ll I Do?,” has no emotional resonance in its new context.\n\nThe movie’s premise, you’ll recall, is that Mr. Crosby’s character, Jim Hardy, is ready to give up his singing career, and his partnership with Ted Hanover, the dancer played by Fred Astaire, for the quiet life of a farmer. The third member of their act, Lila Dixon, can’t quite decide if she wants to quit and marry Jim or keep touring with Ted. At the Goodspeed, it falls to the somewhat stiff Tally Sessions to fill Mr. Crosby’s shoes as Jim and to the fleet Noah Racey to follow Mr. Astaire as Ted. Hayley Podschun’s platinum-blond Lila is a squeaky-voiced chorine who would be right at home in “Guys and Dolls.”\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",
