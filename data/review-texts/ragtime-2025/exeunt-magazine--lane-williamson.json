However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low, and the score is set at the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the director's understanding and respect for the writing, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the director's respectful approach to the source material and avoidance of unnecessary revisions, indicating a favorable assessment of this revival, though the single curated quote limits certainty about the overall verdict.",
