  "bwwExcerpt": "Still, the mantle of “relevance” is a heavy thing to lay on a Broadway musical. An earlier version of this same staging, also by director Lear deBessonet, ran at the Encores! series last November in the weeks before and after the U.S. presidential election, and depending on when audiences saw it, they felt either the show’s bursts of hope or its cries of despair with a fresh immediacy. Seen now, it plays less like a reflection of the breaking news outside the theater’s doors than like a dead-serious fable, speaking not so much to our precise present moment as to the perennial national questions this moment raises.",
