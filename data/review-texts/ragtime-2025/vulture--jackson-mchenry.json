  "dtliExcerpt": "Ragtime settles into a richer and more internal mode quickly, in a large part due to the textured performances of its leads and the thought they’ve applied to Ahrens and Flaherty’s score.",
  "bwwExcerpt": "The fantasy of endless space is what matters, a great chimeric promise, this production understands, that both sustains the nation and goes unfulfilled. Even America has an end. Ragtime, with its thudding sentimentality, is not a truly great musical, but deBessonet has enough finesse to convince you that it might come close.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The production is so powerfully sung and deeply felt that it overwhelms. Maybe these characters have false dreams, and maybe the showâs idea of hope is impossibly naÃ¯ve, but it lingers.\"",
