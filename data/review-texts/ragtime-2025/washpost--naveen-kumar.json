  "fullText": "A revival of the epic historical musical is buoyed by a powerhouse cast but doesn’t always rise above cliché. NEW YORK — The magnificent wall of sound in the full-company opening number of “Ragtime” is a patriotic metaphor. America’s promise has always rested on uneasy accord among people — in this case, a mix of White, Black and immigrant New Yorkers around 1906 — that threatens at any moment to explode. Harmony is rare enough lately that even in song it can feel like deliverance. When a stripped-down version of this revival played a two-week off-Broadway run last November, performances fell on both sides of the presidential election. Given the musical’s central themes about how race, class and immigration shape the pursuit of the American Dream, the atmosphere was electric, even with a mostly bare stage. The timeliness of the story, based on E.L. Doctorow’s 1975 novel, and the stirring score by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens are all but undeniable. Much has happened in the year since, and the more polished and decked-out “Ragtime” that transferred to Broadway aims to soothe jangled liberal nerves. It succeeds on the merits of the material and the powerhouse principal cast reprising their roles. Director Lear DeBessonet, in her first show as artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, makes some appealing use of the grand canvas, a promising sign for her upcoming tenure. But the production doesn’t always benefit from these bold strokes, which underline the pitfalls of a narrative told through archetypes and melodrama. The characters in “Ragtime,” first performed in 1996 and written for the stage by Terrence McNally, are largely stand-ins for ideas and social currents. Their believability as flesh-and-blood depends on the actors, who were squarely the focus of last year’s pared-back run. Many of them are doing excellent, even career-high work here, even while staying just shy of embodying stereotypes. In the role known simply as Mother, a model of White female gentility, Caissie Levy is all grace and assurance, with a clear-eyed presence that grounds her vocals in palpable feeling and anchors the story overall. That’s at least partly because Mother is also an audience surrogate: What would anyone do if they found an abandoned infant in their garden? Poor Father (Colin Donnell) plays the paper-flat villain: If the child is Black, who cares? Joshua Henry is a thunderous marvel as Coalhouse, a proxy for Black masculinity in the form of a Harlem pianist with middle-class aspirations who discovers he’s the foundling’s father. The depth and soul of his booming voice lends dimension to the role, even as Coalhouse turns from a victim of hate crime to violent vigilante. (The same cannot be said of Nichelle Lewis, who over-styles her songs as his lover Sarah, perhaps to make up for the underwritten part or to escape the long shadow of Audra McDonald’s Tony-winning turn in the 1998 Broadway premiere.) In another of the second act’s tips toward cliché, the Jewish immigrant Tateh rises from off-the-boat destitution to a Hollywood director’s chair, a transformation that Brandon Uranowitz — who played a young boy in the musical’s first iteration in Toronto — manages to finesse with vigorous charm. Ben Levi Ross also makes a believable man of Mother’s younger brother, a dilettante in search of a cause whose wandering heart always seems to be in the right place. The story’s menagerie of historical figures — including Shaina Taub as labor activist Emma Goldman, Anna Grace Barlow as showgirl Evelyn Nesbit and John Clay III as Booker T. Washington, here a totem for Black respectability — are more symbols than people, yet the performers give them an impressive lived-in quality. DeBessonet’s staging, and the choreography by Ellenore Scott, lend each onstage faction its own language of movement: Wealthy suburbanites strike Seurat-like tablaeus, denizens of Harlem dance in a flurry of limbs, and new arrivals trudge forward with heavy feet. The production shines when the design remains simple, with lighting (by Adam Honoré and Donald Holder) pinpointing characters against the slick-black floor like stars in orbit. The detailed period costumes (by Linda Cho) clearly illustrate social boundaries and shifts in class, while the set (by David Korins) moves from striking visual restraint (rolling stairways, the partial outline of a house) to curiously expressive flourish (the appearance of a bunting curtain that looks like a massive droopy diaper). The risk-taking is admirable but grows peculiar and distracting. Fortunately, the show sounds gloriously lush throughout (orchestrations are by William David Brohn, music direction is by James Moore and sound design by Kai Harada). And the underlying conviction coursing through “Ragtime,” that everyone — from J.P. Morgan to an orphaned Black child — is fully entitled to America’s founding promise, resonates loud and clear. So much so that it hardly needs much embellishment at all. Ragtime, through June 14 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in New York. About 2 hours and 45 minutes with an intermission. lct.org.",
