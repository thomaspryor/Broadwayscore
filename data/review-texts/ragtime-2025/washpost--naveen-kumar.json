  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessReview by Naveen KumarNEW YORK — The magnificent wall of sound in the full-company opening number of “Ragtime” is a patriotic metaphor. America’s promise has always rested on uneasy accord among people — in this case, a mix of White, Black and immigrant New Yorkers around 1906 — that threatens at any moment to explode.

Director Lear DeBessonet, in her first show as artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, makes some appealing use of the grand canvas, a promising sign for her upcoming tenure. But the production doesn’t always benefit from these bold strokes, which underline the pitfalls of a narrative told through archetypes and melodrama.",
