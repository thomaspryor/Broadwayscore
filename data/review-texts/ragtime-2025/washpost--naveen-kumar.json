  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessReview by Naveen KumarNEW YORK — The magnificent wall of sound in the full-company opening number of “Ragtime” is a patriotic metaphor. America’s promise has always rested on uneasy accord among people — in this case, a mix of White, Black and immigrant New Yorkers around 1906 — that threatens at any moment to explode. Harmony is rare enough lately that even in song it can feel like deliverance.\n\n11 CommentsMost ReadOpinionMichael ShermerI’ve reported on UFO sightings for decades — and come to this conclusionJanuary 29, 2026Brianna TuckerIn Texas, Democrats narrow GOP’s U.S. House majority, land state Senate upset30 minutes agoSalvador RizzoDOJ misconduct complaint against D.C. federal judge dismissedEarlier todayNewsletterFridaysBook ClubOur weekly selection of book reviews and recommendations from Book World editor Ron Charles.Sign up5.52.10",

Director Lear DeBessonet, in her first show as artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, makes some appealing use of the grand canvas, a promising sign for her upcoming tenure. But the production doesn’t always benefit from these bold strokes, which underline the pitfalls of a narrative told through archetypes and melodrama.",
