However, due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"sterling production\" and \"flawless cast,\" indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt employs unambiguous superlatives ('sterling,' 'flawless') and indicates strong enthusiasm for the production's quality, clearly warranting a Rave classification despite the limited excerpt length.",
