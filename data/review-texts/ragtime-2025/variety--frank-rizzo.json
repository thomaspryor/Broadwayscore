  "fullText": "Whether \"Ragtime\" is presented in productions mammoth (as in its 1998 premiere) or modest (the 2009 revival), the musical, adapted from E.L. Doctorow's kaleidoscopic 1975 novel, reverberates with the directness, passion and allegorical heft of an American folk epic.\n\nLear deBessonet opens her tenure as artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater with an expanded and exceptional version of the concert-plus production she staged at New York City Center during the weeks surrounding the presidential election last fall. It's a savvy choice given the positive reception it received, the show's panoramic scope and the ever-vital themes of the work.",
  "dtliExcerpt": "It’s a thrilling experience, though on the Vivian Beaumont Theater’s vast stage this pageant of a musical feels a bit skimpy. Not that the musical needs opulent sets, but it does call for stunning stagecraft to match the awe of its aspirations. It’s achieved here only intermittently.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"In productions large or small â or, here, imperfectly in-between, though still glorious â everything is the service of the show that creates with words, music and movement a grand American tapestry â tears and all.\"",
