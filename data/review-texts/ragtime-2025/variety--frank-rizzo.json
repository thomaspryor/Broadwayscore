  "fullText": "It’s a thrilling experience, though on the Vivian Beaumont Theater’s vast stage this pageant of a musical feels a bit skimpy. Not that the musical needs opulent sets, but it does call for stunning stagecraft to match the awe of its aspirations. It’s achieved here only intermittently.",
