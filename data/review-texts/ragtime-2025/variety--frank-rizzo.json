  "_invalidatedFullText": "Read our review of Real Women Have Curves on Broadway, a new musical adaptation of the 1990 play by Josefina López and the HBO film of the same name. The American dream, and to what extent it can be a reality, has long been a rich subject for Broadway shows to explore, from the recent revival of Gypsy to the 2024 musical adaptation of The Great Gatsby. But such shows can’t be too much of a downer and so restrain their critiques, even as their audiences must confront what this titanic hope means anymore. There are definitely moments in Real Women Have Curves where it appears to take this task seriously alongside its more archetypal coming-of-age narrative. Ana García’s (Tatianna Córdoba) fervor to become a journalist steers her toward an interview with a congressional candidate who reveals his flippant, anti-immigration thoughts. She is also the only U.S. citizen in her family, and though fresh out of high school, is thus saddled with the responsibility of doing the banal home administrative work her undocumented parents and sister can't. The second act opener takes place in an immigration detention center, dark and gray and spare. Yet the show continually treats these components as regrettable, in a way. In brief flashes, the weight of the García family’s jeopardized safety, and that of the undocumented factory workers feverishly making 200 dresses for an important order, lands with confidence: an INS raid of an adjacent pillow factory leaves the cast hiding beneath their sewing machines and the stage in silence for a minute. But quickly, Real Women Have Curves appears to wish this element weren’t such a part of the story, either rushing through dramatic beats or undermining them with a cheesy song about flying out of a cage. Real Women Have Curves feels most comfortable as the musical where Ana grows up, tells her mother (an excellent Justina Machado) that her second-gen immigrant child dreams are valid, and goes off to become a person in her own right. But that’s also the more boring show, dutifully checking off narrative cliches (her mother doesn’t understand her, she has to help her family even though she’s bad at sewing). Intermittently, the songs by Joy Huerta and Benjamin Velez keenly find something unique in the lives of its characters, like a song about menopause, but too often the lyrics feel generic, as if the wrinkles that make this story potent and valuable have trouble sticking to create a more singular piece. For how much the show is about the characters’ status as immigrants or citizens, and how frequently they distinguish themselves from white Americans (from their treatment in society writ large to the justice system more specifically), it’s curious that, particularly in today's political environment, the show loops back to a relatively unquestioned idea about the meaning, value, and reality of the American dream. It’s like Real Women Have Curves can’t figure out which story to care about more: the one about a teen following her passion, or about the complexity of immigrants trying to make it in an America where their ambitions are sometimes kept out of reach. Based on the the 1990 play by Josefina López and the 2002 television film starring America Ferrera, the show takes place in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, in 1987. Young Ana García, born in the U.S. to Mexican immigrants, hopes to go to Columbia University. Her mother (Machado) and sister Estela (Florencia Cuenca) run a sewing factory whose appliances are on their last legs. When a huge order of dresses comes from a client with connections to important buyers, Ana has to choose between her passion of becoming a journalist or helping her family, while the specter of Ronald Reagan’s conservative immigration stance looms in the background. Much of the show takes place in the sewing factory, with machines lining the stage like an army regiment. Vibrancy comes from the enthusiastic ensemble, featuring Carla Jimenez, Jennifer Sánchez, Aline Mayagoitia, Sandra Valls, and Shelby Acosta; bright and glowing costumes by Wilberth Gonzalez and Paloma Young; and berry-bold lighting from Natasha Katz. But the richness of the set design, by Arnulfo Maldonado, feels overpowered by the AI-looking LED video backgrounds by Hana S. Kim, which conflate textural expressive murals with smeary, waxy giant screensavers. Real Women Have Curves has a 93% audience approval rating on Show-Score, earning it \"Must-See\" status on the review aggregator site. Audiences have largely praised its funny and feel-good nature and representation of a diverse array of Latina women. Read more audience reviews of Real Women Have Curves on Show-Score. Real Women Have Curves keeps its most compelling and dramatic elements at a distance, opting instead for uplifting. But even in that regard, the music and book don’t feel sturdy enough to distract from its indecision about what it means to be an American, much less in a sociopolitical landscape where those questions are at the forefront of national conversations and loaded with potential danger. Curves might not be intended as a dark treatise on American or immigrant identity, but it needn't cinch these ideas in an ill-fitting dress.

The running time of Real Women Have Curves is 2hr 10min. Incl. 15min intermission. It’s the summer of 1987, and Ana Garcia dreams of flying away from East Los Angeles. But when a major order comes in for her family’s garment business, plans don’t exactly fall into place. This is a joyous and uplifting Tony Award-nominated musical based on Josefina López's play and the 2002 film. A few samples of tracks have already been released, and audiences can expect soaring ballads, ensemble numbers featuring the Garcia family, and a strong throughline of Latin music that speaks to the characters’ cultural background. This is a new musical making its Broadway debut, but out-of-town reviews were glowing, including from The Boston Globe and that city’s radio station, WBUR. This musical is for ages 12 and up. Lisa Loomer wrote the book based on the play by Josefina López and screenplay by López and George LaVoo. Joy Huerta and Benjamin Velez wrote the songs.

  "fullText": "Whether \"Ragtime\" is presented in productions mammoth (as in its 1998 premiere) or modest (the 2009 revival), the musical, adapted from E.L. Doctorow's kaleidoscopic 1975 novel, reverberates with the directness, passion and allegorical heft of an American folk epic.\n\nLear deBessonet opens her tenure as artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater with an expanded and exceptional version of the concert-plus production she staged at New York City Center during the weeks surrounding the presidential election last fall. It's a savvy choice given the positive reception it received, the show's panoramic scope and the ever-vital themes of the work.\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n Related Stories \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n 'The Odyssey': Travis Scott Appears in New TV Trailer for Christopher Nolan's Epic \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Elon Musk Says Christopher Nolan Has 'Lost His Integrity' With 'The Odyssey' If Lupita Nyong’o Is Playing Helen of Troy\n\nIt's a thrilling experience, though on the Vivian Beaumont Theater’s vast stage this pageant of a musical feels a bit skimpy. Not that the musical needs opulent sets, but it does call for stunning stagecraft to match the awe of its aspirations. It's achieved here only intermittently.\n\n \n Popular on Variety\n\nBook writer Terrence McNally artfully adapted Doctorow's densely packed, historical novel which, from the start, seemed destined to be a musical. (Its title alone would get the theatrical rights rolling.) But because of the multitude of characters and stories of the book, that was no easy task. (The 1981 film version was less than a commercial triumph.)\n\nTapping into Doctorow's cooly elegant narration and rambunctious conceit, McNally streamlined the event-filled book into a clear, cohesive and dynamic creation for the stage.\n\nMusic unites the interconnecting stories in this saga and expands its passions, with a sumptuous score by composer Stephen Flaherty and lyricist Lynn Ahrens that taps into a wide range of American styles, idioms and amalgams, even as the second act turns more dissonant. Special mention, too, goes to William David B John's lush orchestrations and the show's gorgeous choral work.\n\nDirector deBessonet's fluid staging follows three disparate groups — a white, upper-middle-class family, an African-American couple and a newly emigrated Jewish widower and his young daughter. They all face seismic shifts in their lives at the turn of the last century. Dramatic shifts in America, too, as \"Ragtime\" takes on weighty issues of racism, immigration, class, industrialization, the rise of unions, and the changing worlds for women and popular culture.\n\nThat's a heavy load to balance — on top of a slew of symbols and metaphors. But the leading actors manage to fill in the broad outlines of their archetypical characters (most with generic monikers) with finesse as they adapt, embrace, rebel or are defeated by the chaos of fast-moving times.\n\nFrom his suburban perch, the imperious Father (Colin Donnell) fails to hear or understand the music of change, especially the new syncopated sounds of ragtime which trips up the inevitability of the beat, creating a new tempo for the times.\n\nHowever, Mother (Cassie Levy, splendid) appreciates this new music which accompanies her transformative story arc. She changes from dutiful 19th century wife and mother (singing the quaint \"Goodbye, My Love\") to a 20th century woman who finally finds the power of her own agency (a resounding \"Back to Before\").\n\nHer Younger Brother (Ben Levi Ross, funny, sad and riveting) also yearns for something more than privileged comfort and finds his purpose and inspiration in activist Emma Goldman (Shaina Taub, bringing warmth to the rabble-rousing). Mother's Little Boy (Nick Barrington, humorously self-possessed) is a curious observer of the changes taking place around him. He's clairvoyant, too — he foresees the trigger event for a world war— giving the work a touch of prophecy that is better integrated in the novel.\n\nThe second story follows the journey of Tateh (Brandon Uranowitz), the Latvian immigrant and his Little Girl (Tabitha Lawing), from New York's tenements to factory exploitation in a mill town to his re-invention as a populist filmmaker in a nascent industry. Uranowitz' is both tender and tough in both his struggles and in his triumph, capped with a chronicle of his character's rise in a dazzling \"Buffalo Nickel Photoplay Inc.\"\n\nThe main propellant of these interwoven stories is the narrative of Coalhouse Walker Jr. (Joshua Henry, simply superb), a successful and charismatic musician, and Sarah (Nichelle Lewis), whom he loved, lost and is reunited with, only to have tragedy fall upon them both. Lewis delicately dials the character's challenging emotional swings from madness, through recovery, hope and despair. But it's Henry's commanding presence, richly felt emotions and powerful vocals that anchors the show while making the production soar.\n\nThough the score is anthem-heavy and earnestness is always hovering, there are moments in the show that are transcendent. The opening number remains a stunner as choreographer Ellenore Scott finding fresh ways of delineating all the major and minor characters and introducing the tensions that will further tighten throughout the show.\n\nIncluded in these special moments are Coalhouse wooing Sarah out of her room with his enchanting \"New Music\"; their love duet, \"Wheels of a Dream\"; the contrasting quests of Father and Tateh in \"Journey On;\" Younger Brother's passion in \"The Night That Goldman Spoke at Union Square\" and, with Goldman singing what the young man can't articulate, \"He Wanted to Say”; and Allison Blackwell as Sarah's Friend, tearing through the Act One closer \"Til We Reach That Day” with artful measure.\n\nThe show's creators also know that lightness is needed, too, and give the audience the occasional breather — while remarkably keeping the themes in play — by tapping into the appeal of secondary characters such as escape artist Houdini (Rodd Cyrus), Evelyn Nesbitt (Anna Grace Barlow, a delight as perhaps America's first meaningless celeb); and a rude bunch of baseball-loving bros.\n\nIn productions large or small — or, here, imperfectly in-between, though still glorious — everything is the service of the show that creates with words, music and movement a grand American tapestry — tears and all.",
