  "dtliExcerpt": "From the moment the chorus rises from the stage of the Vivian Beaumont Theater during the opening number of Ragtime, you know you’re in for something special—a big Broadway musical with what seems like a cast of thousands singing their hearts out over swelling strings and gutsy brass.
