    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('sweeping epic', 'captures attention and never lets go', 'passionate performance') suggests enthusiastic recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires low confidence as this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('sweeping', 'epic', 'captures your attention') indicating a highly favorable view. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning, suggesting it may not represent the full review. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, using terms like \"sweeping, epic\" and \"passionate performance,\" suggesting a highly favorable review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt employs enthusiastic superlatives ('sweeping,' 'epic,' 'never lets go') indicating clear endorsement, though limited availability requires caution.",
