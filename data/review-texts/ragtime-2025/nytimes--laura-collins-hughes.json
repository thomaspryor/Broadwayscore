  "fullText": "Joshua Henry, Caissie Levy and Brandon Uranowitz lead the glorious cast of Lear deBessonet’s inspiriting Broadway revival at Lincoln Center Theater.\n\nListen to this article · 7:19 min Learn moreShare full articleBy Laura Collins-Hughes\n\nNear the top of the musical “Ragtime,” which unfurls at the turn of the 20th century, the wealthy patriarch of a suburban family boards a ship bound for a polar expedition. His wife won’t miss him much, yet she thinks she will, and so he comforts her.\n\n“But it’s only a year,” he says. “Nothing much happens in a year. The world will not spin off its axis.”\n\nIt was almost a year ago when the brief run of Lear deBessonet’s potent “Ragtime” revival at New York City Center straddled the presidential election: apt timing for a show that rummages through an American moment to interrogate the American soul.\n\nSince then, the country has been engaged in an ever-more-fractious internal tussle about its identity and intentions, its dreams and decency.\n\nSo while deBessonet’s “Ragtime” production for Lincoln Center Theater, which opened on Thursday night at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, has much the same glorious cast it had last fall, the cultural climate has altered its alchemy. The considerable beauty of this inspiriting show — full of complicated emotions about our diaspora nation — is streaked with melancholy.\n\nFrom left, Joshua Henry, Caissie Levy and Brandon Uranowitz in Lincoln Center Theater’s Broadway revival of “Ragtime” at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Manhattan.The company’s abundance of extraordinary talent starts with its stars: Joshua Henry as Coalhouse Walker Jr., a Black pianist and new father flourishing in the era of ragtime music; Caissie Levy as an affluent white woman called only Mother, who comes into her own when her husband leaves on that expedition; and Brandon Uranowitz as Tateh, a poor Jewish immigrant newly arrived from Latvia with his young daughter.\n\nAs the plot follows the intersecting fortunes of those three characters’ families, each seeking to redeem the country’s promise at a time of tumultuous change, old-fashioned musical-theater pleasures are very much on offer: a multitudinous cast clad in sumptuous costumes; riveting vocals undergirded by a 28-piece orchestra; a sprinkling of spectacle descending from above and rising from below. It works as rousing entertainment, full stop.\n\nBut the production is also imbued somehow with a present-tense sense of civic necessity. This is simply what deBessonet, Lincoln Center Theater’s new artistic director, has done for years, notably with her productions for the Public Theater’s Public Works program. In any case, that is not a caveat.\n\nThis is, though: Adapted by Terrence McNally (book), Stephen Flaherty (music) and Lynn Ahrens (lyrics) from E.L. Doctorow’s sprawling novel, “Ragtime” can be heavy-handed in its verbiage. The story’s Coalhouse strand, albeit buoyed by Flaherty’s music, leans hard into Black tragedy and white savior tropes. The script’s sheer sweep, which incorporates sundry historical characters (look, Houdini!), presents a risk of two-dimensional pageantry.\n\nBut this revival, which opens with an enchanting little boy in short pants alone onstage, sidesteps each of those hazards as neatly as possible. Everything here is at human scale, intimate even on the vast Beaumont stage. And when the text doesn’t measure up, deBessonet’s impeccable actors elevate the artistry.\n\nIf “Ragtime” has a dominant location, it is the home in New Rochelle, N.Y., where Mother is enjoying life as head of household while Father (Colin Donnell) is away. She has plenty of company: her unfiltered, oracular child, Edgar (Nick Barrington); her restless romantic of a younger brother (Ben Levi Ross); and her brusque and racist father (Tom Nelis). The background music to their lives evokes the calliope, while their clothes whisper loudly of prosperity: elegant, tailored and in shades of cream. They look at all times ready for a game of croquet. (The set is by David Korins, and costumes are by Linda Cho.)\n\nThe day that Mother discovers an abandoned newborn in the garden, and decides to take in both infant and then mother, is the day her future joins paths with Coalhouse’s. The child is his son with Sarah (Nichelle Lewis), the woman he loved but foolishly took for granted. (Allison Blackwell, playing Sarah’s loyal friend, makes his failure indelibly clear.) In the anguished solo “Your Daddy’s Son,” Sarah pours out her pain to her baby, asking his forgiveness — and it is not Lewis’s fault that her voice is drowned out by the orchestra when the music intensifies.\n\nWhen Coalhouse goes looking for Sarah, wanting to win her back, he finds her and the baby living at Mother’s house. Sarah, upstairs, refuses week after week to see him. Resolutely, penitently, he keeps returning anyway, a charmer intent on proving his solidity. When at last she descends the steps as he plead-sings, “Sarah, come down to me,” it is as if a magnetic force pulls her to him — that or the sheer, stunning power of his voice.\n\nHenry, whose acting, like his singing, seems to emanate from his very core, earned more than one mid-show standing ovation at the performance I saw. In “Wheels of a Dream,” as he sang of the baby’s future — “When he is old enough I will show him America” — it was like hearing an echo of his “Soliloquy” in “Carousel”: another father thrilling to the possibilities that life holds for his son. (Music direction is by James Moore.)\n\nWe root for Coalhouse and Sarah’s union, and we root too for Mother, who upon her husband’s return is not about to retreat back into the acquiescent, ornamental role she used to play in her marriage. She is disgusted by his utter lack of compassion. Put out by how drastically his home has changed in his absence, Father calls Sarah’s baby “a bastard child.”\n\nMother is too much a lady to express her rancor openly, but Levy makes her a master of genteel subtlety and cool rebuffs. You can hear the death of her love when she tells Father: “I did not expect you to come home a different man but I had hoped to find you a kinder one.”\n\nOf the three principals, though, the penniless artist Tateh is the winsome one, even with all his worries. When he first encounters Mother, he is still tethering his little girl (Tabitha Lawing) to him with a rope, so petrified is he of being separated from her in this unfamiliar land. But Uranowitz endows Tateh with a sweetness that prevails over the bitterness in his life.\n\nHe is playful, funny, sympathetic. Almost inevitably, in our perception, he is also a proxy for the many faceless immigrants lately in the news. You can feel the audience willing him to achieve the American dream.\n\nTateh, Mother, Coalhouse — each of them is working to build a better country for their children.\n\n“Ragtime” is not blind to the uglier forces in the culture: bigotry, violence, misogyny, greed. The anarchist Emma Goldman (Shaina Taub) pops up throughout the show, fighting against — even delightfully hissing at — rapacious capitalists. Racism in particular has mortal consequences in this musical.\n\nIf, at the end, the script ties up the strands of its story in a way that seems overly naïve (to offer specifics would be a spoiler), it is also an optimistic vision of American social harmony.\n\nDeBessonet presents a haunting counterpoint to that in the last word of the final song. The word is “dream,” but look at the actors’ solemn faces; listen to their intonation. It does not sound like a dream ascendant.\n\nWhat is the status of our American dream? This “Ragtime” wants to know.\n\nRagtimeThrough Jan. 4 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, Manhattan; lct.org.
