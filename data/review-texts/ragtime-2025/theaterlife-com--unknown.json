  "fullText": "October 16, 2025: Lear deBessonet makes a stunning debut as the Kewsong Lee Artistic Director at Lincoln Center with her magnificent revival of the musical Ragtime (1996, Toronto; 1997, Los Angeles; 1998, New York), based on E.L. Doctorow’s 1975 novel of that name. The musical stands out as a powerful reminder of a key moment in modern American history, although its depiction of unpleasant truths about our past is not likely to land it a booking at the Kennedy Center in the immediate future. Its pertinence, however, is timeless. Tackling the vast expanse of the Vivian Beaumont stage, deBessonet uses a revolving stage on which David Korins’s minimalist but evocative scenic units—gorgeously heightened by the exceptional lighting of Adam Honoré—allows for swift movement from scene to scene. The huge (by today’s standards) cast of 41 actors smoothly navigates an episodic plot that intertwines the stories of three disparate families—white, Black, and immigrant—at the turn of the 20th century. Linda Cho’s costumes, especially her whites for the family, blacks for the immigrants, and earth colors for the African Americans, are consistently attractive, although—as so often in such shows—they allow anachronisms to mingle with authenticity. The result is a sweeping, epic that captures your attention and never lets go for nearly three hours of passionate performance. October 16, 2025: Lear deBessonet makes a stunning debut as the Kewsong Lee Artistic Director at Lincoln Center with her magnificent revival of the musical Ragtime (1996, Toronto; 1997, Los Angeles; 1998, New York), based on E.L. Doctorow’s 1975 novel of that name.

Tackling the vast expanse of the Vivian Beaumont stage, deBessonet uses a revolving stage on which David Korins’s minimalist but evocative scenic units—gorgeously heightened by the exceptional lighting of Adam Honoré—allows for swift movement from scene to scene. The huge (by today’s standards) cast of 41 actors smoothly navigates an episodic plot that intertwines the stories of three disparate families—white, Black, and immigrant—at the turn of the 20th century. Linda Cho’s costumes, especially her whites for the family, blacks for the immigrants, and earth colors for the African Americans, are consistently attractive, although—as so often in such shows—they allow anachronisms to mingle with authenticity. The result is a sweeping epic that captures your attention and never lets go for nearly three hours of passionate performance. The need to compress so much of Doctorow’s complex story sometimes leads to abrupt developments, sacrificing the novel’s richness for dramatic efficiency; much had to be omitted. Terrence McNally’s book nevertheless requires two hours and 45 minutes before concluding with the stage equivalent of the kind of postscript of what happened afterward that often follows movies before the credits roll. With its main action set in 1906, the year of the “crime of the century,” when millionaire Harry Thaw shot architect Stanford White for having an affair with Thaw’s wife, showgirl Evelyn Nesbit, the story begins around 1901-02 and concludes in 1916. Real-life contemporaries, like Black leader Booker T. Washington (John Clay III), anarchist Emma Goldman (Shaina Taub), illusionist Harry Houdini (Rodd Cyrus), industrialist Henry Ford (Jason Forbach), Admiral Peary (John Rapson), and others, make appearances in the fictional world of the three families. Washington, Goldman, and Houdini exercise their influence, respectively, on Walker, Younger Brother, and Tateh. Still, their presence is minimal compared to that in the book. The well-to-do white family, of New Rochelle, includes the humane, sympathetic Mother (Caissie Levy), the ultraconservative Father (Colin Donnell), who travels with Peary on an expedition; Mother’s Younger Brother (Ben Levi Ross), a liberal-minded explosives expert with a crush on Nesbit; and the Little Boy (Nick Barrington). Mother takes in the abandoned baby of the unwed Sarah (Nichelle Lewis) and ragtime piano player Coalhouse Walker, Jr. (Joshua Henry), who will eventually suffer the destruction of his Model-T Ford at the hands of racist whites; his and Sarah’s consequent attempts to seek justice lead to tragedy. As if the racist angle weren’t relevant enough, the narrative also has room for an anti-immigrant theme in its treatment of Tateh (Brandon Uranowitz), a poor Latvian Jew who arrives here with his young daughter (Tabitha Lawing). Overcoming oppression, he rises from a pushcart peddler of his handmade silhouettes to pioneer silent film director, thereby meeting Mother in Atlantic City. These circumstances are enough for the show to mirror multiple aspects of America during the time depicted, from the civil rights struggle, to the creation of the assembly line, to sensationalistic celebrity exploitation, to the threat of domestic terrorism, to the rising popularity of ragtime, and so on. All these social themes are beautifully integrated into a show that soars from song to song with grand choral numbers balanced by awesome power ballads, performed by a company whose leads are each and every one outstanding. They are supported by a remarkably accomplished ensemble of singer-dancers kept busy morphing from background role to background role with a never-ending succession of costume changes. Although the songs don’t always advance the plot, they rarely distract from it. The show’s comedy songs include a perfectly calculated routine called “What a Game,” set in the bleachers at the Polo Grounds to which Father has brought his young son in a desperate attempt to bond over baseball. Pontificating about the higher values of the sport, Father must adapt to the crude language of the nearby male fans, and their on-the-beat expectorations, with even his Little Boy getting in one good spit. It doesn’t move the plot, but it’s an out-of-the-park home run. The title song, incorporated as a motif throughout, helps unify the narrative; ragtime-based moments, in this and other tunes, remind us of the period, but many songs are in the standard mode of Broadway anthems that could fit any period if they’re delivered with big voices and reservoirs of emotion. And, in each of the leading roles, that’s what they get, although it’s necessary to underline the performance of nuclear-powered baritone Joshua Henry as Coalhouse, a role of near operatic dimensions that once again reveals him as one of our musical theatre’s foremost talents. Seven years ago, Henry brought the house down with “Soliloquy” in a Broadway revival of Carousel; now he does the same with “Coalhouse’s Soliloquy.” Caissie Levy is wonderful throughout as Mother, but she stops the show with the exquisite “Back to Before.” I can imagine someone thinking time could be saved by cutting the song, but not after having heard Levy—who gets a standing “o”—sing the dickens out of it. And when Nichelle Lewis opens her pipes, especially in her challenging duet with Henry, “Sarah Brown Eyes,” the musical theatre heavens open and send down blessings. Brian Uranowitz as Tateh works a little too hard at pushing the Latvian immigrant persona for my taste, but you can’t deny his energetic enthusiasm. Ben Levi Ross’s Younger Brother brings a surprisingly potent voice to the role, and he gets enough out of a rabblerousing speech to inspire a round of applause. Colin Donnell’s Father, in his white suit and full beard, is an impressive, if starchily uptight, patriarch. Of the many other supporting players, I especially enjoyed the adorable Anna Grace Barlow who resembles and even sounds like a young, pre-blonde Marilyn Monroe. A few tiny things inspire niggling questions, like why is Sarah’s babe-in-arms, wrapped in swaddling clothes, as small at birth as when he’s five months old? And what kind of answer does Coalhouse expect when he asks Father to tell him about this infant son he never met? That he sleeps through the night? And how could Tateh consider his work as a director well known at a time when narrative films were just being born and the public had no idea of who the directors were, or even that they existed. But these are silly concerns in the scheme of Ragtime things. Ultimately, deBessonet’s revival is a triumph, proving Ragtime to be as resonant and necessary as ever. While minor narrative compressions and anachronisms exist, they are utterly eclipsed by the production’s sweeping grandeur, its timely exploration of America’s enduring struggles, and a succession of powerhouse vocal performances that stir the soul. This is a magnificent, emotionally charged production that not only honors its source material but thrillingly reaffirms the musical’s place as a defining and urgent American epic.
