  "dtliExcerpt": "Ragtime culminates with two huge 11 o’clock numbers, from Henry and Levy, a Tony-winner and Olivier-nominee whose names are rightfully big draws to the show. Yet the showstopping vocal moment still fresh in my mind is that of Lewis, who offers a haunting rendition of “Your Daddy’s Son.” Overall the trio of book writer Terrence McNally, composer Stephen Flaherty, and lyricist Lynn Ahrens meet in harmony: the characters connect, the score dazzles and the 28-piece orchestra more than rises to the occasion, accompanied by an ensemble of pitch perfect vocalists.",
