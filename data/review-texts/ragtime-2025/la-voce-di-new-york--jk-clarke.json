    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows positive assessment ('compelling', 'impactful') but qualified language ('without losing too much') suggests some reservations. Limited text warrants low confidence and mid-Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view, noting the story is compelling and impactful. However, the phrase 'without losing too much' implies some reservations. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, the score is on the lower end of Positive. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the repackaging of the story, but the phrase \"without losing too much along the way\" indicates some reservations. Given that this is the only excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the production's impact and storytelling, with only minor qualification ('without losing too much'). As a single curated excerpt, confidence is low.",
