Photos by Matthew Murphy\n\n*****/***** (five stars out of five)\n\nThere are very few things that equal the grandeur and pageantry of a perfectly executed, epic Broadway musical. As such, they are rare birds, indeed, surfacing at unexpected intervals. The latest such occurrence is the Lincoln Center revival of Ragtime: The Musical, Terrence McNally’s well-crafted interpretation of E.L. Doctorow&#8217;s seminal 1975 historical novel. Helmed by the fabulously talented Lear deBessonet, who manages to unite the story’s many and sundry threads with the deftness of a ringmaster, Ragtime conveys Doctorow’s complex historical snapshot with its intended gravitas and emotion in a mere two hours and 45 minutes.\n\nAt the heart of Ragtime is a tale of gross injustice that triggers a tragic, albeit understandable, spree of revenge. The victim, Coalhouse Walker, Jr. (Joshua Henry, who nearly steals the show with his emotive and overwhelmingly perfect singing), is a Harlem pianist so successful that he’s able to buy a Model-T Ford. Venturing to New Rochelle to find his estranged love, Sarah (Nichelle Lewis), and their newborn baby, who’ve taken refuge with a local family—known only as Mother, Father, Mother’s Younger Brother, Grandfather and The Little Boy, to emphasize the homogeneity of upper class, white suburban families—after Sarah’s perceived rejection by Coalhouse, Walker is repeatedly harassed by the local fire brigade, particularly a racist Irish immigrant, Willie Conklin (Jacob Keith Watson, who plays several other characters with remarkable versatility), who leads a group of colleagues to beat Walker and steal (and destroy) his vehicle.\n\nWalker’s consequent rage, and the eventual murder of Sarah at the hands of police, has hints of parable: the earnest man wronged who is refused justice because he is not part of the dominant sector in society (in this case, because he is black). Doctorow deftly points out the irony that Conklin is an Irish immigrant, a group that faced very serious discrimination (job postings often read “No Irish need apply”) in the United States in the mid-19th century on into the time the story takes place (1905-1915); yet, he is a virulent, violent bigot of the variety that continues (to a lesser degree, fortunately) to infect our society. Rather than turn the other cheek, Walker engages in vigilantism, killing several of his oppressors, then holds a standoff in the Morgan Library in Manhattan. Doctorow craftily fictionalizes many historical figures in the novel (many of whom appear in the musical)—such as J.P. Morgan, Booker T. Washington, Evelyn Nesbit and Emma Goldman—to subtly point out the systemic nature of Jim Crow-esque, societal rules that segregated black Americans and enforced a second (or lower) class status, despite the repeal of slavery 50 years prior.\n\nThe musical’s additional storylines, which echo the themes of discrimination against the “other,” include the arrival of the Jewish immigrant widower Tateh (terrifically played by the always amazing Brandon Uranowitz), and his adorable, doting daughter, generically labelled “The Little Girl” (wonderfully portrayed by Tabitha Lawing). Though their journey in the land where “anyone can succeed” starts out painful and unpromising, Tateh’s artistic skills and savvy help turn him into a well known film director and he eventually begins a relationship with Mother (the delightful Caissie Levy) who has left her boorish husband. The message is clear: the American dream is available to all comers, no matter how hard it seems at first . . . unless you’re black. This is starkly illustrated when the famed Admiral Peary, on his way to the North Pole, refers to ships full of immigrants as “future customers,” and his black First Officer rejoins, “my people were brought here on ships,” and is summarily dismissed.\n\nPerhaps the show’s only shortcomings are the trivialization of significant historical figures who are far better fleshed out in the novel. But McNally, along with lyricist Lynn Ahrens, manage to tell the story quite well within the time constraints and in spite of Stephen Flaherty’s passable, yet unexciting music (actual Ragtime music is far more entertaining). However, historical figures like Harry Houdini and Stanford White are not only misrepresented (Houdini is shown as a spiritualist, when in fact he spent much of his life debunking mysticism), but add nothing to the production. Equally trivialized is Emma Goldman, a complicated, ferocious anarchist who fought for equality and workers rights, resulting in her eventual deportation. Here, unfortunately, she’s played by the twee Shaina Taub, who once again puts on an almost pollyanna-ish air (as she did in her Tony-winning suffragette musical, Suffs), that betrays a significant lack of understanding of these important historical figures. In Ragtime, Taub’s Goldman is a cheerleader, not a revolutionary.\n\nLargely due to time constraints, Ragtime: The Musical succeeds best as a paean to a complicated and wondrous time in American history. Presented in a largely operatic, sung-through style with very little standalone dialog, deBessonet’s enormous cast (41 actors!) fill the stage with excitement and movement (Ellenore Scott’s choreography is subtle and effective) in almost every scene. Linda Cho’s extraordinarily lush period costumes coupled with Adam Honoré’s intricate and often intimate lighting turns even ensemble characters into vibrant parts of this bustling snapshot of a time gone by.\n\nTaken as a whole, however, Ragtime does what every adaptation should: to re-package a compelling story in a visually and emotionally impactful way without losing too much along the way—and perhaps even adding to it. Ragtime allows us to look at a moment in history, warts and all, and still savor its importance\n\nRagtime.
