The language suggests a strong recommendation, but due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights the director's success and the visually stunning staging, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited text and single excerpt, the score is placed in the middle of the 'Positive' bucket.",
