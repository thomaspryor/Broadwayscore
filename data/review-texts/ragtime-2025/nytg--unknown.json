  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Pirates! The Penzance Musical comes with a stacked cast and a nearly 150-year history of Broadway adaptations. With such an iconic piece of theatre, any change is bound to stir the pot. But perhaps what makes this version such a smash is that at its core, it's exactly what Gilbert and Sullivan created the original to be: a fun, silly, nonsensical laugh with the lightest plot and a great big happy ending to wrap it all up.\"",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the production is a \"smash\" and \"fun, silly, nonsensical laugh,\" suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited text, I'm scoring it in the middle of the positive range.",
