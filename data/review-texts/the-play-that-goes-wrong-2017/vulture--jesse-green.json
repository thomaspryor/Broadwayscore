  "bwwExcerpt": "Farce is not an acquired taste; even babies laugh at pratfalls. Rather, farce is the taste you fail to grow out of - and thank God, because sometimes only the stupidest fun will do. If this is one of those times, then \"stupidest fun\" should probably be plastered on the walls of the Lyceum, where The Play That Goes Wrong, a backstage comedy created by England's Mischief Theatre Company, is opening tonight. It's so ridiculous it makes you feel almost ashamed to love it.",
