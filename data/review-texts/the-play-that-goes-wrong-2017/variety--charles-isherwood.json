    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Praises the cast's execution and commitment while acknowledging the show's limited premise. Positive but measured assessment. | GPT-4o: The review praises the cast's execution and commitment, suggesting a positive experience despite the show being described as an 'extended sketch'. | Gemini: The review describes the show's premise and praises the cast's execution, but doesn't offer a clear recommendation for or against seeing it. It falls into the 'Mixed' category. | Kimi: While praising the cast's 'admirable precision and commitment,' the critic characterizes the show as merely an 'extended sketch,' suggesting limited substance. The extremely brief excerpt prevents determination of a clear recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Positive, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Mixed",
