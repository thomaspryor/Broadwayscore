  "bwwExcerpt": "You either go for this sort of thing or you don't -- I don't, particularly, but I was in the minority at a recent performance. \"The Play That Goes Wrong\" works best when you believe the actors are in real danger. There are times you do. I might've enjoyed it as a 70-minute romp. As things stand, for me at least, a comedy this tired just can't be right.",
