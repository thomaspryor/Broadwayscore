  "bwwExcerpt": "\"The Play That Goes Wrong\" sometimes threatens to outstay its welcome and dissipate its considerable charms over time. There is, after all, a fine line between repetition for comic effect and the tedium of beating a punchline until it is good and dead. But the Broadway production is considerably tighter than the one that played two years ago on London's West End...For much of its two-hour running time, \"The Play That Goes Wrong\" offers a hilarious tribute to the spirit of the theater and the man",
