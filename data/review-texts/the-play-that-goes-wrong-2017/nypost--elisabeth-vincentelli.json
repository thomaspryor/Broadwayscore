    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it a 'delightful disaster that works,' indicating a positive recommendation for a show that succeeds through deliberate comic incompetence. The paradoxical praise suggests skilled execution of apparent amateurishness. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as a 'delightful disaster' that 'works,' indicating a positive recommendation despite some reservations about its chaotic nature. | Gemini: The review calls the show a 'delightful disaster,' which suggests a mixed reaction. It acknowledges both positive and negative aspects, fitting the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: Despite labeling the show a 'disaster,' the critic uses the affectionate modifier 'delightful' and explicitly states the production 'works,' praising the tremendous skill involved. The oxymoronic phrasing suggests an appreciation for intentional messiness, though the extreme brevity/truncation prevents a higher confidence rating.",
