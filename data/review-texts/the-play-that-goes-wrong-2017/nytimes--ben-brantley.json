(And no, the White House doesn’t qualify.) Such is the brutal allure of monster truck jams, videos of toddlers falling off trikes and steel-cage wrestling matches.\n\nThat is also the appeal of Mischief Theater’s “The Play That Goes Wrong,” which opened on Sunday at the Lyceum Theater and is as close to a demolition derby as we are likely to see on Broadway. This knockabout farce out of London, where it has been running for more than two years and won the Olivier Award for best comedy, is devoted entirely to destroying itself before your eyes.\n\nSo take a long look at the uncurtained stage when you arrive. You will see a tacky, cheerful simulacrum of a classically creepy English manor drawing room. (Nigel Hook did the self-immolating set.)\n\nNow try to envision the ways that this set, which ominously includes an upstairs and an elevator, might be violently dismembered by a cast of really bad, really clumsy actors. Whatever visions of chaos your imagination summons, the odds are that this show’s artfully hapless team will exceed them.\n\nBy now, you should have read enough to know whether “The Play That Goes Wrong” is for you or not. If you feel that it is, be advised that it is perfectly O.K., and possibly preferable, to see it after a couple of drinks or in the glazed condition that comes from too many sleepless nights.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",
