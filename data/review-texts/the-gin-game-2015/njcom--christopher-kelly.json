  "bwwExcerpt": "There's probably not much that a pair of old pros like James Earl Jones and Cicely Tyson couldn't put over on stage. At age 84, he still possesses that haunting, deep bass voice; is still capable of sliding like quicksilver from gentle humor to powerhouse authority. At age 90, she still looks ethereal and commands attention despite that tiny frame and sometimes whispery manner...They generate considerable laughs alongside moments of quiet tenderness, and each actor find moments to shine and other moments to relinquish the spotlight -- it's a duet with glorious solos. Where this 'Gin Game' stumbles is in its second half, when Coburn's play takes a series of dark turns and the two characters begin mercilessly attacking one another. Except director Leonard Foglia and his actors don't entirely take those turns alongside Coburn, preferring instead to keep the tone broad and semi-jokey...The result feels a little too much like empty calories; a 'Gin Game' that goes down exceedingly easy, but leaves you hungry for real substance.",
