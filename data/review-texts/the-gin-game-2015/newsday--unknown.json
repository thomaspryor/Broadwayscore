  "bwwExcerpt": "The multi-award-winning virtuosos, who have worked together at least five other times, manage to play off the intimate rhythms of one another while still making us believe that their characters begin as strangers...Directed with leisurely sensitivity by Leonard Foglia, the production lets the balance of powers shift and flow through the games of gin that Coburn uses as a device to weave the characters' bond. Tyson, in fuzzy light brown curls and an omnipresent handbag, has a simplicity that makes everything look easy. Jones, mostly in old windbreakers and a scowl, uses a showy technique to suggest how hard the volatile Weller works to hide his own isolation. Both are estranged from their families and, after a while, we start to understand why.",
