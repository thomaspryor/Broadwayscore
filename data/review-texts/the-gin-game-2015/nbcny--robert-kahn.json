  "bwwExcerpt": "In case the prospect of old age and its frailties doesn't already frighten you, allow me to direct your attention to the lonesome and raw revival of D.L. Coburn's 'The Gin Game'...Nothing in director Leonard Foglia's ('Master Class') update of 'The Gin Game' is stylized...As Weller, a decaying businessman who was outmaneuvered by his partners, Jones wears clothes that are sizes too big, making him seem literally a man smaller than he once was. Jones seethes and seethes as Fonsia wins and wins, building up to a crescendo of ire that terrifies her...Tyson shuffles across the stage like a once-powerful woman not used to having to be careful with her body. It's a perfectly ladylike performance, until it's time to put the screws to her verbally abusive new friend, and then she really lets him have it. Jones and Tyson, it will surprise no one, make for lively sparring partners.",
