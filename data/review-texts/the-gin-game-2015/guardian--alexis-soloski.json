  "bwwExcerpt": "Jones and Tyson are actors of expertise, originality and allure, and it is pleasant to watch them disport themselves on Riccardo Hernandez's shabby set. Under Leonard Foglia's indulgent direction, Jones cavorts through Weller's frailties and rages, using his walking stick as crutch and club. Weller counts out loud when he deals the cards and you can hear the amusement Jones finds in each pedantic number. Tyson, clutching her purse like body armor, alternates primness with fervor. She can bring dignity to a terrycloth bathrobe and that is saying something. Her voice is much thinner and shriller than Jones's (everyone's is), but it carries.",
