  "bwwExcerpt": "One thing you should probably not bet against at 'The Gin Game' on Broadway is the little old lady onstage who seems to have supernatural luck with cards. Another is the two-person cast, James Earl Jones and Cicely Tyson...The handsome and beautifully acted revival of D.L. Coburn's Pulitzer Prize-winning play...about two lonely, alienated nursing home residents is directed by Leonard Foglia, who has put an emphasis on the play's humor. That makes for an enjoyable evening but also makes the come-out-of-nowhere ending a gut-wrencher...Jones curses up a storm, pushes for faster games and slaps the cards down on the table in hopes of winning just a single hand. Tyson plays her little old lady with a stutter-step and tentativeness to her gait, but a mind sharp and stinging. There's a girlish glee that comes over her as each new round ends with her victory. Watching them together is a sheer honor.",
