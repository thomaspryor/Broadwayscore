  "bwwExcerpt": "....it's not just lean, it's anorexic. Other than the two leading characters, everyone seems like a cartoon cutout. I respect economical writing and understand the use of archetypes but it seems out of balance with the human and romantic aspects it clearly wants to make. What's the show's future?: Still to be determined but for a summer show in the Berkshires it's one of the hottest tickets and the musical has much to be admired, several terrific numbers and a fine ensemble.",
