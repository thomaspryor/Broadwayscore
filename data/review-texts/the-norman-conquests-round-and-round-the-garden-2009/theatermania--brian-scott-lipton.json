    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('superb cast', 'effortless and inevitable') but only one excerpt available, so confidence is low. Upper end of Positive range due to unqualified praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the director and cast, describing the production as 'effortless and inevitable,' suggesting a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the director and cast, suggesting a strong positive experience. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt uses unambiguously positive language ('superb', 'effortless and inevitable') indicating a strong endorsement, though with only one curated excerpt available, confidence in the overall verdict is reduced.",
