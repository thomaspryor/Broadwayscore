    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for direction and cast with superlative language ('superb', 'effortless and inevitable'), but confidence is low due to single excerpt that may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the director's work and the cast, indicating a strong positive impression. The use of 'superb' and 'effortless and inevitable' suggests a solid recommendation, though the single excerpt limits full context. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the director and cast, indicating a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the cast and direction, describing the production as 'effortless and inevitable,' indicating a clear recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full review's tone.",
