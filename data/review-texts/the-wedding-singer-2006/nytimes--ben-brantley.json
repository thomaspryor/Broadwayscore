The wedding cake comparison suggests it's sweet but forgettable, neither recommending nor discouraging attendance. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'genial' and 'edge-free', suggesting it is pleasant but lacking in impact or excitement. The tone is neutral, neither strongly recommending nor discouraging attendance. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"genial\" and \"edge-free\", suggesting it is pleasant but lacks depth or excitement. This indicates a mixed reaction, not strongly recommending or discouraging it. | Kimi: The critic offers faint praise, describing the show as genial and effective for its intended audience but implying it lacks edge or substance through the 'wedding cake' metaphor.",
