    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt appears to be primarily promotional text and cast/crew listings rather than critical evaluation, making it impossible to determine the critic's actual recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the musical as 'thrilling' and highlights its dynamic score and thematic depth, suggesting a positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of explicit strong recommendation, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the musical as \"thrilling\" and highlights its themes of self-discovery and belonging, suggesting a positive experience. However, without the full review, it's difficult to gauge the extent of the enthusiasm, so a score in the lower-middle of the 'Positive' range seems appropriate.",
