With only one excerpt available and no clear evaluative language from the critic, scoring must be conservative. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the musical as 'thrilling' and highlights its dynamic score and themes of friendship and belonging, suggesting a positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the musical as \"thrilling\" and highlights its exploration of self-discovery, suggesting a positive overall impression. However, due to the limited text and single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively within the positive range.",
