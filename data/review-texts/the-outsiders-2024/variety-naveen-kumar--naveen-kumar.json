  "fullText": "Tough guys with a soft side have long held a firm grip on the American imagination. S.E. Hinton's novel \"The Outsiders,\" about a cadre of down-and-out boys, has been read by millions of restless adolescents since it was published in 1967, when the author herself was a teenager. Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 film, stacked with before-they-were-A-list hunks including Rob Lowe and Matt Dillon, ushered in the Brat Pack era of moviemaking that paid serious attention to young people and their discontents.",
