  "fullText": "Emma Pittman and Brody Grant in 'The Outsiders' (Photo: Matthew Murphy) The Outsiders sparkles not just as a smart adaptation of the beloved S.E. Hinton novel (and Francis Ford Coppola movie) but a genuinely great American musical. The songs here, by the indie folk duo Jamestown Revival (with Justin Levine) don’t feel like pro forma music breaks but organic engines driving a tragic story of class conflict and brotherly love to onstage moments with real heft. Plus, the score boasts a country-inflected energy and lyrics that match the plainspoken poetry of Robert Frost. Who says that nothing gold can stay?

The absence of any negative or mixed signals suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: Despite the truncated text, the review praises the musical as a \"genuinely great American musical\" and highlights the quality of the songs and their integration into the story. This suggests a positive recommendation, though the lack of a definitive conclusion warrants a score in the lower end of the positive range.",
