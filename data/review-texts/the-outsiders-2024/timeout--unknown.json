  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Part of what makes this revival so absorbing is that you don't always know where to lookat the actor on stage or the same actor live on screen. The giant images tug at your eye; you sometimes can't help choosing them over the small, real person who is actually there. In this revival, itself a kind of re-production, that doesn't feel like a gimmick or a trick. It's a new way to see an old dream.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic finds the revival 'absorbing' and praises the innovative use of screens as 'a new way to see an old dream' rather than dismissing it as gimmicky, indicating a positive recommendation despite only having one excerpt. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the absorbing nature of the revival and its innovative approach, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the single excerpt and text quality warning, the confidence is medium and the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review describes the revival as \"absorbing\" and a \"new way to see an old dream,\" indicating a positive, though perhaps not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. The focus on the unique staging suggests it's worth seeing for that aspect alone.",
