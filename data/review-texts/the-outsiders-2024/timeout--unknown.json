The giant images tug at your eye; you sometimes can't help choosing them over the small, real person who is actually there. In this revival, itself a kind of re-production, that doesn't feel like a gimmick or a trick. It's a new way to see an old dream.\"",

However, the lack of a full review and explicit recommendation results in a medium confidence level. | Gemini: The review describes the revival as \"absorbing\" and a \"new way to see an old dream,\" suggesting a positive, albeit not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation.
