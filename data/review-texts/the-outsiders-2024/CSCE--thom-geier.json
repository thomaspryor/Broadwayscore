Hinton novel (and Francis Ford Coppola movie) but a genuinely great American musical. The songs here, by the indie folk duo Jamestown Revival (with Justin Levine) don’t feel like pro forma music breaks but organic engines driving a tragic story of class conflict and brotherly love to onstage moments with real heft. Plus, the score boasts a country-inflected energy and lyrics that match the plainspoken poetry of Robert Frost. Who says that nothing gold can stay?
