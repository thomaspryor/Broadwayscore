However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the actress's command and the director's choices, suggesting a positive experience. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low, and the score is conservatively placed within the positive range.",
