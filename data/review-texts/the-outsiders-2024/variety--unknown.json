Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, describing the performance and staging as \"magic\" and pushing each other to \"grand extremes.\" This suggests a recommendation, although the lack of full context warrants a score in the middle of the positive range.",
