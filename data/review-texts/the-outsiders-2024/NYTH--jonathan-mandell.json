  "fullText": "Posted in Broadway , New York Theater , Theater Reviews The Outsiders Broadway Review Author: New York Theater Published Date: April 11, 2024 Leave a Comment on The Outsiders Broadway Review In “The Outsiders,” opening on Broadway tonight, an exciting cast of gifted young performers, a lovely if little-varied folk and country score, and some thrillingly muscular, almost cinematic choreography are all employed to tell a story that’s been told many times before. Rival teenage gangs? Angsty adolescents? Kids who put grease in their hair? It’s hard to avoid comparisons to, among others, “West Side Story&#8221; and “Grease.” But of course the most unavoidable comparison – which is both boost and burden – is to the two landmark works on which “The Outsiders” is directly based. S.E. Hinton famously wrote her novel about teenagers from Tulsa Oklahoma who divide into Greasers and Socs, when she herself was still a teenager in Tulsa Oklahoma, inspired by what she witnessed in her high school. &#8220;The Outsiders,&#8221; published in 1967, not only remains a consistent best-seller; it’s not only among the best-selling young adult novels of all time; it’s the book credited with launching the Y.A. genre. It is routinely assigned in middle schools and high schools – but also banned by some schools and libraries because of its depiction of violence, smoking, drinking, foul language and family dysfunction (which surely adds to its popularity.) The 1983 movie that Francis Ford Coppola made of the book – which he dedicates “to the people who first suggested it be made: Librarian Jo Ellen Misakian and the students of the Lone Star School in Fresno, California” &#8212; may be unique in the absolute number of future stars whose careers it helped launch: Tom Cruise before Risky Business, Ralph Macchio before The Karate Kid, Patrick Swayze before Dirty Dancing, Matt Dillon, Emilio Estevez, C. Thomas Howell, Diane Lane, Rob Lowe (I left a few out.) It can be no coincidence that the promotional photos (on the Playbill cover, on the show&#8217;s homepage etc) evoke memories of one of the movie posters. Both novel and movie have the protection of iconic status; the novel has a niche readership (ages 13 to 18?) The Broadway musical has no such protection, and a skeptical constituency. Yet it presents the story with little alteration. While there are undeniably touching moments in the story, Broadway theatergoers might feel some of the plot dated in its melodrama. “Teen-agers today want to read about teen-agers today,” Susan Hinton wrote in an essay published when she was 19 years old; she’s now 75. The Greasers: (Top Row) Jason Schmidt (Sodapop Curtis), Renni Anthony Magee (Steve), Daryl Tofa (Two-Bit), Tilly Evans-Krueger (Ace), Sky Lakota-Lynch (Johnny Cade), Joshua Boone (Dallas Winston), Brent Comer (Darrel Curtis); (Front Row) Brody Grant (Ponyboy Curtis) The creative team has made a few changes, most noticeably the demographics of the Greasers. One character is female, a tomboy named Ace (Tilly Evans-Krueger) and several are portrayed by performers of color (while all the performers who portray Socs are white.) This implies racial tensions. But nothing in the lyrics or the dialogue suggest anything other than that class division drives the story, which is centered around, and narrated by, 14-year-old Ponyboy Curtis (Brody Grant.) The Curtis House: Brody Grant as Ponyboy, Jason Schmidt as Sodapop Curtis, Brent Comer as oldest brother Darrel Curtis, Sky Lakota-Lynch as Johnny Cade Ponyboy is an orphan (his parents died in a car crash) who lives with his two older brothers (Brent Cromer and Jason Schmidt) on the East Side, the Greasers’ side of Tulsa, which is falling apart. He is picked on by the Socs. “We call them Socs cause they live like socialites,” Ponyboy sings in “Tulsa ’67,” the first song in the show. The Socs live on the West Side, where: “The grass is always greener and the streets are always clean All the girls are pretty there And all the guys are mean” The Socs at the Drive in: (Top Row) Barton Cowperthwaite (Brill), Dan Berry (Paul), RJ Higton (Chet), Kevin William Paul (Bob), Emma Pittman (Cherry Valance), Melody Rose (Beverly); (Front Row) Sean Harrison Jones (Tripp) Ponyboy meets the prettiest of the Soc girls, Cherry (Emma Pittman) at the local drive-in, where they feel a connection, in part because they read books, unlike anybody else in their respective circles. His rapport with Cherry antagonizes the meanest of the Soc guys, Bob (Kevin William Paul), Cherry’s jealous boyfriend. This leads to a series of violent and tragic events, just as in the novel and the movie, that principally involve Ponyboy’s best friend Johnny (Sky Lakota-Lynch), but also the alpha Greaser Dallas (Joshua Boone.) The story is told with a score by the Texas-born duo Jamestown Revival and Justin Levine, which has a sometimes lilting sometimes hard-charging Southwestern country sound infused with heartfelt harmonies.
