The lack of full context suggests a conservative score within the 'Rave' bucket. | Gemini: The review uses extremely strong positive language, calling the revival \"giddily thrilling\" and Scherzinger's performance \"one of the greatest performances I've ever seen.\" This clearly indicates a Rave review.",
