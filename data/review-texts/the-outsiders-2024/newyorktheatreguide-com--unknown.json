  "fullText": "'The Outsiders' review — adaptation of the classic novel rumbles with talentRead our review of The Outsiders on Broadway, a new musical adaptation of S. E. Hinton's classic 1967 novel now playing at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre.\n\nThe Outsiders, an always earnest and intermittently gripping new musical at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre, boasts elements that will make you sit up and take notice.\n\nDirector Danya Taymor’s energizing staging is one of them, while a choral moment so rousing it takes you by surprise is another. Brody Grant, a Broadway newcomer whose emotion-etched acting and vocals point to a bright star in the making, is another source of bragging rights.\n\nGrant does the heavy lifting as Ponyboy Curtis, an orphaned 14-year-old who’s caught in a gang war between the working-class “Greasers” and well-off “Socs” (as in socialites) in 1967 Tulsa, Oklahoma. Can this smart, sensitive teen outrun a dead-end destiny and, to quote the script, “stay gold”?\n\nS. E. Hinton’s 1967 novel and Francis Ford Coppola’s 1983 movie version asked the same question. The musical's book writers, Adam Rapp (The Sound Inside) and Justin Levine, stay close to those sources while reshaping some dramatic moments for their adaptation. One is the fate of Ponyboy’s elder pal. The storytelling earns applause for accessibility, but it can get mired in cliches.\n\nThe score by Jamestown Revival (Jonathan Clay and Zach Chance) and Levine is likewise uneven. Moody folk- and bluegrass-flavored songs fit the setting. “Great Expectations,” Ponyboy’s aspirational solo amplified by other voices, is a highlight, but many songs are too heavy with exposition. Limp lyrics like “the grass is always greener” stick out for the wrong reason.\n\nChoreographers Rick and Jeff Kuperman put the show in gymnastic, muscular motion. The climactic gang war surges in such stylized, cinematic fashion that my audience actually cheered. Despite its flaws, The Outsiders is ready to rumble.\n\nThe Outsiders explores class conflict, loyalty, and the search for identity among adolescents. The musical is based on Hinton’s young adult novel that’s a fixture on school reading lists, and Coppola’s film adaptation featuring C. Thomas Howell, Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Ralph Macchio, Rob Lowe, and Diane Lane.\n\nAmid the many Greasers and Socs in the story, the focus is on the exceptional Ponyboy, who gets by with his brothers Sodapop (Jason Schmidt) and Darrel (Brent Comer) and besties Johnny (Sky Lakota-Lynch) and Dallas (Joshua Boone). Ponyboy makes an unexpected connection with well-to-do Cherry (Emma Pittman).\n\nAs The Outsiders unfolds, you can’t help but recall the Sharks and Jets from the classic musical West Side Story. But the similarities are actually superficial. Unlike Tony and Maria, romance doesn’t spark between Ponyboy and Cherry – just a warm understanding of what it’s like to be broken. The Outsiders is about brotherhood – whether blood or choice — and protecting it at all costs.\n\nThe world of The Outsiders is a gritty one, and the Broadway production reflects that. The set (designed by AMP featuring Tatiana Kahvegian) is an abandoned lot strewn with old tires, blocks, and a beat-up car. The space transforms into a home, a drive-in movie, a church, a park with a fountain, a hospital through shifts in lighting and props.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Taymor’s fine cast delivers. Lakota-Lynch shines as Johnny Cade. As Ponyboy’s big brother, Comer casts a strong presence – one wishes his songs were more varied.\n\nPrior to opening night, The Outsiders had an overall 90% rating on Show-Score.\n\nThe Outsiders boasts terrific performances and imaginative staging. You’ll want to be inside the Jacobs Theatre to see it.\n\nLearn more and get The Outsiders tickets on New York Theatre Guide. The Outsiders is at the Bernard B.
