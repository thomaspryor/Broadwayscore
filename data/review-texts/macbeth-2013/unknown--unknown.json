    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic describes the production as 'overthought' and 'unsure of its welcome' despite acknowledging strong star power. This suggests disappointment with the execution, but with only one excerpt available, the full verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view of the production, describing it as 'overthought' and 'unsure of its welcome,' indicating a lack of confidence in its appeal. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the production is \"overthought\" and \"unsure of its welcome,\" indicating a negative assessment. Given that this is a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates the critic finds the production 'overthought' and suggests it struggles to find an audience willing to 'meet it halfway,' faulting the approach despite the star cast.",
