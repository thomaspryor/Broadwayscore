  "bwwExcerpt": "In a second viewing of this National Theatre of Scotland production, Cumming is even more verbally dexterous and dynamic...Directors John Tiffany and Andrew Goldberg layer the production with spooky sounds and moody music and keep Cumming on the move...Even with all that, this solo stab at the Bard proves to be a case of diminishing returns. The concept becomes less interesting as it goes on. Shakespeare completists will be intrigued. Audience members unfamiliar with the story and who's who will",
