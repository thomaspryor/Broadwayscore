  "bwwExcerpt": "Not only does this street-clothes production do away with any sense of regality, save for a luxurious robe Craig wears in the second act (costumes by Suttirat Larlarb), but Gold's vision is to make Macbeth as 'approachable' as possible. A pre-show speech by the hilarious Michael Patrick Thornton informs us of Shakespeare's time writing this as a plague raged through England and people turned toward the supernatural. It's close to the audience interactions famously espoused by traditional Globe productions - which a note in the Playbill unwisely evokes - but this attempt to appeal to the everyman becomes tiresome.",
