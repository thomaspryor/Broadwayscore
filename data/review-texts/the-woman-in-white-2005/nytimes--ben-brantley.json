No redeeming qualities mentioned. | GPT-4o: The review describes the musical as lacking clarity and focus, with a negative tone suggesting it is not worth seeing. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"perpetual fog bank\" and \"never quite come into focus,\" indicating a negative assessment of the musical. | Kimi: The critic employs strong negative metaphors of fog and gauze to describe the production as unclear and poorly conceived, though the text appears truncated before delivering a final verdict.",
