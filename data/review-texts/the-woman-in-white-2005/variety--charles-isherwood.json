The overall assessment is against recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the musical adaptation is not successful, with the only positive note being the 'occasionally stirring score'. Overall, it does not recommend the show. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the musicalization was not worthwhile, despite some positive aspects of the score, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: The critic delivers a definitive negative verdict that this particular classic should not have been musicalized, offering only faint, qualified praise for the composer's score.",
