The overall recommendation is negative. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the musicalization was not worthwhile, despite some positive aspects of the score, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: The review delivers a clear verdict against the show, stating it is not worth musicalizing, while only offering faint praise for the score.",
