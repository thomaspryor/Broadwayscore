  "bwwExcerpt": "A story that might have worked as a door-slamming stage farce ends up having no reason to sing. Musicals generally require sweeping sentiments, and while Almodovar's 'Women on the Verge' has charm to burn, it lacks the emotional depth of the director's later, richer movies, or even the molten melodrama of earlier works like 'Law of Desire.'",
