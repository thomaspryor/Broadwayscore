  "bwwExcerpt": "Jeffrey Lane's script skims over the story's frenetic events hurriedly, following the screenplay rather than making theatrical capital from it; David Yazbek's songs, some of which have possibilities, seem eager to weave themselves into the context, like movie music, instead of rising to show-music heights. And, though I never imagined I'd write this sentence, Bartlett Sher's direction lacks clarity, and Christopher Gattelli's choreography lacks point.",
