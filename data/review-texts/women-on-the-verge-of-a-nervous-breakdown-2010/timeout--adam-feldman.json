  "bwwExcerpt": "The frustrating thing about Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown is that it is not bad; it is merely unready. Had the show opened out of town, many of its narrative troubles might have been fixable. (The current version exhibits scars of last-minute show-doctoring.) But in its current form, it seems lost among the streets of Madrid—always on the verge of breaking through, but finding itself instead in the soup.",
