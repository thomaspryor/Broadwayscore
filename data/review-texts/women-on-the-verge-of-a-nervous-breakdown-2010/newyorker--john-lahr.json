  "bwwExcerpt": "'Women on the Verge' is a farce, and this poses a strategic challenge for a musical. Farce is about momentum, which is hard to sustain in musicals, where the songs require the actors to stand and deliver. 'Women on the Verge' meets the stop-start rhythm problem best in Laura Benanti's manic, sensational number as the model Candela, 'Model Behavior,' in which she skitters from phone to phone, babbling about her shallow life. The show's best and most moving song, 'Invisible'—Lucia's psychological aria about her lost life, superbly performed by LuPone—breaks the farce convention and just about gets away with it. In the end, with admirable effort, 'Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown' picks up speed and flies, but never quite high enough.",
