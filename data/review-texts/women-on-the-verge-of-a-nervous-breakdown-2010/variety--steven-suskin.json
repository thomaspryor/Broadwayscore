  "bwwExcerpt": "The recipe for gazpacho is scrawled large across the curtain at Lincoln Center Theater's 'Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.' Like the dish in question, the new Almodovarsical is refreshing, peppery and palate-cleansing, but it is still, in the end, cold tomato soup -- invigorating and highly spiced, but not satisfying enough for a full meal or a full evening's entertainment. Tuner is blessed with some delicious performances and any number of items of interest, but the result can be summed up as women (and men) on the verge of a coherent musical.",
