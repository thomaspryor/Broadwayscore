  "bwwExcerpt": "Despite its flaws, I still must recommend warmly this musical. Songs like 'Model Behavior' (performed by a deliciously playful Laura Benanti), 'Yesterday, Tomorrow and Today' (Brian Stokes Mitchell), 'Tangled,' and 'Invisible' (Patti LuPone) are gems that will stay with you after you leave the theatre. And if the production doesn't bring all the expected beauty, joy, and intensity, it's still worth spending time with these women and men in search of love.",
