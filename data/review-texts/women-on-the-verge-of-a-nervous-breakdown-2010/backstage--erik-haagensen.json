  "bwwExcerpt": "It took me a while to understand my disappointment in Lincoln Center Theater's musical adaptation of Pedro Almodóvar's 1988 film 'Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,' now at the spectacularly restored Belasco Theatre. There had been much to enjoy: Jeffrey Lane's frequently funny book, David Yazbek's perfectly professional Latin-infused songs, a stellar cast at the top of its game, and Bartlett Sher's fluid staging that combines with a highly imaginative physical production to capture Almodóvar's idiosyncratic visual style and editing rhythms. Yet the show hadn't jelled. Eventually, a light dawned. 'Women' is what composer Mary Rodgers calls a 'Why?' musical. It has no compelling reason to sing; it's just the original property with songs dropped in.",
