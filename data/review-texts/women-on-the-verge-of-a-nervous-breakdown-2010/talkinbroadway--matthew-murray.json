However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the songs for lacking narrative and character development impact, suggesting a negative view of the show's effectiveness. The confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates that the songs are pleasant but ultimately detrimental to the show, suggesting a negative overall assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates the songs, while pleasant musically, fail dramatically by not advancing plot or character and stopping the show's momentum. With only one curated quote available, confidence is reduced.",
