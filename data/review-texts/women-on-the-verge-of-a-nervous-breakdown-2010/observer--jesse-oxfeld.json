  "bwwExcerpt": "Mr. Yazbek's Spanish-inflected music is upbeat and catchy, and his smart lyrics are sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. The costumes (by Catherine Zuber) are awesomely bright and zany (her leopard-print Spy-vs.-Spy ensemble for Ms. LuPone's entrance deserves its own Tony), and the sets (by Michael Yeargan) are similarly spectacular.",
