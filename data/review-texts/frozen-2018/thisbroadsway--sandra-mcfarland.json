She is stunning and radiant on the stage and she sings as if the music was made for her...Murin is equally impressive as the free spirited Anna with a powerful voice...Talented ensemble...There are some wonderful new additions to the score and the blockbuster anchor song 'Let It Go' gets a whole new life on a set of magical illusion created with beautiful lighting and projections.\" \n\nRead more",
