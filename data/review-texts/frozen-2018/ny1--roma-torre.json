  "bwwExcerpt": "Full disclosure: 'Frozen' is not my favorite Disney princess movie. Loved the message and the song, but the story seemed pretty convoluted even by Disney standards. As a musical, the plotting remains weak, but there is a special magic that only live theatre can produce, and it's working a charming spell on the Broadway stage.",
