  "bwwExcerpt": "Full disclosure: 'Frozen' is not my favorite Disney princess movie. Loved the message and the song, but the story seemed pretty convoluted even by Disney standards. As a musical, the plotting remains weak, but there is a special magic that only live theatre can produce, and it's working a charming spell on the Broadway stage.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite criticizing the plotting as 'weak', the critic finds the stage production creates 'special magic' and 'charming spell'. Single excerpt limits confidence, but the positive theatrical experience outweighs story concerns. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses reservations about the plot but acknowledges the 'special magic' of the live theatre experience, suggesting a mild recommendation. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review acknowledges weaknesses in the plot but states that the live theatre production has a special magic and is working a charming spell. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive with reservations. | Kimi: While the critic criticizes the weak plotting, they praise the 'special magic' and 'charming spell' of the live production, offering a qualified but clear recommendation to see the show.",
