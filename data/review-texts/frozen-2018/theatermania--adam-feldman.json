However, it doesn't express overwhelming enthusiasm, so I've placed it in the lower end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The critic praises the creative team's successful translation of the source material and appreciates the organic expansion of the world, using clearly positive language ('organic rather than forced'). However, the text appears truncated without a final verdict, warranting low confidence.",
