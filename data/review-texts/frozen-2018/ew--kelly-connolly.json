  "bwwExcerpt": "Grandage is a director accustomed to Shakespeare and therefore to people trapped by secrets - even in the midst of glittering sets and impressive snow tricks, the bond between the sisters effectively and literally takes the spotlight. Fans of the movie will be pleased to find Anna and Elsa safe in Levy and Murin's gloved hands, and doubters may just find their hearts thawed.",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive reception, highlighting effective direction and performances. The mention of 'doubters may just find their hearts thawed' implies a strong recommendation even for skeptics, suggesting a higher score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review suggests that fans of the movie will enjoy the show and that even doubters may be won over, indicating a positive, though not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the direction, technical design, and lead performances, explicitly stating that the show satisfies fans of the film and can win over doubters, indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited available text.",
