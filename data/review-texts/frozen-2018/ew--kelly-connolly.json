  "bwwExcerpt": "Grandage is a director accustomed to Shakespeare and therefore to people trapped by secrets - even in the midst of glittering sets and impressive snow tricks, the bond between the sisters effectively and literally takes the spotlight. Fans of the movie will be pleased to find Anna and Elsa safe in Levy and Murin's gloved hands, and doubters may just find their hearts thawed.",
