This suggests a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the show is neither a disaster nor a transcendent experience, placing it squarely in the mixed category. | Kimi: The critic explicitly places the production in middle ground, stating it avoids failure but falls short of excellence, indicating an unenthusiastic, middling assessment.",
