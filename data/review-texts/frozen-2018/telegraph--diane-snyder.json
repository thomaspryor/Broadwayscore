  "bwwExcerpt": "They play it safe. While the film was Disney's non-traditional take on the time-honoured princess tale - with spirited sisters finding their way back to each other instead of marrying handsome princes - this is not a daring reinvention of the material, but a repackaging of the film for the stage. It's the surest way to please the movie's faithful fans. Although darker than its predecessor in tone and design (sets and costumes are by Olivier winner Christopher Oram), this new Frozen is brisk and entertaining for most of its two hours and 20 minutes, with the same characters that won the hearts of filmgoers brought to three-dimensional life.",
