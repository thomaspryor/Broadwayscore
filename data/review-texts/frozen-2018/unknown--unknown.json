    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review acknowledges some successful elements ('sometimes rousing') but emphasizes more negative aspects ('often dull', 'long descent into confusion', failure to blend elements). This is a single curated excerpt which may not represent the full verdict, warranting low confidence. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt describes the show as 'sometimes rousing, often dull,' with a 'long descent into confusion.' The lack of coherence and blending issues suggest a negative impression, though the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a mixed assessment, noting both successful and unsuccessful aspects of the production. The language suggests an uneven experience, justifying a 'Mixed' classification. | Kimi: The excerpt describes a production that is occasionally rousing but often dull, with a promising opening that gives way to a confusing blend of styles and tones.",
