    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. Acknowledges positive elements (catchy songs, spectacular staging) but identifies a significant structural flaw (story stretched thin). No clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 places it in the Mixed bucket. The review highlights positive elements like catchy songs and spectacular staging, but also notes a significant flaw in the story's pacing. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive aspects (catchy songs, spectacular staging) and a significant negative (thin story, length). This indicates a mixed reaction, aligning with the critic's rating of 60. | Kimi: The review balances praise for the catchy songs and spectacular staging against criticism of the thin, overstretched story. The critic's own 60/100 rating confirms a mixed assessment with notable reservations.",
