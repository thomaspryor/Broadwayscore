  "bwwExcerpt": "The Broadway version, though, is the virtual opposite: a play-it-by-the-book rendering of the story that, in refusing to take any real risks, ends up undermining the story's core message -- namely, that sometimes you've got to 'let it go,' and let your freak flag fly. For a show about magic and wonder, there's shockingly little on display here.",
