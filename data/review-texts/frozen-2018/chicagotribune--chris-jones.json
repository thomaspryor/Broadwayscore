  "bwwExcerpt": "Vastly improved from its rocky Denver tryout, director Michael Grandage's heavily sold production of Disney's 'Frozen' is set to open here Thursday night, replete with richer storytelling, less extraneous comedy and with its crucial pair of sisters, who in Denver seemed all iced up in some chilly corner of the castle, finally letting go enough emotionally to thaw the center of their mutually dependent story.",
