  "bwwExcerpt": "For its new stage musical \"Frozen,\" Disney should've heeded the sage advice of Queen Elsa: Let it go. Broadway should be the place to see what you can do, to test the limits and break through. No right, no wrong, no rules for thee - you're free! But that's wishful thinking. With \"Frozen,\" the House of Mouse doesn't let us in, doesn't let us see. Stays the good Mouse it always has to be. Conceals, doesn't feel. Doesn't let us know. Well, here's what I know: \"Frozen\" is not a very good show.",

Overall, it is an enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review calls the show a 'dazzling spectacle' which indicates a positive experience, but the 'even if it doesn't always leave you humming' suggests a reservation, placing it in the positive bucket with a score in the middle. | Kimi: The review offers enthusiastic praise for the production's visual impact and emotional power ('dazzling', 'breathless') with only a minor reservation about the memorability of the score.",
