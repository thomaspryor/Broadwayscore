  "bwwExcerpt": "Under the direction of Michael Grandage, Frozen doesn't entirely go wrong, but it does evince signs of the struggle to establish a consistent, unifying tone and to settle on a center in a story inherently bifurcated by having two heroines kept apart for most of the action. It ends up being merely adequate, a bland facsimile when it should have been something memorable in its own right.",

However, the brevity of the review limits the confidence level. | Gemini: The review is positive, calling the show a \"gorgeous spectacle\" and highlighting its emotional core. This indicates a recommendation, though without extreme enthusiasm. | Kimi: This excerpt offers unqualified praise for the production's visual spectacle and emotional storytelling, clearly indicating a positive recommendation despite the limited context.",
