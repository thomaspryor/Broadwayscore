  "bwwExcerpt": "In addition to Oram's monumental icescapes, Finn Ross' video and projection design gives the impression that the St. James stage, proscenium and beyond is freezing before our very eyes. Kudos, too, to Jeremy Chernick's special effects and Peter Hylenski's sound design, which, when it isn't blasting out Levy's high notes, manages to make us believe that a new ice age is upon us.",
