  "bwwExcerpt": "Grandage is incredibly well-served by a cast of terrific actors and singers, led by the phenomenal Caissie Levy as Elsa. She brings real complexity to her powerful vocals. She doesn't just belt her songs out, she performs them with a voice rich in emotion. In this way the over-familiar Let it Go, that ends the first act, is made to feel fresh. The song soars. She is perfectly partnered with the more vulnerable Patti Murin as Elsa's sister Anna. A strong bond clearly exists between the actors as well as their characters. There's also adorable work from Andrew Pirozzi as the agile reindeer Sven and Greg Hildreth as a puppeteer snowman Olaf, while Timothy Hughes brings a formidable physicality to the character of Pabbie.",
