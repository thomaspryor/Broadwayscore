(Couldn’t they at least hook her up to a gelato machine?) Nor is it the warmheartedness of her sister, Anna, which puts her at constant risk of unelective cryogenesis.\n\nNo, the precious gift causing so much anxiety at the St. James Theater is the 2013 blockbuster film from which the stage musical has been adapted. After all, $1.3 billion in box office is a lot of ice.\n\nIn ways that are both successful and not, you can feel the director, Michael Grandage, and his design team (sets and costumes by Christopher Oram; lights by Natasha Katz) straining to make something artistically worthy of the property’s commercial promise. At least in comparison with the tryout I reviewed in Denver in September, they’re getting closer.\n\nThe show’s masterly first 20 minutes, for instance, have been significantly rejiggered since Denver, and show Mr. Grandage getting the back story squared away swiftly. As little girls, Elsa and Anna, princesses of Arendelle, are loving besties until their parents, the king and queen, are forced to separate them once Elsa’s leaky magic grows powerful enough to threaten Anna’s safety.\n\nBehind the scenes at the New 42nd Street Studios, the building where Broadway rehearses. Featuring “Margaritaville,” “Pretty Woman,” child stars and cronuts.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",

He acknowledges improvements from the tryout and praises the 'masterly first 20 minutes,' but the overall tone suggests neither strong recommendation nor dismissal. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'sometimes rousing, often dull,' indicating mixed feelings. While there are improvements noted since the Denver tryout, the overall tone suggests a balance of positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review uses mixed language like \"sometimes rousing, often dull, alternately dopey and anguished.\" While it acknowledges improvements since the Denver tryout, it doesn't offer a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The review describes the show as 'often dull' and 'dopey' while acknowledging 'sometimes rousing' moments and a 'masterly first 20 minutes.' The critic notes improvements from the Denver tryout but suggests the production is still 'straining' to achieve artistic worth. The text appears truncated, preventing a clear view of the final verdict.",
