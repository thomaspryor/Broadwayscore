    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges Mamet's dialogue skills but finds the production lacking in substance and depth. 'More heat than light' suggests surface drama without meaningful insight. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the production for lacking depth and fully exploring its themes, suggesting it is more style than substance. | Gemini: The review suggests the production has some merit in its dialogue but ultimately doesn't fully explore its themes, indicating a mixed or lukewarm assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges Mamet's skill with dialogue as a positive attribute, but the dominant critique is that the production favors superficial heat over substantive illumination, failing to adequately explore its thematic material.",
