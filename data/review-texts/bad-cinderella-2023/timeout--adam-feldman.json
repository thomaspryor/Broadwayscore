    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic acknowledges 'appealing qualities' but frames the overall experience as a 'missed opportunity,' indicating neither a recommendation nor strong discouragement. The original 40 rating confirms this mixed assessment. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 40 aligns with a Negative bucket. The review suggests the show fails to deliver on its potential, despite some positive aspects. | Gemini: The review acknowledges \"some appealing qualities\" but ultimately concludes it's a \"missed opportunity,\" indicating a negative assessment. The critic's rating of 40 aligns with the Negative bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 40/100 places this firmly in the Negative range (35-54), and the text confirms this verdict: faint praise ('some appealing qualities') is overwhelmed by the central criticism that the production 'feels like a missed opportunity.'",
