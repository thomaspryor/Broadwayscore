  "bwwExcerpt": "The score, by Lloyd Webber and lyricist David Zippel, goes in one ear and comes out the other without troubling anything in between. You are unlikely to remember much of it, except the oft-repeated title-song motif—which has an advantage coming in, since it shamelessly evokes “In My Own Little Corner,” from Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella—and perhaps “Only You, Lonely You,” a ballad that Dobson delivers with suitable ardor. Directed sleekly by Lloyd Webber loyalist Laurence Connor, Bad Cinderella is the kind of show that seems destined to be left behind. It’s a shiny glass slip-up.",

The text indicates disappointment and a lack of meaningful impact, fitting the Negative bucket. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the show feels like a missed opportunity, indicating a negative assessment. The critic's rating of 40 further supports this classification. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges 'some appealing qualities,' the dominant verdict is that the production fails to meaningfully update its source material. The provided rating of 40 aligns with the Negative bucket (35-54), indicating a disappointing but not devastating assessment.",
