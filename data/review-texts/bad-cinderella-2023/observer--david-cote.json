  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Book writer Emerald Fennell may think she’s flipped the script on the story of an abused stepdaughter, a fairy godmother, glass slippers and a fateful ball. But her fable of spunky iconoclasm versus glam conformity makes little sense and inspires zero sympathy.”\n\nRead more",
  "bwwExcerpt": "The fact that Genao is a poor actor with a grating, nasal voice, and negative comic timing makes Cinderella less appealing than the gyrating cartoons around her. Pairing Fennell’s quippy and shallow book with lyricist David Zippel’s strenuously slangy lyrics and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s lugubrious, syrupy music might have screamed cross-generational synergy on paper, but it’s a woeful marriage: TikTok meets grandfather clock.",
