However, this is only a single excerpt, so confidence is medium rather than high. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is clearly negative, describing the show as 'muddled and momentum-less' and 'isn't good'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic states the show \"isn't good\" and describes it as \"muddled and momentum-less,\" indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
