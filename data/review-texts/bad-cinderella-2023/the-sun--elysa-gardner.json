  "bwwExcerpt": "Mostly, though, “Bad Cinderella” delivers as a tonic, fueled by Mr. Lloyd Webber’s diverting-enough score — infused, predictably, with rock bombast and a couple of earworm melodies — and brisk, sometimes bawdy comedy, with the latter particularly well served by the cast. For this 75-year-old musical theater veteran’s latest creative journey, it’s as happy an ending as anyone could have expected.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review calls it a 'tonic' and 'as happy an ending as anyone could have expected,' but qualifiers like 'diverting-enough' and the modest expectations suggest reserved praise. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a 'tonic' with a 'diverting-enough score' and 'brisk, sometimes bawdy comedy,' suggesting a positive experience. The mention of a 'happy ending' further supports a positive verdict. However, the single excerpt warning reduces confidence. | Gemini: The review states the show \"delivers as a tonic\" and has a \"diverting-enough score\" and \"brisk comedy.\" This suggests a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates mild recommendation with qualified praise; terms like 'diverting-enough' and 'as anyone could have expected' suggest solid but not enthusiastic endorsement of the production.",
