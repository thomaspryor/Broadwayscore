Instead, it’s surprisingly vulgar, sexed-up and dumbed-down: a parade of hustling women in bustiers and shirtless pec-rippling hunks.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic explicitly states the show lacks positive qualities of its source materials and describes it as 'vulgar, sexed-up and dumbed-down.' However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show for lacking the qualities of previous adaptations and describes it negatively as 'vulgar, sexed-up and dumbed-down'. The tone is strongly negative, suggesting a pan. | Gemini: The excerpt uses negative language like \"vulgar\", \"sexed-up\", and \"dumbed-down\", indicating a negative assessment of the show. Given that it is only a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous criticism, finding the production vulgar and inferior to previous adaptations, with no redeeming qualities mentioned. Scored conservatively given limited context.",
