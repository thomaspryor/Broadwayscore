  "showScoreExcerpt": "The book of \"Bad Cinderella\" plays like a series of unfunny \"Saturday Night Live\" sketches. Laurence Connor (who also directed the earlier London production) has given the show no particular style and each scene seems to be in different genre. The show can’t decide if it is taking place now - with its references to rock band Guns N’ Roses (parodied in the song “Buns ‘n’ Roses”), its use of both diversity and inclusion, a female Vicar, its erotic baker, reference to a “spare” prince, and its shirtless muscle hunks seen in the palace gym – or the Middle Ages.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt is clearly negative, calling the book 'unfunny' and criticizing the lack of style and coherence. However, with only one excerpt available and text cut off mid-sentence, confidence is low - the full review verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show for lacking style and coherence, comparing it to unfunny sketches, which suggests a negative view. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is negative, criticizing the book, direction, and lack of style. Given it's an excerpt, I'm scoring it as negative rather than pan, with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers specific criticisms of the book ('unfunny'), direction ('no particular style'), and tonal inconsistency without mentioning any redeeming qualities. While harsh, the language falls short of the extreme condemnation typical of a Pan.",
