This is a clear pan with no redeeming qualities offered. | GPT-4o: The review is strongly negative, criticizing the show for lacking fairy-tale magic and coherent dramatic logic. The tone suggests a complete lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses very negative language, stating the musical is designed to appeal to no one and lacks magic and logic, indicating a strong dislike. | Kimi: The critic delivers a harsh verdict, describing the show as appealing to 'no one' and lacking both 'fairy-tale magic' and 'coherent dramatic logic,' indicating a complete failure of the production.",
