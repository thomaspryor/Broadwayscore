    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Pan) - using median score | Claude: The critic calls the show the 'cheesiest and crudest' and finds even its moral message nonsensical. However, this is only one excerpt from a longer review, so confidence is low as the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'cheesiest and crudest,' and criticizes the moral inconsistency, indicating a strongly negative review. However, with only a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is negative, calling the show \"cheesiest and crudest.\" Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the tone suggests a negative recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers harsh condemnation using superlatives like 'cheesiest and crudest' and attacks the show's fundamental logic, indicating a strong pan. However, confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Pan",
