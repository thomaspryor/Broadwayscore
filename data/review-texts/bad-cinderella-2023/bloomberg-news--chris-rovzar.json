  "bwwExcerpt": "The creators behind the new musical Bad Cinderella were at least clever about one thing: They claimed the word “bad” as their own before it could be used against them. Handily, there are many other useful terms to describe the production: “prurient,” “ill-conceived,” “non­sensical,” “overlong” and “icky.”",

However, confidence is low since this is only a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strongly negative terms to describe the production, suggesting a deep pan. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses extremely negative language to describe the production, such as \"prurient,\" \"ill-conceived,\" \"nonsensical,\" \"overlong,\" and \"icky.\" | Kimi: The review offers exclusively condemnatory language, labeling the show 'prurient,' 'ill-conceived,' 'nonsensical,' and 'icky,' which clearly places it in the Pan category. Confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation, but the sentiment is unambiguously hostile.",
