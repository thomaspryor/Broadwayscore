    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Single excerpt suggests the critic finds the show worse than just 'bad' - specifically calling it unoriginal, which is presented as worse than being outright bad. However, with only one curated quote available, the full review sentiment is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is strongly negative, criticizing the show for being unoriginal, which is considered worse than being bad. Given the lack of full context and only one excerpt, the confidence is low, but the sentiment is clearly negative. | Gemini: The single quote available is negative, stating the show is unoriginal. Given the limited context, confidence is low, but the statement is clearly a negative assessment. | Kimi: The single excerpt delivers a clear negative verdict, explicitly calling the show 'bad' and criticizing it as 'unoriginal.' Given this is the only available curated quote, confidence is low, but the sentiment is unambiguously negative.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Webber’s limp score does little to help the production’s case. He stuffs it with sweet songs that tickle the ears, but never latch on to the heart. Genao and Dobson are great vocalists — but need time or meatier material to morph into memorable ones. Director Laurence Connor instructs his bubblegum ensemble to deliver lines with such rabid zeal (really clench your fist here, keep those lips pursed there) that actors appear to be mocking their own material. Carmello and McLean — both veterans — are the only players that sit in the ridiculousness of their characters’ hubris as if intrinsically motivated by it. They deliver sublime comedic performances, especially in the shade-throwing number “I Know You.”",
