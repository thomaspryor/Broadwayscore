Single excerpt warning noted, but the criticism is substantive and unambiguous. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'flimsy' and 'uninspired', with no confidence in its characters, suggesting a negative view despite some humorous elements. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as flimsy, uninspired, and lacking confidence, indicating a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as structurally weak ('without a thesis') and lacking inspiration or confidence in its characters, despite acknowledging humorous moments from McLean.",
