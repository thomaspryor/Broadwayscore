Single excerpt warning noted, but the criticism is substantive and unambiguous. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'flimsy' and 'uninspired', with no confidence in its characters, suggesting a negative view despite some humorous elements. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as flimsy, uninspired, and lacking confidence, indicating a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as structurally weak ('without a thesis') and lacking inspiration or confidence in its characters, despite acknowledging humorous moments from McLean.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Despite McLean’s humorous victories, Bad Cinderella is a flimsy, uninspired shadow that invests no confidence in its characters and chugs along without a thesis. It takes a familiar story and a veteran Broadway composer, hoping this will be enough, but at what cost? What is the musical trying to do, if even the possibility of spectacle or entertainment is hampered by its misogyny?",
