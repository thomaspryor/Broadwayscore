However, single excerpt warning requires caution as the full review context is missing. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'hyped-up', 'over-caffeinated', and 'increasingly tiresome', indicating a negative view. Despite acknowledging nice melodies, the overall tone is critical. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"loses its way,\" \"wastes,\" and \"increasingly tiresome,\" indicating a negative assessment of the show. | Kimi: While acknowledging Lloyd Webber's melodies are among his best in decades, the critic states they are wasted on a production described as 'tiresome,' 'smugly arch,' and directionless, indicating a clear recommendation against seeing the show.",
