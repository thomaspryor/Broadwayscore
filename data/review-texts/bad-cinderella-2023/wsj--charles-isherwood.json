  "showScoreExcerpt": "“ ‘Bad Cinderella’ both celebrates the discarding of traditional ideas of attractiveness, and what place they might take in relationships, and at the same time doubles back and affirms them. In any case, it’s not a musical that warrants serious analysis.”\n\nRead more",

However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests ambivalence, noting the musical's contradictory themes and stating it doesn't warrant serious analysis, indicating a lack of strong recommendation or dissuasion. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a mixed message about the show's themes and ultimately concludes it's not worth serious analysis, suggesting a lukewarm reception. The 'Read more' implies the excerpt is truncated, lowering confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt dismisses the show as thematically confused and undeserving of serious critical engagement, indicating the critic does not recommend it. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
