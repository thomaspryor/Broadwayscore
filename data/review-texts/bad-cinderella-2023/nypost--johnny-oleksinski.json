    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Pan) - using median score | Claude: Strong negative language calling the show 'a mess' and 'perplexing and often dull', but confidence is low due to truncated text with unclear full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as a 'mess' and 'perplexing and often dull,' indicating a strong negative opinion. The lack of a clear recommendation and the use of negative descriptors suggest a pan. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as a \"mess\" and \"perplexing\", indicating a negative assessment. The critic questions the purpose of watching it. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as a 'mess' that is 'perplexing and often dull,' with the critic questioning the very purpose of the production, indicating a strongly negative verdict. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Pan",
