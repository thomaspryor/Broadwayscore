  "showScoreExcerpt": "Lloyd Webber’s least original musical….\nit’s the sort of show that an undemanding theatergoer, or one in the right mood for it, might find fun. I didn’t find it much fun. I wasn’t horrified, just disappointed. Disappointed by the tunes, from a composer who has delivered distinctly memorable songs over the past half century. Disappointed that the book makes no sense\n\nRead more",

However, this is only an excerpt and the measured tone ('wasn't horrified') suggests mid-Negative range rather than a pan. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses disappointment with the show, particularly with the tunes and the book. The tone suggests a negative verdict, though not a complete pan, as the critic was not horrified but rather let down. | Gemini: The review expresses disappointment with the music and book, and the critic explicitly states they didn't find it fun. | Kimi: The critic calls this Lloyd Webber's 'least original musical' and expresses explicit disappointment with the tunes and book, stating they 'didn't find it much fun.' While acknowledging undemanding audiences might enjoy it, the overall verdict is clearly negative.",
