    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic calls the show a 'mess' and criticizes it for following a formulaic approach. However, with only one excerpt available, this could be cherry-picked negativity from a more balanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show as a 'mess' and implies a negative view of the writing and formulaic approach. However, without the full review, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is negative, indicating issues with the writing and adherence to a formula. Given the single excerpt and negative tone, I've classified it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic explicitly calls the show a 'mess' and criticizes the writers for relying on formulaic Disney princess tropes, indicating a clear negative verdict.",
