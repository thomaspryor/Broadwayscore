    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Pan) - using median score | Claude: The critic calls the show 'trite' and 'inflated' and criticizes its lack of wit and intelligence. This is clearly negative assessment, though with only one excerpt available, confidence is medium. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'trite' and 'inflated', suggesting a lack of quality and intelligence. The tone is strongly negative, indicating a pan. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is clearly negative, calling the show \"trite\" and \"inflated.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring in the negative range, but not too low. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers an unambiguously negative verdict, dismissing the show as trite, inflated, and intellectually lacking with no redeeming qualities mentioned. Given the single-excerpt warning, confidence is low, but the harsh tone clearly places this in the Pan range. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Pan",
