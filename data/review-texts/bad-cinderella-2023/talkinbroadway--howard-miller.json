    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Critic finds the show fundamentally flawed ('way out of balance') with the title character 'misplaced and underutilized' and design elements 'overwrought'. However, single excerpt warning applies - this could be one negative section of a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights significant issues with the balance and utilization of the title character, as well as criticism of the visual elements. The tone suggests a negative impression, but with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show is \"way out of balance\" and the title character is \"misplaced and underutilized.\" This suggests a negative assessment, but due to the limited excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the show's structural imbalance, underutilization of the title character, and finds even the visual design overwrought, indicating a clear negative verdict, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full review's tone.",
