  "bwwExcerpt": "Well, “Bad Cinderella” (which was originally titled simply “Cinderella” when it premiered in London, which might have caused some consumer confusion) is splashy, campy, lightweight, overcharged, strident, and slight. If not necessarily bad, “Bad Cinderella” (which often feels like “Cinderella” combined with “Shrek” and “Clueless”) isn’t exactly great either.",

Single excerpt warning applies - this appears genuinely mixed rather than cherry-picked positive. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'splashy, campy, lightweight, overcharged, strident, and slight,' and concludes that it is 'not necessarily bad' but 'not exactly great either,' indicating a mixed sentiment. The single excerpt provides limited context, leading to low confidence. | Gemini: The review uses mixed language like \"splashy, campy, lightweight, overcharged, strident, and slight\" and states it's \"not necessarily bad\" but \"isn't exactly great either,\" indicating a mixed assessment. The confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: The critic uses ambivalent language ('not necessarily bad' but 'isn't exactly great') and negative descriptors (lightweight, strident, slight) without actively discouraging attendance, indicating a middling, unenthusiastic assessment.",
