  "showScoreExcerpt": "“[It’s] like a hormonally confused teenager, riddled with conflicting impulses and given to impulsive lurching in different directions. Everyone involved seems convinced it is a dazzlingly original twist on a classic fairy tale: Cinderella is feisty! She has agency! She's no princessy pushover! It's a trope stated so regularly you can set your watch by it. But despite such gritted-teeth determination, Bad Cinderella is a strangely rudderless enterprise. This Cinderella is all dressed up with nowhere to go.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt heavily criticizes the show as 'rudderless' with 'conflicting impulses' and dismisses its feminist angle as tired tropes. However, this is only one excerpt from a longer review, so the full verdict may be different. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'rudderless' and 'riddled with conflicting impulses', suggesting a lack of coherent direction and execution. The critic implies the show fails to deliver on its intended originality, leading to a negative assessment. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"hormonally confused teenager\", \"conflicting impulses\", \"impulsive lurching\", and \"strangely rudderless enterprise\", indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The single available excerpt condemns the show as directionless ('rudderless enterprise,' 'nowhere to go') and unoriginal, with no positive elements mentioned. Given this is a curated excerpt and clearly negative, it falls in the lower range of the Negative bucket.",
