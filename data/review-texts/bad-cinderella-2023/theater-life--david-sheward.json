    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt explicitly calls the show 'disappointing' and 'lowbrow parody' that is 'shallow.' Despite being a single curated excerpt, the language is clearly negative with no redeeming qualities mentioned. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'disappointing' and 'shallow,' indicating a negative view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt explicitly states the show is \"disappointing\" and \"shallow\", indicating a negative assessment. Given that it's a single excerpt, the confidence is medium. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as 'disappointing' and 'shallow,' criticizing its failure to deliver on its thematic premise. With only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low, but the evaluative language is clearly negative.",
