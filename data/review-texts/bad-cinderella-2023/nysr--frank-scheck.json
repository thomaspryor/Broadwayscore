    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: 2/5 stars with devastating language throughout: 'terrible show,' 'sheer cynicism,' 'atrocious lyrics,' 'blandly generic score.' Even acknowledging a few performer highlights, the overall verdict is complete rejection with no recommendation to see it. | GPT-4o: The review is largely negative, highlighting issues with the book, score, and overall execution. While there are some praised performances, the overall tone suggests disappointment. The original 2/5 star rating supports a negative classification, but the text is truncated, so the final verdict may be missing. | Gemini: The review is largely negative, citing a weak score, atrocious lyrics, and a cynical enterprise. While there are some positive mentions of individual performances, the overall assessment is unfavorable, aligning with the 2/5 star rating. The truncated text warning lowers the confidence. | Kimi: The 2/5 star rating and consistently harsh criticism of the book ('sophomoric'), score ('blandly generic'), and lyrics ('atrocious') place this firmly in the Negative bucket, despite praise for Carolee Carmello's performance as a 'saving grace.'",
