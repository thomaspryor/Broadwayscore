  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Cromer’s sensitive direction and Yazbek’s music and lyrics capture the feelings and growth of overnight friendship between the two, and Shalhoub and Lenk persuasively play their roles. The friendship that develops between Israeli and Egyptian is critical to the theme that we are all humans who seek a sense of belonging...This is a sweet, heart-warming and charming musical. The show is suited for everyone, but it might be a bit slow-moving for some theatergoers.\"\n\nRead more",
