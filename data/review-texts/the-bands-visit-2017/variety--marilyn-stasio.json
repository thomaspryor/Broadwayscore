  "bwwExcerpt": "The set's a bit grander and the music sounds richer, but success hasn't spoiled this embraceable musical fable about the surprising friendships that bloom in the middle of a political desert. In this Broadway transfer of an Off Broadway hit, human error sends an Egyptian military band to a depressed Israeli outpost in a desert wasteland - and human connections bring Arabs and Israelis together on common ground.",
