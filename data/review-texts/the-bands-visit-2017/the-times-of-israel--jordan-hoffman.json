  "bwwExcerpt": "After a fruitful run Off-Broadway, \"The Band's Visit\" has moved to the Great White Way and it is a tremendous success. Though certain aspects of the film can never be replaced, like the deadpan imagery in some of its cinematography and the marvelous performance by Sasson Gabai, the stage version takes a small cinematic curiosity and enlarges it to something bold and unforgettable.",
