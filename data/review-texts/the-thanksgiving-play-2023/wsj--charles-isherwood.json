Gathered in a high-school classroom in an unnamed city are the director, Logan, played with her usual savory comic panache by two-time Tony winner Katie Finneran, and three actors.\n\nLogan’s boyfriend, Jaxton (Scott Foley), is among the cast. He prides himself on his yoga practice and his status as a street-performing local fixture. “I have a day job, but that’s not what’s important in the story of me,” he earnestly says. Caden (a lively Chris Sullivan), an elementary-school teacher, has been designated the “history specialist,” and exudes excitement over the project. His animation grows when the third cast member, the comely-and-she-knows-it Alicia (D’Arcy Carden), a professional actress lured from Los Angeles, breezes into the room late, incredulous that she had to take a bus when her Uber app mysteriously disappeared.\n\nScott Foley and Ms. Finneran Joan Marcus",
