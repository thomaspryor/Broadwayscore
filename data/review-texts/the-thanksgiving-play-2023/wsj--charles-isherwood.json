Gathered in a high-school classroom in an unnamed city are the director, Logan, played with her usual savory comic panache by two-time Tony winner Katie Finneran, and three actors.\n\nLogan’s boyfriend, Jaxton (Scott Foley), is among the cast. He prides himself on his yoga practice and his status as a street-performing local fixture. “I have a day job, but that’s not what’s important in the story of me,” he earnestly says. Caden (a lively Chris Sullivan), an elementary-school teacher, has been designated the “history specialist,” and exudes excitement over the project. His animation grows when the third cast member, the comely-and-she-knows-it Alicia (D’Arcy Carden), a professional actress lured from Los Angeles, breezes into the room late, incredulous that she had to take a bus when her Uber app mysteriously disappeared.\n\nScott Foley and Ms. Finneran Joan Marcus",

However, the text is clearly truncated and missing the final verdict, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review calls the play \"rambunctiously funny\" but also \"overstretched.\" While truncated, the initial description leans positive, suggesting a recommendation with reservations. Confidence is low due to the truncated nature of the text. | Kimi: The review offers qualified praise, calling the show 'rambunctiously funny' and the production 'spiffy' with strong comic performances, but the significant criticism that it is 'overstretched' keeps it from a clear recommendation. Given the text is truncated and the final verdict may be missing, confidence is low.",
