  "garbageFullText": "With so much turmoil in the world, it’s at least a little comforting that things haven’t changed much in Grover’s Corners, the place that gives Our Town, Thornton Wilder’s beloved 1938 report from Smalltown USA, its name. People there are born, love and die without so much as looking up to savor what they have. That’s life.\n\nAnd while a check-in from the fictional New Hampshire town circa 1901-1913 is always a moving and welcome addition to anyone’s frazzled day, the new staging by Kenny Leon, opening on Broadway tonight at the Ethel Barymore Theatre with a cast that includes Jim Parsons, Katie Holmes, Richard Thomas, Billy Eugene Jones, Ephraim Sykes and Zoey Deutch, lacks the strong personality that would send it to the top of the many Our Towns that have staked claims on the world’s stages for nearly a century.\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'Bug' Cancels Final Broadway Preview Due To Cast Illness; Opening Night Still Set For Tomorrow\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\tBelow The Line\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Grammys, Tonys & More\n\nLeon, a top-notch director who has done recent work that is both more exhilarating (Purlie Victorious) and more revelatory (Home), here makes a few attempts at diversifying and era-defying Wilder’s classic without offering a complete re-think that might have brought fresher life to the theatrical chestnut.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWatch on Deadline\n\nOn Beowulf Borritt’s gorgeously simple set design – all distressed wooden planks, vertical and horizontal, beautifully lantern-lit by Allen Lee Hughes – that fits well with Wilder’s preferred limited-scenery aesthetic – the large cast of actors from wildly disparate worlds forms a melting pot of Americana. Jim Parsons, who plays a charmingly deadpan Stage Manager, has long since made the jump from sitcom stardom to become one of New York’s busiest stage actors, just as co-star Richard Thomas did years ago after he left The Waltons (one of the few popular entertainments that could rightly lay claim to rivaling Our Town in homespun sincerity). Katie Holmes has a nicely varied resume of TV, film and stage credits, Zoey Deutch makes her Broadway debut after a career largely in film, while Billy Eugene Jones, Ephraim Sykes and Michelle Wilson bring some serious stage chops to the proceedings. Downtown theater legend Julie Halston is on hand for the show’s best comic moments.\n\nTrue, few of the cast members are on stage long enough to make overlarge impressions, and those that are – with the exception of Parsons – don’t always make the most of the opportunity. Holmes and Thomas are gentle presences but little more, Sykes and Deutch, as the childhood sweethearts who marry and, in the play’s heart-tugging final segment, face life’s final act, are better individually than together. (Deutch does fine, though, in her big scene at the end when, allowed a brief return to the earthly realm, her Emily learns the painful lessons of life’s fragility and swiftness.)\n\nThe production’s signature contribution to the Our Town legacy is a chancy meld of historical eras and cast demographics. The latter works well, with a mix of ethnicities and religions speaking cogently to the universality of Wilder’s tale. The play’s action is even preceded by the cast singing “Braided Prayer” by Abraham Jam, an initially cacophonic mix of Muslim, Jewish and Christian prayers and hymns that slowly coalesces into something lovely.\n\nA later outburst of a modern-sounding smooth R&B gospel duet is more jarring than compelling, and the same might be said of Dede Ayite’s costume design, which nods toward various decades – early 20th Century gentility for some of the adults, ’90s sleeveless sweats, shorts and backwards caps for the teens, and some choices that just confound, most notably an unidentifiable blend of Desperately Seeking Susan Madonna and Meet Me In St. Louis Tootie for Deutch’s doomed Emily.\n\nThe final section of Wilder’s play – the three acts are performed without an intermission in this production, with Parson’s Stage Manager having some fun explaining away any confusion – is one of American drama’s most foolproof scenes, and Leon and his cast pull it off nicely. The gulf between the town’s grief-stricken living and the cemetery’s reconciled dead is at once harrowing and comforting. The juxtaposition just might be Wilder’s greatest contribution to American drama, a case Leon’s Our Town makes with conviction.\n\nTitle: Our TownVenue: Ethel Barrymore Theatre, BroadwayPlaywright: Thornton WilderDirector: Kenny LeonCast: Jim Parsons, Zoey Deutch, Katie Holmes, Billy Eugene Jones, Ephraim Sykes, Richard Thomas, Michelle Wilson, Julie Halston, Donald Webber Jr., with Ephie Aardema Sarnak, Heather Ayers, Willa Bost, Bobby Daye, Safiya Kaijya Harris, Doron JéPaul, Shyla Lefner, Anthony Michael Lopez, John McGinty, Bryonha Marie, Kevyn Morrow, Hagan Oliveras, Noah Pyzik, Sky Smith, Bill Timoney, Ricardo Vázquez, Matthew Elijah Webb, Greg Wood and Nimene Sierra Wureh.Running time: 1 hr 45 min (no intermission)\n\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\n\nDisappointing.

  "fullText": "The revival also stars Zoey Deutch, Katie Holmes, Ephraim Sykes, and more. “Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it — every, every minute?” So goes the question asked and answered by Thornton Wilder’s Pulitzer prize-winning play, a text just as resonant 86 years after it was penned. The short answer is, of course, no. And the long answer is once again unfolding on Broadway, under the direction of Tony winner Kenny Leon. \"This play is called Our Town,” Jim Parsons tells the audience, delivering the opening lines as Stage Manager, the narrator who guides us through the story. He then divulges details of the play’s history, its cast, and all those who had a hand in crafting it. It’s both the turn of the 20th century in a small, New Hampshire town and present day, in the Barrymore Theater. Even before Parsons speaks his first bout of meta-dialogue, it’s clear that the entirety of the theater will be the stage. The cast members descend the aisles lit by candlelight, singing a mesmerizing hymn that unites the people who will soon fill the town. On either edge of the stage are pews where audience members sit. As Wilder requested in his script, props are almost nonexistent and the scenery is minimal: two tables, six chairs, and an unremarkable piano. There’s simple, expertly deployed lighting design from Allen Lee Hughes, including the occasional lantern, but otherwise? The rest is pure, unfiltered imagination. And it’s all too easy to fill in the blanks. The space appears sparse and simple, which makes it all the more vast. Thus, we’re welcomed into the world of Grover’s Corners, the small New Hampshire town that is home to the Gibbs and Webb families, neighbors who experience growing up, adulthood, and, eventually, death. Leon’s inclusive approach to casting means the play better reflects life as we know it. The Gibbs family is Black and the Webb family is white; the Professor who delivers key anthropological context is played by Native American actress Shyla Lefner; the local milkman is played by a deaf actor, John McGinty, who signs his lines, to which his neighbors sign their responses. The Stage Manager insists that it is 1901, but also affirms that it is not. Or, as one of Wilder's characters eloquently puts it, we are located in \"the United States of America; Continent of North America; Western Hemisphere; the Earth; the Solar System; the Universe; The Mind of God.\" Leon has trimmed the three act classic down to 1 hour and 45 minutes and the pacing is far from brisk until suddenly, in its third act especially, it goes by all too quickly. Though its newfound flow comes at the expense of quaint, but weighty moments from the original text, Wilder’s philosophy still runs through the story. Our Town is all straightforward sentimentality. Where a scene could play as sappy, it is raw and matter-of-fact, as it ponders a frightening existential concept: the brevity of human life. The most winning aspect of Wilder's play is its warmth. Leon preserves this, as do his actors. Zoey Deutch, making her Broadway debut, is as instantly likable as ever. She balances easy charisma with distinct vulnerability, something that is crucial to the arc of Emily Webb when her life takes a tragic turn. She shares charming chemistry with Ephraim Sykes (Ain't Too Proud), the boy-next-door who wins her heart with kind words and a well-timed ice cream soda. Meanwhile, Katie Holmes fulfills an almost thankless role, granted little time to shine as Mrs. Webb, but provides a grounding presence as the practical mother of two. Michelle Wilson (Sweat, A Raisin in the Sun) and and Billy Eugene Jones (Purlie Victorious) are standouts as Dr. and Mrs. Gibbs, loving and occasionally stern parents who impart wisdom in their most casual conversations — and always know their way around a good speech when someone is in need of perspective. It's Parsons who is our constant, yet his performance is the most difficult to parse: his Stage Manager strikes the Wilder balance of dry yet sincere, but feels rather distanced. He leaves us wanting in some moments — for comfort, sentimentality, or perhaps just clarity — but when the time comes for his critical third act monologue, he has just the right words, just the right tone. Our Town is, arguably, utterly plotless. What drama plagues the town of Grover’s Corners, besides a single drunken organ player? Two teenagers fall in love —not in the midst of explosive drama or against all odds — they merely share a conversation, two ice cream sodas, and a quiet, convenient moment of revelation. And people die, as they always do. But then, it isn’t about what happens but the unremarkable reality of it happening at all. Not coincidentally, the most striking aspects of this particular production are baked into the DNA of Wilder’s timeless play. There’s something undefinable missing: perhaps a cut line that was the secret skeleton key or merely the fact of changing the pacing and losing the reality of the show’s slow simplicity. Ultimately, Wilder’s words remain the magic; the progression from a day to a wedding to a funeral a guaranteed gut punch. It is, if nothing else, a reminder that life itself ought to be thoroughly appreciated. Grade: B",
