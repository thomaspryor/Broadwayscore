    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the show's casting choices, indicating relevance and appropriateness for contemporary audiences. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review text limit confidence in this assessment. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, but very brief, so I am scoring it as a barely positive review with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers modest praise for casting choices and contemporary relevance, suggesting a positive but qualified assessment. Limited context requires conservative scoring at the lower end of the Positive range.",
