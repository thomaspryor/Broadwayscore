  "bwwExcerpt": "Revival of Thornton Wilder’s ‘Our Town’ is moving, emotionally stirring production. Kenny Leon’s emotionally charged revival at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre has opened with an engaging if stylistically varied cast and a swift pacing that boils a three-act play down to an intermission-less 105 minutes.",
