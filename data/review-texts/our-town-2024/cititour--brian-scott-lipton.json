And, yes, I know numerous theatergoers who have seen this work for the first time later in life and agree with the legendary Edward Albee that “it is the greatest American play ever written.” \n\nNo offense to Mr. Albee, but “Our Town,” has always struck me as alternately boring, banal and, at the end, admittedly rather moving. And nothing about Kenny Leon’s non-traditional production, now at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, has caused me to change my overall opinion. \n\nTo my mind, the play (now presented in 105 intermissionless minutes) suffers from one major problem; it gives us essentially two-dimensional characters in too-short snippets, denying us the kind of investment we need to have in these people, while wasting precious time “showing us” where the post office is or talking about the weather. (The minimal scenic design is by Beowulf Boritt.)\n\nAdmittedly, Leon doesn’t seem as comfortable with this play as he did with “Purlie Victorious” or “Topdog/Underdog,” but I applaud this production’s diversity. Setting the play both in the past and now (somehow?), Leon has much of the small New Hampshire town of Grover’s Corners populated by African Americans -- especially the prosperous Gibbs family, extremely well played by Billy Eugene Jones, Michelle Wilson, and a slightly too mature but still effective Ephraim Sykes as their teenage (then 20something) son George. \n\nAbove all, he’s handled the show’s largest part, the Stage Manager, to the affable, out actor Jim Parsons. He plays down the effeminacy of some of his previous stage roles, but I think Parsons is still meant to portray this quasi-narrator as a (perhaps closeted) gay man. Engaging as he can be, though, Parsons lacks the gravitas of some of his predecessors in the role, including Henry Fonda and Paul Newman, instead sounding primarily like his nerdy “Big Bang Theory” character Sheldon Cooper during his fictional TV show “Fun with Flags.” \n\nStill, Parsons does find some much-needed humor in the text, as do such players as the ageless Richard Thomas as the wry newspaper editor Charles Webb (nicely matched by the still-stunning Katie Holmes as his dutiful wife, Myrtle, and the lovely Zoey Deutch as his precocious daughter Emily) and the ever-hilarious Julie Halston as town busybody Luella Soames. \n\nLeon also does well with the show’s central romance between Emily and George, and the scene where the two teens finally confess their feelings is lovely. Still, Leon’s direction and the actors’ talents are at their finest in the show’s final, saddest section, when a now-dead Emily – who has passed while giving birth to her and George’s second child – insists on returning home for one “ordinary” day (her 12th birthday). Struck by how we foolishly ignore the beauty of everyday life, Emily urges us to appreciate everything about the here-and-now. You would literally need to be made of stone not to shed a tear or two. \n\nIndeed, Wilder is to be applauded for giving us a valuable and universal life lesson. I just wish getting there didn’t feel so much like listening to a lecture.\n By Brian Scott Lipton\n\nVisit the Sitehttps://www.ourtownbroadway.com/Open/Close DatesOpening 10/10/2024Closing Open-ended\nTheatre Info\nBarrymore Theatre243 W 47th StNew York, NY 10036 Map\n\nCititour.com is your guide to interesting places throughout New York City.

The review expresses appreciation for elements while maintaining overall reservations about the production. | Gemini: The review expresses mixed feelings. While praising some performances and the final section, it criticizes the play's two-dimensional characters and the director's comfort with the material. The overall impression is neither strongly positive nor negative. | Kimi: The critic finds the play boring and banal for most of its runtime with two-dimensional characters, while praising the diverse casting, several performances, and the moving final act. This results in a mixed assessment that acknowledges strengths but does not offer a clear recommendation.",
