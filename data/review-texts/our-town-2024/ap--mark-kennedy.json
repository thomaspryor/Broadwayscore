    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise ('fresh relevance', positive framing of 'masterpiece' revival), but limited text and curation warning requires caution. Upper end of Positive range due to unqualified praise tone. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the revival for finding fresh relevance and maintaining timeless simplicity, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the word \"masterpiece\" and states that the revival finds fresh relevance, indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given that it is only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the revival's relevance and execution, describing it as fresh yet timeless. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is low, but the tone is distinctly positive with no reservations mentioned.",
