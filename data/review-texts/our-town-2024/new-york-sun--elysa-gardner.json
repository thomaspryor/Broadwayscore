However, with only one truncated excerpt and no clear overall verdict visible, confidence is low and score reflects cautious positive assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt conveys a strong positive emotional impact, suggesting the production is both moving and thought-provoking. Despite the limited context, the language indicates a high level of recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive experience, but the truncated nature and single excerpt warrant a lower confidence and a score in the middle of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the production's emotional impact and the director's vision, describing audiences as leaving 'wonder-struck' and 'grateful.' However, confidence is reduced due to the single-excerpt, truncated nature of the available text.",
