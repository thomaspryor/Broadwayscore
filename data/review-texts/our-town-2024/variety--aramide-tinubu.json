  "fullText": "It takes a great deal of work to make the ordinary enticing, but that’s precisely what director Kenny Leon does in his production of Thornton Wilder’s 1938 Pulitzer Prize-winning “Our Town.” Set in the fictional town of Grover’s Corners, New Hampshire, the three-act play offers the audience snapshots of the inner workings of a typical American town. Days in Grover’s Corners consist of milk deliveries, baseball, choir practices, conversations around the dinner table and even a young couple falling in love. While nothing extraordinary occurs, the heart of the story is about how people relate to one another, which the play convincingly argues is the most essential aspect of life.\n\n“Our Town” begins with the introduction of the Stage Manager (a perfectly cast Jim Parsons). He works diligently to offer the audience a lay of the land. From Grover’s geographical layout to the forewarnings of what’s to come, viewers are compelled to take an interest in this place because of him. Once oriented, the narrative begins. Opening in 1901, “Our Town” centers on two neighboring families, the Gibbs and the Webbs. Dr. Gibbs (Billy Eugene Jones) and his wife, Mrs. Gibbs (Michelle Wilson), are pillars of the community. They have two children, George (Ephraim Sykes) and Rebecca (Safiya Kaijya Harris). Just a house over are Mr. Webb (Richard Thomas), Grover’s newspaper publisher, his wife, Mrs. Webb (Katie Holmes) and their children, Emily (Zoey Deutch) and Wally (Hagan Oliveras).",
  "bwwExcerpt": "Though “Our Town” runs just 105 minutes, much shorter than the original two hours and 35 minutes, the last act does drag a bit. This final chapter centers on death and what we miss out on when we’re not truly present. However, these scenes lean toward melodrama, removing some of the sharpness constructed in the play’s first two acts. Still, Leon masters the core of Wilder’s message. Life is fragile and fleeting, and love is all that matters.",
