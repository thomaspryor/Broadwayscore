However, due to limited context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is negative about a lead performance. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as negative, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a direct negative evaluation of a key performance, describing it as the 'biggest letdown,' which suggests significant disappointment likely affecting the overall recommendation. However, confidence is low given only one curated excerpt is available, which may not represent the full review's verdict on the entire production.",
