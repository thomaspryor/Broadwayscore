    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for the production's freshness and immediacy, plus positive assessment of Parsons' performance. Single excerpt limits confidence, but language suggests solid recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's fresh approach and highlights Jim Parsons' performance as tender, indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, the upper end of the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the production's ability to make the play feel urgent and immediate, and highlights Jim Parsons' performance as surprisingly tender. This suggests a positive, though possibly not rave, review. | Kimi: The excerpt offers specific praise for the production's fresh conceptual approach and the lead performance's surprising tenderness, indicating a clear positive recommendation despite limited context.",
