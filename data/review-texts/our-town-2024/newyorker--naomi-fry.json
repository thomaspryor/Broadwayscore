    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clear praise for the production and direction. However, confidence is low due to limited text that may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production for balancing intimacy and expansiveness, honoring the original vision while updating it. The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the direction and its ability to honor the original vision while making it feel contemporary, suggesting a strong positive assessment. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language warrants a score on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the direction and contemporary relevance of the production, warranting an upper-range Positive score. As only a single curated excerpt is available, confidence is reduced.",
