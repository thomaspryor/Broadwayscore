  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessReview by  Naveen KumarThe fictional setting of “Our Town” is meant to represent an Anyplace, where audiences can imagine themselves lost in the comforts of routine until they’re confronted with the realities of death.\n\nThornton Wilder’s metaphysical tragedy debuted in 1938 and always takes place in the theater where it’s being performed, with the Stage Manager (Jim Parsons, in the latest revival) sketching the quaint particulars of Grover’s Corners and the folks who call it home. The success of any production depends on the connection we feel to that world here and now.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Leon’s staging is lovely, but I found myself craving a daring challenge to the idea of convention rather than simply an inclusive version of it. Why should the picture of a “typical American life” remain so narrow? Why stuff it with more types of people rather than pull it apart? That’s a job for other storytellers — whose repudiation of norms will hopefully become the new one.",
