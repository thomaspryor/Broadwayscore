    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt is too brief and lacks a clear evaluative tone. It mentions a multicultural cast and relevance to current times but does not provide a definitive recommendation or critique. Given the lack of context and the single excerpt warning, a mixed score is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, describing the cast as \"suited for our times.\" Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as a low positive. | Kimi: Single excerpt praises the casting as timely and relevant ('suited for our times'), indicating mild approval. With only one curated quote available, score reflects lower end of Positive range per guidelines.",
