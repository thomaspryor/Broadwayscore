    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt is vague and does not provide a clear positive or negative evaluation. The lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach, leading to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive but very brief, so I'm scoring it as a barely positive recommendation with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers mild appreciation for the director's thematic handling but lacks clear evaluative verdict or sufficient context to determine stronger recommendation strength.",
