    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Negative | Claude: The phrase 'actors get so mired' suggests negative criticism of performances, but with only a fragment available and truncated text, the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests some issues with the production, particularly with the actors being 'mired,' which implies a lack of fluidity or engagement. However, the lack of full context and the warning about potential cherry-picking lead to a conservative score in the middle of the Mixed range. | Gemini: The single excerpt available suggests a negative assessment of the acting, indicating a negative overall impression. Given the limited context, the score is placed in the middle of the negative range.",
