    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, acknowledging that the show avoids excessive sentimentality but not providing strong praise. The single excerpt warning and lack of clear positive language lead to a low confidence score in the Mixed range. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a slightly positive review, so I scored it at the lower end of the positive range. The confidence is low due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers faint praise by noting the production avoids excessive sentimentality, suggesting a mildly positive assessment rather than enthusiastic endorsement. With only one curated excerpt available, the full verdict remains uncertain.",
