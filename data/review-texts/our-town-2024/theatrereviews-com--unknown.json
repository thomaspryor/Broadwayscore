  "fullText": "“Our Town” by Thorton Wilder is recognized as a classic, and the revival now playing at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on Broadway, directed by Kenny Leon is the perfect example of why it has achieved that status. It is timeless, appealing to a multi-generational audience, and allows each theatergoer to recognize their own connection to the content. Not only will each person find similarities to their own town, but collectively as an audience, Grover’s Corners, New Hampshire, where the play takes place, becomes “Our Town.” We share different memories that might be triggered by the words and actions delivered on stage, and together smile, laugh, cry and come to understand how precious this short life on earth can be. We are inspired by simplicity, learn from the acts of kindness, marvel at the joy of living, and are reminded of grief and mortality. The style and construction of the play crossed boundaries when first produced and still breaks barriers now, as each director creates and develops their interpretation. Mr. Leon has pushed even further, performing all three acts without intermission, and providing a universal multiracial cast. The show opens with a song “Braided Prayer” which features prayers from Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths, which is heard as people from the town assemble on stage. This is certainly a hint that this production will have no boundaries and showcase an all-inclusive theme. The audience is guided through the evening by the Stage Manager (an amiable Jim Parsons) who opens the play with a tour of the small town of Grover’s Corners on a morning in 1901, pointing out familiar places and explaining the demographics. He introduces some of the essential members of the town that the audience will come across during the play. There is the paperboy (an energetic Sky Smith); a milkman ( a friendly John McGinty); Mr. and Mrs. Webb (a classic Richard Thomas and wholesome Katie Holmes); their children Emily and Wally (a vibrant Zoey Deutch and solid Hagan Oliveras); Doc and Mrs. Gibb (a kindhearted Billy Eugene Jones and a strong Michelle Wilson); their children George and Rebecca (a bewildered Ephraim Sykes and a zealous Safiya Kaijya Harris), who live next to each other; and a professor ( an informed Shyla Lefner). As the day wears on we are introduced to some other townsfolk. There is Simon Stimson, the choir director (a secretive Donald Weber Jr.) who we learn is an alcoholic; Constable Warren (a forgiving Bill Timoney) who “looks the other way”; and Mrs. Soames (a hilarious Julie Halston) the town gossip. The entire cast is a remarkable ensemble and no less than stellar. These are common, moral, authentic and generous people, who appreciate what life has given them. It is not a “slice of life,” but rather a three-decker sandwich, devoured over the course of three acts without an intermission, which assures that every audience member will leave the theater full of lingering thoughts and deeply emotional reactions. The plot seems unimportant, because it is the message that will linger for a while. Mr. Leon has managed to make this rendition even more timeless than it was always meant to be. Costume design by Dede Ayite spans decades but never seems intrusive and the lighting design by Allen Lee Hughes subtlety enhances the emotional content of each scene. This Broadway revival will be remembered long after it closes and ensures that “Our Town” is positively everyone’s town. Mischief Theatre has returned to Broadway with another play that isn’t going exactly as planned, exactly the way the creative team wanted it to, now on stage at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, aptly titled “Peter Pan Goes Wrong” based on the play “Peter Pan” by JM Barrie. The book showcases… In Jez Butterworth’s “The Hills of California,” the four Webb sisters gather in the summer of 1976 at Seaview the guesthouse on the outskirts of Blackpool, an English seaside resort on the Irish Sea, where their mother Veronica (a once demanding and selfish Laura Donnelly) lies dying upstairs in what… With dramatic revivals, the question always becomes: is it too soon or is it too dated? Now, John Guare’s 1990 award- winning dark comedy, “Six Degrees of Separation,” has made its first return to Broadway. Fortunately, this proves a perfect time to savor a play about a momentous evening –…",
