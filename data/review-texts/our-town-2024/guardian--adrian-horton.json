    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('anchor', 'thoughtful', 'fresh resonance') suggests clear recommendation. Single excerpt limits confidence, but tone indicates upper end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and the production's ability to find fresh resonance, indicating a positive reception. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set towards the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"thoughtful revival\" and \"fresh resonance,\" indicating a positive assessment of the production. Given the single excerpt, I am placing it in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise, describing the revival as 'thoughtful' and successfully finding 'fresh resonance' in the material, indicating a clear recommendation despite limited context.",
