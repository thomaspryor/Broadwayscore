    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the play's impact, but the single quote and lack of full context limit confidence. The sentiment is mildly positive, indicating a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive sentiment, but due to the limited text, the confidence is low. I am placing it in the lower end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the production's emotional resonance and intellectual depth, warranting an upper-range Positive score per the single-excerpt guidelines. Confidence is low due to the availability of only one curated quote.",
