    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt contains high praise for Coon's performance, comparing it to 'the very best art' and describing it as soul-deep. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review's verdict about the overall production. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for Coon's performance, describing it as deeply impactful and comparable to the best art. The single excerpt warning suggests using the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on Carrie Coon's performance, praising it as believable and impactful, comparing it to the best art. Given the single excerpt, I am placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for Carrie Coon's performance with superlatives ('very best art'), indicating a positive review. Limited to one curated quote about the acting, so confidence is low and score stays in upper Positive range rather than Rave.",
