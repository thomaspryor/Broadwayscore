    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise for the performance but suggests the material feels dated or less relevant. The truncated nature and lack of clear recommendation makes this mixed with low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a focus on performance strength, but also implies that the paranoia central to the play feels less impactful. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a mixed verdict with low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a focus on character study, but also notes that the paranoia feels less relevant. This indicates a mixed reaction, with some positive aspects but overall a tempered enthusiasm. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers qualified praise ('forceful enough') suggesting the production works primarily as a character study, though the truncated text hints at reservations about the play's contemporary relevance. With only one excerpt available, confidence is low.",
