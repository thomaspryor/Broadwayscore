    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises playwright's insight and character understanding, suggesting artistic merit. However, excerpt appears truncated mid-sentence and lacks clear recommendation language, warranting low confidence and lower positive score. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a complex and potentially unsettling experience, but doesn't offer a clear recommendation. The focus on the characters' destruction and the comfort in conspiracy theories leans towards a mixed or slightly negative assessment, but without more context, it's hard to be certain. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the playwright's thematic control and intelligence, appreciating how the writing finds 'strange comfort' in chaos. As a single curated excerpt with positive valence, it falls in the upper Positive range (80-84), though the truncated nature and lack of full verdict warrant low confidence.",
