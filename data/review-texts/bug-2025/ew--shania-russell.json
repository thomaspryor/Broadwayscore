The 'skin-crawling effect' is presented as a positive theatrical achievement rather than a criticism. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as effectively tense and surprising, with a B+ grade indicating a positive review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic gives the show a B+ grade and highlights the show's ability to create tension and surprises, indicating a positive experience. | Kimi: The B+ grade and enthusiastic praise for the production's tension and staging indicate a clearly positive recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in assessing the full review's nuance.",
