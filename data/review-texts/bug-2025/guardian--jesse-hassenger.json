    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt suggests qualified praise for newcomers but raises concerns about character depth and lasting impact. The 'temporarily transfixed' phrasing and comparison concerns suggest mixed feelings rather than clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that new audiences might be temporarily captivated, but it implies that those familiar with previous versions might find the characters lacking depth. This indicates a mixed reception, with some positive elements but also reservations. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a potentially engaging experience for first-time viewers, but implies that the impact may be fleeting or diminished for those familiar with previous versions. This indicates a mixed or qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show may transfix first-time viewers but emphasizes this effect is temporary, while suggesting the central characters lack depth compared to earlier productions.",
