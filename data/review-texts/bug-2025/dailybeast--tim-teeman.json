    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic praises the ambition and performances as 'electric' but finds the play itself stalls and becomes 'arduous' with 'no answers.' This balanced assessment of strong performances in a flawed work places it in Mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges strong performances but criticizes the play for losing momentum and providing no answers. The mixed signals and single excerpt lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review praises the performances but ultimately finds the play itself lacking, describing it as an \"arduous descent\" despite its initial promise. This suggests a mixed reaction. | Kimi: While the critic praises Coon and Smallwood's 'electric' performances, the verdict on the play itself is damning: an 'arduous descent' that 'stalls' and offers 'no answers,' with the final line explicitly stating the play fails to succeed despite its prescient themes.",
