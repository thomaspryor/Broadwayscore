  "bwwExcerpt": "Carrie Coon is unleashed from her corsets—and every other stitch of clothing—in the blistering Broadway revival of her husband Tracy Letts’s macabre thriller “Bug,” being presented by Manhattan Theatre Club roughly 20 years after it was first seen in New York off-Broadway. (Due to the prevalence of nudity, audiences must turn off their phones and have them put in secure pouches for the show’s duration.)",

The warning about truncated text and lack of full review makes confident scoring impossible. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a notable performance and an intriguing production element, but lacks clear recommendation language. The absence of a full review or explicit verdict makes it difficult to confidently classify the review. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on Carrie Coon's performance and the play's nature as a 'macabre thriller,' but lacks a clear recommendation. The mention of nudity and phone pouches suggests a potentially intense experience, but doesn't indicate whether it's ultimately worth seeing.",
