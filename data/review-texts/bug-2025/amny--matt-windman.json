The truncation cuts off at a crucial negative turn, suggesting disappointment despite technical appreciation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates respect for the craft and appreciation for performances, but the critic did not fully engage with the production. The lack of full engagement and surrender suggests a mixed review. | Gemini: The critic acknowledges the play's craft and performances but states they didn't fully connect with it, suggesting a mixed reaction. The truncated text and single excerpt lower the confidence. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges polish, craft, and performances but explicitly states they could not emotionally surrender to or engage with the production, suggesting a mixed-to-disappointed response. Low confidence due to single truncated excerpt.",
