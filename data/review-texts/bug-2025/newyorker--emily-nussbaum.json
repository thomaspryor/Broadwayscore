    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt focuses on praising Coon's performance as 'openhearted, subtly joyful' and 'liberating', suggesting strong appreciation. However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of positive elements. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a positive portrayal by Coon, suggesting a strong performance. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a positive portrayal of a character and the liberating effect of finding meaning in pain, suggesting a positive experience. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Carrie Coon's performance, describing it as 'openhearted,' 'subtly joyful,' and ultimately 'liberating,' indicating clear approval. However, as a single curated excerpt focused primarily on one performance element, confidence remains limited regarding the overall verdict.",
