    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performances with vivid imagery ('sparks as bright as any bug zapper'), but only one excerpt available makes full verdict assessment difficult. Praising performances as 'most special effects' suggests clear recommendation despite limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances with vivid imagery, suggesting a positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances of Coon and Smallwood, calling them the show's 'most special effects,' indicating a positive, though potentially qualified, recommendation. Given only one excerpt, I am scoring towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performances and scenic design, describing the acting as the show's 'most special effects' with 'impressive ache and intensity.' While clearly positive, the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
