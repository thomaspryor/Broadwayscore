Given single excerpt warning and truncation, scoring conservatively in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the set design and technical aspects, indicating a positive view. However, the text is truncated, and the single excerpt warning suggests caution. The recommendation is mild, so a lower positive score is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the intimacy and intensity of the production, as well as the set design. However, the sentence is cut off, so the overall verdict is unclear. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
