However, with only one truncated excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may be cut off. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast and notes increased relevance, suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low, and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive view of the show's relevance, but due to the limited text, confidence is low. The reference to the excellent cast also contributes to the positive assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('excellent cast') and emphasizes heightened relevance, indicating a clear recommendation. However, with only one curated excerpt available and the text truncated, confidence must remain low per scoring guidelines.",
