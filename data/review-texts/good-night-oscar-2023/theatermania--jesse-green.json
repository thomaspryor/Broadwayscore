Confidence is low due to the extreme brevity of the text.",

Previews begin October 5 ahead of an official opening night on October 8. Performances are scheduled through October 29.\n\nWashington Square was previously scheduled to open on March 15, 2020 but was shuttered due to the pandemic following four preview performances.\n\nWashington Square tells the story of Catherine Sloper, a wealthy young woman growing up in a dour household.
