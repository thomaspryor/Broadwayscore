However, extremely brief text limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review describes Sean Hayes' performance as a 'tour-de-force', indicating a strong recommendation for the show based on his portrayal. | Gemini: The review praises Sean Hayes' performance as a \"tour-de-force\" and states that the play captures both the wit and tragedy of Levant's life, indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: While brief, the review offers unqualified praise for both the lead performance ('tour-de-force') and the play's execution ('captures both the wit and tragedy'), indicating a clear recommendation. Confidence is low due to the extreme brevity of the text.",
