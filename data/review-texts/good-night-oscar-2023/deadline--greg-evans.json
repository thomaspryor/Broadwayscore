However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt states the show is \"less than convincing,\" which indicates a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the subject's biographical potential but explicitly states the production fails to make a convincing case, indicating a negative verdict on the show's execution.",
