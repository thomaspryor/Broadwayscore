However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong, enthusiastic language like 'tour de force' and 'career-crowning achievement,' indicating a highly positive review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses the phrase \"tour de force\" and heaps praise on the playwright, cast, director, and especially Sean Hayes, calling it a \"career-crowning achievement.\" | Kimi: The excerpt employs superlative language ('tour de force,' 'career-crowning achievement,' 'Garlands all around') indicating an enthusiastic, must-see recommendation consistent with the Rave bucket, though confidence is reduced due to the single-excerpt limitation.",
