  "bwwExcerpt": "The playwright Dominique Morisseau knows what she is doing. That's clear not only because she says it so convincingly in her Playbill note for Manhattan Theatre Club's production of 'Skeleton Crew,' but because she writes this moving drama with pristine delicacy and develops its characters with rigorous detail and tact. Under the masterful direction of Ruben Santiago-Hudson, 'Skeleton Crew' presents a vibrant cast, poetic dialogue and profoundly layered storytelling that move the audience to audibly engage.",
