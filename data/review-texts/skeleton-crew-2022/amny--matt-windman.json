  "bwwExcerpt": "'Skeleton Crew' could have easily ended on a downbeat note. After all, no one is coming to save the factory, and the characters face an uncertain future. But the compassion they share for one another, the sacrifices they make for each other, and the unexpected pride they take in their work, turn 'Skeleton Crew' into a most unlikely feel-good - or rather feel-hopeful - drama",
