However, the mention of 'predictable moments' suggests some reservations, placing it in the lower range of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review praises the performances and direction, indicating a positive experience, but the phrase 'even the most predictable moments' suggests some reservations. | Kimi: The critic offers solid praise for the direction and performances, noting they elevate potentially predictable material, though the excerpt's brevity limits certainty about the overall verdict.",
