  "bwwExcerpt": "Under Ruben Santiago-Hudson's taut direction, this cast of four is uniformly splendid. Rashad, famous for playing a mother on TV in 'The Cosby Show' and on stage in 'Blue' and 'A Raisin in the Sun,' completely transforms herself into a seasoned factory worker here, and she wears those overalls with absolute confidence. Boone delivers a fierce, raw performance that consistently galvanizes the drama when he's on stage. Granted, he has a slightly easier task than the other three actors. His Dez character is the only one not infected with a blinding naivete about the world in which they live and work.",
