  "bwwExcerpt": "In truth, some of the plot devices, the neat parallels and red herrings, are, like Faye, a bit creaky with use. But that doesn't stop them from working; indeed, it's a pleasure to surrender to classic craftsmanship. Though you can certainly sense Morisseau's debt to August Wilson in her dramaturgy - 'Skeleton Crew' is part of a trilogy of works set in Detroit, as Wilson had his Pittsburgh Cycle - you also sense the brute efficiency of problem plays by Ibsen and the best television procedurals.",
