  "bwwExcerpt": "Morriseau has created a brilliant, modern workplace tragedy, masterfully attuned to the ways the American Dream has made sleepwalkers of us all. If there is a tiny bit of motherly compassion missing from Rashad's portrayal of the plant matriarch, it is more than atoned for by the nuances and moments of joy felt throughout the play: a stunning assembly line of workers trying their best to not fall off the belt.",
