  "bwwExcerpt": "“Between Riverside and Crazy” is a play where everyone, including Pops, is a con artist. Guirgis takes his time to expose the duplicity of each of his characters, and the scenes between Pops and the voodoo Church Lady (Liza Colon-Zayas) and his former NYPD partner, Detective O’Connor (Elizabeth Canavan), and her fiancée, Lieutenant Caro (Michael Rispoli), show a major talent writing at full and breathtaking speed. These four gifted actors know precisely how to jockey with each. They do the playwright’s poker-game of words full justice.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises actors as 'gifted' and says they 'do full justice' to the material, indicating appreciation. However, with only one curated quote available, confidence is low as the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the actors' performances and suggests the play is well-executed. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence, suggesting a mild positive score. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the actors and their handling of the playwright's words, suggesting a positive experience, but the limited text and excerpt-only warning necessitate a lower confidence and a score on the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the cast as 'gifted' and judges that they do the text 'full justice,' indicating a positive assessment of the production quality, though the single-excerpt limitation prevents higher confidence.",
