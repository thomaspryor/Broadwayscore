Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds clearly positive, so using upper end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play's dialogue as vibrant and masterful, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the dialogue and describes the play as filled with surprises and twists, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the playwright's 'master' level dialogue and the show's blend of dramatic and comedic surprises, using vivid, laudatory language throughout.",
