    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear enthusiasm with 'amazing Henderson' and invitation to 'come along for the ride!' But single excerpt warning means this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation of the play and its lead actor, suggesting an engaging and worthwhile experience. However, with only one curated excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses strong praise for the play and the lead performance, suggesting a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The single available excerpt is clearly positive, praising the play's 'beauty' and calling the lead actor 'amazing' while explicitly inviting audiences to see the show. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the 80-84 Positive range.",
