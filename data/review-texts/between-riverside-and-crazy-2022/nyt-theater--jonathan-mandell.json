As subtle in its craft as it is blunt in its language — and performed by a first-rate cast — the play is likely to make you delight in all the New Yorkers on stage in the first act…and then force you to question your initial judgement in the second.\n\nRead more",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the phrase \"must-see\" and praises the craft and cast, indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly labels the show a 'must-see' and praises its subtle craft and first-rate cast, indicating a strong recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
