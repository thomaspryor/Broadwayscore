    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: This appears to be an excerpt with positive language ('honors') praising the transfer's success, but lacks detail for a confident assessment of recommendation strength. | GPT-4o: The review praises the Broadway transfer for honoring the play's character study and social commentary, indicating a positive assessment. | Gemini: The review states that the Broadway transfer 'honors' the play, indicating a positive assessment. While not overly enthusiastic, it's a clear recommendation. | Kimi: The review is extremely brief with only one evaluative sentence, but clearly positive - 'honors' indicates the production succeeds. Low confidence due to brevity with no reservations mentioned, suggesting solid recommendation in the upper-mid Positive range.",
