However, with only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment of the review is uncertain, leading to a lower confidence and score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the playwright's ability to create empathetic and affectionate characters, suggesting a positive experience. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the playwright's character work and the emotional connection created, indicating a positive recommendation. However, with only a single curated excerpt available, the full scope of the critic's assessment remains unclear.",
