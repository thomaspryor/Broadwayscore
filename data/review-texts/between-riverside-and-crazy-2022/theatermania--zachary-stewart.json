However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, calling the play \"ideal\" and a reminder to love imperfect people. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise, calling the show 'ideal' and highlighting its warm thematic resonance, indicating a clear recommendation despite the limitation of a single curated quote.",
