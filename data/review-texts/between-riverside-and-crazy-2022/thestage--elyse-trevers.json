    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Excerpt praises Henderson's 'master class in acting' performance and finds the show 'somewhat relevant' despite being 'slightly dated.' Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mildly positive but may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Stephen McKinley Henderson's performance as a 'master class in acting,' suggesting a positive view despite noting the show feels 'slightly dated.' The single excerpt warning suggests using the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt notes the show is slightly dated but praises Stephen McKinley Henderson's performance as a \"master class in acting.\" Given the single excerpt and the positive emphasis on the lead performance, I'm scoring it as a low positive. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows qualified praise: critic notes the show is 'slightly dated' but praises Henderson's performance as a 'master class,' suggesting the production is worthwhile primarily for the acting. With only one excerpt available, scoring at the lower end of the Positive bucket per instructions.",
