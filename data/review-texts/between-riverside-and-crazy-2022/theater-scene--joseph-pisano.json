  "showScoreExcerpt": "Living in his \"palatial\" rent-controlled apartment on one of Manhattan's most stunning architectural stretches, Walter \"Pops'' Washington (Stephen McKinley Henderson) is an aging man of aging principles. A Black ex-cop, he presides over a crumbling kingdom from the figurative throne of his dead wife's wheelchair in Stephen Adly Guirgis' Pulitzer-Prize-winning \"Between Riverside and Crazy.\" The gruffly engaging Henderson, along with the rest of the heady ensemble, feast on Guirgis' piquant dialogue that blends the sacred with the profane, the comic with the tragic, and earnest social commentary with intense silliness. It's just unfortunate that Guirgis' shaggily constructed plot inspires doubts about whether a brilliant cast and brilliant writing necessarily equate to a brilliant play. \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Praises cast and dialogue as 'brilliant' but expresses significant structural concerns about the plot construction. Single excerpt warning applied - cautious scoring due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The review praises the performances and dialogue but expresses reservations about the plot's construction, leading to a mixed verdict. The single excerpt and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the acting and dialogue but questions the overall brilliance of the play due to the plot's construction. The truncated text and single excerpt make the confidence low. | Kimi: While the excerpt praises the 'brilliant' cast and 'piquant' dialogue, it ends with significant reservations about the 'shaggily constructed plot' and explicitly questions whether the strong elements cohere into a successful play. As a single curated excerpt with a truncated ending, confidence is low.",
