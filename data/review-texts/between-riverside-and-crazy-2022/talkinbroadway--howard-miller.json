    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clear praise for first act construction, but 'So far, so good' suggests potential reservations about later acts. Low confidence due to limited text and potential for cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive assessment of the first act, highlighting its strong character development and plotting. However, without more context, it's unclear if this praise extends to the entire production. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, praising the character development, plot, and realism of the first act. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers qualified praise for the first act with 'so far, so good' indicating mild approval, appropriate for lower Positive range. Truncated text and single-excerpt limitation require low confidence.",
