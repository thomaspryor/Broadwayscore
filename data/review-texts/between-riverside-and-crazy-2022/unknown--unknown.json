    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The 'CRITIC'S PICK' designation is a strong positive indicator, suggesting recommendation. However, with only one excerpt available that doesn't contain explicit evaluative language, confidence is low. The philosophical tone suggests engagement with the work. | GPT-4o: The designation 'CRITIC'S PICK' suggests a strong recommendation. Despite the limited excerpt, this label typically indicates a positive review. | Gemini: The quote suggests a nuanced but ultimately positive view, implying the show explores complex characters and themes. Given the single excerpt and 'Critic's Pick' label, I'm placing it in the lower end of the Positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The 'CRITIC'S PICK' designation indicates a strong recommendation, but the single curated excerpt format limits confidence and constrains the score to the upper end of the Positive range per guidance.",
