    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear appreciation for both the play's thematic content and Henderson's theatrical skill. 'Celebrates' and 'authority of theatrical craft' indicate strong positive assessment, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play's celebration of theatrical craft and honors a character's resilience, suggesting a strong positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the play and Henderson's theatrical craft, indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production's craft and honors the central performance, indicating a clearly positive recommendation, though the single-excerpt format prevents a more definitive assessment.",
