  "bwwExcerpt": "Crackling with humor and shot through with surprises, “Between Riverside and Crazy,” which premiered off Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company in 2014 and won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, is both a captivating collection of character studies and an incisive indictment of the systems that act upon them. It’s a stunning intellectual achievement that’s also a total gas, a rare breed of theater deserving of protection at all costs.",

Using upper Positive range given clearly positive language. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast's performance under Austin Pendleton's direction, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the direction and returning cast, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low, and the score is in the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for both direction and cast performances ('ease and richness,' 'lived inside the characters'), indicating a clearly positive assessment. However, as a single curated excerpt, the overall verdict confidence is reduced.",
