However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation and potential for truncation affecting the complete verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'stiff and dusty,' indicating a negative view. While there is praise for a lead performance and set design, the overall tone suggests a lack of recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses negative language like \"stiff and dusty\" to describe the production, and only praises the lead performance and set design, indicating an overall negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
