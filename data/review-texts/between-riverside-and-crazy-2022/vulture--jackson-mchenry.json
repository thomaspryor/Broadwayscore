    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the play's distinctiveness, calling it 'lovelier and weirder' than typical issue drama. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be cherry-picked from a mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the play, highlighting its humor and uniqueness. However, without the full context, the confidence is low, and the score reflects a mildly positive impression. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the play's humor and strangeness, lifting it above typical issue dramas. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low, but the tone is positive enough for a low-end positive score. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows clear appreciation for the play's distinctive qualities, praising its humor and strangeness for elevating it beyond typical issue drama into something 'lovelier and weirder,' indicating solid recommendation.",
