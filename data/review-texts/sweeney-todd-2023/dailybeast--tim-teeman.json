    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('bloody good time') with specific praise for both leads suggests strong enthusiasm, but single excerpt limits full verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the revival, highlighting the suitability of Josh Groban's performance and Annaleigh Ashford's energy. The tone suggests an enthusiastic recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, calling the revival a \"bloody good time\" and praising the performances of the leads. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive tone warrants a score in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong praise ('bloody good time', 'perfectly suited') for the production and both lead performances, warranting upper Positive range per guidance on curated excerpts.",
