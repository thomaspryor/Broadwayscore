The original rating of 87 supports a high Positive score, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Groban's performance, calling it a \"compelling watch.\" Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a strong recommendation. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance, calling it 'compelling,' but limited context requires conservative placement in the Positive bucket per excerpt guidance.",
