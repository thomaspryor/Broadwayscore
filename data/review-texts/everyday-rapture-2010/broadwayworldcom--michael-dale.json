  "bwwExcerpt": "Of course, the Sherie Rene Scott who describes herself on stage as, 'one of Broadway's biggest and brightest semi-stars,' in the enormously entertaining variety hour (and a half) she calls Everyday Rapture, is actually a character created by the Sherie Rene Scott who co-authored the smart, semi-autobiographical musical with Dick Scanlan. Which details are factual and which are, shall we say, enhanced, are for them to know and for us to not give a damn about as we're laughing, tapping our toes and enjoying the fizzy charms of this impeccably funny, semi-funked up chanteuse.",
