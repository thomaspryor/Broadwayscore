  "bwwExcerpt": "With those doleful eyes, that wide permafrost smile set at a perpetual three-minutes-to-irony, and a crinkly mezzo that slingshots from brassy to bruised, Sherie Rene Scott (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Aida) has steadily established herself as New York’s leading comic divette. Does that mean we care about her life? Scott, smartly, assumes we don’t. In Everyday Rapture, a self-deconstructing micro-revue tracing her transformation from Kansas Mennonite to “Broadway semi-star,” Scott uses the blimp-hangar that is the American Airlines Theatre as an echo chamber for her wit, backed by her “Mennonettes” and an eclectic set list that ranges from Judy Garland to Tom Waits to, yes, an erotic Mr. Rogers tribute medley. Tom Kitt’s typically brilliant arrangements are half the reason for showing up; the other half is Scott, whose lambent ease with the absurd (cleverly refined by director Michael Mayer and book co-writer Dick Scanlan) makes Everyday much more than just another maudlin auto-cabaret.",
