  "bwwExcerpt": "Problematic with such a show is whether to accept its oddities as peculiar but true or to question them as fabrications usurping the privilege of facts. The show’s solution is to postulate a heroine called “Sherie Rene,” who both is and isn’t Scott. To which I say that “Everyday Rapture” both is and isn’t a show.",
