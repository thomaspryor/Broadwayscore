  "bwwExcerpt": "'Everyday Rapture' is little changed from the Second Stage production last year off-Broadway. There was concern that it would get swallowed up in the larger American Airlines Theatre. But while less intimate now, under Michael Mayer's solid direction it remains both a witty parody of confessional shows and an earnest showcase for a gifted diva. Scott makes fun of herself as one of Broadway's brightest semi-stars, but her glittering performance proves she is a full-fledged star.",
