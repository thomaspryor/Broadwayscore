  "bwwExcerpt": "But for all the script's funny one-liners, vignettes like Scott's account of losing her virginity to a Times Square street magician don't have much resonance. A lengthy segment centering on an obsessive teenage fan (Eamon Foley) who posted a video on YouTube of himself lip-synching to one of her songs is more creepy than amusing. Scott, accompanied by backup singers Lindsay Menez and Betsy Wolfe, handles the musical and narrative demands of the show in fine fashion. But 'Rapture' comes across as overly precious and lacking the thematic heft that would justify its unexpected Broadway berth.",
