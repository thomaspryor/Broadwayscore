  "bwwExcerpt": "But for all the script's funny one-liners, vignettes like Scott's account of losing her virginity to a Times Square street magician don't have much resonance. A lengthy segment centering on an obsessive teenage fan (Eamon Foley) who posted a video on YouTube of himself lip-synching to one of her songs is more creepy than amusing. Scott, accompanied by backup singers Lindsay Menez and Betsy Wolfe, handles the musical and narrative demands of the show in fine fashion. But 'Rapture' comes across as overly precious and lacking the thematic heft that would justify its unexpected Broadway berth.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite praising Scott's performance, the critic finds the material lacking resonance and questions why it deserves a Broadway production. The overall assessment is negative. | GPT-4o: The review highlights issues with the script's resonance and thematic depth, suggesting the show doesn't justify its Broadway run. While performances are handled well, the overall tone is negative. | Gemini: The review praises Scott's performance but finds the script lacking resonance and thematic heft, resulting in a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and smaller outlet lower confidence. | Kimi: While the critic praises the lead performer's handling of the material and acknowledges some funny one-liners, the final verdict clearly criticizes the show as 'overly precious' and lacking sufficient substance for a Broadway production, ultimately questioning its presence on the Main Stem.",
