  "bwwExcerpt": "'Everyday Rapture' is an easygoing end to a frantic Broadway season. This is Sherie Rene Scott's likable 90-minute, semiautobiographical musical - an Off-Broadway hit last summer at Second Stage and now the Roundabout Theatre's last-minute savior after the revival of 'Lips Together, Teeth Apart' crumbled with the abrupt departure of Megan Mullally.",
