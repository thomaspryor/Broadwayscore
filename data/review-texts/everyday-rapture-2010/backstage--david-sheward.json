  "bwwExcerpt": "This cabaret-style show, which fills in the end-of-season slot at Roundabout Theatre Company after the revival of 'Lips Together, Teeth Apart' was indefinitely postponed, breaks all the one-person-show rules. There's more than one actor in the cast; the witty script, by Scott and Dick Scanlan, doesn't follow a clear chronological line; and Scott wisely avoids playing all the other characters in her story. That tale traces Scott's journey from a repressive Mennonite upbringing in Topeka, Kan. to 'numerous second leads in Broadway musicals.' Employing a dry, ironic tone, Scott is not afraid to include herself among her satiric targets as she skewers the narrow fundamentalism of her hometown, the pain of being a misfit in high school, and the obsessions of musical theater fanatics.",

The critic appreciates Scott's dry, ironic tone and her willingness to include herself as a satiric target. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the show's wit and Scott's effective use of irony in her performance. The review suggests a positive reception but lacks strong superlatives or explicit recommendations, placing it in the lower range of Positive. | Gemini: The review describes the show as witty and satiric, with Scott's performance being a highlight. However, due to the limited excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the show's unconventional structure, 'witty script,' and performer's 'wise' artistic choices and sharp satire, indicating a clear recommendation despite limited context.",
