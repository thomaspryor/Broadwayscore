  "bwwExcerpt": "The musical interludes are uniformly splendid. Backed by her two Mennonettes (Lindsay Mendez, Betsy Wolfe), Scott is a stylist in full control of her instrument. The low-key arrangements by Tom Kitt ('Next to Normal') only enhance her amalgam of precision and warmth. And yet the show sometimes feels out of joint. In a smaller setting, 'Everyday Rapture' achieved a near-miraculous balance between narcissistic bravado, self-mocking and sentimentality. But the last weighs heavier here, and the inspirational tidbits take over. If there's a lesson in this, it's that corn should stay in Kansas.",
