  "bwwExcerpt": "\"'Rapture,' which opened Thursday at the Roundabout's  American Airlines  Theatre, fits just fine into a large space, much  bigger that  off-Broadway's Second Stage Theatre where the production  had a  successful run last year. But then the bubbly, blond,  multitalented  Scott has one of those quirky, expansive theater  personalities that can  really fill a stage.\"",
