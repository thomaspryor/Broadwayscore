    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for the star's performance with strong language ('force of nature'), but this is only a single excerpt focusing on one performer, so the overall show verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for Chita Rivera's performance, describing her as a 'force of nature' with 'vulnerability and steely determination.' However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, and the score is at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Chita Rivera's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation strength, so I've placed it in the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the lead performer using superlatives like 'force of nature,' indicating a positive assessment. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the upper Positive range, though limited context prevents higher confidence.",
