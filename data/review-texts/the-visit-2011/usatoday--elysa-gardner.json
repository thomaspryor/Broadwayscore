Given single excerpt warning and clearly positive tone about the lead performance, scoring in upper Positive range, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Chita Rivera's performance, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Chita Rivera's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation strength, so I've placed it in the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance ('force of nature'), suggesting a positive view, though the limited context prevents a definitive assessment of the overall production.",
