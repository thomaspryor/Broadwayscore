    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. The review acknowledges positive elements (emotional weight) but identifies significant limitations (constrained by reverence), indicating neither a clear recommendation nor discouragement. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 places it in the Mixed bucket. The review acknowledges emotional weight but notes constraints, indicating a balanced view. | Gemini: The review acknowledges emotional weight but also notes constraints, suggesting a mixed experience. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 60 falls within the Mixed range (55-69). The review praises the emotional weight and faithfulness but criticizes the constraints of reverence to the source material, resulting in a balanced, middle-of-the-road assessment.",
