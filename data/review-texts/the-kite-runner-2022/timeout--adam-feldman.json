Acknowledges emotional impact but identifies constraint as a significant flaw. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the adaptation's emotional impact but notes it feels constrained, aligning with the critic's original rating of 60, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges emotional weight but also notes constraints, suggesting a mixed experience. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The critic's 60/100 rating and balanced assessment—praising the emotional impact while criticizing the production's excessive reverence for the source material—indicate a middle-of-the-road verdict with neither strong recommendation nor dismissal.",
