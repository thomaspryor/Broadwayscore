    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Text is clearly truncated mid-sentence. The excerpt shows high anticipation followed by 'But in reality' suggesting disappointment, with talent praised but material criticized. Single excerpt warning applies - could be cherry-picked negative moment from a more positive review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the concept and onstage talent but suggests the book and music do not meet expectations. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a mixed verdict with low confidence. | Gemini: The review expresses excitement about the concept but suggests the execution doesn't fully deliver, indicating a mixed assessment. The truncated text makes it difficult to determine the overall recommendation with high confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the diverse casting concept and onstage talent but implies the book and music are significantly weaker ('runs much hotter than'), creating a mixed assessment. Single excerpt and truncation warrant low confidence.",
