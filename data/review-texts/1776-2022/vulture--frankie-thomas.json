Single excerpt limits confidence, but clear positive trajectory from initial puzzlement to enjoyment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a strong positive impression, with high praise for the talent level and casting. Despite initial reservations, the critic quickly becomes absorbed by the performance, indicating an overall positive verdict. | Gemini: The review states that the show \"wins you over in minutes\" and praises the talent level and charismatic lead, indicating a positive recommendation. The initial reservations are quickly dismissed. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows clear enthusiasm and recommendation ('wins you over', 'charismatic'), but single-source truncation warrants low confidence per instructions.",
