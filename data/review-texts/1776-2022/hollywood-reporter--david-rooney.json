    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong positive language ('exhilarating', 'crackles with contemporary relevance') suggests enthusiastic recommendation. Using upper end of Positive range due to single excerpt warning and clearly positive tone. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('exhilarating', 'crackles with contemporary relevance'), suggesting an enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"exhilarating\" to describe the revival, which indicates a positive sentiment. Given that this is the only excerpt available, and it is strongly positive, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strongly positive evaluative language ('exhilarating,' 'crackles'), placing it in the upper range of the Positive bucket, though limited context necessitates low confidence.",
