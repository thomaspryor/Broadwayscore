    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt acknowledges significant talent but concludes with criticism about the show being 'raucous' and lacking cohesion. This balanced assessment with no clear recommendation suggests Mixed territory. Low confidence due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges the talent but criticizes the production for lacking cohesion. The single excerpt and lack of a clear positive or negative recommendation suggest a mixed review. | Gemini: The review acknowledges talent but ultimately finds the production too chaotic and lacking cohesion, suggesting a mixed experience. The truncated text and single excerpt lower the confidence. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the cast's talent, the 'but overall' pivot delivers a clear negative verdict criticizing the production as chaotic, unfocused, and failing to achieve cohesion.",
