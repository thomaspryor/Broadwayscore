Given single excerpt warning and mild positive language, scored in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'very worthwhile', indicating a positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so a lower score within the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The single quote available is positive, calling the show \"very worthwhile.\" Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic explicitly praises the show as 'very worthwhile,' indicating a clear recommendation that the production has merit, though the single excerpt limits confidence in the full assessment.",
