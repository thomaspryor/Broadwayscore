  "bwwExcerpt": "It wins you over in minutes. Though I spent the opening number puzzling over what the nontraditional casting was doing for the show - what statement it was making, how literally we were meant to interpret it, whether it was working too hard against the text - I soon ceased to notice it at all. The talent level is so high that the casting feels less conceptual and more incidental. Led by the charismatic Crystal Lucas-Perry as John Adams, the ensemble cast is a thrilling mix of Broadway veterans (including Carolee Carmello, resplendent in villain mode as John Dickinson) and newcomers. My favorites - it's the kind of show that encourages you to pick favorites - were Shawna Hamic, bombastic as Richard Henry Lee, Brooke Simpson, sparkly and adorable as Roger Sherman, and Patrena Murray, whose wry, understated performance as Benjamin Franklin feels definitive. But the shared energy and chemistry transcend any individual performance, and under the direction of Page and Paulus, everyone onstage seems to be having the time of their life.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite calling the musical 'fundamentally corrupted,' the critic expresses being 'deeply moved' and explicitly wants 'other people to witness it.' This is a clear recommendation despite reservations. Single excerpt warning requires caution - scored in upper Positive range given the strong emotional response and explicit recommendation to others. | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses a strong positive reaction, highlighting the beauty and joy found in the production despite its flaws. The critic's desire for others to witness it suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The critic states they are \"deeply moved\" and \"glad to have witnessed it\" and wants others to see it, indicating a positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt and mention of a \"fundamentally corrupted musical\" suggest a strong but potentially qualified positive, so I chose a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains an explicit recommendation ('I want other people to witness it') and expresses strong emotional engagement ('deeply moved'), indicating a positive verdict for the production despite acknowledging flaws in the source material.",
