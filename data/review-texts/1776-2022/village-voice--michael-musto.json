  "bwwExcerpt": "Despite the occasional A for effort moments, the production still clocks in as a potent revival-something not easy to pull off, considering that the show has a lengthy Act One section where independence is discussed in the Congressional chamber and the politicos have the nerve not to bother to sing or dance at all! The sets are relatively uninspired (especially what looks like a big shower curtain with flag images on it, plus the humdrum-looking desks at Independence Hall), and the sudden use of contemporary activism videos at one point in Act II is jarring, but again, what propels this production is a bold willingness to take chances-and believe me, it resonates.",

The positive verdict outweighs the criticisms. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges flaws in the production design and some jarring elements but ultimately describes it as a 'potent revival' that 'resonates,' indicating a positive recommendation despite reservations. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws (uninspired sets, jarring video use) but ultimately concludes that the production is a \"potent revival\" due to its \"bold willingness to take chances.\" This suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: Despite specific criticisms of the uninspired sets and jarring contemporary video elements, the critic ultimately classifies the show as a 'potent revival' that resonates, recommending it for its bold risk-taking.",
