  "bwwExcerpt": "The remarkable revival of '1776,' cast entirely with female, transgender and nonbinary actors, is not as much about the pronouns as it is about a verb. Because the delightful ensemble owns the script and score of this 1969 musical as if the story of the signing of the Declaration of Independence were written explicitly about them. That sense of new ownership joyfully pervades this splendid production, which opened officially Thursday night at Broadway's American Airlines Theatre. Directors Jeffrey Page and Diane Paulus adhere to the philosophy of 'Hamilton's' Lin-Manuel Miranda, the founding father of the proposition that all men (and women and trans and nonbinary people) are created equal when it comes to serenading us about the birth of the country.",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the ensemble's performance and suggests a strong connection to the material, indicating an enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, praising the ensemble's performance and ownership of the material. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I'm scoring it in the upper end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt displays unambiguous enthusiasm, praising the ensemble as 'delightful' and perfectly suited to the material. Following the instruction to use the upper end of the Positive bucket (80-84) for clearly positive curated excerpts.",
