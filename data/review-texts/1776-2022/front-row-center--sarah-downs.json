    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt criticizes a key song for devolving from 'powerful' to 'counterproductive,' suggesting poor execution. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review's verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes a shift from powerful to counterproductive, indicating mixed feelings. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach. | Gemini: The excerpt describes a shift from \"powerful commentary\" to \"counterproductive\" caricature, indicating a mixed assessment. Given the single excerpt and the negative turn, a score in the mixed range is appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges 'powerful commentary' initially but criticizes the execution for devolving into 'caricature' and becoming 'counterproductive,' indicating a mixed assessment. With only one curated excerpt available, confidence must remain low regarding the overall verdict.",
