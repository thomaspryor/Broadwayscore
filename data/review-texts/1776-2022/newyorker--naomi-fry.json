    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the production positively as 'breathing fresh life' and avoiding being 'musty,' but with only one curated quote available, the full review sentiment is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive reception, highlighting the innovative casting and revitalization of the material. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive reimagining of the musical, breathing fresh life into it. Given that it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the production's innovative casting and direction, which successfully revitalizes the material. While clearly positive, the language lacks the superlatives ('masterpiece,' 'triumph') typical of a rave review.",
