    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic dismisses the revival as 'over-amplified' and 'terminally woke' with nothing meaningful to contribute. Despite praising some 'revolutionary elements,' the overall assessment is clearly negative. Single excerpt warning requires caution about full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the revival as 'over-amplified' and 'terminally woke', suggesting it lacks substance. The lack of elderly casting is noted as a negative. The tone suggests a negative view, but with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is negative, calling the revival \"over-amplified, terminally woke\" and saying it \"doesn't really have anything to say.\" Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges some elements as 'truly revolutionary,' the overall verdict condemns the revival as 'over-amplified' and lacking substance, with 'terminally woke' used pejoratively to dismiss the production's relevance.",
