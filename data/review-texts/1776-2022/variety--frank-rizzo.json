  "bwwExcerpt": "Co-directors Diane Paulus and Jeffrey L. Page apply a bold Brechtian brush to this picture with its casting, staging, musical arrangements and design. Without changing the narrative, it adds layers of context that offer further shadings to the musical, even though at times the results are somewhat crude, clunky or overdone.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows appreciation for the production's fresh perspective and reframing of history, using positive language like 'inspires' and 'witness anew.' However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive reinterpretation of the classic, inspiring yet haunting. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive reframing of history, but the phrase \"continues to haunt in its incompleteness\" indicates reservations. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers qualified praise, appreciating the production's reframing and inspirational quality while acknowledging a haunting 'incompleteness'; given the limited context, this suggests a mildly positive recommendation.",
