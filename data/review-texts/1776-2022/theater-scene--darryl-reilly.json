    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for both source material and this production's execution. 'Done justice' indicates the revival successfully honors beloved material with a 'terrific' diverse cast. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production for doing justice to the original material with a diverse cast, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, the confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"immortal,\" \"monumental,\" and \"terrific,\" indicating a positive assessment of the revival. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strongly positive language ('terrific,' 'done justice'), warranting upper Positive range per instructions for clearly positive isolated quotes. Limited confidence due to lack of full context.",
