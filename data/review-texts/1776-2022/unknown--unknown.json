However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation - the full review verdict could differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the production for being overdone and incomprehensible, indicating a negative view. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the production as \"overpumped and overplayed\" and \"hardly comprehensible,\" indicating a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers a clear negative verdict, criticizing the production as 'overpumped and overplayed' to the point of being 'hardly comprehensible' due to a 'fundamental misunderstanding' of the source material.",
