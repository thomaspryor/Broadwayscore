    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single sentence fragment praising the casting approach with qualified approval. Low confidence due to extremely brief excerpt that may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges a potentially gimmicky casting choice but concludes it 'works quite well', indicating a positive view. However, the text is short and lacks detailed evaluation, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review states that the casting choice \"works quite well,\" indicating a positive, albeit reserved, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic gives a qualified but clear endorsement, stating that the diverse casting concept works well despite initial skepticism. The phrase 'works quite well' indicates a solid positive recommendation.",
