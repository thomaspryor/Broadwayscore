    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt acknowledges flaws ('can quibble about many other things') but ends with clear praise for the show's relevance and impact. Single excerpt warning requires caution - this sounds mildly positive, so lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the production effectively communicates with contemporary audiences, indicating a positive reception despite some quibbles. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context warrant a cautious, lower-end positive score. | Gemini: The review acknowledges issues with the production but ultimately states that the show resonates with audiences, suggesting a positive but not rave recommendation. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges minor quibbles with the production but delivers an unambiguous recommendation that the show effectively resonates with contemporary audiences, using strong affirmative language ('no question', 'loudly and clearly').",
