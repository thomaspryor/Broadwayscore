Given single excerpt warning and mildly positive tone, scoring at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the revival as 'timely and timeless' with a 'fresh perspective,' suggesting a strong positive reception. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive reception, highlighting the timeliness and timelessness of the revival. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise ('timely and timeless,' 'fresh perspective') indicating a favorable recommendation, though the single-excerpt limitation warrants caution.",
