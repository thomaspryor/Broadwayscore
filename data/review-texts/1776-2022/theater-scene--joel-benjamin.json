  "showScoreExcerpt": "Directed by Diane Paulus and Jeffrey L. Page (who also did the simplistic choreography), this production’s well-meaning gimmick is to have all the historic characters played by a “cast that includes multiple representations of race, ethnicity and gender [who] identify as female, transgender and nonbinary,” to quote the exacting language of the production’s press release. This casting coup works most notably as a political statement, hopefully forcing the audience take a fresh look at the original all-male contingent, however brilliant they may have been, and their flaws. The word “woman” never appears in the Declaration of Independence (nor the Constitution) and the millions of Black slaves were quite purposely and expediently left out of the Declaration. This multi-racial cast is a not-so-subtle slap in their faces.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt focuses on casting choices as political statement with mixed assessment - praises the concept but calls choreography 'simplistic' and approach a 'gimmick.' Low confidence due to limited text and unclear overall verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the casting as a political statement, with no clear recommendation for or against seeing the show. The lack of a clear verdict and the focus on political commentary leads to a mixed classification with low confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers qualified praise for the political impact of the diverse casting while criticizing the 'simplistic choreography' and characterizing the approach as a 'well-meaning gimmick.' Without access to the full review's final verdict, the overall recommendation remains ambiguous.",
