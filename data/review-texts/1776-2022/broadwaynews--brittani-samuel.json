    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The word 'Unfortunately' signals disappointment, and the critic finds the show limited in its ability to make meaningful points. However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict may be different. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view of the storyline, indicating it fails to make an interesting point. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is negative about the storyline, suggesting a lack of compelling elements beyond casting and costuming. Given the limited text, a negative score is appropriate, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the storyline as uninteresting and lacking depth, suggesting only technical elements like casting and costuming provide value. With only one curated excerpt available, the overall verdict likely falls in the negative range, though confidence is limited.",
