They possess an attitude — a very big attitude — toward the female character they’re portraying.\n\nUtterly lacking is any point of view when the female, transgender or nonbinary actors put on men’s clothes in the new revival of “1776,” which opened Thursday at Roundabout’s American Airline Theatre.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "John Adams may be the biggest bore ever to be the lead character in an American musical stage. He and others keep telling us what an insufferable pedant he is. Here, Crystal Lucas-Perry plays him as straight and humorless as any male actor ever has. Beyond the nontraditional casting, there's nothing very revolutionary about this lackluster '1776.'",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Pan/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Critic calls the show 'terrible' and criticizes the book as 'possibly the dullest, longest book scenes ever written for a musical.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this may be cherry-picked negative content from a more balanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is highly negative, calling the show 'terrible' and criticizing the book scenes as 'dull' and 'longest ever written for a musical.' The single excerpt warning suggests caution, but the language indicates a strong pan. | Gemini: The excerpt states that the show is \"terrible\" and the book is \"dullest, longest ever written.\" Given the negative language, I'm placing this in the negative bucket. Confidence is low due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers an unambiguously negative verdict using words like 'terrible' and 'dullest,' which would place it in the Negative bucket. However, given the warning that this is a single curated excerpt that may be cherry-picked, confidence is set to low. | Buckets: claude=Pan, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Negative",
