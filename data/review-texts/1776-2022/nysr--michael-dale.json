    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes positive qualities (fresh energy, relevance) but is too brief and potentially cherry-picked to determine full recommendation strength. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a positive view of the revival, noting 'fresh energy' and 'contemporary relevance'. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive assessment, highlighting \"fresh energy and contemporary relevance.\" However, due to the limited text, I am scoring it at the lower end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear, unqualified praise for the production's vitality and modern resonance. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is low per instructions, but the language is distinctly positive.",
