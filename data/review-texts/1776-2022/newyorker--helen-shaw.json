    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed assessment - acknowledges the show's powerful musical moments while critiquing its political/artistic limitations. With only one curated quote available, confidence is necessarily low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the power of musical moments, suggesting a positive impact. However, the limited context and single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious, low-confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the power of the musical moments, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low, and the score is placed at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, noting that while 'stern looks' politically and artistically fall short, the musical numbers are powerful and effective enough to 'rally the troops,' indicating a conditional recommendation based on the score.",
