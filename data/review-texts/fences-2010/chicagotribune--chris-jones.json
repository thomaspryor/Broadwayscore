  "bwwExcerpt": "Certainly, Washington eroticizes Troy, a character typically played by more stentorian actors with deeper bass notes and thicker girths (although Washington has put on a few pounds and wants not for gravitas). But that potent sexual appeal — underexpressed in most productions of this oft-revived masterpiece — is very much a part of Troy. He was, after all, a star athlete of the Negro Leagues, and his married state doesn't prevent him from bedding a much younger woman (unseen but with enthusiasm implied) and fathering her child. Viola Davis, who plays Rose, the wife Troy betrays, uses that more powerful sense of sexual betrayal to fuel the play's famous Act 2 howl of anguish with such force that you're moved to tears. If Troy is already a broken, angry man, Rose hasn't lost much. But when you're losing Denzel Washington to some cheap floozy — well, the stakes can't help but rise.",
