  "bwwExcerpt": "But Washington's Troy, while vigorous and charismatic, isn't long on nuance; and in that sense it is of a piece with the staging. Directed by Kenny Leon, an experienced and astute purveyor of Wilson's work, this Fences makes the characters' struggles briskly accessible and absorbing, but doesn't always capture their depth and resonance.",
