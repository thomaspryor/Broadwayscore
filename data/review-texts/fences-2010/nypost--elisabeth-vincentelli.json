  "bwwExcerpt": "Denzel Washington is the draw for this revival of August Wilson's 'Fences.' But it's the play itself that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats: This is pure, unabashed melodrama -- the kind where the line 'Got something to tell you' never introduces good news. The 1987 play, which won both the Pulitzer and Tony, may not be Wilson's most sophisticated effort -- brace yourself for multiple baseball analogies -- but it's one of his most emotionally effective. And it feels good to be taken for a ride by such a storyteller, especially when the ride is as delicately staged, as gorgeously acted as it is here.",
