  "bwwExcerpt": "Leon — who helmed Wilson’s final two works, Gem of the Ocean and Radio Golf — has built a sturdy, buffed-to-a-sheen Fences, buoyed by a top-shelf supporting cast (Henderson is the quintessential Wilson interpreter) and Branford Marsalis’ beautiful bluesy between-scenes music. Pity that he’s glossed over the play’s doleful, poetic soul.",
