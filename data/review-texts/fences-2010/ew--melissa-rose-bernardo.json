  "bwwExcerpt": "Leon — who helmed Wilson’s final two works, Gem of the Ocean and Radio Golf — has built a sturdy, buffed-to-a-sheen Fences, buoyed by a top-shelf supporting cast (Henderson is the quintessential Wilson interpreter) and Branford Marsalis’ beautiful bluesy between-scenes music. Pity that he’s glossed over the play’s doleful, poetic soul.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Praises the production values, cast, and music, but the final line 'Pity that he's glossed over the play's doleful, poetic soul' suggests a significant flaw that undermines the overall experience. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the production's sturdy build and strong cast but notes a significant reservation about missing the play's 'doleful, poetic soul.' The single excerpt suggests a positive recommendation with notable caveats. | Gemini: The review praises the cast, direction, and music but criticizes the production for glossing over the play's soul. This suggests a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the excerpt praises the 'top-shelf' cast, 'beautiful' music, and 'sturdy' production, it concludes with significant criticism that the director has 'glossed over the play's doleful, poetic soul'—a substantial reservation for an August Wilson revival. With only one excerpt available, confidence is low, but the mixed signals suggest neither a clear recommendation nor a dismissal.",
