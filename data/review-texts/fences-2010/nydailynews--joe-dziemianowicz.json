  "bwwExcerpt": "Washington seems to have seized upon Rose's comment that when Troy 'walked through the house, he was so big he filled it up.' If he sank fully into his character, an outsize performance could work. But Washington never lets you forget you're watching him act. That fact is amplified by director Kenny Leon's tendency to overemphasize the play's inherent soapiness. Lines are underlined and spelled out in capital letters. It doesn't draw you in to Wilson's characters, but builds a fence between you and them.",
