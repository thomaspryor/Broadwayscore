  "bwwExcerpt": "The star of a show doesn't always get top billing. Denzel Washington is by far the biggest name associated with the first Broadway revival of August Wilson's 'Fences,' but my guess is that it's Viola Davis whose performance is going to stick with you. Not that Mr. Washington is anything less than solid, but Ms. Davis is something else again. I knew she was a remarkable artist—anyone who saw her in the Off-Broadway premiere of Lynn Nottage's 'Intimate Apparel' or the film version of John Patrick Shanley's 'Doubt' knows that—but what she's doing this time around goes straight into my scrapbook of stage performances from which you learn how brutally true to life great acting can be.",

The language about performances that teach 'how brutally true to life great acting can be' suggests high artistic value and clear recommendation, though excerpt focuses on acting rather than full production. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Viola Davis's performance as exceptional and memorable, suggesting a strong recommendation. Denzel Washington is described as 'solid,' indicating a positive overall impression. However, given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses heavily on praising Viola Davis's performance, calling it exceptional and memorable. While it mentions Denzel Washington positively, the emphasis on Davis suggests a strong recommendation, placing it in the positive bucket. However, due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise for Viola Davis's performance ('brutally true to life great acting'), implying the show is unmissable for her work alone, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
