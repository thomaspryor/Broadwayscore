  "bwwExcerpt": "His movie-star charisma on full display, Washington infuses his compelling turn with equal doses of raucous humor and barely contained violence that keep the audience constantly off-guard. He's beautifully matched by Davis, who conveys her character's indefatigable inner strength and endless reserves of warmth so vividly that when her character suffers a deep betrayal in Act 2, the effect is shattering.",
