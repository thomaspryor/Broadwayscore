  "bwwExcerpt": "Six years ago, gifted director Kenny Leon delivered a fine production of 'A Raisin in the Sun' to Broadway, marred only by the stage inexperience of its bankable star, Sean Combs. Back with another classic chronicling the African-American experience, and this time with the right star in place, Leon knocks it out of the park with this beautifully calibrated realization of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize–winning 'Fences.' Denzel Washington is magnificent in the role indelibly created by James Earl Jones, and the astonishing Viola Davis matches him every step of the way. It's a deeply moving, hugely satisfying evening of theater.",
