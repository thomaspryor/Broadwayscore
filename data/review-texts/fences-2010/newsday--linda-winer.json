  "bwwExcerpt": "Despite its 1987 Pulitzer Prize and its Tony Award, 'Fences' always was a glorious mess of a drama. As the second of what became August Wilson's monumental 10-play journey through African-American life in the 20th century, the early work is more plotted, structurally clumsy and melodramatic than the rest of the cycle. And that's the last negative observation you'll read in this space. 'Fences' has been magnificently revived - in all its messy glory - by director Kenny Leon with a splendid ensemble topped, but not dwarfed, by Denzel Washington and Viola Davis.",
