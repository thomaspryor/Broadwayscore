  "bwwExcerpt": "First seen in New York in 1987 with James Earl Jones, 'Fences' has now returned with an equally starry actor, Denzel Washington in the lead. Washington, last on Broadway in 2005 in a production of 'Julius Caesar,' acquits himself well in this blistering revival, directed with a sure, steady hand by Wilson veteran Kenny Leon. It's a big, bold performance in a big, bold play, rife with emotion-drenched soliloquies for its star about life, love, death and the devil.",
