  "bwwExcerpt": "Kenny Leon's lightweight production captures the intricate rhythms of Wilson's language, but never moves beyond the play's surface. Though enjoyable, this 'Fences' feels less like a substantial drama than a broad sitcom comedy stuffed with melodramatic shocks and awes. Washington comes off not as Troy, but a charismatic movie star wearing an unglamorous sanitation jumpsuit as a lark.",
