  "bwwExcerpt": "I won't say that a better playwright might not have been able to make something watchable out of this clichéd scenario, but what Miller made out of it in 1972 was pretty much what you'd have expected from a second-rate writer born in 1939 who had drunk deep from the well of the '60s and now proposed to inform his audiences that their parents' values were comprehensively corrupt. Hence the coach, a boorish, ill-educated stage-Irish blowhard who proudly displays pictures of Teddy Roosevelt, John Kennedy and Fightin' Joe McCarthy on his mantelpiece and salts his small talk with good old-fashioned ethnic slurs of the highest possible voltage, thereby alerting the audience to his lack of enlightenment. Hence, too, his 'boys,' all of whom are louts save for Tom, who clearly speaks for the author (and who is played in this revival by the author's son).",

However, given this appears to be a truncated excerpt with only one sentence provided, confidence is reduced as the final recommendation could potentially shift with additional context.",
