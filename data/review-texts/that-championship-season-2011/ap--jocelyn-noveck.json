  "bwwExcerpt": "At the curtain call of a recent preview, one of the cast members cracked a joke, and the rest of the actors broke up laughing. They left the stage arm-in-arm, still guffawing. Such easy camaraderie would seem hard to fake, and it serves the cast well. 'That Championship Season' has been revived to excellent effect by a talented, committed ensemble of actors.",
