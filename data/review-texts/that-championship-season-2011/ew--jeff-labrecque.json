  "bwwExcerpt": "Noth and Gaffigan are superb, though on familiar character ground. Noth especially turns what could be a one-note caricature into something more substantial. Phil is the one man who's trying to move on or just keep up — even if he's clueless how to do so — and Noth successfully evokes the emotional whiplash of his frustrated character.",
