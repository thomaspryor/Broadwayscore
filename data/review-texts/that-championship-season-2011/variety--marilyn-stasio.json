The praise for the cast doesn't overcome the fundamental criticism of the production. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the revival for lacking emotional intensity and feeling dated, despite having a superb cast. This indicates a negative assessment of the overall production. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the revival feels \"tired and dated\" and lacks the emotional intensity of the original, leading to a negative classification. | Kimi: Although the critic acknowledges the cast's abilities, the overall verdict finds the production tired, dated, and lacking the emotional intensity of the original, clearly indicating it is not recommended.",
