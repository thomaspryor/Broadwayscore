  "bwwExcerpt": "While many expert eyes and hands also lavish attention on the new revival of 'That Championship Season,' the results are not nearly as satisfying. The smart and incisive Gregory Mosher (Broadway's 'A View From the Bridge'; the Kennedy Center's 'The Glass Menagerie') has the directorial reins on this occasion, but he's unable to elevate the dramatic stakes of Jason Miller's dated, Pulitzer-winning play above the predictable terrain of a liquor-fueled confessional.",
