  "bwwExcerpt": "Despite its creation in a tumultuous era, this never was a more than a solid piece of middlebrow message-naturalism. And despite the care and affection lavished on the handsome production, it remains a male-bonding parlor drama that signals its big secrets more clearly than it justifies a high-profile revival. Granted, the bar was set high on this one. Last season, Mosher directed a staggering production of 'A View From the Bridge,' starring Liev Schreiber and Scarlett Johansson, revealing unimagined depths in Arthur Miller's melodrama. When Mosher chose Kiefer Sutherland, Jim Gaffigan, Chris Noth, Jason Patric and Brian Cox for this conventional piece of curdled mid-America, one could be forgiven for thinking the director had something special in mind for it.",
