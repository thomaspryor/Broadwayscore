Acknowledges cast effort but recommends against seeing it. | GPT-4o: The review suggests the production is outdated and not worth reviving, despite acknowledging the cast's efforts. This indicates a negative recommendation. | Gemini: The review states that the play should have been left undisturbed, indicating a negative assessment despite acknowledging the cast's efforts. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states the show is a 'theatrical fossil' that should have been 'left undisturbed,' constituting a clear recommendation against seeing it. While acknowledging the cast's efforts, this follows the pattern of performer praise not redeeming a negative verdict.",
