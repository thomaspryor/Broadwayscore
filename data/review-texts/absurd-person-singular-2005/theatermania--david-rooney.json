The praise for the 'game cast' doesn't redeem the overall negative assessment of the production. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong negative language, suggesting the play is outdated and not worth reviving, despite acknowledging the efforts of the cast. | Gemini: The review states that the play is better left undisturbed, indicating a negative assessment despite praising the cast's efforts. | Kimi: The critic explicitly recommends against seeing the revival, declaring it a 'fossil' that should have remained 'undisturbed' despite acknowledging the cast's efforts.",
