  "bwwExcerpt": "McCarrell's believable boyishness, sweet vulnerability, gangly posturing and off-handed humor is appealing, and he manages to keep you engaged even if you've long lost interest in the details of the plot. His singing is sure, and in \"Good Kid,\" the best number in the musical, he shows in a heartbreaking way the pain of trying to fit in before he discovers that \"normal is a myth.\"",
