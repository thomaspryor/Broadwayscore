However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of positive quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a positive verdict, suggesting this production successfully addresses past issues. The strong language 'finally gets this play right' implies a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The quote indicates a strong positive reaction, especially in comparison to previous productions. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic declares this Broadway production succeeds where previous attempts failed, offering a clear endorsement that this version 'gets it right,' though the single excerpt limits confidence in the full assessment.",
