    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises Cox's performance as 'the evening's best' and explains how it makes story elements believable. However, the framing suggests plot believability issues that needed solving, indicating qualified praise rather than enthusiastic recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises a specific performance but does not provide a clear overall recommendation for the show. The focus on a single actor's ability suggests mixed feelings about the production as a whole. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a positive performance, but it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation based on this single quote. Therefore, I'm scoring it as mildly positive with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt praises Cox's performance as the evening's best for making a potentially confusing plot point believable, indicating qualified approval. With only one excerpt available, confidence is reduced per instructions.",
