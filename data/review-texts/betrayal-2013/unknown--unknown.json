However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The phrase \"Critic's Pick\" and the word \"revelatory\" suggest a strong positive review. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am using the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The 'Critic's Pick' designation and use of 'revelatory' indicate clear enthusiasm for this production, placing it in the upper Positive range. However, confidence is low due to availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
