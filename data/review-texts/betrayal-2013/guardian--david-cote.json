However, with only a single truncated excerpt available, confidence is low as the full review verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Daniel Craig's performance, suggesting he brings energy to the role. However, without a full verdict or more context, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score in the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on Daniel Craig's performance and presence, suggesting a positive aspect of the production. However, due to the limited text, it's difficult to determine the overall verdict with high confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Daniel Craig's stage presence and performance, comparing him favorably to his previous Broadway work, though the full review context is unavailable.",
