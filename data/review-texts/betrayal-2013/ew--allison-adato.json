    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: B+ grade indicates solid positive recommendation. The phrase 'command a smart, stripped down' suggests praise for performances and production approach. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation of the performances and production style, with a B+ grade indicating a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is set towards the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt is a B+ and uses the word 'command' to describe the performances, indicating a positive assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: B+ grade with unambiguous praise for the cast ('command') and production ('smart, stripped down') indicates a solid positive recommendation, though the single excerpt limitation requires low confidence.",
