    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes production as 'brilliantly choreographed' which is clear praise, but limited text and excerpt warning require caution about full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'brilliantly choreographed,' indicating strong praise. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The phrase \"brilliantly choreographed production\" suggests a positive assessment. Given that this is a single excerpt, I am scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers strong praise calling the production 'brilliantly choreographed' and the play 'endlessly fascinating,' indicating a clear recommendation, though limited text necessitates conservative scoring at the upper end of the Positive range.",
