    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for all three lead performances ('magnificent', 'stunning') and production ('exceeds those boundaries'), but single excerpt warning requires caution about cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the performances and suggests the production exceeds expectations. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the production and the performances of the actors, indicating a positive review. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise using superlatives like 'magnificent' and 'stunning,' and notes the production exceeds the source material's boundaries. Per instructions for single curated excerpts, scored at the high end of the Positive bucket (80-84).",
