However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the direction and performances, calling the production a \"masterclass.\" Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive with high end of the range, but with low confidence due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong praise ('masterclass', 'extraordinary') but lacks explicit 'must-see' recommendation language required for Rave classification. Per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, scored at upper end of Positive bucket.",
