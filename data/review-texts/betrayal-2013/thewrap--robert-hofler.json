  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Weisz and Spall are so charming and engaging throughout that a palpable sadness settles over the Barrymore Theatre late in the play when we see them so physically and romantically engaged in the flat they've rented...It's a marvel of acting to watch Craig slowly bring the subtext of raging anger to the fore in scene after scene as Spall and Weisz effectively react with knowing silence...\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performances ('charming and engaging', 'marvel of acting') suggests positive recommendation, but single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances as 'charming and engaging' and highlights a 'marvel of acting,' indicating a positive view. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the positive aspects of the performances by Weisz and Spall, describing them as \"charming and engaging\" and a \"marvel of acting.\" Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I placed it in the positive bucket and gave it a higher score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performances, calling them 'charming and engaging' and a 'marvel of acting', indicating a clear recommendation based on the cast's work.",
