    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong superlative praise calling it the most 'devastating, clear-eyed examination' the critic has seen suggests high recommendation. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed overall review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides high praise, calling it the 'most devastating, clear-eyed examination' the critic has seen, indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses strong praise, calling the play \"the most devastating, clear-eyed examination of the arc of a love affair as I've seen.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers strong superlative praise for the production's emotional impact and clarity, warranting a high-positive score, though the limited context necessitates low confidence.",
