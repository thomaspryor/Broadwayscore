  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Craig, his famously chiseled features half-hidden under a '70s shag, seems oddly blasé about his wife's infidelity, while Weisz strikes a lovely if tentative balance between expressive physicality and inward control.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single truncated excerpt shows mixed evaluation - praises Weisz's performance as 'lovely' and credits Spall's strong character work, but criticizes Craig as 'oddly blasé.' The truncation and analytical tone without clear recommendation warrant low confidence and mid-Mixed range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a mix of observations on performances, with some praise for Spall but a sense of detachment from Craig. The lack of a clear positive or negative tone suggests a mixed review. The single excerpt and lack of a full verdict make confidence low. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the actors' performances with some praise but also notes a sense of detachment or tentativeness. The mention of a 'puzzle' suggests a potentially confusing or uneven structure, leading to a mixed assessment. | Kimi: Single truncated excerpt offers qualified praise for Weisz and Spall but criticizes Craig as 'oddly blasé,' suggesting uneven performances without a clear overall recommendation.",
