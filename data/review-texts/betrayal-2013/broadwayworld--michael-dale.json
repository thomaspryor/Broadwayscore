  "bwwExcerpt": "The verbal thrills of Pinter's text arise from the fact that his characters are educated, literary people, well versed in the power of words - and the silences in between them - to attack and humiliate. But what is also revealed by the tightly wound ensemble under Lloyd's guidance is that, despite the play's title, this is also a romantic tragedy, though one played out with carefully restrained emotions. One person's act of Betrayal can be another's act of uncontrolled desire.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises the 'tightly wound ensemble' and Lloyd's direction, with appreciation for how the production reveals deeper layers of Pinter's text. Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds clearly positive so scoring upper end of Positive bucket, but confidence is low due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the strengths of the play's text and the ensemble's performance under Lloyd's direction, suggesting a positive view. However, the single excerpt and lack of a full review text limit confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights the verbal thrills and the romantic tragedy aspect, suggesting a positive experience, but the limited text and lack of a clear recommendation warrant a lower score and confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the 'tightly wound ensemble' under Lloyd's guidance and the 'verbal thrills' of the production, appreciating its carefully restrained emotional qualities. Given the single excerpt warning indicates this is clearly positive, it falls in the upper range of the Positive bucket.",
