    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises 'masterful revival' and 'gifted' director with 'tight thoughtfulness,' suggesting strong positive assessment. However, confidence is low due to single curated quote limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the revival as 'masterful' and praises the direction by Jamie Lloyd as 'tight thoughtfulness'. Despite the limited text, the language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"masterful revival\" and \"gifted Jamie Lloyd,\" indicating a positive review. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive range but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strong superlatives ('masterful', 'gifted') to praise the revival and direction, indicating clear enthusiasm. Per the single-excerpt guidance, this falls in the upper Positive range (80-84), though limited context prevents Rave classification or higher confidence.",
