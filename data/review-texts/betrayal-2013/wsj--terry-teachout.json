However, this is only an excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the production is popular due to star power rather than dramatic quality, indicating a lack of excitement. This points to a mixed review, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the play is relying on star power rather than dramatic merit, implying a negative assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic explicitly attributes the show's sellout crowds solely to star power while stating it lacks dramatic excitement, indicating a negative assessment of the production's quality. Single excerpt limits confidence.",
