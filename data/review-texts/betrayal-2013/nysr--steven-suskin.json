    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: 4/5 stars indicates a strong positive recommendation. The word 'incisively' suggests sharp, effective execution. However, with only a headline excerpt available, confidence must be low as the full critical assessment is missing. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt provides a 4/5 star rating and describes the production as 'incisive', suggesting a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt includes a 4/5 star rating and describes the production as 'incisively' with notable actors, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The 4/5 star rating and praise for the 'incisive' staging of this London transfer indicate a solid recommendation, though the single excerpt limits certainty about the full review's verdict.",
