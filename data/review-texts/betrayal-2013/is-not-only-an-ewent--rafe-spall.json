  "bwwExcerpt": "it's a theatrical assemblage that quickly sold out its run. The show's copywriters describe the demand as \"unprecedented\", but, really, all those $400-plus tickets, and the hand-wringing they occasion, are old news. The prices are worth noting in this instance only because what many people pay is out of balance with what they see on the Barrymore stage.\"",
