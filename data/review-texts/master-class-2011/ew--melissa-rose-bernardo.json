  "bwwExcerpt": "McNally's well-crafted, quip-filled drama — which depicts Callas teaching at Juilliard, circa 1971 (her voice was virtually destroyed by then) — is less a biography and more a love letter to La Divina. So who knows if she really made a singer puke before the poor girl performed Lady Macbeth's letter scene in the Verdi opera, or if Ari actually spoke about his 'big thick uncircumcised Greek d---'? Incidentally, the soprano with the shaky stomach is played by Sierra Boggess — best known as Broadway's original Little Mermaid — who reveals a lovely vibrato but a surprising lack of stage presence; as for the other students, Alexandra Silber is sweetly endearing as the self-professed 'fiery' soprano who, poor thing, doesn't have a look, and Garrett Sorenson is splendid as the cocky tenor doing Cavaradossi's aria from Tosca.",
