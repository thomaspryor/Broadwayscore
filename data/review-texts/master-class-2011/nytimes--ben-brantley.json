More Photos »\n\nTowering before us — and tower she does, though she is not particularly tall — the celebrated opera singer is undeniably, overwhelmingly there. And yet she’s not there at all. One of the most daunting presences you’re ever likely to come across is, on some profound level, absent. Which makes it all the more impossible for you to take your eyes off her.\n\nFollow @NYTimestheater for theater news and reviews from Broadway and beyond.\n\nSierra Boggess, left, and Tyne Daly in the revival of Terrence McNally's “Master Class.” More Photos »\n\nThis paradox is the magic trick at the center of Tyne Daly’s remarkable performance as Maria Callas in “Master Class,” Terrence McNally’s 1995 play about the twilight of that goddess of bel canto. In the production that opened Thursday night at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, Callas is supposedly in an auditorium at the Juilliard School in the early 1970s, where she is instructing students on the art of performing opera.\n\nBut Ms. Daly makes it clear that the awed young things who are trying so hard to hit notes and look heroic are for Callas colorless phantoms. So is the world they inhabit. This Callas lives in a more vivid time, in a moment both eternal and fleeting when the glory of her career matched the appetite of her ambition. That moment is still bright and hot inside her — it’s the only reality she completely acknowledges — and it turns everything else into shadows.\n\n“Master Class” is not, by even a generous reckoning, a very good play, though it can be an entertaining one. Mr. McNally (whose earlier “Lisbon Traviata,” which took a more indirect look at Callas, is a very good play) is an opera buff who here mixed a passionate fan’s knowledge of myth, gossip and music into one pulpy, Broadway-ripe package. Yet Ms. Daly transforms that script into one of the most haunting portraits I’ve seen of life after stardom.\n\nBest known for playing tough, earthy broads on television (“Cagney & Lacey”) and onstage (Momma Rose in “Gypsy”), the square-bodied Ms. Daly would not seem an obvious choice for the rarefied self-creation that was Callas. The elegant Zoe Caldwell, who originated the role (and won her fourth Tony Award for it), certainly looked more like the middle-aged Callas and probably behaved more like the public’s idea of that singer.\n\nBut let’s be honest: although Mr. McNally’s version of Maria Callas shares the résumé of the real star, she is a fabrication, a juiced-up composite of 20th-century divas. While he borrowed a few lines (including much of the final speech) from tapes of Callas sessions at Juilliard, he has also admitted to incorporating aspects of other stars, including Renata Scotto and Leontyne Price. This was probably necessary, as the real Callas was said to be a deeply boring conversationalist.\n\nSo it has hardly seemed blasphemy to have had the Callas of “Master Class” embodied over the years by actresses as different from their prototype (and from one another) as Patti LuPone, Faye Dunaway, Dixie Carter and Fanny Ardant. What the part requires is, above all, an understanding of the ego that both enables the stardom and stunts the lives of those who possess it.\n\nIn this Manhattan Theater Club production, directed by Stephen Wadsworth, the ego of Ms. Daly’s Callas is Olympian and it’s scary. She is not one of those irresistibly charming narcissists who pop up in affectionate satires of show folk like Kaufman and Ferber’s “Royal Family.” True, it looks as if she might be that way in the opening scene, when Callas addresses the audience with cozy condescension while taking digs at other famous sopranos.\n\nHer early interactions with her pianist, Manny (Jeremy Cohen), and a stagehand (Clinton Brandhagen) are amusingly impatient and imperious. So, to some extent, are her sessions with the three students she (sort of) listens to and feels free to insult: two sopranos, Sophie De Palma (Alexandra Silber) and Sharon Graham (Sierra Boggess), and a tenor, Anthony Candolino (Garrett Sorenson).\n\nYet you sense that what’s happening around Callas is of little interest to her. The students, the songs they sing, even her own words matter only insofar as they prompt memories of what was (and for her still is and ever shall be). Even casually dropped names hook into her past, and her torn expressions show it.\n\nGet 50% Off The New York Times & Free All Digital Access.\n\nBillions of dollars have poured into the continent to fight killer diseases. But the most basic killer, injury, is neglected.\n\nIn Room for Debate: Even for students who can afford a semester overseas, there may be better uses for that time and money.",
