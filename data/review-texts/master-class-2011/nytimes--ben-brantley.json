  "bwwExcerpt": "'Master Class' is not, by even a generous reckoning, a very good play, though it can be an entertaining one. Mr. McNally is an opera buff who here mixed a passionate fan's knowledge of myth, gossip and music into one pulpy, Broadway-ripe package. Yet Ms. Daly transforms that script into one of the most haunting portraits I've seen of life after stardom.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises lead performance as saving the show from excess, but excerpt is too brief to assess full critical verdict with confidence. | Gemini: The review praises Daly's performance as Callas, suggesting it elevates the show, but also implies the show itself has potential to be self-indulgent. This indicates a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: While brief, the text offers clear praise for the central performance, crediting Daly with elevating material that otherwise risks pretension. The 'bracing astringency' and ability to 'channel spirit' indicate a strong recommendation conditional on the lead performance.",
