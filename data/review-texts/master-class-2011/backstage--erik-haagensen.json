  "bwwExcerpt": "Manhattan Theatre Club has imported this production of 'Master Class' from the Kennedy Center's 2010 tribute to playwright Terrence McNally, where it was a sizeable hit. Spruced up with some recasting and featuring an improved turn from star Tyne Daly, the show should repeat its D.C. success.",
