  "bwwExcerpt": "Luckily, \"Master Class\" is less a deep character study than an entertainment, and Daly delivers the zingers like the pro that she is, reliably eliciting laughs when she tells a member of an audience \"You don't have a look,\" or when she dismisses the idea that she is engaged in rivalries with other singers: \"How can you have rivals when no one can do what you can do?\".",
