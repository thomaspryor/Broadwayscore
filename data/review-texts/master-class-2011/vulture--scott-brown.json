  "bwwExcerpt": "Problem is, in Wadsworth’s Class, the world just doesn’t feel that dangerous. And while Daly, with her clipped, rabbit-punching rhythms and deep reserves of phlegm, is often wickedly funny (“Does anyone know what time it is? I have a beauty parlor appointment after this”) and unspeakably poignant (“Never move on your applause. It shortens it”), I sometimes felt her playing less the tragic has-been than the self-deluded never-was. For the true diva, maybe there’s not much difference. And maybe that’s why I have trouble caring.",

  "fullText": "I can’t say that Master Class (playing at the Friedman through August 14), Terrence McNally’s wittily imagined version of the tutorials held by a phlegmatic, reminiscing, mot juste–dispensing Maria Callas at Julliard in the seventies, has ever really spoken to me. I’m no opera buff, and since I’m in a confessional mode, I'll tell you that I’m not much for “divas” either; at least, not as theatrical fetish objects. I mostly find them exhausting — the regret, the defiance, the one-liners, I get it. (Nor did I see the original 1996 production of Master Class, which won Zoe Caldwell a Tony, and then cycled through Patti LuPone and Dixie Carter; Faye Dunaway took the role on tour. Even typing all those names exhausts me; I feel like I’m hoisting each individual letter up to a 40-foot marquee.)\n\nMaster Class, produced by Manhattan Theatre Club, is at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre.",

Neither recommends nor discourages. | GPT-4o: The review expresses mixed feelings, acknowledging some humor and poignancy in Daly's performance but also a lack of engagement with the production overall. The critic's personal disinterest in the subject matter and the production's impact leads to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review expresses mixed feelings. It acknowledges Daly's performance and humor but ultimately finds it difficult to care about the character, suggesting a lack of strong engagement with the production. | Kimi: While acknowledging Tyne Daly is 'wickedly funny' and 'unspeakably poignant' in moments, the critic finds the production lacks stakes and ultimately concludes 'I have trouble caring,' indicating a clear recommendation against seeing the show.",
