  "fullText": "The titanic American-born Greek soprano (1923-77) had a terrible face. Or thought she did. Her nose was as long as an anteater’s, and her wide mouth as jarring to the eye as a raw red scar on her olive skin. Had you met her, you might have been afraid to look her in the eye, for fear of recrimination: the world had failed her early on. Her parents, George and Evangelina Kalogeropoulos, had three children: a beautiful girl named Jackie, a boy who died of typhoid fever as a toddler, and then Maria. (The family emigrated from Athens to Queens five months before Callas’s birth.) Evangelina’s disappointment that her third child wasn’t a boy was so great that, for several days, she refused even to look at Maria. Things went downhill from there. Evangelina favored the musically inclined Jackie, but when it was discovered that the four-year-old Maria had a voice she was put to work. In 1937, Evangelina left George and took her daughters back to Athens, where Maria, overweight, myopic, clumsy, and impoverished, was finally taken on by a knowledgeable instructor, who proclaimed her a dramatic soprano. Other teachers followed, all of whom marvelled at the young girl’s tenacity, her bel-canto singing, and her peerless acting ability. (Before Callas, most bel-canto singers just stood at center stage and sang pretty.) Perhaps Callas learned to act in order to entertain the Italian and Greek soldiers her mother forced her to go out with in exchange for food and other wartime scarcities. If that was the case, she extracted herself from her mother’s controlling cruelty by expertly developing what she could control: her voice and her revolutionary approach to a role. As she told one interviewer, she relied on the music to tell her how to play a part; it was all there in the score, if you listened and used your brain a little—but not enough to make you self-conscious.\n\nIn this, Callas resembled another singer who changed the rules: Billie Holiday. Like Holiday, Callas used music as a way of expressing her indomitable, wounded self. While she managed to make opera democratic—by 1956, she had appeared on the cover of Time, and people who had never attended an opera were familiar with her exploits: the broken contracts, the dismissed managers, and so on—there was nothing middle class or comforting about her; she treated opera as a high art that she could fill with base feelings. And, again like Holiday, she was drawn to the wrong men, to men she considered more dangerous and powerful than herself: greatness is isolating. Callas met the Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis in 1957, while she was married to an Italian industrialist, Giovanni Meneghini, whose money and management had propelled her career forward. Two years later, she left her husband, and she spent the rest of her life in love with Onassis, who eventually dumped her for Jacqueline Kennedy (whom he married in 1968). Callas’s sadness over this lost love distanced her more and more from the world in which she had made her name. Perhaps owing to her dramatic weight loss in the fifties, her voice became strained, and from 1965 onward her appearances were infrequent.\n\nIn the fall of 1971, Callas agreed to teach a series of voice classes in New York, and that is where “Master Class” begins. In a black suit, Callas (Tyne Daly) enters the stage, where her accompanist, Emmanuel Weinstock (the charming Jeremy Cohen), waits, smiling. (He is her anchor throughout the play.) The theatre itself is the classroom. Speaking directly to the audience, Callas asks if the room is too bright. Can the lights be turned down, please? Where’s the cushion she asked for, for her seat? Where’s the footstool she needs in order to sit properly? Ah, you. The pianist. Who are you? You don’t look familiar. Speak up! No one can hear you. “Yesterday morning, we worked on ‘Don Carlos’ together.” “Was that you?” Callas doesn’t remember Manny, as she now calls him—she says each character’s name as if she had invented it—because he doesn’t have a distinctive look. As a matter of fact, you there, sitting in the first or third row, you don’t have a look, either. Those lights are turned down now, much better. Bravo. Next victim, please. Ha-ha, of course that’s a joke.\n\nSophie De Palma (the talented and touching Alexandra Silber) enters. She is plump and earnest, and will sing an aria from “La Sonnambula,” one of Callas’s signature pieces. “Good luck,” the diva says, before settling in. But she can’t quite settle. Sophie has barely sung the first vowel before Callas interrupts. Why go on when it’s wrong? Why does Sophie not feel the music, let it fill her up? Callas, McNally wants us to know, is teaching the hard business of make-believe. (She tells Sophie to mind her posture, not as herself but as her character.) Callas puts Sophie through her paces, and, as she does so, McNally’s insightful script—which is full of feeling for all the characters—slowly drifts from Callas’s efforts to teach someone else how to dominate the stage to her actually dominating it, through her memories. The stage goes dark, and Callas, alone now, is carried back in time—to the unattractive, unloved girl she was and to the woman she became, thin and chic and in love with Onassis, whose insults and lack of class turned her on. Callas was schooled in an art; Onassis was schooled in the world of dog-eat-dog. He wanted to sign her to an exclusive contract, “the most fucking exclusive contract anybody ever had,” under which she would sing only for him, and a song she didn’t like. And yet, for her, this defined love: Onassis was a man who could control her and her talent, and whose twin impulses to praise and debase she couldn’t resist.\n\nDuring the intermission, I found myself wondering how Daly and her excellent director, Stephen Wadsworth, would keep all this intellectual and emotional splendor aloft. Though they’d captured my heart with the first half, there was the worry that exhaustion or lack of imagination would cause the acting or the directing to topple. Other questions came to the fore, too: about the nature of celebrity and mythmaking. A few weeks earlier, I’d seen “Celebrity Autobiography,” a performance series, created and developed by Eugene Pack and Dayle Reyfel (at the Triad), in which actors, ranging from the dryly hilarious Sharon Gless to the matchless Rachel Dratch, read from celebrity memoirs. The joke there is on celebrities who chronicle their self-absorption without any self-consciousness at all. (You haven’t lived until you’ve heard Dratch read from Madonna’s 1992 book, “Sex.”) But “Celebrity Autobiography” is entirely about the put-on. What Daly understands about her role as Maria Callas is that Callas can’t put herself on: she doesn’t distinguish between her life and her performance. Her life is a career, and her career is her life—a fact that becomes even clearer in the second act, when she must deal with a strong-willed diva-in-training, Sharon Graham (the appropriately haughty Sierra Boggess). After Callas encourages a stout tenor named Anthony Candolino (the lovely Garrett Sorenson), to whom she offers a degree of tenderness that she wouldn’t extend to a woman, Sharon confronts her with the truth: Sharon would never tax, and thus ruin, her voice by giving everything to opera, as Callas has done. Daly’s face falls, beneath her Egyptian eye makeup and her hauteur, and we feel the melancholy that comes with the segregating force of excellence.\n\nDaly fully embodies this role, in which a less intelligent performer might be tempted to show off. (I didn’t see Zoe Caldwell’s acclaimed interpretation, which won her a Tony for best actress in 1996.) Daly and McNally understand what women of Callas’s generation felt: that, in order to have a career, they had to either hide their feminine vulnerability or hide behind it. Daly wants us to see both the woman and the diva. She wants us to see, too, the point at which Callas could no longer tell the two apart. Callas, like all great, self-created myths, lives on in the darkness of our imaginations as a rage that will not be quieted, a wound that cannot heal. She remains a singular figure in this age of mechanical reproduction, because she proved over and over what art can do: destroy, remake, and nourish the soul. Her music crashes through the walls of indifference with unconquerable sound and immeasurable feeling. ♦",
