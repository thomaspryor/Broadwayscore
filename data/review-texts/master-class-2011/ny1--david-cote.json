  "bwwExcerpt": "McNally’s play may be a bit schematic, punctuated by soul-searching monologues about the diva’s tortured affair with Greek billionaire Aristotle Onassis, but it’s an entertaining vehicle for Daly, and McNally is skilled in balancing bitchy humor and pathos. Moreover, the staging by opera veteran Stephen Wadsworth is stately and dignified without being fussy.",
