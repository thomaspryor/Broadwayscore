  "bwwExcerpt": "Terrence McNally's funny, reverential and wholly engrossing 'Master Class' brings us all too briefly into the distinctive orbit of Maria Callas...And as the play recreates a master class in singing, so Tyne Daly as the singer offers a master class in technique to inspire any acting student or colleague.",
