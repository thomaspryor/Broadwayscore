  "bwwExcerpt": "Goldstein and choreographer Christopher Gattelli milk the in-the-round staging for all it's worth. The band members are scattered among the audience, the actors often run up and down the aisles and volunteers are invited onstage for games of charades and Pictionary. Clean-cut and colorful, this production skews young. It's great for teens, but adults may find its hyperactivity a bit numbing.",
