  "bwwExcerpt": "The show's songs, including 'Day By Day' (warmly sung by Anna Maria Perez de Tagle), 'Learn Your Lessons Well,' 'By My Side' and 'All for the Best,' are well-served by Michael Holland's dynamic orchestrations...It's clever, but the message intended by the parable gets lost. That's the evening's biggest problem: Instead of the show's style enhancing the delivery of its substance, it often obscures it.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt praises musical elements but identifies a fundamental flaw where style obscures substance, calling it 'the evening's biggest problem.' This suggests mixed reception with significant reservations. | GPT-4o: The review praises the orchestrations and performances but criticizes the show for obscuring its message, indicating a mixed verdict. The single excerpt and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the orchestrations and some performances, but ultimately finds that the show's style obscures its message, indicating a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises specific elements like orchestrations and performances but identifies a fundamental flaw where the production style obscures the show's intended message, suggesting neither a clear recommendation nor rejection.",
