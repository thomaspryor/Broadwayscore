  "bwwExcerpt": "The show's songs, including 'Day By Day' (warmly sung by Anna Maria Perez de Tagle), 'Learn Your Lessons Well,' 'By My Side' and 'All for the Best,' are well-served by Michael Holland's dynamic orchestrations...It's clever, but the message intended by the parable gets lost. That's the evening's biggest problem: Instead of the show's style enhancing the delivery of its substance, it often obscures it.",
