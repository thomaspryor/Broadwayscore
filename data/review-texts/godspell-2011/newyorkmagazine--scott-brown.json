  "bwwExcerpt": "The music's been given a once-over, as well, with sometimes radically tricked-out new undercarriages: Gone is the granola folk of 'God Save the People,' replaced by an almost- reggae lilt; 'We Beseech Thee''s gospel revival has been canned in favor of neo-country (and is now performed on, gulp, trampolines). And yet, for all that's changed, it's still much the same spell. 'Bless the Lord' is still the first number to bring down the house (especially as performed by the redoubtable Lindsay Mendez), and incandescent individual performances (Telly Leung's magnificent 'All Good Gifts,' for example) elevate songs that might, in less expert hands, show their age.",
