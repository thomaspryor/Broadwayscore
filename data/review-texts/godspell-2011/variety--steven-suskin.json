  "bwwExcerpt": "Strongest aspect of the affair is the casting: This 'Godspell' is especially well sung. Standing out are Lindsay Mendez (on 'Bless the Lord' and elsewhere) and Telly Leung (on 'All Good Gifts'). The one big letdown comes from Hunter Parrish, the Jesus of the occasion. Parrish has an innocent smile, big blonde hair, and plenty of teeth; he doesn't look like a Ken doll, exactly, but he sings like one. Wallace Smith, as John/Judas, is marginally stronger but not up to the level of the ensemble. One of the surprising bright spots is the entr'acte reprise of 'Learn Your Lessons Well,' sung by Leung (at piano) with Mendez and Smith. Yes, there is an audience for this 'Godspell,' and perhaps they can be reached. But the strengths of the original have been so weighted down by mirthless improvements that it makes for a very long two hours.",
