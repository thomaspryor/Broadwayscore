However, it doesn't express overwhelming enthusiasm, so it's a solid positive rather than a rave. | Kimi: The excerpt uses superlative language ('perfect pitch') to praise the direction and characterization, indicating enthusiastic approval of this production despite the brevity of the text provided. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
