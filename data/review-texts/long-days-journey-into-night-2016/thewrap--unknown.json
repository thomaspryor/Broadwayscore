  "fullText": "James Tyrone is as miserly as ever in the Roundabout Theatre Company’s Broadway revival of Eugene O’Neill’s “Long Day’s Journey Into Night,” which opened Wednesday at the American Airlines Theatre.

Every prematurely extinguished lightbulb, all those cheap hotel rooms he booked on the road, that quack doctor he ordered for his wife, and now the charity sanitarium where he’ll send his son to die of consumption — it’s all there in the tight, controlled way Byrne talks and moves and even sips his whiskey.",

The tone is analytical rather than critical. | Gemini: The review describes Byrne's performance but doesn't offer a clear overall recommendation for the production. It's more descriptive than evaluative, suggesting a mixed or neutral assessment. | Kimi: The critic praises Byrne's physical performance as successfully embodying the character's miserliness, though the text appears truncated before delivering an overall verdict on the production.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "It's one of many incongruous elements of Eyre's production - including Rob Howell's set design, which features period furniture but a modern, skylit glass-house that sometimes distracts from the proceedings and leaves the staircase off-puttingly upstage and in shadows.
