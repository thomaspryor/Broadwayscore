  "fullText": "April 27, 2016\n Leave a comment\n\n“None of us can help the things life has done to us,” Jessica Lange says as Mary Tyrone. Mary is talking about one of her sons, a drunk, but she herself, a convent girl who married a matinee idol, has become a morphine addict. At the end of the night, she will descend into madness.\nBy then, nearly four hours after the play began, this sixth Broadway production of Eugene O’Neill’s epic drama about his own family has become essentially a play about his mother. This is not likely a deliberate choice by director Jonathan Kent. Rather, it is due to Lange’s superior performance.\n\nFiled under Broadway, DC Theatre Scene, New York Theater, Theater Reviews\n\nAbout New York TheaterJonathan Mandell is a 3rd generation NYC journalist, who sees shows, reads plays, writes reviews and sometimes talks with people.\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
