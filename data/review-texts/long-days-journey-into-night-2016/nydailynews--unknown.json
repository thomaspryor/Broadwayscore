  "fullText": "ExpandGabriel Byrne and Jessica Lange in the troubled marriage at the center of “Long Day’s Journey into Night.” (Joan Marcus/©2016 Joan Marcus)\n\nIn Broadway's star-studded revival of \"Long Day's Journey Into Night,\" the character of James Tyrone is the seasoned stage actor. But his beloved and bedeviled wife, Mary, also puts on a hell of a show. Junkies do that when they're shooting up and want to hide it.\n\nMary's not fooling James or their sons, Jamie and Edmund. She's just wreaking havoc, as she's done for decades. But the politeness fades on an August day in 1912.\n\n\"It's pretty hard to take at times, having a dope fiend for a mother!\" rages Edmund.\n\nBoom! That line, first heard 60 years ago, is as piercing and explosive as ever. More grenades get tossed in this mighty American tragedy. The tormented Tyrones rip through illusions and hurl regrets, recriminations and harsh truths.\n\nFrom left, John Gallagher, Jr. and Michael Shannon in the Roundabout production. (Joan Marcus/©2016 Joan Marcus)\n\nO'Neill is at his most autobiographical in this Tony- and Pulitzer-winning drama. Repetitive and long-winded too. Even a perfectly tuned production can be an endurance test. Performances aren't all equal in Jonathan Kent's nearly four-hour Roundabout staging.\n\nAs the morphine-addicted Mary, Oscar-winner Jessica Lange maximizes her meaty role's potential. Lange is blessed with an expressive voice and uses it like a musical instrument — soft and coquettish, warm and motherly, then barbed and brutal as if dredging words from a bottomless well of despair.\n\nFrom the get-go, her Mary is \"on.\" She walks backward to avoid eye contact with the men in her family. Her final scene, a drug-hazed dive back to her convent days, devastates. And when she's not onstage, Lange is missed.\n\nJessica Lange gives a strong, multifaceted performance. (Joan Marcus/©2016 Joan Marcus)\n\nActors playing the Tyrone men — each in love with the bottle — have varying degrees of success. As the tightwad James, Gabriel Byrne has the presence of a matinee idol. James is quiet, as if exhausted. His love for and bottled-up anger at Mary both come through. As Jamie, a second-rate actor living off his father, Michael Shannon towers physically and gives a sturdy but not particularly memorable performance. Tony winner John Gallagher, Jr., fails to summon much grace or gravity as tubercular wannabe writer Edmund. Colbie Minifie completes the cast as a feisty maid.\n\nIn a smart touch, the set is as off-kilter as the people who live there. The low ceiling looks like it might clamp down at any moment. Just like reality.",
