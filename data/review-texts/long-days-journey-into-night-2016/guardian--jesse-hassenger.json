Photograph: 2016 Joan Marcus This article is more than 9 years oldReviewLong Day’s Journey Into Night review – all-star cast conjure a visceral O'NeillThis article is more than 9 years oldAmerican Airlines Theater, New YorkJessica Lange, Gabriel Byrne and Michael Shannon are all superb as the family tearing one another apart in a dark production of Eugene O’Neill’s finest play\n\nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s, Eugene O’Neill faced his death at last, writing Long Day’s Journey Into Night, his greatest, most intimate play, a loving and bitter cenotaph to his mother, father, and brother.\n\nHaving rechristened the O’Neills as the Tyrones and substituted Edmund, the name of a brother who had died in infancy, for his own, O’Neill set the action on one ghastly summer’s day in 1912, a time when his diagnosis of tuberculosis threatened to collapse his mother back into a heroin addiction and fortify the self-pitying alcoholism of his father, elder brother, and himself.\n\nThese long-dead Tyrones have returned to the stage again, with Jessica Lange as Mary, Gabriel Byrne as her husband James, and Michael Shannon and John Gallagher Jr as their sons, Jamie and Edmund. If Jonathan Kent’s production sometimes suffers from low spirits and the script – with its repeated exclamations, recriminations and long quotations – can sound confoundingly circular, it remains a visceral and poetic evocation of familial tenderness and injury.\n\nThe close of the play has always belonged to Mary, but Lange gets hold of much of the rest of it, too. Her Mary, a part she first played in the West End in 2000, can seem sweet, flighty, frail, but there’s an adamantine spine beneath that softness, one that’s been built on need and hurt. When provoked, she can turn as vicious as any of the men and she knows how to make her words cut more cruelly and deeply.\n\nByrne brings great sympathy to James, a domestic tyrant who can’t help but see himself as a victim, which he is also. The scene in which he describes to Edmund the mistake he made by making a fortune in cheap melodrama rather than pursuing true artistry is deeply affecting.\n\nView image in fullscreenJohn Gallagher Jr and Michael Shannon, the latter of whom is disturbingly convincing as a drunk. Photograph: 2016 Joan MarcusShannon, always a welcome and idiosyncratic stage presence, shows how Jamie’s cynicism and cruel bonhomie barely disguises a raw and aching self-hatred. In a late-night confession to Edmund, he says, “The dead part of me hopes you won’t get well.” Shannon is also disturbingly expert at playing drunk.\n\nGallagher, while an emotionally persuasive and likable actor, hasn’t yet captured the divided self that the rest of the cast portrays so finely. This is partly a consequence of the script, which endows Edmund with weakness rather than the monstrousness the other characters sometimes display, but also owes to a hesitation on Gallagher’s part to give over to the character’s selfishness and cloying weakness.\n\nBut even his performance offers a sense of the drama as both a profoundly realistic work and as one that operates on a symbolic level, as in late-period Ibsen. Perhaps O’Neill felt that he needed this very slight distance, just as Kent feels he needs small adornments, like a diaphanous curtain that wafts across the stage and the distant sounds of the sea.\n\nAs Edmund says, with pain and wonder: “Who wants to see life as it is, if they can help it?” But at its best moments – and there are many – this Long Day’s Journey Into Night shows us life as it is and also the clarity and fog, the darkness and light, that surround it.\n\nAt any point, you can opt out of the sale of all of your personal information by pressing",

The original rating of 80 supports this classification.

Given it's the only excerpt, and the critic gave it an 80, I'm scoring it as a positive review, but with low confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the lead performances using strong evaluative language ('powerhouse', 'gravitas'), aligning with the provided 80 rating in the solid Positive range. Confidence is low due to the single-excerpt warning indicating potential cherry-picking.",
