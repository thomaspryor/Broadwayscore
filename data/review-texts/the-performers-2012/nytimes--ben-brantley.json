Even in a season featuring two works by a king of Anglo-Saxon expletives like David Mamet, this comedy by David West Read may well clock the most obscenities per minute of any play on Broadway. Nonetheless Mr. Read’s perky account of innocents in porn land, centered on a film awards presentation in Las Vegas, feels like a throwback to the more discreetly risqué entertainments of 40 and 50 years ago. Though its author is only 29, “The Performers” is like an early Neil Simon farce with an X-rated vocabulary, or a blue-tongued episode of the smirky but sentimental TV series “Love American Style.”\n\nIn those days middle-class audiences — alarmed and titillated by the loud groans of a sexual counterculture it couldn’t ignore — found reassurance in stage and screen fare that skirted the wild side but wound up nestled down by the family hearth.\n\nThe plots of such diversions often involved cozy, button-down couples who had started to wonder if there was more to life than twin beds and the missionary position. Usually, a clean-cut husband or wife (or both) would get drunk and go a little crazy before concluding, like Dorothy in Oz, that there’s no place like home after all.\n\nThat’s more or less the formula for “The Performers,” which opened on Wednesday night at the Longacre Theater in a production directed by Evan Cabnet. Lee (Daniel Breaker), a journalist, and Sara (Alicia Silverstone), a schoolteacher, are finally going to tie the knot after years of contented togetherness. The rub, though, is that in their entire lives they have had sex only with each other. Could they be missing out on something?\n\nThe answers are waiting in Vegas, where Lee has been dispatched by The New York Post to write a profile on a rising porn star whom he happens to have known in high school. That hunky, dimwitted friend of yore is now going by the name Mandrew, and the good news is that he is played by Cheyenne Jackson, a master of finding goofy charm in salacious innocence.\n\nMore good news! Mandrew’s wife and sometime co-star, Peeps (short for Pussy Boots), is played by Ari Graynor, who turns out to be Mr. Jackson’s ideal comic match. In endowing cartoon characters, whose punch lines are visible long before they land, with something like sincerity and spontaneity, these two work wonders. Unfortunately, with “The Performers,” wonders soon cease.\n\nThe show, which also features Jenni Barber as a starlet called Sundown (for reasons you can infer) and Henry Winkler as a very old hand in the business named Chuck Wood, raises mild hopes in its opening scene. Lee is interviewing Mandrew, who’s assuming he’ll win big at the awards ceremony that night for his performance in a movie whose title — last time I checked with my editors — can only be paraphrased here. (Let’s call it “Planet of the Mammary Glands.”)\n\nThe sight of Mr. Jackson in a suede bikini in a gumdrop-colored hotel room is certainly some demented eye candy. (Anna Louizos is the set designer, and Jessica Wegener Shay must have enjoyed herself creating the costumes.) And when Mandrew starts to talk about using “Where’s Waldo?” as an erotic aid, or enlists Lee to help him act out a scene from his movie, you may think optimistically, “Hey, you’re not really going there, are you?”\n\nThat thought will recur, but less happily, many times during this show’s intermissionless 90 minutes. For it soon becomes clear that “The Performers” is going to the planet of second-tier sitcoms.\n\nThe script is spiced heavily with the punning innuendoes of which porn movies — both their titles and their dialogue — are made, a form of wordplay that remains a schoolboy’s delight. One exchange: “Can we talk in private?” “We can talk about Chuck’s privates!”\n\nThough the humor is partly rooted in our awareness of how puerile such talk is, a little of it goes a long way. So does comedy based on characters’ limited literacy and attention spans, which suggests those blonde jokes that were once the rage, just aimed at porn stars instead.\n\n“The Performers” reaches its heights, which are mostly foothills, when it follows the internal logic of porn-speak to absurdist extremes. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Graynor are best at giving earnest voice (and body) to this logic, though Mr. Winkler is pretty amusing when Chuck accepts an award saying, “You’ve opened your hearts and your legs to me.”\n\nMs. Barber brings a vanilla sweetness to her top-heavy, artificially constructed character. Mr. Breaker and Ms. Silverstone do what they can with the thankless roles of straight man and woman. (To Ms. Silverstone falls the unfortunate task of getting drunk and shaking a tail feather.)\n\nThe show also has a running motif about people wondering what it would be like to switch places with one another, as the mother and daughter do in the movie “Freaky Friday.” But they don’t really need to, because no matter how much skin they choose to show in public, they’re all the same underneath it.",
