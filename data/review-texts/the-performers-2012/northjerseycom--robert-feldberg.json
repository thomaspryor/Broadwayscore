  "bwwExcerpt": "Ever run into an old acquaintance who's way down on his luck? After you realize there's nothing you can do to help, you feel awkward and embarrassed, and just want to slink away. I had a similar emotion at 'The Performers,' which opened Wednesday night at the Longacre Theatre. The play, which is beyond wretched, stars Alicia Silverstone ('Clueless') and Henry Winkler ('Happy Days'), two actors who've earned our affection over the years. To see them slogging through a scuzzy 'comedy' about moronic porn actors, amid a snickering procession of crude sex jokes, was distressing. Is work that hard to find?",
