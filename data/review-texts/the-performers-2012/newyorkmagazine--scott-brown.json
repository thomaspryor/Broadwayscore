  "bwwExcerpt": "Truth be told, nothing feels entirely necessary in The Performers. Why is Mandrew named Mandrew? Straight male porn stars don't have names like \"Mandrew.\" (Jackson has a prime physique more in line with the requirements of gay porn, but Read, beyond one intriguing little feint near the top of the show, doesn't go There, or anywhere near There.) So Mandrew is Mandrew because and only because \"Mandrew\" is funny to say - at least, the first sixteen times. And The Performers is acceptably funny, too",
