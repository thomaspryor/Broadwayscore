  "bwwExcerpt": "\"The revival is disheartening for those who were raised on the original show, which had an elegant and extremely effective simplicity. What \"Les Miz\" really needs is a rest. Too much of even a great musical can be nauseating. This \"Les Miz\" feels less like a revival than a ritual.\"",
