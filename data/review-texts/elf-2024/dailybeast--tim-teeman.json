However, this is only a single excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the show's success in appealing to both kids and adults, and its ability to evoke emotional responses, indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show is enjoyable for both kids and adults, suggesting a positive experience. Given that it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates the show successfully delivers seasonal charm and emotional resonance ('wide smile/slightly moistened eyes') while achieving the 'far more difficult' feat of entertaining both children and adults, representing a clear recommendation. Confidence is low due to availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
