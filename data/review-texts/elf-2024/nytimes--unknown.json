    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('delightfully, entirely right') with praise for the lead performance. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this may not represent the full review's verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production for capturing the essence of the title character with enthusiasm, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"exuberant\" and \"delightfully, entirely right,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the language pushes the score towards the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt features clear praise for the lead performance ('exuberant') and adaptation ('delightfully, entirely right'), indicating a solid positive recommendation despite limited context.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Henson, who was nominated for a Tony Award for his show-stealing turn as Damian in “Mean Girls,” makes Buddy utterly his own: sunny, darling, slightly unsettling. At the mention of tickle fights or snuggling, he emits a small noise that he doesn’t know is sexual, and moppets in the audience won’t either. That joke is aimed at the adults. It’s a tonic of a performance — the kind that makes you smile later, just thinking about it. The trouble is that Buddy is trapped inside “Elf the Musical,” a creaky adaptation whose two-and-a-half-hour length seems designed less to maximize audience enjoyment than to ensure there’s an intermission that people can spend buying merch.",
