However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this may not represent the full review's verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production for capturing the essence of the title character with enthusiasm, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"exuberant\" and \"delightfully, entirely right,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the language pushes the score towards the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt features clear praise for the lead performance ('exuberant') and adaptation ('delightfully, entirely right'), indicating a solid positive recommendation despite limited context.",
