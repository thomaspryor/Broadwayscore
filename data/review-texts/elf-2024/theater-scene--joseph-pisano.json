    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies - this appears to be a qualified, lukewarm endorsement limited to existing fans only, suggesting mixed reception rather than broad recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the show may appeal to fans of the movie but does not provide a strong recommendation for a broader audience. The lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning contribute to the low confidence. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a mild recommendation, likely pleasing fans of the movie. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers a mild, qualified endorsement limited to existing fans of the movie, lacking broader enthusiasm or superlatives. The tepid 'will likely please' suggests adequacy rather than excellence. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
