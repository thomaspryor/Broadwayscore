Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the enthusiasm suggests upper-positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as a 'crowd-pleasing, feel-good delight' with 'genuine showmanship', indicating strong positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses very positive language such as \"crowd-pleasing, feel-good delight\" and \"genuine showmanship\", indicating a strong positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt employs enthusiastic language ('delight', 'genuine showmanship') to praise the production's entertainment value and technical craft, indicating a clear recommendation. However, confidence is reduced due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
