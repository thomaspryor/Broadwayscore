  "bwwExcerpt": "The last time “Elf: The Musical” was on Broadway, during the holiday season a dozen years ago, I saw an autism-friendly performance of it. This turned out to be a great way to view this stage adaptation of the 2003 Will Ferrell movie, since my attention was directed almost entirely to the dexterity and decency with which the cast delighted the sometimes-unpredictable audience. That fond memory began fading before the end of the first song of this new revival, which opens tonight at the Marquis Theater for another holiday run.",
