    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Despite being only one excerpt, this is exceptionally strong praise from a self-described 'jaded critic' describing 'theater magic' and emotional transformation. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt conveys a strong, positive emotional impact, suggesting a transformative experience. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt is strongly positive, using the phrase \"theater magic\" and indicating a transformative experience for the critic. Given the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt conveys unqualified wonder and emotional transcendence, using the metaphor of converting a 'jaded critic' to suggest the show delivers rare theatrical magic. Despite the single-excerpt limitation, the language indicates enthusiastic recommendation.",
