However, the single excerpt and lack of broader context limit confidence. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is strongly positive about a performance, suggesting a positive overall review. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains clearly positive language ('delightfully, entirely right') regarding the lead performance, warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket per scoring guidelines for curated excerpts.",
