    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: 4/5 stars with enthusiastic language ('perfect stocking-stuffer', 'subversively funny delight') indicates strong positive recommendation. Single excerpt warning noted, but tone is clearly celebratory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'subversively funny delight' and 'perfect stocking-stuffer,' indicating a strong recommendation. The original 4/5 stars rating supports a positive classification, and the language suggests enthusiasm. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses very positive language like \"subversively funny delight\" and \"perfect stocking-stuffer,\" indicating a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The 4/5 star rating combined with enthusiastic praise ('subversively funny delight', 'perfect stocking-stuffer') indicates a clear recommendation in the Positive bucket. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this scores in the 80-84 range, though limited context warrants low confidence.",
