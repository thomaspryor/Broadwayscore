Single excerpt limits confidence but tone is clearly enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'subversively funny delight' and 'perfect stocking-stuffer,' indicating a strong positive recommendation. The original 4/5 stars rating supports a score in the upper Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses very positive language like \"subversively funny delight\" and \"perfect stocking-stuffer,\" indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The 4/5 star rating and enthusiastic language ('delight,' 'perfect stocking-stuffer') indicate a strong positive recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about potential caveats elsewhere in the review.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Buddy, the 30-ish human raised as an elf at the North Pole but now thrust into the real world, could be insufferable in the wrong hands. He must burst into every scene full of glee and naive wonderment, yet every bouncing ball must roll to a stop once in a while. Even more than original star Will Ferrell in the film, Grey Henson knows the value of stillness. He can warble and kick up his heels with the best of them, but just as suddenly utter a sincere sentiment to touch the heart. You’re never sure when he’ll dial things up to 11 or simply listen and react, which keeps his performance interesting from start to finish.",
