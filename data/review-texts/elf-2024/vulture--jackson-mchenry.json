  "bwwExcerpt": "If there are occasional glimmers that Elf has more going on than meets the eye, this production has done its best to convince you to grow up and stop believing in anything less than cold commercial logic. The show ends with its own flight of the DeLorean, this time with Santa’s sleigh and a ton of foam snow shot directly toward your seats. If it achieves a sense of spectacle, it’s only by way of brute force. I had to wipe a lot of crud off my glasses frames.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests some positive elements ('occasional glimmers') but lacks a strong recommendation. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence in determining the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt is mildly positive, suggesting there are some redeeming qualities to the show. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers faint praise ('occasional glimmers') suggesting mild recommendation at best; low confidence due to excerpt-only format.",
