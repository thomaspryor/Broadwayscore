Helmer Akin Omotoso is a stylist of considerable flair, but the pic’s storytelling is too obscure and indulgent to catch on in foreign markets, despite an attractive a cast and moments of brilliance.\n\nThe tale is essentially a missing person’s story about estranged Nigerian brothers: Ade (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a London-based banker, and Femi (Fabian Adeoye Lojede), a political radical who’s been imprisoned, tortured, run out of his home country, and is last seen living the street life in Johannesburg. When Femi goes missing, Ade tries to find him, and the search — as elliptical and blind-alleyed as anything by Bunuel — provides the bulk of the storyline. Ultimately, “Man on Ground” is a mismatch of content and directorial panache: Omotoso is inclined to long, lingering takes and slo-mo action, which only punctuates the point that so little is going on. The film’s brightest spot is Thisiwe Ziqubu, who plays Femi’s fiancee, Zodwa, and is a talent to watch.",
