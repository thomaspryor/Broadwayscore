  "bwwExcerpt": "No one could expect director Eric Schaeffer, a veteran of several Sondheim shows, to fix inherent issues - a momentumless narrative and soapy dialogue. But more originality in his approach, conceptually and design-wise (black drapes - really?), could have helped make a standard-issue show a truly distinctive one.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic identifies 'inherent issues' including 'momentumless narrative and soapy dialogue' and calls it a 'standard-issue show' that lacks distinction. While acknowledging the director's pedigree, the overall assessment is clearly negative with specific criticisms of execution. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the lack of originality and the failure to address inherent issues, suggesting a negative view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the show's inherent issues and the director's inability to fix them, suggesting a negative overall assessment. The mention of lack of originality further reinforces this. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the show's 'momentumless narrative' and 'soapy dialogue' while faulting the direction for lacking originality, ultimately dismissing it as 'standard-issue' rather than distinctive. With only one curated excerpt available, confidence is reduced.",
