The phrase 'succeeds in spite of itself' suggests qualified approval but not a clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review describes the production as 'uneven' but acknowledges the score as 'magnificent', indicating a mixed assessment overall. | Gemini: The review explicitly calls the production a \"mixed blessing\" and notes its unevenness, placing it squarely in the Mixed bucket. The score reflects the balance of positive (magnificent score) and negative (uneven production) elements. | Kimi: The critic explicitly labels the show a 'mixed blessing' and calls the production 'uneven,' though acknowledges it ultimately succeeds and praises the score as 'magnificent.' The brief text indicates significant reservations alongside qualified success.",
