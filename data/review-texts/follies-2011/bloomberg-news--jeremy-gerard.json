  "bwwExcerpt": "Broadway’s sterile Marquis Theatre has never looked so good as in the state of faux decrepitude that welcomes us to the latest, and finest, revival of Stephen Sondheim's Follies...Near the end [of 'Loveland'] Raines, through a brilliant trick, snaps Ben and us back into the reality of 1971. We’re still feeling the jolt as the curtain falls and Technicolor nostalgia recedes into grim reality.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Critic calls this the 'finest revival' and praises the production design and performances, but single excerpt warning applies - may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as the 'finest' revival, indicating strong enthusiasm. However, since only one excerpt is available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the phrase \"finest revival\" which indicates a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a high score within the positive bucket. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
