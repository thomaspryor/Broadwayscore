  "bwwExcerpt": "Eric Schaeffer’s lavish production, which features a 41-member cast and a 28-piece orchestra, originated at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. It has improved since then...Peters fully captures Sally’s sweet and innocent center. Burstein violently throws himself into the role of Buddy, bringing the character’s pent-up anger to manic heights. Maxwell, who is better known as a dramatic actress, proves that she can handle a tough musical role. Raines credibly portrays Ben’s downward spiral from cocky self-denial into helplessness.",
