  "bwwExcerpt": "Schaeffer, whose early directing talent on road shows like 'Big' has matured into something quite formidable, has achieved a great deal here. Not the least is the way the younger selves of the former showgirls are integrated into the action, often with the help of choreographer Warren Carlyle. Without the device ever seeming crass or manipulative, these sepia-toned lovelies of the pre-war years alternately flare up with the force of nostalgia and resilience - and, as the ever-intriguing Elaine Paige reminds us, 'Follies' is about still being here just as much as wondering what happened - then recede whenever loss and regret overwhelms. It is a very poignant visual treatment and it gives way to a gorgeous second-act 'Loveland' sequence (designer Derek McLane fills the stage with a plush look that suggests both a womb and a fatal web). The sequence is as caustic as it is beautiful.",
