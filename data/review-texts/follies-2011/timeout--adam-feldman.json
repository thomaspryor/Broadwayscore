However, single excerpt limits confidence in full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt strongly recommends the show as a must-see for adults, highlighting its enduring impact and beauty. The language used is enthusiastic and suggests a high level of praise. | Gemini: The critic states that no grown-up should miss the show and calls it gorgeous, indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unambiguously enthusiastic language ('no grown-up should miss', 'gorgeous') indicating a rave recommendation, though confidence is reduced due to the single-excerpt format.",
