  "bwwExcerpt": "For Broadway, director Walter Bobbie milks the script more; the action clocks in about ten minutes longer than it did at CSC. Although easing up on the accelerator gives us more time to savor the sensual-slapstick dance between Dancy and Arianda, it also means the climactic 20 minutes-as gender roles and power positions sharply flip-grow a tad overindulgently logy. Undaunted, Arianda maintains terrific tension at all times-as well as full comic release.",
