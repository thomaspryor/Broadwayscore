  "bwwExcerpt": "Arianda was subsequently propelled onto Broadway last season playing the part that made Judy Holiday famous, the dumb blonde of \"Born Yesterday.\" Reaction was mixed to that revival, but not to her performance. She has since had small roles in \"The Good Wife\" on TV and Woody Allen's movie \"Midnight in Paris,\" and now, at 27, Arianda is back in \"Venus in Fur,\" this time on Broadway. She is just as good as she was. Her co-star Hugh Dancy is better than the actor",
