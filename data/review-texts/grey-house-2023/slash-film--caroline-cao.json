As of now, it's difficult to forecast how ‘The Grey House’ may influence the untapped horror potential on Broadway-sized stages. Somewhere, there are unproduced possibilities waiting in the cobwebbed drawers.”\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning requires caution about incomplete verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show is not particularly impressive but has redeeming qualities in its atmosphere and cast. The overall tone is mixed, with no strong recommendation or discouragement. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a mixed assessment, acknowledging the atmosphere and cast but noting it might not impress as a live experience. The concluding sentence expresses uncertainty about its influence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers faint praise noting the show 'sustains itself' through cast and atmosphere but explicitly states it 'might not impress,' suggesting a lukewarm assessment that neither recommends nor discourages attendance. Single excerpt warning limits confidence.",
