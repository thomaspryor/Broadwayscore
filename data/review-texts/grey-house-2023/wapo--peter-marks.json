  "bwwExcerpt": "But apart from Laurie Metcalf’s enjoyable portrayal of an inscrutable mountain woman, and a set by Scott Pask out of the Grimms’ grimmest fairy tale, the play itself exists in a sort of gray zone — neither particularly terrifying nor profound. It belongs in that lesser rank of thrillers that whip up suspense by withholding vital information, the kind that requires gullible characters to take the bait and audiences to wait for clarification before the final bows.",

    "reasoning": "Claude: The critic clearly places this in a 'lesser rank' of thrillers with fundamental structural problems, despite praising individual elements like Metcalf's performance and the set design. | GPT-4o-mini: The review highlights a lack of depth and suspense in the play, with only the performance of Laurie Metcalf receiving positive mention, leading to a clear negative recommendation overall.",
