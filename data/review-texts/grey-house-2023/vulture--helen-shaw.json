(The production sent over a PDF explaining the lore to critics after they attended, which may be a sign that things aren’t entirely clear in the performance.)

The single excerpt and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges effective moments but criticizes the metaphors and characters, indicating a mixed reaction. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges 'genuinely effective scary moments' but emphasizes structural problems (muddled metaphors, thin characters) that prevent sustained dread, suggesting a mixed reception that neither recommends nor discourages attendance.",
