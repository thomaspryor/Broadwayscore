The phrase 'The devil’s in the details' suggests some level of critique, but without more context, the recommendation is unclear. | Gemini: The review uses the phrase \"The devil's in the details\" which is a negative assessment of the play. The review is therefore classified as negative.",

  "dtliExcerpt": "At times, the psychological slow burn of his new dark comedy moves at a snail’s pace — lethargizing the play’s momentum and stretching entire scenes beyond comprehension — but “Grey House” cracks open in its final moments. And by its end, the play accomplishes what only the best of its genre is able to: It reminds us that the scariest monster of all lives in mankind.",
