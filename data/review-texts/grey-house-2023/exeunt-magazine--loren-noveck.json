    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic expresses enjoyment during the show but immediate dissipation afterward, suggesting a mixed experience that doesn't linger positively. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates enjoyment during the viewing experience but suggests the impact was fleeting. This suggests a mixed review with some positive elements but lacking lasting impression. | Gemini: The reviewer enjoyed the show while watching it, but it didn't leave a lasting impression. This suggests a mixed or lukewarm reaction. | Kimi: While the critic explicitly enjoyed the experience in the moment, the observation that the show's impact immediately dissipated suggests it lacks lasting power or depth. For a psychological thriller, this forgettability is a significant qualification that prevents a clear recommendation.",
