    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for the craft and effectiveness of the production, calling it 'genuinely scary' and praising the use of space. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'genuinely scary' and highlights effective use of the theater space, indicating a positive recommendation. The single excerpt warning suggests using the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses positive language such as \"genuinely scary\" and \"effective use\" to describe the play, suggesting a positive recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, I'm placing it on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the play's scariness and technical execution, with 'genuinely scary' and 'effective use' indicating a clear recommendation, though without the superlatives that would suggest a rave.",
