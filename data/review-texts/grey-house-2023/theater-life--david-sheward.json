    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt criticizes structural problems and suggests audience confusion, with the short runtime being the only mercy mentioned. However, this is only one excerpt and may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights significant issues with the show, mentioning 'numerous loose, unexplained ends' and a tone of relief that it is short, suggesting a negative view. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt points out flaws in the show's plot and suggests it is not a positive experience, though the short runtime is a minor saving grace. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production for 'numerous loose, unexplained ends' and explicitly describes the audience experience as 'suffering,' with relief that the runtime is brief. This indicates a negative recommendation, though confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation.",
