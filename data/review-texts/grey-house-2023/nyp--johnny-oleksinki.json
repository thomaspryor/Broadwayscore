  "bwwExcerpt": "However, director Joe Mantello’s production of “Grey House” only offers a few audio-based jump-scares and a vaguely spooky atmosphere. The tension is swallowed whole even by a house as intimate as the Lyceum, and shudders from the audience are rare. Once we’ve become accustomed to the occasional burst of unexpected noise, the play settles for being merely unsettling.",
