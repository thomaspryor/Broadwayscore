  "dtliExcerpt": "While the eerie beginning may draw inspiration from tried-and-true horror tropes, Grey House, which recently opened at the Lyceum Theatre on Broadway, succeeds in subverting both the genre and audience expectations by weaving together a haunting story of horror and heart. Unfortunately, Holloway's puzzle-box mystery doesn't give viewers all the clues they need to fully comprehend the tragic tale it's trying to tell.",
