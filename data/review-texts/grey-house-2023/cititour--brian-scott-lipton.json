  "fullText": "Review: Grey House is Both Dark and Dull June 1, 2023, 8:05.35 pm ET “I know this movie,” remarks the bloodied-up Henry (the ever-fascinating Paul Sparks) to his frantic wife Max (Claire Karpen, more-than-ably filling in for an ailing Tatiana Maslany) as they enter the somewhat creepy mountain cabin that provides the setting for Levi Holloway’s dark yet dull play “Grey House,” now at the Lyceum Theatre. Henry and Max ended up there after she hit a deer during a massive snowstorm, wrecking their car. And since he has a broken ankle, the phone in the cabin doesn’t work, and the snow won’t stop. Grey House becomes their temporary home. Or is it their last one? Continue reading... Cititour.com is your guide to interesting places throughout New York City.

  "bwwExcerpt": "As always, director Joe Mantello has gotten uniformly superb performances from everyone on stage; the cast gets a gold star for their commitment to this uneven material. On the downside, Mantello could pick up the pacing a little, the play often seems to be limping (just like Henry) to its conclusion as we impatiently wait for all to be revealed.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic praises the performances but calls the play 'dark yet dull' and criticizes pacing issues and confusing plot resolution. The BWW excerpt confirms negative assessment with 'uneven material' and structural problems. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges superb performances but criticizes the pacing and clarity of the play. The truncated text and mixed aggregator context suggest a mixed review with notable strengths and weaknesses. | Gemini: The review calls the play \"dark yet dull\" and \"uneven material,\" but praises the performances and direction. The truncated nature and mixed signals lead to a lower confidence score. | Kimi: While the critic praises the cast's 'superb performances' and commitment, they describe the play as 'dull' and 'uneven' with 'limping' pacing and a confusing, unsatisfying ending. The truncated text warrants low confidence, but the negative assessment is consistent throughout. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
