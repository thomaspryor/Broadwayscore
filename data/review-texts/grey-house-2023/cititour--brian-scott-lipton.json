  "fullText": "Review: Grey House is Both Dark and Dull June 1, 2023, 8:05.35 pm ET “I know this movie,” remarks the bloodied-up Henry (the ever-fascinating Paul Sparks) to his frantic wife Max (Claire Karpen, more-than-ably filling in for an ailing Tatiana Maslany) as they enter the somewhat creepy mountain cabin that provides the setting for Levi Holloway’s dark yet dull play “Grey House,” now at the Lyceum Theatre.
