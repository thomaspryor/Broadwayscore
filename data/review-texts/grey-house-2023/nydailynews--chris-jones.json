  "dtliExcerpt": "I’m not sure those are the right initial expectations to raise, just as I am not convinced everyone around me at the matinee I saw understood what was going on, not least because Holloway wrote a much stranger play than anything typical of this genre and he refuses to pander. Good for him, and for Mantello for backing this young writer all the way, but I bet there will be plenty of question marks on the audience feedback surveys.",

The 'good for him' suggests artistic respect but predicting audience confusion indicates mixed overall assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a mixed reaction, highlighting the play's unconventional nature and potential audience confusion. While there is praise for the writer's boldness, the overall impression suggests a lack of clarity and potential audience disconnect. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the play is unconventional and may not appeal to everyone, indicating a mixed reception. The critic acknowledges the writer's choices but anticipates audience confusion. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the playwright's refusal to pander and the director's commitment to the young writer, indicating respect for the artistic vision, despite acknowledging the play's strangeness may confuse audiences. With only one excerpt available, this falls in the lower Positive range.",
