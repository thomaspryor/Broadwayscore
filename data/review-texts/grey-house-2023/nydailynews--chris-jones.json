  "dtliExcerpt": "I’m not sure those are the right initial expectations to raise, just as I am not convinced everyone around me at the matinee I saw understood what was going on, not least because Holloway wrote a much stranger play than anything typical of this genre and he refuses to pander. Good for him, and for Mantello for backing this young writer all the way, but I bet there will be plenty of question marks on the audience feedback surveys.",

With only one excerpt available and an 'Up' aggregator verdict, this suggests a conflicted review that neither fully recommends nor discourages. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the unconventional nature of the play and suggests that it may not be easily understood by all audiences, but also praises the writer and director for their bold choices. This indicates a mixed reception with appreciation for certain aspects. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses uncertainty and suggests the play might not resonate with everyone. While praising the writer and director's commitment, it also anticipates audience confusion, indicating a mixed reception.",
