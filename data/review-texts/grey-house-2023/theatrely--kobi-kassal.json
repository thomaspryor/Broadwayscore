    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt describes a 'deliberate clash' that 'sometimes works' - neutral language suggesting mixed results. However, excerpt appears cut off mid-sentence and may not capture full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed reception, noting that the clash between staging and humor 'sometimes works'. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning suggests caution in interpretation, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a mixed reaction to the staging and humor, suggesting neither a strong recommendation nor a strong discouragement. The limited text makes it difficult to assess the overall verdict with high confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise that the directorial clash between horror and humor 'sometimes works,' implying inconsistent success. As a single curated excerpt with truncated text, the overall verdict is ambiguous, but the tone suggests neither strong recommendation nor rejection.",
