Single excerpt warning applies - this appears representative of a mixed verdict that leans slightly negative. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the production's success in stagecraft but criticizes its overall impact as a theatrical work, indicating a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review praises the stagecraft but ultimately finds the show unsatisfying and lacking depth, indicating a mixed reaction. | Kimi: While praising the technical design and stagecraft as 'wonders,' the critic explicitly states the show 'falls short' and is not a 'satisfying work of theater,' indicating a negative recommendation.",
