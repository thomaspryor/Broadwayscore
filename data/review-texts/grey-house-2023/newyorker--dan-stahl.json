  "fullText": "A married couple, wandering through the woods after getting in a car accident, come across a cabin. Nobody answers the door, so they let themselves in. “I’ve seen this movie,” the husband says, surveying the cluttered interior. “We don’t make it.” He has the right idea, but in this case it’s a play: Levi Holloway’s “Grey House,” as smart as it is scary. The cabin turns out to be inhabited by the foulmouthed Raleigh (an unnervingly crotchety Laurie Metcalf), plus four oddball girls and a silent boy who might be her children. There’s also a basement door that keeps opening by itself (the creepy, creaky set is by Scott Pask) and a fridge filled with “the nectar of dead men,” if you believe the girls. They’re frighteningly convincing, as are most of the ghoulish effects and all the performers. Joe Mantello directs one hell of a show.(Lyceum; through Sept. 3.)",

Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly positive verdict. | Gemini: The excerpt is highly positive, praising the performers, effects, and direction. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I've scored it at the higher end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt contains enthusiastic praise ('one hell of a show,' 'frighteningly convincing') indicating a clear recommendation, though the single-quote limitation necessitates a high-positive score rather than a rave.",
