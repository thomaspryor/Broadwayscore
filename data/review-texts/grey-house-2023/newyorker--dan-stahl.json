  "fullText": "Skip to main contentA married couple, wandering through the woods after getting in a car accident, come across a cabin. Nobody answers the door, so they let themselves in. “I’ve seen this movie,” the husband says, surveying the cluttered interior. “We don’t make it.” He has the right idea, but in this case it’s a play: Levi Holloway’s “Grey House,” as smart as it is scary. The cabin turns out to be inhabited by the foulmouthed Raleigh (an unnervingly crotchety Laurie Metcalf), plus four oddball girls and a silent boy who might be her children. There’s also a basement door that keeps opening by itself (the creepy, creaky set is by Scott Pask) and a fridge filled with “the nectar of dead men,” if you believe the girls. They’re frighteningly convincing, as are most of the ghoulish effects and all the performers. Joe Mantello directs one hell of a show.(Lyceum; through Sept. 3.)",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The quote uses strong positive language such as \"frighteningly convincing\" and \"one hell of a show\", suggesting a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I've scored it towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
