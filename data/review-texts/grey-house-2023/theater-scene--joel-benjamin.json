  "showScoreExcerpt": "Eerie and irritating in equal measure, Levi Holloway’s \"Grey House\" at the Lyceum Theatre dredges up the classic plot device of many horror films: strangers stumbling into a den of oddballs and suffering the consequences. The couple that does, indeed, invade the eponymous domicile, Max and Henry (Claire Karpen – subbing for Tatiana Maslany - and Paul Sparks, both excellent) actually refer to this conceit and even joke that the results are always bad. \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt describes the show as 'eerie and irritating in equal measure' and mentions the plot is a tired horror trope, but praises the lead performances as 'excellent.' With only one curated excerpt available and text cutting off mid-sentence, confidence is low about the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'eerie and irritating in equal measure' and highlights a familiar plot device, suggesting a mixed reception. The performances are praised, but the overall tone is ambivalent. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the play as \"eerie and irritating\" and mentions a classic horror plot device. This suggests a mixed reaction, neither strongly positive nor negative, but more of an observation. | Kimi: The excerpt presents conflicting signals: the atmosphere is praised as 'eerie' while the experience is deemed 'irritating,' and the plot is described as a dredged-up cliché despite excellent performances from the leads. With only one excerpt available, this appears to be a genuinely mixed assessment.",
