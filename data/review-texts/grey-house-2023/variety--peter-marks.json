With only one curated quote available, this appears mildly positive with clear reservations, placing it at the lower end of the Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's ability to create a chilling atmosphere but notes narrative issues. The positive elements are emphasized, suggesting a recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review excerpt is generally positive, describing the show as a \"haunting, atmospheric thriller\" that creates \"genuine chills.\" However, it also notes that the narrative \"occasionally loses its way,\" indicating a reservation. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the production's atmospheric effectiveness and ability to create 'genuine chills' while acknowledging narrative weaknesses, indicating a positive but qualified recommendation. Confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation.",
