    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt suggests the show has merit but only under specific conditions ('works best when'), implying inconsistent execution. Without more context, this reads as qualified praise rather than clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, highlighting that the show is most effective when it embraces campiness, implying it may not always succeed. The lack of a clear recommendation or discouragement places it in the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review suggests the show is enjoyable when it embraces its campiness, implying that it is not always successful. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as a slightly positive review with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a qualified endorsement, noting the show works well under specific conditions (embracing camp), suggesting mild approval with caveats rather than unreserved enthusiasm. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
