    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt suggests the show has charming moments but ultimately lacks substance or impact, indicating a lukewarm assessment. However, with only curated excerpts available, the full verdict may be more positive or negative. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the show has a 'teasing quality' and should not be taken too seriously, indicating a mixed impression. The lack of strong positive or negative language points to a middle-ground assessment. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the show has some redeeming qualities (\"charming\") but ultimately shouldn't be taken too seriously, indicating a mixed reaction rather than a positive or negative one. The lack of a clear recommendation pushes it towards the middle of the spectrum.",
