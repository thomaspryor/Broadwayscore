  "fullText": "On the plane after dropping her children off to her ex, the lyrics would pour out of Kelly Clarkson.\n\n\"To be just frank,\" the star says, \"there would be times I’d fly my kids to my ex and then I’d have to fly back and then wake back up hours later for work again. And I was exhausted physically, mentally, emotionally. On those flights back when I’m by myself, those were the really hard moments. And that’s when a lot of the songs were written because there’s so much that was going on and I was processing so much. Honestly, a lot of the songs were written in those moments on the way back.\"",
