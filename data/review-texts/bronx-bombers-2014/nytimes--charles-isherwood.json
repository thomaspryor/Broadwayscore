  "bwwExcerpt": "Strange though it may sound, this pinstriped pantheon sits down to dine together in a dream sequence from 'Bronx Bombers,' an affectionate celebration of Yankee greatness (with a smidgen of Yankee angst) written and directed by Eric Simonson...The drama inherent in clashing egos gives 'Bronx Bombers' some natural juice in the early innings, but the suspense about whether Martin will be axed - and Berra will agree to replace him - more or less gets benched in the play's second act.",
