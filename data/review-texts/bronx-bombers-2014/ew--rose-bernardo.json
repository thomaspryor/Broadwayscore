    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Text critiques a declining trajectory in the playwright's work and questions the manufactured plot, but excerpt cuts off mid-sentence. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears negative but confidence is low due to incomplete text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the dilution of Simonson's work and the far-fetched nature of the stories, indicating a negative view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses disappointment, stating that the story is far-fetched and the plot is manufactured. Given the negative tone and the warning about truncated text, I've assigned a negative score with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the playwright's declining quality with 'diluted' efforts and 'far-fetched' stories, specifically attacking the 'manufactured plot' with no redeeming qualities mentioned.",
