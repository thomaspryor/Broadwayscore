    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Pan | Claude: Clear escalating negative progression: mediocre → bad → worse. The dismissive closing line shows contempt for the entire enterprise. Single excerpt limits confidence, but tone is unambiguously pan-level negative. | GPT-4o: The excerpt compares 'Bronx Bombers' unfavorably to other mediocre and bad sports-themed shows, suggesting it is even worse. The sarcastic tone and dismissive 'wake me when' line indicate a strong negative verdict. | Gemini: The critic clearly pans the show, calling it 'worse' than a previous 'bad' show. The tone is dismissive and negative. | Kimi: The critic establishes a downward progression from mediocre to bad to worse, explicitly calling the show inferior to previous failed sports-themed plays and using sarcasm ('Wake me when they get to horseshoes') to dismiss it as worthless.",
