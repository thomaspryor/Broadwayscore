  "bwwExcerpt": "Devout Yankee fans may get misty at the sight of the beloved Iron Horse, bedeviled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, meeting today's Mr. Nice Guy Derek Jeter. But the scene is more sugary than the Cracker Jack served in the upper deck. And manipulative music seemingly recruited from 'The Natural' seeks to tug heartstrings. When all is said and done, 'Bronx Bombers' is too feel-good and fawning for its own good.",
