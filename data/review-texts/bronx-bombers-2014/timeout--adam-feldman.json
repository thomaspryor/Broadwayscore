  "bwwExcerpt": "If penning sports plays were a competition, Eric Simonson would be MVP. He's found drama in football coaching (Lombardi), basketball rivalry (Magic/Bird) and now, with Bronx Bombers, the national pastime. None of these qualify as great works, but for some theatergoers, they offer tantalizing glimpses into exotic subcultures...Bronx Bombers touches on high points of 20th-century Yankee history, although it hasn't been so much plotted as researched and pitched to guys who get a lump in the throat from seeing Lou Gehrig shake hands with Derek Jeter...Simonson, who directs his own script too laxly, touches on predictable tensions between individual excellence versus team spirit, but in terms of ideas or visual flair, there are no curves here.",

The review describes the play as a 'missed opportunity' and lacking 'dramatic tension', indicating a clear lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the play lacks dramatic tension and is not compelling, indicating a negative assessment. The critic's rating of 40 aligns with the negative bucket. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 40/100 places this in the Negative bucket, and the review describes the show as a 'missed opportunity' that fails to be compelling theater.",
