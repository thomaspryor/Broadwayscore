  "bwwExcerpt": "The tender-hearted, super- sappy New York Yankees tribute 'Bronx Bombers,' which just transferred to Broadway's Circle in the Square after a short Off-Broadway run, really ought to be playing in Cooperstown as a sort of side show for tourists visiting the Baseball Hall of Fame. It could be done with animatronics instead of actors, a la 'The Hall of Presidents' at Disney World...Watching actors portray legendary Yankees with distinctive personalities will no doubt be a guilty pleasure for many fans. But all things considered, they deserve something better than this unchallenging and uninteresting history pageant.",
