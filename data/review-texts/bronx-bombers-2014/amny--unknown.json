  "bwwExcerpt": "The tender-hearted, super- sappy New York Yankees tribute 'Bronx Bombers,' which just transferred to Broadway's Circle in the Square after a short Off-Broadway run, really ought to be playing in Cooperstown as a sort of side show for tourists visiting the Baseball Hall of Fame. It could be done with animatronics instead of actors, a la 'The Hall of Presidents' at Disney World...Watching actors portray legendary Yankees with distinctive personalities will no doubt be a guilty pleasure for many fans. But all things considered, they deserve something better than this unchallenging and uninteresting history pageant.",

Despite acknowledging it might be a 'guilty pleasure,' the overall verdict is clearly negative. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show as 'unchallenging and uninteresting,' suggesting it is not worth seeing despite some appeal for fans. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The review expresses disappointment, calling the show \"unchallenging and uninteresting\" and suggesting it belongs in a museum rather than on Broadway. While acknowledging some potential pleasure for fans, the overall tone is negative. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the show as a sappy, uninteresting tourist attraction better suited for animatronics than actors, explicitly stating audiences deserve better despite acknowledging it may appeal to Yankees fans as a guilty pleasure.",
