  "bwwExcerpt": "Scolari plays Yogi with obvious affection for a legend bent with age but unbowed in team loyalty, a man panicked at the sense of the team ever splitting apart. There is plenty of inside-baseball inside-stuff, explained with relative grace. And for those of us who don't much care, designer David C. Woolard amuses us with the changing styles of the uniforms.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows appreciation for lead performance and production design, but limited positive language and acknowledgment that non-baseball fans need accommodation suggests qualified recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights positive aspects such as the affectionate portrayal by Scolari and the amusing design elements, suggesting a generally positive view but with mild enthusiasm. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning necessitates a cautious, lower-end positive score. | Gemini: The review excerpt is mildly positive, praising the actor's portrayal and the designer's work. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the performance ('obvious affection'), writing ('relative grace'), and design ('amuses us'), suggesting a gentle, tempered recommendation without enthusiastic endorsement or criticism.",
