    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic dismisses the play as not functioning as theater, suggesting it fails in its basic purpose as a theatrical work. The 'accidentally wandered onto a stage' phrasing indicates it doesn't belong in the theater. | GPT-4o: The review suggests the play lacks theatrical substance, implying it is not worth seeing as a theater production. The tone is dismissive, indicating a negative assessment. | Gemini: The review clearly states that the play feels more like a love letter than a work for the theater, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the play as lacking theatrical merit, suggesting it functions as a misplaced tribute rather than legitimate theater. With only one sentence available, the verdict appears negative but the full context may be truncated.",
