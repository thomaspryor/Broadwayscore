  "bwwExcerpt": "Sharpened, but still dubiously crafted, 'Bronx Bombers' is a jock drama that will appeal to any Yankees fanatic, but leave others restless in the bleachers...But most important, the script has been tightened, lending needed clarity to its simple message: The Yankees organization has churned with personal drama since before the days of intrusive media and free agency, but ultimately, the team will thrive and the fans will maintain their bond...There are colorful performances from the committed ensemble, many doing double duty...'Damn Yankees' this is not, but it may keep sports fans distracted until spring training.",
