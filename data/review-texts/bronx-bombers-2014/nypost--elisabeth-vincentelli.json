  "bwwExcerpt": "The point seems to be that Yankee greatness bridges generations, and that petty rivalries should be snuffed out for the organization's greater good. What's more amazing than dead players chatting over hors d'oeuvres is that a show about a team with such a backlog of personalities, controversies and scandals could be so dull. No George Steinbrenner, no Red Sox, no juicing - no drama. At this point, you have to wonder what's next for Simonson. A play about hockey in which the Care Bear players hug?",

While the excerpt is too brief to determine if this is a full pan, the available text offers an unambiguous negative verdict with no redeeming qualities mentioned.",
