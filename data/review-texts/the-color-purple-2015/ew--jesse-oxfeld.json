  "bwwExcerpt": "In the British director John Doyle's emotionally rich and visually striking new production of The Color Purple...there is an elegant staging and three gorgeous star performances...Jennifer Hudson makes her Broadway debut here, and it only reconfirms that she's a star...Danielle Brooks...is Sofia, the rare woman in this world willing to stand up to her husband...she turns out to be a gifted stage actress. She's funny, sensitive, and compulsively charismatic...Erivo...plays Celie, who is diminished and defeated through much of the story but finally finds her strength. Erivo's portrayal of that transformation is remarkable. A quiet, subdued performance slowly gathers conviction, and when finally Celie asserts herself with her climatic anthem of self-possession, 'I'm Here,' its power is astonishing.",
