  "bwwExcerpt": "The famous name attached to the revival of the musical version of Alice Walker's 'The Color Purple' is Jennifer Hudson...She is, as might be predicted, not a very commanding stage actress, but her full-bodied singing nonetheless lends power and tenderness...Yet Hudson is not the performer you'll leave this show talking about. This 'Color Purple' instead belongs to the virtually unknown British actress Cynthia Erivo, who as Celie gives one of those galvanizing, star-is-born performances of which Broadway dreams are made. She beautifully captures Celie's 40-year progression, from abused and meek daughter and wife to confident single woman and mother; and she turns musical numbers that might easily be overly cutesy ('Miss Celie's Pants') or schmaltzy ('I'm Here') into punch-in-the-gut anthems of self-discovery. LaChanze won the Tony for originating this role -- Erivo may just make it two-for-two.",
