  "bwwExcerpt": "Cynthia Erivo is an absolute marvel in the lead role of Celie, playing her at first with defeated deference, then indignation and then righteous might. Her voice lifts the roof off the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre. There are times you forget Jennifer Hudson also is onstage...Doyle's pacing in the first act is so swift that there's little time to breathe as misery seems to visit Celie without release...Things loosen up in a more airy second act...Hudson as the hedonistic Shug Avery rushes her lines a tad but no one will care when she opens her mouth to deliver the title song...There is purity and astounding horse power in her voice. Danielle Brooks...makes a strong Sofia, one whose spirit of mirth never gets lost.",
