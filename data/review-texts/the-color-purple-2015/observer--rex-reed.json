    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Clear positive assessment calling the revival 'vastly improved' and 'emotionally devastating' in a positive sense, but limited text makes full evaluation difficult. | GPT-4o: The review praises the revival as 'vastly improved' and 'emotionally devastating', indicating a strong recommendation. The lack of additional context or reservations suggests a high score within the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the revival is \"vastly improved\" and \"emotionally devastating,\" indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives ('vastly improved', 'emotionally devastating') indicating strong enthusiasm for this revival, though the excerpt's brevity warrants lower confidence. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
