  "bwwExcerpt": "We applaud Producing Artistic Director, Mark S. Hoebee for gifting metropolitan area audiences with the best in Modern American Theatre. Even if you have seen a rendition of The Color Purple Before, Paper Mill Playhouse's outstanding production is one that shouldn't be missed. It's a good time in our society to recognize the strength of women and their ability to rise above even the most painful difficulties. Because of the show's themes, it is suggested for mature audiences.",
