    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Uses strong positive language like 'gorgeous,' 'life-affirming,' and 'triumph.' The 80/100 rating confirms this is solidly in Rave territory, warranting a score in the upper 80s range. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language like 'gorgeous', 'life-affirming', and 'triumph', indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. The critic's original rating of 80 supports a high score within the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"gorgeous\" and \"life-affirming\" and calls the production a \"triumph.\" Given the critic's rating of 80, this is a strong positive review. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 80 places the review squarely in the Positive bucket (70-84). While the excerpt contains enthusiastic language ('triumph', 'gorgeous'), the extreme brevity of the text warrants low confidence. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
