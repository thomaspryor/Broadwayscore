  "bwwExcerpt": "My heart has suddenly grown fonder for 'The Color Purple'...The shift from 'Who cares?' to 'Holy mackerel!' is partly due to a canny staging that squarely puts the focus on the rich score by Brenda Russell, Allee Willis and Stephen Bray. And my renewed excitement also comes from pitch-perfect casting of an unknown and an Academy Award winner in lead roles -- an eloquent echo of the central dynamic of Alice Walker's novel, adapted by playwright Marsha Norman. Cynthia Erivo, a Brit who's unknown in New York, is spectacular as the beleaguered Celie, who loses her innocence, self-esteem and all else thanks to men in her life...she sings with such clear, honest openness that you feel everything she's feeling -- and she feels a lot.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Uses strong positive language like 'gorgeous,' 'life-affirming,' and 'triumph.' The 80/100 rating confirms this is solidly in Rave territory, warranting a score in the upper 80s range. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language like 'gorgeous', 'life-affirming', and 'triumph', indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. The critic's original rating of 80 supports a high score within the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"gorgeous\" and \"life-affirming\" and calls the production a \"triumph.\" Given the critic's rating of 80, this is a strong positive review. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 80 places the review squarely in the Positive bucket (70-84). While the excerpt contains enthusiastic language ('triumph', 'gorgeous'), the extreme brevity of the text warrants low confidence. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
