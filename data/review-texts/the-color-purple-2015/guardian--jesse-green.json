Photograph: Matthew Murphy This article is more than 10 years oldReviewThe Color Purple review – Jennifer Hudson and Cynthia Erivo star in stripped-down musicalThis article is more than 10 years oldBernard B Jacobs theater, New YorkJohn Doyle’s streamlined version of Alice Walker’s novel features fine performances from a vocally confident Hudson and the remarkable Erivo\n\nYou won’t find much actual purple in The Color Purple, John Doyle’s simplified restaging of the formerly florid Broadway musical. At one point the nightclub singer Shug (Jennifer Hudson, making her Broadway debut) steps onstage in a periwinkle suit, but that’s the closest the production comes to flamboyance. A restrained expansion of the production Doyle debuted at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London in 2013; this version is streamlined and stripped down. Doyle’s strategy allows the fine performances, particularly Cynthia Erivo as the downtrodden Celie, to brighten it up.\n\nRead moreAdapted from Alice Walker’s novel by book writer Marsha Norman and composer and lyricists Brenda Russell, Allee Willis and Stephen Bray, the story describes the trials and eventual emancipation of Celie, an African American girl who bears two children to her rapist stepfather (whom she believes to be her father) by the age of 14. While her pretty sister Nettie (Joaquina Kalukango) is allowed to finish her schooling, Celie is married off to the cruel Mister (Isaiah Johnson), who tasks her with chores and the rearing of his unruly children. He frequently beats her.\n\nCelie isn’t pleased when Shug, Mister’s old flame, arrives for a visit, but Shug forms a relationship with Celie (erotic in the novel, more sororal here), making her feel loved. Shug also restores the letters from Nettie that Mister had hidden. With Shug’s help, Celie manages to leave Mister and to set up a life and a business of her own.\n\nView image in fullscreenHer joy is infectious … Cynthia Erivo in The Color Purple Photograph: Matthew MurphyThe script is more schematic than the novel, its complexities sometimes reduced to cliches. The score has occasionally vivid moments, but is often sweetly unremarkable in its borrowings from blues, gospel and folk. The emotive content can tend toward the soppy and it’s Doyle’s astute choice to lessen its sentiment and to treat the characters and circumstances coolly and truthfully. Every so often this backfires – the delicacy of the handling of the love between Celie and Shug obscures that relationship – but the simplicity and seriousness is often welcome.\n\nCertainly it pays off for Erivo, a remarkable actor and singer who can accomplish a tremendous amount while seeming to do very little. She communicates Celie’s suffering with scant exaggeration or fuss and her joy is infectious. In the second act, when she finally gets to sing out, her anthemic ballad I’m Here earned a standing ovation in the middle of the show. (Yes, Broadway audiences are much too quick to ovate, but the applause was hard to begrudge.)\n\nCynthia Erivo and Jennifer Hudson in The Color Purple. Photograph: Matthew MurphyShe has fine support from Johnson’s Mister, whom she urges toward a late and not entirely motivated redemption, and Kyle Scatliffe and Danielle Brooks as her stepson and daughter-in-law. Just before opening, Hudson still seemed tentative in the part of Shug, though vocally confident of course. She didn’t seem to have fully embraced the sexuality of Shug, even in the steamy number Push da Button, and while she was clearly treating the work with utmost seriousness her performance sometimes felt studied rather than spontaneous as though she were still searching for the character’s core.\n\nHudson may have a marquee name, but make no mistake this is Erivo’s show. She’s here and if New York producers have any sense, she’ll stay.\n\nAt any point, you can opt out of the sale of all of your personal information by pressing",
