  "bwwExcerpt": "Much of the power of “Billy Elliot” as an honest tear-jerker lies in its ability to give equal weight to the sweet dreams of terpsichorean flight and the sourness of a dream-denying reality, with the two elements locked in a vital and unending dialogue. This isn’t wholesale escapism à la Busby Berkeley or “Mamma Mia!” In tone, it’s closer to the song-dotted working-class films of Terence Davies or, on television, Dennis Potter’s “Pennies From Heaven.”",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Extremely enthusiastic language with superlatives ('sets it ablaze', 'theatrical magic'). However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong, enthusiastic language ('sets it ablaze with hope and joy', 'theatrical magic'), indicating a rave review. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a high level of praise. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"ablaze with hope and joy\" and \"theatrical magic\", indicating a very positive review. | Kimi: The excerpt uses superlative praise ('theatrical magic', 'ablaze with hope') indicating strong enthusiasm for the production. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced per guidelines. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
