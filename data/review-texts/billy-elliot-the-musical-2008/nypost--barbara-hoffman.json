  "bwwExcerpt": "Granted, 'Billy Elliot' isn't perfect - a scene with giant dancing dresses might have gone AWOL from some Disney show on ice - but it's still head and toe-shoes above every other show this season. So thanks, Maggie Thatcher, for giving us something to sing about.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive recommendation calling it superior to all other shows this season, with only minor reservations about one scene. Strong endorsement despite acknowledging imperfections. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges a flaw but ultimately praises the show as superior to others this season, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so confidence is low. | Gemini: Despite acknowledging imperfections, the critic states it's better than every other show this season, indicating a strong positive recommendation. The single excerpt warrants a slightly higher score within the positive bucket. | Kimi: Despite a minor reservation about one scene, the critic uses superlative language declaring the show superior to all others this season, indicating an enthusiastic, must-see recommendation.",
