  "bwwExcerpt": "It celebrates the mineworkers’ collective struggle with all the political passion of a Studs Terkel history. Its extensive cast of children makes you think about the cost of growing up in a world of angry adults, but also the ability of kids to transcend such a world. And it ultimately comes down to a dad (played, superbly, by Gregory Jbara) who, like most of us, doesn’t understand much about his world, except for the most important thing therein. He has to get behind his kid.",

However, this is only one curated excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for its political passion and the superb performance of Gregory Jbara, indicating a positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is highly positive, praising the show's passion and impact. The mention of a superb performance also contributes to a positive assessment. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt contains clearly positive evaluative language including 'superbly' for the lead performance and praises the show's political passion and thematic depth, warranting an upper-range Positive score. Confidence is low due to availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
