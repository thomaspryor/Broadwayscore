  "bwwExcerpt": "It celebrates the mineworkers’ collective struggle with all the political passion of a Studs Terkel history. Its extensive cast of children makes you think about the cost of growing up in a world of angry adults, but also the ability of kids to transcend such a world. And it ultimately comes down to a dad (played, superbly, by Gregory Jbara) who, like most of us, doesn’t understand much about his world, except for the most important thing therein. He has to get behind his kid.",
