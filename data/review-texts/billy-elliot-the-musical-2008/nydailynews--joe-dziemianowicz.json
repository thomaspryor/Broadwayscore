  "bwwExcerpt": "Hall's script is vivid and smart and gets excellent support from the songs. He wrote lyrics, Elton John, the music. No single tune is bound to be a pop recording hit. Still, the fine score covers an array of styles - folk tunes, anthems, novelty numbers - and emotions that beautifully move the story along. It's worth noting that the show's soundscape is crystal-clear.\nDaldry's staging shows an eye for intelligent detail throughout, especially in the knockout 'Solidarity' sequence.\nIt brilliantly weaves plot, music and dance together as a classroom of pint-sized ballerinas in tutus (the cutest mob of moppets since 'Annie') merge with angry miners and cops.",
