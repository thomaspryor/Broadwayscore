  "bwwExcerpt": "Hall's script is vivid and smart and gets excellent support from the songs. He wrote lyrics, Elton John, the music. No single tune is bound to be a pop recording hit. Still, the fine score covers an array of styles - folk tunes, anthems, novelty numbers - and emotions that beautifully move the story along. It's worth noting that the show's soundscape is crystal-clear.\nDaldry's staging shows an eye for intelligent detail throughout, especially in the knockout 'Solidarity' sequence.\nIt brilliantly weaves plot, music and dance together as a classroom of pint-sized ballerinas in tutus (the cutest mob of moppets since 'Annie') merge with angry miners and cops.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Consistent praise for script ('vivid and smart'), score ('fine'), staging ('intelligent detail'), and production quality ('crystal-clear soundscape'). The 'knockout' and 'brilliantly weaves' language suggests strong positive assessment, warranting upper Positive range despite single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the script, score, and staging with terms like 'vivid', 'smart', 'excellent', and 'brilliantly'. Despite noting no pop hits, the overall tone is strongly positive, suggesting a high recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the script, score, and staging, indicating a positive recommendation. The lack of a clear overall verdict and the single excerpt lowers the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers consistent praise for the script ('vivid and smart'), score ('fine,' 'beautifully move the story'), and staging ('knockout,' 'brilliantly'), indicating a clear recommendation despite the single-excerpt limitation.",
