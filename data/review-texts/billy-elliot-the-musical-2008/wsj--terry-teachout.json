  "bwwExcerpt": "No doubt Stephen Daldry, who directed both the musical and the film on which it is based, deserves some of the credit for the high quality of their performances -- and the low quality of the show in which they're performing. I've seen my share of bad Broadway musicals, but I can't recall one that was quite so vulgar and bogus as 'Billy Elliot.'",

Single excerpt warning noted - this appears strongly negative but confidence lowered due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The critic describes the show as 'vulgar and bogus,' indicating a strongly negative opinion. Despite the lack of a full review, the excerpt suggests a deep pan. | Gemini: The critic explicitly states that the show is \"vulgar and bogus,\" indicating a strong negative opinion and a pan. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the cast's high-quality performances, the verdict is devastatingly negative, calling the show 'vulgar and bogus' and memorably worse than other bad musicals. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning.",
