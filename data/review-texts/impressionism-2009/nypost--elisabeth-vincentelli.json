  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Allen and Irons put up a stoic front but can't help betraying a certain sense of defeat. A hectic preview process, during which the play was trimmed from two acts to one, likely explains some of their tentativeness. But their limp performances also stem from the characters: The actors look as bored by Katharine and Thomas as we are.\"",
