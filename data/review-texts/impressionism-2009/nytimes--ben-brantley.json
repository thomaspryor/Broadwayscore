However, the lack of detailed evaluation makes the confidence medium. | Gemini: The review states that the play \"never quite captures\" the essence of its subject matter, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic delivers a definitive judgment that the play fails to achieve its central aim of embodying the artistic movement it depicts, offering criticism without mentioning compensatory strengths.",
