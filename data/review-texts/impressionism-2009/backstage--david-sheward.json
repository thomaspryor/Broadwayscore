  "bwwExcerpt": "\"This disappointing evening is a surprise, as the production is directed by the normally masterful Jack O'Brien, whose marathon stagings of The Coast of Utopia and Henry IV flew by. With Impressionism, 100 intermissionless minutes seem like endless hours. At least you can play Guess the Artist as several beautiful impressionist classics are shown during the scene changes. Thanks to Elaine J. McCarthy for her projection design. Save your money and visit the Met instead.\"",
