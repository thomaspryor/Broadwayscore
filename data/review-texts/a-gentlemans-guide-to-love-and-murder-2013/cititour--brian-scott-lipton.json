  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Darko Tresnjak’s clever, gorgeously costumed production…Lutvak has proven himself a first-rate songwriter in the world of cabaret, but his work here is less memorable than I’d hoped. There are a couple of very fine comic numbers, but I expected some more beautiful ballads…Still, if you want two-and-half-hours of mayhem and merriment, guide yourself over to the Walter Kerr Theatre. The only danger you’ll be in for is having too good a time.'\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning means lower confidence and conservative positive score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'clever' and 'gorgeously costumed' and suggests audiences will have 'too good a time,' indicating a positive recommendation despite some reservations about the music. | Gemini: The review acknowledges some shortcomings in the songwriting but ultimately recommends the show for its mayhem and merriment. The excerpt suggests a generally positive experience, but with some reservations. | Kimi: While criticizing Lutvak's score as less memorable than hoped, the reviewer praises Tresnjak's clever direction and gorgeous costumes, and explicitly recommends attending for the 'mayhem and merriment.' As a single excerpt, confidence is reduced, but the verdict language clearly recommends the experience.",
