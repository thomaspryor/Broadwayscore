  "bwwExcerpt": "\"A stylish music-hall mystery in which we know whodunit from beginning to end, \"A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder\" has lively songs, a congenial villain and a physically and morally flexible mistress...Most important, it has the fine actor Jefferson Mays playing all eight heirs to Highhurst Castle as they're dispatched one after another in comically gruesome ways. What he lacks in finesse as a quick-change artist, he more than makes up for in force of personality.\"",
