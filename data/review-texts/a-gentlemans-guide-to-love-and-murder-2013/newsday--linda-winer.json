  "bwwExcerpt": "\"'A Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder' is, at heart, a clever and jolly 90-minute frolic about a mouse of a disinherited Brit who kills his way up the noble Edwardian family tree until he becomes lord of the manor...Alas, this musical-comedy trifle runs a very leisurely 2-1 / 2 hours, not 90 minutes. This fact should not dissuade patient theatergoers who want to relish Jefferson Mays in one of those performances that people will be talking about all season...composer-lyricist Steven Lutvak and ",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite criticizing the pacing ('very leisurely 2-1/2 hours, not 90 minutes'), the critic recommends it to 'patient theatergoers' and praises Mays' performance as one 'people will be talking about all season.' However, only one excerpt available limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Jefferson Mays' performance as a standout element, suggesting it's worth seeing despite the show's length. However, the single excerpt and lack of a full review make the overall sentiment less clear, warranting a lower confidence level. | Gemini: The review highlights a key performance and suggests it's worth seeing, but notes the show's length as a potential drawback. Given the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While criticizing the show's excessive length and calling it a 'trifle,' the reviewer explicitly recommends it for audiences willing to endure the runtime to see Jefferson Mays' standout performance.",
