The buff, blustering major is undone by his machismo, while poor, delicate Henry - whose particular fondness for Monty informs the side-splitting duet Better with a Man, one of several catchy, clever songs by composer/lyricist Steven Lutvak and lyricist/librettist Robert L. Freedman - finds his beloved little buzzers turned unwittingly against him...The actor who plays Monty, Bryce Pinkham, is pretty of",

Given positive language and performance praise, scored in upper Positive range due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and the music, highlighting the humor and cleverness of the songs. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low due to potential cherry-picking. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances and songs, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt features clearly positive evaluative language ('side-splitting', 'catchy, clever', 'funny') praising both the performances and the score, indicating a strong recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation and truncated text.",
