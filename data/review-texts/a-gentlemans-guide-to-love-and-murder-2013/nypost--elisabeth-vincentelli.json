    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Unfavorable comparison to another show, describes score as 'innocuous music-hall pastiches' and identifies 'Problem No. 1', suggesting disappointment. However, single excerpt from truncated text limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt presents a mixed view, noting some appeal for BBC fans but criticizing the score as 'innocuous'. The comparison to a better-regarded musical suggests a lukewarm reception. However, the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt criticizes the score as \"innocuous\" and compares the show unfavorably to another production. Given the negative tone and lack of positive comments, I'm classifying this as negative, but with low confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows qualified praise for lyrics and setting but identifies major problems with the score and unfavorably compares the show to a superior production. Truncated text and lack of full verdict warrant low confidence. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",

  "fullText": "Jefferson Mays (right) puts up a good fight, playing eight roles — but “A Gentleman’s Guide to Love & Murder” — which also features Bryce Pinkham — isn’t music to your ears. \n AP Photo/The O+M Company, Joan Marcus \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The big hook of the new musical “A Gentleman’s Guide to Love & Murder” is Jefferson Mays. He doesn’t just give a performance — he gives eight of them, impersonating members of the same British family.\n\nThis isn’t new territory for this expert chameleon: In 2003’s “I Am My Own Wife,” a solo play about a German transvestite, Mays played 35 characters, a feat that won him a Tony.\n\nAfter that, eight roles must seem like a pleasure cruise. And yet none of them really register. It’s hard not to think about the real tour de force here — the one pulled off by Mays’ dressers, who sometimes have just 30 seconds to transform him into a loony clergyman in mutton chops, a cleanshaven young toff or a buxom ­battle ax.\n\nAll of them bear the surname D’Ysquith, a well-to-do clan in 1909 England. And all of them get knocked off by their black-sheep cousin, Monty Navarro (Bryce Pinkham), who’s desperate to become the moneyed Earl of Highhurst so he can marry Sibella (Lisa O’Hare), his gold-digging mistress.\n\n“Has it never occurred to you to marry for love?” Monty asks Sibella. “Now\nyou’re being cruel,” she replies.\n\nIf the story is vaguely familiar, it’s because book writer Robert L. Freedman drew it from the same novel that inspired the 1949 comedy “Kind Hearts and Coronets,” in which Alec Guinness embodies the eight victims.\n\nThe droll tone and Edwardian setting should lure BBC fans, but this “Guide” has nothing on “The Mystery of Edwin Drood” — the 1985 caper musical that was successfully revived last year.\n\nProblem No. 1 is Freedman and composer Steven Lutvak’s score, a collection of innocuous music-hall pastiches. The lyrics can be fun, as in “I Don’t Understand the Poor,” sung by the fox-hunting blowhard Lord Adalbert: “Though my politics are purely democratical/I find the species, frankly, problematical.”\n\nBut the melodies aren’t very interesting, and positively pale compared with Rupert Holmes’ catchy contributions to “Drood.”\n\nThe pacing is uneven as well. The first act consists of a series of “accidents” set up by Monty. He pushes exuberant Reverend Lord Ezekial off his church tower’s staircase, and cleverly has Lord Henry killed by his own bees. As for Lady Salome, who fancies herself an actress, Monty switches her prop gun for a real one when she stars in “Hedda Gabler”— and pop goes the thespian.\n\nDirector Darko Tresnjak comes up with staging tricks that combine projections and bright vaudevillian flair, but repetition sets in: Mays just pops back up in an outlandish new guise, looking very pleased with himself.\n\nMeanwhile, the charmless Pinkham — much better as the villain in “Ghost: The Musical” — basically functions as a placeholder during Mays’ costume changes.\n\nThings improve in the second act, when the show switches to Monty’s love life, split between his proper-seeming fiancée, Phoebe (Lauren Worsham), and ­Sibella.\n\nIn general, the women inspire Freedman and Lutvak, who award them their finest ditties. Worsham in particular is in gorgeous lyric voice.\n\nToo bad the show doesn’t spend even more time getting away from murder — love becomes it so much more.",
