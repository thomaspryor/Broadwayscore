    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Uses superlative language ('tour de force', 'hardly likely to be bettered') and unqualified praise ('delightful', 'memorable melody', 'fizzily witty'). Despite single excerpt warning, the enthusiasm is unmistakably rave-level. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'true tour de force' and 'delightful,' indicating strong praise. The mention of 'memorable melody' and 'witty turns of phrase' further supports a highly positive assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"true tour de force\" and \"delightful show\", indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I've scored it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise ('tour de force', 'hardly likely to be bettered') and enthusiastic endorsement ('delightful', 'lift the hearts'), indicating a strong recommendation for this musical. However, as a single curated excerpt, the confidence is reduced. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
