Despite single excerpt warning, the language is clearly in Rave territory with no caveats mentioned. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong superlatives ('tour de force', 'delightful show') and suggests the production is a standout of the season, indicating a rave review. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language such as \"true tour de force\" and \"delightful show,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given that it is only a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt employs superlatives like 'tour de force' and declares the show 'hardly likely to be bettered on Broadway this season,' indicating an unqualified, enthusiastic recommendation consistent with the Rave bucket.",
