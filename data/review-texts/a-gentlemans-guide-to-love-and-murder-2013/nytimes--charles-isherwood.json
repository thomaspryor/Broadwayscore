  "fullText": "Fortune favors the brave, and soon Monty — through happenstance and the occasional bit of malicious handiwork — is rocketing up the social scale, as his relatives fall victim to unhappy, ahem, accidents. Under the nicely pitched direction of Darko Tresnjak — a Shakespeare specialist here making his own impressive Broadway debut — Monty’s journey unfolds as a series of brisk comic vignettes, set to songs that honorably re-create the boisterous heyday of the English music hall and the prime of 19th-century operetta. (The charming set, by Alexander Dodge, features a gorgeously detailed Victorian-style stage within a stage, and the spot-on period costumes are by Linda Cho.)\n\nBryce Pinkham, left, and Jefferson Mays in \"A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder.\"\n\nFollow @NYTimestheater for theater news and reviews from Broadway and beyond.\n\nI could fill the rest of my review with quotations from the lyrics that particularly tickled. Here’s just a morsel, from one of the show’s highlights, a comic ditty lampooning the rapacities of would-be do-gooders, in which Lady Hyacinth D’Ysquith (Mr. Mays, natch), desperate to find a new cause to champion, lights on the opportunities in darkest Africa:\n\nWe’ll civilize a village in the jungle!\n\nIt can’t take long to learn their mother tongue!\n\nAnd all of them are different words for dung!\n\nMr. Lutvak and Mr. Freedman may be reworking forms that have been previously established, primarily the patter song and the romantic ballad. But their score still establishes itself as one of the most accomplished (and probably the most literate) to be heard on Broadway in the past dozen years or so, since the less rigorous requirements of pop songwriting have taken over.\n\nIt is beautifully sung by the rich-voiced cast, with Mr. Pinkham handling his heavy chores with a light touch, his firm tenor matched by pleasingly (and necessarily) precise diction. Ms. O’Hare plays Sibella with pertness and poise, and has a bright, clear soprano. So, too, does the wonderful Lauren Worsham, who plays Phoebe D’Ysquith, the rival for Monty’s heart, with a demure sweetness that never cloys. (Fortunately for Phoebe, she is not in the direct line of heirs to the D’Ysquith fortune.)\n\nMr. Mays is not a musical theater specialist, to be sure, which makes his accomplishment here all the more impressive. Most of his songs don’t make any great demands on the tonsils (he’s largely doing patter material), but he manages to sing in a variety of voices, distinguishing each character with a distinctive sound.\n\nA distinctive look and personality, too: the dazed, toothy dottiness of the Rev. Lord D’Ezekial; the buxom heartiness of Lady Hyacinth; the pompous grumpiness of the reigning Lord Adalbert; the tallyho perkiness of the bright-eyed beekeeper Henry (spinning forth hilarious yet never vulgar double-entendres in a mock-homoerotic duet with Monty, “Better With a Man”).\n\nAs each precise caricature of British snootiness or silliness comes bounding onto the stage, Mr. Mays seems to be challenging himself to elicit bigger laughs, and he almost always succeeds. All but one of his characters ends up six feet under by the time this daffy, inspired musical concludes, but his brilliant performance deserves to be immortalized in Broadway lore for some time to come.\n\nA Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder\n\nBook and lyrics by Robert L.
