Without it, for all its merits, the show never quite achieves musical liftoff. You want the score to raise the dead, not just bury them.\"",

In a musical, the stakes have to be high enough to give the characters a reason to sing. Yet if the stakes are high enough for serial killing, all but the greatest songs can seem ludicrous. (I’m talking to you, Jekyll and Hyde.) So unless you’re the man who wrote Sweeney Todd, you probably want to go with satire, as Rupert Holmes did in adapting Dickens’s The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Following in Drood’s slightly mincing footsteps, the authors of the new musical A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder aim for droll comedy; especially in the knock-’em-dead performance of Jefferson Mays as various undearly departeds, they usually hit their mark.\n\nThat’s partly due to the clever source material: a 1907 novel called Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal and the 1949 Ealing comedy, Kind Hearts and Coronets, that’s loosely based on it. From the former comes the story of a young man who, having been disinherited by a wealthy family, sets out to kill each of the heirs standing between him and his rightful position. From the latter comes the concept of having all of those heirs — young and old, male and female — played by one actor, in the movie’s case Alec Guinness. All versions are told in flashback as the killer awaits his fate in prison, and all three are comedies, though of a progressively lighter stripe.\n\nBut for all the musical’s debts to those sources, its authors (Robert L.\n\nShow \n 0 Comments / 0 New\n \n Comment\n \n\n Theater: A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n Your product is saved!
