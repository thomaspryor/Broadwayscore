  "bwwExcerpt": "\"...the authors of the new musical A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder aim for droll comedy; especially in the knock-'em-dead performance of Jefferson Mays as various undearly departeds, they usually hit their mark...what this material needed from its songs, and does not get, is exactly what Mays brought to his task: a strong, clear, distinctive profile. Without it, for all its merits, the show never quite achieves musical liftoff. You want the score to raise the dead, not just bury them.\"",
