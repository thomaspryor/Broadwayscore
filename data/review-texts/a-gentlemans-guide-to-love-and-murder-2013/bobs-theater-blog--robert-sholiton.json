The music seemed a little more monotonous this time and the lyrics were occasionally lost by less than ideal enunciation, but the show is still a wonderful treat.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the overall tone is clearly positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a positive view of the production's liveliness and design elements, despite some criticism of the music and enunciation. The overall tone is positive, but the single excerpt and noted issues suggest a score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review states that the production is still a 'wonderful treat' despite some minor issues with the music and lyrics, indicating a positive recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The critic offers clear praise for the production as lively, polished, and a wonderful treat, explicitly recommending it despite noting minor issues with monotonous music and occasional enunciation problems.",
