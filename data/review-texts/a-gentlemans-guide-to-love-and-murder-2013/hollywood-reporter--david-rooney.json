  "bwwExcerpt": "\"During previews, Broadway chatrooms have drawn facile comparison to The Mystery of Edwin Drood, the Tony-winning 1986 Rupert Holmes musical that was given a sparkling revival last season. While there's some overlap in the pastiche score and vintage British music hall-style staging, Gentleman's Guide is far superior, propelled by a rollicking story, humor of the most delectable amorality and the cleverest lyrics assembled in quite some time. Just hearing Mays as the ridiculously posh Lord Adalbe",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies - this curated quote is extremely positive, calling the show 'far superior' with 'the cleverest lyrics assembled in quite some time.' However, confidence is low due to limited text availability. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the show, highlighting its superiority, humor, and clever lyrics. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly positive verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt contains strong positive language such as \"far superior\", \"rollicking story\", \"delectable amorality\", and \"cleverest lyrics\", indicating a positive recommendation. Given that it is only an excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers strong praise with superlatives ('far superior', 'cleverest lyrics'), warranting an upper-range Positive score. However, as a single curated excerpt that may be cherry-picked, confidence is reduced regarding the full review's overall verdict. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
