    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Declares the show 'undisputed king of musical comedy' with superlatives like 'wittiest, loveliest' and 'not a weak link.' Despite being a single excerpt, the language is unambiguously rapturous. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language, calling the show 'the new undisputed king of musical comedy' and praising the cast and music. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, calling the show the \"undisputed king of musical comedy\" and praising the cast and show tunes. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it high in the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers rave-level praise, declaring the show the 'undisputed king of musical comedy' with 'wittiest, loveliest show tunes in years' and no weak links in the cast. However, per the single excerpt warning guidelines to use the upper end of the Positive bucket (80-84) for clearly positive curated quotes, the score reflects enthusiastic recommendation while accounting for potential cherry-picking. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
