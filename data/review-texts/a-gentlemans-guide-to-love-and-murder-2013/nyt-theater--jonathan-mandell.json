  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The musical’s influences would lead one to expect a quick-witted comedy set in Edwardian England, and A Gentleman’s Guide delivers on this expectation. Jefferson Mays’ track record as a master of multiple characters promises some jolly acting, and A Gentleman’s Guide delivers on that promise.
