  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The musical’s influences would lead one to expect a quick-witted comedy set in Edwardian England, and A Gentleman’s Guide delivers on this expectation. Jefferson Mays’ track record as a master of multiple characters promises some jolly acting, and A Gentleman’s Guide delivers on that promise. The musical is well-designed, well-acted, and well enough plotted (with some twists that are well-crafted.) Yet for all its cleverness and wicked charm, this is an entertainment I could easily have skipped.\"\n\nRead more",

The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like design, acting, and plot, but ultimately concludes it's skippable, indicating a mixed recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the show is well-crafted, well-acted, and delivers on its promises, the final verdict explicitly states it is an entertainment they 'could easily have skipped,' indicating a recommendation against seeing it despite the isolated praise.",
