There are many aspects of the production to praise with primary honors going to the tour de force performance of actor Jefferson Mays...'A Gentlemen’s Guide' is smaller in scale, but nonetheless wholly satisfying... Director Darko Tresnjak assuredly guides the musical through its paces.\" \n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the tone is consistently positive throughout the available text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the musical as 'smart, funny, and entertaining' with a 'tour de force performance' and 'wholly satisfying' production. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a strong positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using terms like \"smart, funny, and entertaining\" and praising the performance of Jefferson Mays as a \"tour de force.\" | Kimi: Single excerpt contains clearly positive evaluation ('wholly satisfying', 'tour de force', 'smart, funny'), but confidence is low due to limited available text.",
