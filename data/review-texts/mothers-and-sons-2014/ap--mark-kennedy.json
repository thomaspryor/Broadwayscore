  "bwwExcerpt": "Daly, the former star of the TV show 'Cagney & Lacey' and later winner of a Tony for 'Gypsy,' is simply wonderful here, a remote and chilly guest who clings to old ideas even as she knows they are out of date and secretly pines for love. The gentle and moving 'Mothers and Sons' opened Monday at the Golden Theatre, where a celebrated revival of the searing AIDS drama 'The Normal Heart' was staged in 2011. As a sign of how much has changed, McNally's play is being billed as the first time a legally married gay couple has been portrayed on Broadway...The 90-minute play moves quickly, and although some of the most angry exchanges seem to erupt from nowhere, the playwright beautifully shows how close to the surface long-suppressed emotions and slights can fester.",
