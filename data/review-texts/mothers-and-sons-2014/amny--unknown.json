  "bwwExcerpt": "Devised as a single scene without pause, 'Mothers and Sons' makes for a well-constructed, often funny dialogue that is both provocative and heartfelt. But after 90 minutes, very little has changed and no climax has been reached. As she did in McNally's 'Master Class,' Daly offers a masterful performance, delivering her lines with a dry acidity and firm poise while her reactions to both men reveal her conflicted emotions. Steggert, who was previously seen this season in 'Big Fish,' once again excels at playing a good-natured, clean-cut and sensitive youth.",
