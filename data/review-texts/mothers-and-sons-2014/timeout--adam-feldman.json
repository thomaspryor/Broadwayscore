  "bwwExcerpt": "The sincere drama Mothers and Sons marks a return to familiar territory-the play is a follow-up to McNally's 1988 playlet (and 1990 telecast) Andre's Mother, in which a woman hovers at her gay son's memorial service-and also a return to form. Though dated at times, and shaded with passive aggression, this is arguably McNally's best play in 20 years...Sensitively directed by Sheryl Kaller, Mothers and Sons rarely lags as it unfurls in a single unbroken scene. And Daly's commanding performance helps check McNally's impulses toward pop sociology and reverse nostalgia. She has the strength and give of melting steel.",
