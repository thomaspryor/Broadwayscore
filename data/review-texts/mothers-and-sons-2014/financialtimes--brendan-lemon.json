  "bwwExcerpt": "Mike Nichols once observed that casting a well-loved actor in a play or movie makes the director's job easier: you don't have to spend the first half-hour securing audience interest in the actor's character. For proof of the remark, look no further than Mothers and Sons, the sometimes absorbing, somewhat unsatisfying new play by Terrence McNally that has arrived on Broadway. Without Tyne Daly as Katharine Gerard, who has come to New York from Dallas to bring her dead son's diary to his former lover, the character -- and the 90-minute, interval-less play -- would have struggled to engage us from the first beat.",
