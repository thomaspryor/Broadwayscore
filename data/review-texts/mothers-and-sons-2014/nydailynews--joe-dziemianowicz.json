The review highlights a specific aspect that works well, suggesting there are both strengths and weaknesses. | Gemini: The text is very short and doesn't offer a clear recommendation. The critic's rating of 60 suggests a mixed review. | Kimi: The single-sentence excerpt offers qualified praise for specific character dynamics while implying the show works less well elsewhere, consistent with the provided 60/100 rating.
