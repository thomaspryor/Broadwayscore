  "bwwExcerpt": "David Mamet's new play, Race, is the most interesting new work of his to reach the New York stage in quite some time. It's provocative and savvily written, though it feels in the final analysis more like something designed to push emotional buttons rather than stimulate reasoned thought about the topic that gives it its title. It has been given an expert Broadway production, and features a top-notch cast that boasts two of the most impressive performances currently on view here in town.",
