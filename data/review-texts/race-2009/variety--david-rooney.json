  "bwwExcerpt": "As one of the characters in David Mamet's teasing faux-polemic on the subject says, 'Race is the most incendiary topic in our history.' The slender play that takes its terse title from that declaration seems hatched more out of an urge to inflame arguments easily triggered in the age of Obama than out of the need to tell this particular story or even to explore the issue with any real conclusiveness. This being Mamet, however, the dialogue is tasty, the confrontations spiky and the observations more than occasionally biting. Slick but hollow, 'Race' entertains as it unfolds, but grows increasingly wobbly as it twists its way to an unsatisfying wrap-up.",
