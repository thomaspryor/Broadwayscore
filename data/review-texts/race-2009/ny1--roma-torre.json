  "bwwExcerpt": "Everyone in 'Race' breathes the same polluted morality that surround just about every other Mamet character. Jack Lawson and his partner Henry Brown are successful defense lawyers. And true to the stereotype they are as cynical and calculating as they come. So cynical in fact, these guys are beyond racism. They're prejudiced against everyone, or so it seems. They're trying to determine whether to take the case of a wealthy white man accused of raping a young black woman. Their newly hired associate also happens to be a young black woman which should be a tip off to anyone familiar with Mamet's writing. The play is as much about sexism as racism. In fact, despite the title, Mamet seems far more eager to steer this play into the murky waters of misogyny. As badly behaved as the men can be, beware the Mamet women.",
