  "bwwExcerpt": "This play probes affirmative action in white-collar professions. It's mostly an attack thereupon. If there is a thesis, it's that the law treated blacks and whites differently a century ago and does the same now. Both imbalances were wrong. You might well take offense at that argument. But if you follow Mamet's logic in 'Race,' you'd argue that no white liberal could write a watchable play on this subject, anyway. He would be too scared.",
