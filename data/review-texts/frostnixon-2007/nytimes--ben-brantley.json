Available on NYTimes.com and a new iPhone® app.\n\nTelevision mows down a titan in �Frost/Nixon,� the briskly entertaining new play by Peter Morgan about the 1977 face-off between its title characters, the British talk show host (as in David) and the former American president (as in Richard M.). But let it be proclaimed, with drums and fanfare, that theater decisively trumps television in the production that opened last night at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater.\n\nMichael Sheen, left, plays David Frost and Frank Langella is Richard M. Nixon in \"Frost/Nixon.\"\n\nMost of the credit for this victory belongs to a truly titanic performance from the man playing the famously sweaty victim of a cool medium. That�s Frank Langella, whose portrayal of Nixon is one of those made-for-the-stage studies in controlled excess in which larger-than-life seems truer-to-life than merely life-size ever could.\n\nNo screen, big or small, could accommodate such showy grandeur. And it�s telling that when this production � which recreates the story behind the widely watched television interviews between Nixon and Mr. Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen) � projects Mr. Langella�s image onto the bank of monitors at the back of the stage, his face registers as that of some grotesque mythic creature in uncomfortable captivity.\n\nThis tension between camera and subject italicizes a central theme of �Frost/Nixon,� a British import staged, with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy, by Michael Grandage, the artistic director of the Donmar Warehouse in London. Structured as a prize fight between two starkly ambitious men in professional crisis, �Frost/Nixon� makes it clear that the competitor who controls the camera reaps the spoils.\n\nIt should be stated that Mr. Morgan, whose more sophisticated screenplay for the movie �The Queen� also dealt with the triumph of spin over substance, is guilty of spelling out his message too bluntly. �The first and greatest sin of television is that it simplifies, diminishes,� he has one of his characters say. The same accusation could be leveled against �Frost/ Nixon.� The play asks us to take on faith Frost�s understanding of �the power of the close-up,� instead of giving us real evidence of his mastery of the medium. Much of what happens behind the scenes, as Frost�s team prepares to take on the notoriously slippery Nixon, has an improbably na�ve, college studentish air. (�Hey, guys, let�s put on a show to humiliate Tricky Dick.�)\n\nAnd to enhance the play�s nail-biting quotient, which hinges on whether Frost will induce Nixon to apologize for his role in Watergate, Mr. Morgan has blithely rejiggered and rearranged facts and chronology.\n\n(To appreciate how wide some of the discrepancies are, read �The Conviction of Richard Nixon: The Untold Story of the Frost/Nixon Interviews� the coming memoir by James Reston Jr. � who appears as a character in this play, convincingly played by Stephen Kunken � about his experience as one of Frost�s advisers on the interviews.)\n\nMr. Morgan, a specialist in fact-based fiction for screen and television (�The Queen,� �The Last King of Scotland� and, for British television, �The Deal�), has spoken of �the difference between accuracy and truth� in eliciting private drama from public records. But here he sometimes seems to be forsaking accuracy less in the pursuit of truth than of conventional entertainment value.\n\nThis means that while Nixon scholars may gnash their teeth, average theatergoers are likely to have a good time. The structure of �Frost/Nixon� � a time-skipping, globe-spanning montage of narrative scenes and expository asides, largely delivered by Mr. Kunken as Mr. Reston and Corey Johnson as Jack Brennan, Nixon�s top aide de camp � makes more for lively breadth than penetrating depth. (Christopher Oram�s set and Neil Austin�s terrific lighting help keep the play fast and fluid.)\n\nBut it does allow two superb actors to explore the racing, anxious minds behind two much-photographed faces. Admittedly Mr. Sheen has the less rewarding job. One of the brightest actors of the London stage, who has presented his own searing take on the pathology of power in the title role of the Donmar�s production of Camus�s �Caligula,� Mr. Sheen is best known for his sly, multidimensional portraits of Prime Minister Tony Blair in �The Queen� and �The Deal.�\n\nAs written by Mr. Morgan, the character of David Frost offers fewer complexities to snack on. He is presented as a bit of a celebrity bimbo, a vain man who lives for the perfect table in the best restaurant amid A-list companions. What makes him worthy of concentrated attention here is the raw hunger of his ambition and the insecurity that feeds it.\n\nThough his surface remains relentlessly, well, superficial and upbeat, this character brims with the self-doubts and need for approval that keep him in motion. Look for the barely perceptible flinch, like that of someone pricked by a needle, that Mr. Sheen produces every time the term �talk show host� crops up.\n\nGet 50% Off The New York Times & Free All Digital Access.\n\nOn the anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings, Room for Debate asks: Has fear come to play too big a role in government policy and the level of protection Americans seek?\n\nThe growing use of evidence in policy making among lawmakers from different parties may be our best opportunity to cut through partisan gridlock.",
