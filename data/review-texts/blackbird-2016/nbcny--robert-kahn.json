However, with only one truncated excerpt available, confidence is low about the overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Williams' performance as 'venomous, fragile and, finally, stripped bare' and describes the account as 'spellbinding'. This suggests a positive view of the production, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt describes a 'spellbinding account' and praises the performance, suggesting a positive but potentially qualified recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt uses highly laudatory language ('spellbinding', 'stripped bare') to describe the lead performances, indicating clear enthusiasm. However, as a single curated excerpt, the overall verdict is uncertain.",
