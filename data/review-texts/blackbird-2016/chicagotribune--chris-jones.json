    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies. The critic describes the show as a 'sparse shock' and 'tough, toxic ride' which suggests challenging material that may not satisfy all audiences. The warning about disappointing star-seekers indicates mixed reception potential. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a challenging and potentially off-putting experience despite the star power, indicating a mixed reception. The single excerpt and lack of a clear positive or negative verdict necessitate a cautious approach. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a challenging and potentially off-putting experience, but doesn't explicitly discourage seeing it. The phrase \"sparse shock\" and \"tough, toxic ride\" indicate a mixed reaction. | Kimi: The excerpt warns that despite star power, the show offers a 'sparse' and 'toxic' experience likely to disappoint mainstream audiences. With only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low.",
