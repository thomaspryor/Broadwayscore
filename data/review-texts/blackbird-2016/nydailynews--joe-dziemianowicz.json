The positive language outweighs the challenging content warning. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language ('soar', 'compelling') indicating a highly favorable impression of the show, suggesting it is a must-see despite its discomfort. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"soar\" and \"compelling,\" indicating a highly favorable opinion and recommendation. | Kimi: Strong praise for lead performances ('soar') with clear recommendation language ('compelling'). The 'uncomfortable' acknowledges the challenging material but frames it as a strength, not a flaw. No reservations expressed.",
