  "fullText": "Michelle Williams’s girlish and haunted face is so eloquent in “Blackbird,” you might wish you had binoculars for a closer look. Where’s a birder when you need one?\n\nBut Scottish writer David Harrower’s raw and disquieting two-character drama — also starring Jeff Daniels — isn’t about ornithology. The fact that blackbirds are symbols of temptation and carnality may lend a clue to the title.\n\nUnfolding in real time over 80 minutes in a garbage-strewn office, the play follows the tense and volatile reunion of Ray and Una. She’s tracked him down after 15 years and a life-changing liaison.\n\nThe last time she saw him she was 12. He was 40. They’d just had sex at an inn. Twice. You turned me around the second time, Una recalls. There was blood. This isn’t a work that wants to play nice and be polite.\n\nRay, who served time in jail for the incident, has now changed his name and says he’s put the matter and his illegal behavior behind him. Or has he? Can he?\n\nThere’s no question that Una, whose flirty little dress speaks volumes, still grapples daily. “I hate the life I’ve had,” Una moans in a voice trembling with pain.\n\nWilliams’s Broadway debut, in “Cabaret,” was so wispy she practically disappeared, but now she’s commanding. She’s believable and shattering as this damaged young woman. Daniels, ideally cast as an average guy-next-door, is her match. He convinces as a man on the edge, a shifty bird on a wire.\n\nThe play itself isn’t quite as successful. As in an Off-Broadway 2007 run, also directed by Joe Mantello and starring Daniels, it takes time to settle into believable rhythms. Initial staccato bursts of words still sound stage-y. Dimming lights during monologues adds a non-realistic texture the play doesn’t need. The litter-strewn room echoing messy lives feels a bit too heavy-handed.\n\nStill, “Blackbird” is taut, twisty and provocative. There’s value in works that make your mind fly to uncomfortable places and send out cries you can’t unhear.",

While there are some criticisms about the play's rhythm and staging, the overall tone is positive, recommending it for its provocative nature. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws in the production but ultimately finds value in its thought-provoking nature and praises the performances of the leads, leading to a positive but not rave recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic notes staging issues and uneven rhythms in the play itself, strong praise for Williams and Daniels' performances ('commanding,' 'shattering,' 'ideally cast') combined with the final assessment that the work is 'taut, twisty and provocative' with value indicates a solid recommendation.",
