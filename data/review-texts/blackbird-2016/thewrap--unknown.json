He sexually abused her.",

It's as if the sexual abuse her character suffered 15 years ago has caused not only a speech impediment but uncontrollable physical spasms that now affect her walk, gestures, and facial expressions.

The truncated text suggests additional criticism was cut off, making this a negative assessment overall. | GPT-4o: The review highlights strong performances but criticizes Williams' portrayal as overly mannered. The tone suggests a mixed reception with notable elements but significant reservations. | Gemini: The review highlights issues with Williams' performance, describing it as \"mannered to the point of distraction.\" While Daniels' performance is praised, the negative assessment of a lead performance contributes to a negative overall impression. | Kimi: The review offers high praise for Daniels ('marvel') but heavily criticizes Williams ('mannered to the point of distraction'). With the text truncated mid-sentence, the final verdict is unclear, but the significant critique of one lead suggests a mixed reception. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",
