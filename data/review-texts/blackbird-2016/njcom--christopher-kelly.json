    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for Williams' performance ('unforgettable portrait', 'tears up the stage') but single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked praise from a mixed review. Score in upper Positive range given the enthusiastic language about the lead performance. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for Michelle Williams' performance, describing it as 'unforgettable'. The language suggests a highly positive assessment, but due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a strong performance by Michelle Williams, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performance using superlatives like 'unforgettable' and 'tears up the stage,' indicating a strong recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
