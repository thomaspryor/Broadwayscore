    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic uses positive descriptors like 'lean and muscular piece of drama' and praises the director's ability to draw out 'fully-developed performances from great actors.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction and performances, indicating a positive view. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence, suggesting a lower-end positive score. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the play as a \"lean and muscular piece of drama\" and praises the director's ability to draw out fully-developed performances. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the production's dramatic construction and direction, describing it as 'lean and muscular' with 'fully-developed performances,' indicating a positive recommendation despite the limited excerpt.",
