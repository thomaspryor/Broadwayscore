They walk as if welded together, though whether in support, restraint or combat is unclear. Her eyes are wild and her bare legs wobbly, and he leads their stuttering steps with an angry, obdurate chin.\n\nIf you saw them in real life, you’d consider calling the police. As it is, your first impressions of Ray and Una — so intensely embodied by Jeff Daniels and Michelle Williams in the Broadway production of David Harrower’s “Blackbird” — would seem to guarantee a satisfyingly fraught night at the theater.\n\nWhat follows is definitely fraught, with the sort of acting that triggers seismometers. The satisfaction factor is somewhat lower.\n\n“Blackbird,” which took the Olivier Award in London for best new play in 2007, is an immensely powerful work that only occasionally maximizes its potential in the fitful production that opened on Thursday night at the Belasco Theater. When I saw it nine years ago at the Manhattan Theater Club, it left me shaking.\n\nSo I was steeled to have the breath knocked out of me once more. After all, this latest incarnation of Mr. Harrower’s disturbed and disturbing drama of criminal love shares many elements with that earlier version. It has the same accomplished director (Joe Mantello) and set designer (Scott Pask). Most important, it has the same leading man, Jeff Daniels, who in 2007 delivered what felt like the performance of his career.\n\nMr. Daniels is still first-rate as Ray. And Ms. Williams, in the role previously played by Alison Pill, is certainly committed to the part of Ray’s former lover, whom he seduced 15 years before “Blackbird” begins, when she was 12 and he was in his 40s. But it often registers as the kind of commitment you associate with institutionalization in mental wards.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",

He acknowledges strong individual moments but finds the overall execution problematic, with performances that are 'anticlimactic' and direction that misses the play's quieter power. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the play's power and the actors' commitment, but criticizes the production's execution, finding it fitful and not fully maximizing the play's potential. It praises the play's structure but finds the production flawed. | Kimi: While praising the 'immensely powerful' play and 'first-rate' performances by Jeff Daniels and Michelle Williams, the critic finds this Broadway production 'fitful' and 'anticlimactic,' noting that it fails to capture the quiet menace of the original Off-Broadway run and often leaves the viewer annoyed rather than fascinated.",
