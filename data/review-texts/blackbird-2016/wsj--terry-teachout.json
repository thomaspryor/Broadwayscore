  "bwwExcerpt": "David Harrower's \"Blackbird,\" a pruriently manipulative tale of pedophilia that made a lot of noise off Broadway in 2007, has finally made it to Broadway in a big-stage revival closely similar to the small-scaled production that I reviewed in this space nine years ago...It's a have-it-both-ways shocker that seeks to make us sympathize (but not really!) with a man (Mr. Daniels) who molested a 12-year-old girl (Ms. Williams)...",

This indicates a positive recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the show is \"worth seeing\" due to the performances, but the caveat about needing a \"long, hot shower\" indicates reservations. | Kimi: The critic explicitly recommends the show as 'worth seeing' based on 'superb' lead performances, though warns that the disturbing subject matter may leave audiences feeling unsettled.",
