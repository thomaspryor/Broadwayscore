However, the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the strong performances and direction, indicating a positive assessment. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the direction and performances, describing the drama as 'lean and muscular' with 'fully-developed performances' and electric interplay between the leads. However, confidence is low due to the limited availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
