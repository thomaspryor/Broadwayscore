    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic describes being physically engaged and affected by the performances, suggesting the production successfully creates visceral impact. However, this is only a brief excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests an engaging and intense experience, indicating a positive reaction to the performances. However, the lack of full context and a single excerpt warning necessitates a cautious approach with a low confidence level. | Gemini: The excerpt describes a visceral reaction to the performance, but also suggests a potential loss of impact over time. This indicates a mixed, but potentially absorbing experience, placing it in the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic emphasizes that despite the passage of time, the production remains intensely effective, describing physical reactions of engrossment and horror that indicate a successful, gripping theatrical experience.",
