    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Despite the single excerpt warning, the critic explicitly calls the revival 'absolutely brilliant' which is unambiguous rave language. The uncomfortable subject matter context doesn't diminish this clear superlative praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong language ('absolutely brilliant') to describe the revival, indicating a highly positive assessment. Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt calls the revival \"absolutely brilliant\", which indicates a rave review. The description of \"harrowing\" adds to the intensity of the recommendation. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers strong praise ('absolutely brilliant') but limited context requires cautious scoring at the upper end of the Positive range per excerpt guidelines.",
