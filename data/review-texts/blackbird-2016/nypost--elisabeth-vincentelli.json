  "bwwExcerpt": "...had Michelle Williams made her Broadway debut in \"Blackbird\" instead of \"Cabaret,\" she'd have been hailed as a major new stage star, because what she pulls off in David Harrower's 2005 drama is shattering...By play's end, 80 minutes later, both actors look drained. You'll be shocked, yet strangely elated -- the sign of powerful theater.",
