    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows strong praise for performances with vivid, appreciative language like 'spellbinding' and detailed character analysis, but as a single curated quote from a truncated review, confidence must be low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Williams' performance as 'spellbinding,' suggesting a positive view. However, the single excerpt and lack of a full verdict lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt describes a 'spellbinding account' and praises Williams' performance. Given the single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performances, describing them as 'spellbinding' and emotionally raw, suggesting the production is worthwhile for the acting alone despite the limited available context.",
