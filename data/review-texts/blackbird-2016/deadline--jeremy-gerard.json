However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and text cutoff. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong, enthusiastic language ('electrifying production', 'sparks showering down more heat and crackle') indicating a highly positive recommendation. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning suggest caution, but the language supports a Rave classification. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"heat and crackle\" and \"electrifying production.\" Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low, but the language suggests a strong positive leaning. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('electrifying production,' 'heat and crackle') for the performances and production, warranting a high-positive score. However, as a single truncated excerpt, confidence remains low.",
