  "bwwExcerpt": "Like the Packers' bread-and-butter play — 49 Power Sweep — the drama generates power from its simplicity. Performed on a spare 360-degree circular stage without an intermission, director Thomas Kail's production makes effective use of vintage football footage and the evocative music that fans will recognize from grainy NFL documentaries. But there is a sitcom flavor to the play's comic rhythm and well-worn themes, and while the conclusion leaves the question of Lombardi's true character unanswered, the conflicted narrator himself seems to prod the audience to side with the legend. Of course, Lombardi is not a show to diminish its hero, and with Lauria and Light's sterling duet, fans can rest assured that their champion's legacy is secure.",
