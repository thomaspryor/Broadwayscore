  "bwwExcerpt": "Though many scenes are static, director Thomas Kail ('In the Heights') scores points with his audience-friendly staging for this in-the-round theater. The production's touchdown comes when Lombardi drills the Pack on the power sweep, the play that helped make them unbeatable. As X's and O's rush across the bare stage and give way to images of players in green and gold, the play at last comes to life. It's the sort of winning moment Lombardi would expect - and that this show needs more of.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic gives a 60/100 rating and describes it as 'solid if predictable' - clearly mixed territory. Praises the lead performance but finds the overall drama formulaic. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 indicates a mixed review. The text describes the play as 'solid if predictable,' suggesting it has strengths but lacks originality or excitement. | Gemini: The review is mixed, describing the play as \"solid if predictable.\" The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the \"Mixed\" bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60/100 rating places this in the Mixed range. While the lead performance is praised ('scores a touchdown'), the drama is called 'predictable' and noted to work best only in specific moments, indicating uneven quality.",
