  "fullText": "In Eric Simonson’s new play, based on a biography by David Maraniss, “When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi,” and directed by Thomas Kail, a young sports reporter (Keith Nobbs) spends a week in 1965 with Vince Lombardi (Dan Luria), the infamously gruff coach of the Green Bay Packers, and his long-suffering wife, Marie (Judith Light). Lombardi is a lot like the reporter’s father: intolerant of imperfection, too demanding; and the reporter is a lot like Lombardi’s son (and teammates): uncontrollable and imperfect; and the week is explosive. It’s hard to believe that in 2010 we can still romanticize selfish, abusive bastards, even if they’re gifted enough to turn a losing team into winners. That said, this has the potential to be a moving story about fathers and sons and football, but Luria would do well to tone down the yelling and play more subtle notes. The dazzling sound and lighting turn a simple stage into a pro-football field, and Judith Light cuts through a loud, cold men’s world with her warm brilliance.\n\nDate: \n Previews begin September 23, opens October 21\n\nMore news, politics, culture, business, and technology:\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (Revised January 7, 2009) and Privacy Policy (Revised January 7, 2009).

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show's potential ('has the potential to be a moving story') and praises specific elements (Light's performance, technical design), but expresses strong reservations about romanticizing the problematic protagonist and criticizes the lead performance. Neither recommends nor discourages seeing it. | Gemini: The review expresses reservations about romanticizing abusive figures, but acknowledges the potential for a moving story. It praises Judith Light's performance and the sound/lighting design, while suggesting the lead actor should tone down his performance. This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise for the production's 'dazzling' design and Judith Light's 'warm brilliance,' but criticizes Dan Luria's unsubtle performance and questions the show's romanticization of its abusive subject matter.",
