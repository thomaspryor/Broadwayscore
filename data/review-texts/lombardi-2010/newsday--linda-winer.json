  "bwwExcerpt": "There is probably a built-in audience for 'Lombardi,' the by-the-numbers biographical play that marks the National Football League's debut as a Broadway co-producer. That niche had better be a big one. For someone not previously enthralled with Vince Lombardi's famous winning streak as coach of the Green Bay Packers in the '60s, the only compelling part of Eric Simonson's untheatrical script is the mystery of what it's doing on Broadway.",
