    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses warmly positive language ('care and affection', 'homecoming' vs 'exhumation'), suggesting genuine appreciation for the revival. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence must be low as the full review verdict could differ significantly. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a strong positive sentiment, highlighting the care and affection in the production, and likening it to a 'homecoming'. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper range of Positive. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive sentiment, describing the revival as being mounted with \"care and affection\" and feeling like a \"homecoming\" rather than an \"exhumation.\" Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as a solid positive, but not a rave. | Kimi: The critic praises the revival's careful staging and affectionate tone, describing it as a warm 'homecoming' rather than a stale 'exhumation,' indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited excerpt.",
