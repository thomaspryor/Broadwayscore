    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear praise for the revival's quality ('care and affection') and uses positive metaphor ('homecoming' vs 'exhumation'), but single excerpt limitation requires low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the revival, emphasizing 'care and affection' and comparing it to a 'homecoming'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses a positive sentiment, describing the revival as being mounted with \"care and affection\" and feeling like a \"homecoming.\" This suggests a favorable impression of the production. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production's careful, affectionate mounting and describes it as a welcoming 'homecoming' rather than a stale 'exhumation,' indicating a solid recommendation for the revival.",
