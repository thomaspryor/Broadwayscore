    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies. The critic recommends seeing it specifically for Cranston's performance ('you owe' suggests obligation, 'thrill' is positive), but acknowledges the rest of the show is weak ('two-dimensional'). This qualified recommendation lands in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Bryan Cranston's performance as thrilling and high-risk, suggesting a strong reason to see the show. However, it acknowledges that the rest of the show may not match his level, indicating some reservations. | Gemini: The review praises Cranston's performance highly, but notes that it overshadows the rest of the show. The critic is willing to accept this trade-off, indicating a positive but qualified recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: The critic strongly recommends seeing the show specifically for Cranston's 'wrenching performance,' but explicitly notes that the rest of the production is comparatively 'two-dimensional' and calls the experience a 'trade-off' accepted 'with a sigh,' indicating significant reservations about the overall production despite the exceptional acting.",
