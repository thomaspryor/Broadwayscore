  "bwwExcerpt": "The absolute genius of Ivo van Hove's production is to give this a churning, gripping immediacy, as TV cameras swoop over the action and relay images to a giant screen centre stage and on smaller screens throughout the auditorium. And it is propelled by a searing, shatteringly committed performance from Bryan Cranston, for which he won him an Olivier and Critics' Circle Award in London, bringing the intense, intimate detail of his TV work on Breaking Bad to fill a much bigger canvas.",
