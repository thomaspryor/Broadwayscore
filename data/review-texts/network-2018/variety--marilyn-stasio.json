  "bwwExcerpt": "Bryan Cranston, who could do no wrong as Walter White in 'Breaking Bad' (and a Tony winner for 'All the Way'), burrows deep under the skin of Howard Beale here: the furrowed brow, the anxious angularity, the searching eyes all indicate a person in extremis. But it's the voice that really makes us feel - and fear - for Beale. Beneath the mellifluous tones of Cranston's professional 'newsman' delivery we can hear the agitated rasp and incipient howl of a person who's cracking up.",
