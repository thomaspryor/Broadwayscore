  "bwwExcerpt": "With its continual sensory overload and its darkly vague intimations about populism and corporate power, this Network certainly looks cool. But it’s beyond cool: It’s icy. We seem intended to nod our heads and think about how prescient it all was—the mob appeal of anger, a mention of Saudi Arabia—but then to think no more. Network isn’t galvanizing, it’s numbing: emptily flashy in its condemnation of empty flash, inhuman in its wan defense of humanity. It has a superb TV star and a killer catch phrase, but behind the sound and fury is only a shadow of significance.",

The use of 'powerhouse performance' and 'riveting revival' indicates a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The review highlights a 'powerhouse performance' and calls the revival 'riveting,' indicating a positive assessment. The original rating of 80 aligns with the positive bucket. | Kimi: The critic awards an 80 rating and uses strongly positive language ('powerhouse', 'riveting') to praise both the lead performance and the revival itself, indicating a clear recommendation.",
