  "fullText": "This is no time for bogus expressions of sophistication. So, let's just say: Hooray! With \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,\" the Boy Who Lived has finally come to Broadway, bringing enchantment to a world that could really use a little magic right now.\n\nThe show's savvy producers have done a wonderful job refurbishing the vintage Lyric Theater (circa 1903), both inside and out. The sculpture of a giant black raven's wing hangs over the theater marquee, and the iconic image of a boy crouched in a winged nest can be seen perched on the roof. They should also have spread new pavement out front, because there's going to be a lot of foot traffic on 43rd Street over the next few years.\n\nInside, the walls are painted \"raven plume,\" while a midnight-blue carpet is emblazoned with the Hogwarts crest. How about ravens? You want ravens? Just look up. Ravens! (And how about buying stuff? You want to buy stuff? Check out the lobby.)\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n 'Severance' Editor Reveals the Techniques Used to Craft the Intense Marching Band Season Finale \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Ben Stiller Calls Pat McAfee 'Weird' for Comments About Him, Timothée Chalamet and Spike Lee Attending Knicks Game: 'Seems a Little Anachronistic or Cliche?'\n\nOnce you get past the sensory (and commercial) blandishments and the show begins, it's clear that director John Tiffany and his wizard designers have answered the big question: What can the theater do for the story of Harry Potter that the books and movie treatments haven't done? In a word, the theater has brought its own brand of wizardry to the material. Visually and aurally, the show presents a panorama of dazzling effects that draw audible gasps from the audience.\n\nFor a show that isn’t a musical, the production pulses with action thanks to movement designer Steven Hoggett's inspired work. At King's Cross Station in London, where the show opens, travelers march across the stage in formation, using their suitcases for multiple purposes that feel like coordinated dance moves. Their regimented movements also advance the plot premise of playwright Jack Thorne (based on an original story by J.K. Rowling, Tiffany and Thorne) that the world we are about to enter is a predetermined, immutable reality fixed in time. A bit fascistic, to tell the truth.\n\nAmong the travelers rushing about the station are Harry Potter (all grown up and played with grown-up authority by Jamie Parker) and his wife, Ginny (Poppy Miller). These doting parents are seeing off their son, Albus (a winning performance from Sam Clemmett) as he heads off to his first year of school at Hogwarts. And as he himself was advised almost 20 years ago, Harry tells his son to run straight at a brick wall: \"Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it; that's very important.\" That's only the first scene, and already this show feels wondrous.\n\nAlso at the station seeing off their own child, Rose (Susan Heyward), are Hermione Granger (Noma Dumezweni, who grows and grows in this role) and Ron Weasley (Paul Thornley, just as we’ve pictured him). Once on the Hogwarts Express, Albus meets Scorpius Malfoy (a brilliant Anthony Boyle), son of Harry Potter's archenemy, Draco Malfoy (another classy performance from Alex Price). But unlike — or in spite of — their fathers, these two become fast friends.\n\nAnd now that the stage is set and the principals have been introduced, relax and marvel at the wonders that greet the kids at Hogwarts.\n\nThe story is a brand-new one, but there are plenty of familiar pleasures. The talking portraits, for one thing. There's a wonderful scene in which that long-gone sage, Albus Dumbledore (Edward James Hyland) leans out of his own portrait to speak to Harry. Those alarmingly mobile staircases also play a central role and are even more fun than the ones in the movies, because there's always a chance that someone will go flying around a curve. Best of all, there's a set of bookcases in the Hogwarts library that keep swallowing and spitting out unwary readers.\n\nBut for all its inventive stagecraft devices, the show has a plot that really works as an extension of the Potter saga. You'll remember that young Cedric Diggory was killed in the fourth year of this continuing tale. Here, his father, Amos Diggory (Hyland), who's living at St. Oswald's Home for Old Witches and Wizards, is still grieving for his son. It gives Albus a brave but not so brilliant idea.\n\nIf you want to know what happens next, you'll have to come back for Part 2. But suffice it to say that there's an obsession with time, and especially the yearning to go back in time to correct a person's mistakes, that is central to Rowling's mythology. It also emerges in the dynamic of sons who follow in their fathers' footsteps, repeating, rather than repairing, their past sins — no matter how hard the boys fight for their independence.\n\nThat central theme interlocks with the good-versus-evil dynamic that underpins all seven — and now eight — chapters of Rowling's pop masterpiece. We love the swirling black cloaks and conical hats of the witches and wizards, the shroud-like garments of the Dementors and the marvels of time travel. But most of all, we love seeing theater that shows us the true magic of great storytelling.",

  "garbageFullText": "Read our review of The Heart of Rock and Roll on Broadway, a new musical set to the hit songs of Huey Lewis and the News, at the James Earl Jones Theatre. The Heart of Rock and Roll, the new musical set to the rock hits of Huey Lewis and the News, knows what its audience wants. Forget the power of love: That’s there, but this show is powered end-to-end by ‘80s nostalgia and — to unify those who experienced the ‘80s with those who didn’t — the biceps of Corey Cott. Cott, our lead, opens the show (in a sleeveless jumpsuit) as Bobby, the lead singer of a News-esque rock band giving the audience a concert. As the band teases us with a rockin’ snippet of “Do You Believe In Love,” the setup falls away and that jumpsuit reveals itself not as distressed rock star chic, but Bobby’s uniform for his lowly job at a cardboard manufacturer. The band sure wasn’t paying the bills. Surprisingly, that setting is where the love comes in. The Heart of Rock and Roll follows the trite-and-true rom-com blueprint: Bobby, now determined to become a sales exec, teams up with buttoned-up accountant Cassandra (McKenzie Kurtz, bringing excellent vocal and comedic chops) to land a major client. Spoiler: Sparks fly. Bobby is this show’s version of the hometown hunk who teaches the girl the true meaning of love and family (and finally gets her obnoxious, preppy old boyfriend out of the picture), and she does the same in return. There is a kind of \"HR-approved\" feel to the whole enterprise: Though a return to rock beckons, Bobby is reluctant to lose his place on the corporate ladder. Despite brief suggestions of the contrary — including the brilliantly, satirically staged \"Stuck With You,\" in which Cassandra imagines an unfulfilling life with her old boyfriend (Billy Harrigan Tighe) — the musical largely equates happiness with rather \"traditional\" love and corporate fulfillment, at least as far as the leads are concerned. The pursuit of music is reserved for the side characters and misfits. It’s all more Reagan than rock and roll. Then again, I didn't attend The Heart of Rock and Roll for its politics and I'd wager most people aren't, either. Nor does the show want you to. Your willingness to overlook this and the show's many plot contrivances will likely be proportional to your interest in either or both of the crowd-pleasers named at the start of this review. But I must say, your level of fun likely won’t. I am neither an ‘80s kid nor a person with any outsized interest in Cott’s rugged good looks, but I had a good, old-fashioned great time for 2.5 hours. Director Gordon Greenberg’s production is eager to sweep you up in its bright lights, even brighter costumes, and heart-thumping sound. Why not let it? The Heart of Rock and Roll is still going to be beating around you regardless. The Heart of Rock and Roll kicks off as Bobby, who traded his job as rock-band frontman for a corporate job but gets fired from that job for going over the head of his boss, Chuck Stone (John Dossett), to prove his worth as a high-powered salesman. Turns out, Stone's daughter, Cassandra, wants the same thing — but he doesn't have the rationality, and she doesn't have the charisma. A meeting with a major client (Orville Mendoza plays the founder of Swedish furniture giant \"Idea\") offers them the opportunity to team up and prove themselves. But just as they start to succeed and fall in love, Bobby's band is offered a major touring gig and record deal — and he has a choice to make. Lewis does not appear in The Heart of Rock and Roll, but he provided the pre-recorded voiceover telling audiences to “put away their Rubik’s cubes” (i.e., cell phones) before the show starts. That the mere sound of his voice received immediate, raucous applause is evidence of the strong admiration for Lewis that brought the musical into existence in the first place. The result that emerged is one-third Hallmark movie, one-third rock concert, and one-third '80s music video. When Cott and his band, the Loop, take the stage (composed of actor-musicians Raymond J. Lee, John-Michael Lyles, and rock-vocal MVP F. Michael Haynie), the energy is as electric and fiery as at any stadium concert. Ditto for any time the standout Tamika Lawrence, as HR professional and Bobby's friend Roz, opens her mouth to sing (or speak, for that matter). The show transforms into an '80s music video when the ensemble takes center stage with Lorin Latarro's choreography — Act 2 opens with full-on jazzercise, and three women personify a prized guitar during the sultry \"I Want a New Drug.\" At the time of publication, The Heart of Rock and Roll has an 89% approval rating from audiences on the review aggregator Show-Score.
