The show is a commercial juggernaut, after all, and all things Harry Potter remain a global obsession. Lines form daily outside the new merchandise store on Fifth Avenue.But the producers’ decision to cut the original two-part show down to just one part seemed to suggest that finances were proving trickier on Broadway — despite the show’s acclaim and its best play Tony win. Although they cited the pandemic in the announcement of the new version, the London, Melbourne and Hamburg productions will continue to perform the original version, indicating that the higher costs of Broadway production, and perhaps Americans’ attention spans, might also factor into the decision.

  "dtliExcerpt": "In any case, the immensely cheering if not altogether surprising news is that “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” 2.0 (or do I mean “.5”?) is every bit as rewarding as the original version.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Every bit as rewarding as the original version. My lack of surprise derives from the theatrical expertise, on every level, evinced by the creators of the two-part version...Potterheads may notice where subplots have been trimmed or eliminated, but the many-tentacled narrative remains virtually the same...And the production retains virtually all of the original’s bedazzlements, from wand battles to levitating Dementors, to quicksilver character transformations.\"",
