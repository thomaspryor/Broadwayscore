  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Every bit as rewarding as the original version. My lack of surprise derives from the theatrical expertise, on every level, evinced by the creators of the two-part version...Potterheads may notice where subplots have been trimmed or eliminated, but the many-tentacled narrative remains virtually the same...And the production retains virtually all of the original’s bedazzlements, from wand battles to levitating Dementors, to quicksilver character transformations.\"",
