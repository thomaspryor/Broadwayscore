  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A triumph of theatrical magic...Combines grand storytelling with stagecraft on a scale heretofore unimagined...It is often suspenseful and sometimes downright frightening. Yet amid the cinematic tumult and dazzle of the densely action-packed plot, Thorne and Tiffany carve out quiet scenes of intimacy and tenderness. Great care has gone into creating each moment of this state-of-the-art adventure. It leaves its audience awestruck, spellbound, and deeply satisfied.\"",
