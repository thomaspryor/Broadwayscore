  "bwwExcerpt": "The play - whose story is credited to Rowling, playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany - has an emotional honesty that, like the books, never sinks into sentimentality and guarantees its endurance. At its essence is a story about parents and children, specifically fathers and sons, struggling to connect with a loved one they can't understand.",

However, the lack of full context and the single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious, lower-end Positive score. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the play's emotional honesty and enduring quality, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited text available. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the play's emotional honesty and guarantees its endurance, indicating a strong recommendation, though the single-excerpt format necessitates low confidence.",
