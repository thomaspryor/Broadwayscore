  "bwwExcerpt": "The play - whose story is credited to Rowling, playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany - has an emotional honesty that, like the books, never sinks into sentimentality and guarantees its endurance. At its essence is a story about parents and children, specifically fathers and sons, struggling to connect with a loved one they can't understand.",

However, with only one curated excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively in the lower positive range as this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play's emotional honesty and enduring quality, suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the play's emotional honesty and enduring quality, suggesting a positive overall assessment. However, due to the limited text, a score in the middle of the 'Positive' range is appropriate.",
