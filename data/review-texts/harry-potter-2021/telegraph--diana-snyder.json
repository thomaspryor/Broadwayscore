  "bwwExcerpt": "The play - whose story is credited to Rowling, playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany - has an emotional honesty that, like the books, never sinks into sentimentality and guarantees its endurance. At its essence is a story about parents and children, specifically fathers and sons, struggling to connect with a loved one they can't understand.",

The language indicates enthusiasm and confidence in the play's impact. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights the play's emotional honesty and potential endurance, suggesting a positive experience, but the lack of further details warrants a score in the lower-middle range of the 'Positive' bucket.",
