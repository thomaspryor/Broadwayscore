Hardly are those words out before people react. For\nyears, J. K. Rowling�s creation has inspired adoration and fandom on the\nOlympic scale. But without the depth of a book�s narration, or the tricks and\ntrappings of CGI, can the Potter prestige work on stage? Especially now that\nhe�s a grownup, with kids and problems that the young, feisty Harry never\nimagined? Not to worry. After a somewhat slow start, crammed with exposition, Harry Potter and the\nCursed Child, Parts 1 and 2 will have you in its spell.\n\nCursed\nChild asks\nthe question: if it were possible to turn back time and fix the mistakes of the\npast, would you? Even more important, should you? It also weaves a story about\nfamily, loyalty, and good-vs-evil, played out over a background of unintended\nconsequences.\n\nIn\ncase you know nothing about the wizarding world of Harry Potter, a brief\nsynopsis: a neglected, orphaned English boy finds out that he�s really a\nwizard, and that his parents died saving him from The Dark Lord. He goes to\nwizard school. Years pass; he has friends and adventures. Some of the wrong\npeople die, but eventually, good triumphs, evil is vanquished, and the hero\ngets the girl. You can fill in some of the missing details while you wait for\nthe first act curtain; the Showbill provides synopses of the seven Harry Potter\nbooks, and a �good to know� section.\n\nAs\nalways in Potter-land, the story focuses on young people, but for Cursed\nChild, the older generation gets involved; it wouldn�t be much of a Potter\nstory if Ron (Paul Thornley) and Hermione (Noma Dumezweni) weren�t around. And\nof course, we have Harry himself (Jamie Parker), the most famous wizard in the\nworld, who is now middle aged, fearful, and angry, and his wife, Ginny (Poppy\nMiller).�\n\nSam Clemmett and\nAnthony Boyle����������������� photo credit Matthew� Murphy�\n\nCursed\nChild\nfocuses on one of Harry�s kids, the resentful and insecure Albus (Sam\nClemmett), who�s about to go off to the wizard school, Hogwarts. On the train,\nhe meets Scorpius Malfoy (Anthony Boyle), the son of Harry�s old enemy Draco\nMalfoy (Alex Price). They become best friends at school, and, in true Harry\nPotter style, with the best of intentions, they mess with magic to solve a\nproblem. As they get in too deep, and try to fix it, layer after layer of\nwizard�s magic come into play.\n\n�Noma� Dumezweni, Susan�\nHeyward,� Paul� Thornley,� Olivia� Bond,� Ben� Wheelwright,� Jamie� Parker,�\nPoppy� Miller,� Sam�\nClemmett���������������������������������������������������������������� Photo�\nCredit:� Manuel� Harlan�\n\nThe\nproduction pleads with us to #KeepTheSecrets, so that�s all the plot that can\nbe said without revealing too much. Rest assured, good triumphs and evil is\nvanquished. In addition, wounds heal, families come together, and darkness is\nturned back. With lots and lots of eye-filling magic.\n\nSam� Clemmett,� Brian�\nAbraham� &� Anthony� Boyle�������������������������������� Photo� Credit:�\nMatthew� Murphy�\n\nSome\nof the most breathtaking stagecraft ever made reaches out of the Cursed\nChild proscenium arch, and grabs you in your seat. That�s really the best\npart of the show � the splendid sets (Christine Jones), lighting (Neil Austin),\ncostumes (Katrina Lindsay), sound (Gareth Fry), and in particular, the smashing\nvideo design (Finn Ross and Ash Woodward) and illusions and magic (Jamie\nHarrison).\n\nFor\nthat matter, a transformed Lyric Theatre draws you in to the Potter world from\nmoment one. Clearly, a good chunk of Cursed Child�s reported $68M cost\nwent into the theater itself; it�s simply gorgeous and completely redone in\nPotter-themed d�cor, from the sconces to the carpet to the wallpaper.\n\nEven\na Scrooge-level cynic would be enchanted by this theater, the wonderful design,\nand the terrific theatrical illusions, made to enfold you completely in the\nembrace of J. K. Rowling�s saga. That�s a pretty good place to be, for the five\nhours or so of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts 1 and 2.\n\nHarry\nPotter and the Cursed Child, Parts 1 and 2\n\n214 W 43rd St, New\n York, NY 10036\n\nPerformances:\nWednesday, Saturday, and Sunday: Part 1, 2pm; Part 2, 7:30pm; Thursday, Part 1\n7:30pm; Friday, Part 2, 7:30pm\n\nhttp://harrypotter.ticketmaster.com/",
