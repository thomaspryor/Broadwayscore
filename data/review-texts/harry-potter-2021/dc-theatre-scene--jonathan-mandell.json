  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Whatever the extent of your Potter training, prepare to be dazzled. The special effects are awe-inspiring...The design team works overtime...Add to that some first-rate acting among the 40-member cast...The storytelling that is most satisfying for the less Potter-obsessed are those elements that make 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' feel like the theatrical equivalent of a Young Adult Novel - its exploration of adolescent friendships and father-son relationships.\"",
