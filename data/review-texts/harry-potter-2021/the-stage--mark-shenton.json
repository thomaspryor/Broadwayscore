  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"It remains utterly gripping and entirely original in its own right...Tiffany's urgent, theatrical production is a continuing marvel, boasting absolutely brilliant effects but always remaining foregrounded in the storytelling...At this show's heart is its humanity, and how it poignantly addresses themes of parental legacy, loss and regret. This is why - beyond all the hype...this Broadway production looks sure to replicate the stratospheric success it has enjoyed in the West End.\"",
