    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt describes production elements positively with phrases like 'magic,' 'perfected,' and enthusiastic descriptions of effects. However, with only one curated quote available, this may not represent the full review sentiment, so scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights the impressive and magical production elements, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the lower range of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the positive aspects of the production's illusions and stagecraft, suggesting an enjoyable and worthwhile experience, but the limited text and single excerpt warrant a score in the middle of the positive range.",
