    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Rave | Claude: The phrase 'theatrical tour de force' is extremely strong praise language that typically indicates a must-see recommendation, though confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong, positive language indicating a highly favorable view of the production, suggesting it is a must-see. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language like \"tour de force\" and \"extraordinary,\" indicating a strong recommendation. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the Positive bucket.",
