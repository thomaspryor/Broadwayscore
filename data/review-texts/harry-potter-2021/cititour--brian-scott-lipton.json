Fear not, even in its \"slimmed-down\" one-part version, Jack Thorne's \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,\" a continuation of J.K. Rowling's multi-book saga, still has more than enough swooshing capes, waving wands and pyrotechnic tricks to keep both young ones and older viewers visually entertained.
