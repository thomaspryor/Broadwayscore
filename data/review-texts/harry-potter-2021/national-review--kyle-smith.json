It's like a colossal magic show with a story wrapped around it...The play is a marvel...The character development is thin, the dialogue bland...That isn't the point, though...'The Cursed Child' is a gargantuan entertainment extravaganza...It's not likely to be a gateway to Shakespeare or Ibsen for your children, but it'll surely captivate them.\"",
