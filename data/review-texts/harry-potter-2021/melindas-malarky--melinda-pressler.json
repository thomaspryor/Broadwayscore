  "fullText": "I'm one of the few who knew little of the ongoing Harry Potter phenomenon. Still, I reveled in the splendid British transplant of \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" which received numerous accolades and Olivier's on the London stage. I was fortunate to attend with a friend, an obsessed Potter fan. She provided a sufficient synopsis to bring me in sync with the Harry Potter sagas. Needless, entering the newly renovated Lyric Theater is an immersive magical experience. Many audience members of all ages were adorned in character costumes that sparked an enchanting ambience. The tall Gothic ceiling and Phoenix motif are elegant & bewitching. The astonishing marquee outside has an immense wing morphing from the billboard. It feels as if it may take flight. The play (shown in 2 parts) is an exhilarating escape into a fantasy tale of time travel filled with friendship, family, courage & magic. The ensemble cast was exceptional. The convincing special effects were haunting & surreal; the staging smart & affective. I was transported to a make believe world that came alive. I felt a kinship to the characters and transfixed immersed into this supernatural universe. \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" is an inspiration & celebration of one's imagination.",
