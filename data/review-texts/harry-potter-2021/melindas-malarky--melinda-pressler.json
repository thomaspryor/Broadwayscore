  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Entering the newly renovated Lyric Theater is an immersive magical experience...The play is an exhilarating escape into a fantasy tale of time travel filled with friendship, family, courage and magic. The ensemble cast was exceptional. The convincing special effects were haunting and surreal; the staging smart and effective. I was transported to a make believe world that came alive. I felt a kinship to the characters and transfixed immersed into this supernatural universe.\"",
