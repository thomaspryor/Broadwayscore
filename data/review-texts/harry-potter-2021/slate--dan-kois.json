When it fails, it exposes what's under the tricks: a story that can feel awfully mundane. When it succeeds, that ingenious theatricality can make audiences believe that magic is real...Read the script for the first part, then buy tickets to Part 2, which contains all the production's most wondrous special effects...Skipping Part 1 means you get to miss some painfully clunky exposition.\"",
