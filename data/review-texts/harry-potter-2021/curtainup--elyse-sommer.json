However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language about the stagecraft and illusions, and states the play is 'never boring,' suggesting a positive experience overall. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper range of 'Positive.'",
