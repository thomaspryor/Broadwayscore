The comment that the play is 'long but never boring' further supports a strong recommendation. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language indicates a rave review. | Gemini: The review praises the stagecraft and illusions, and states the play is never boring, suggesting a positive experience, but the lack of a strong recommendation and the mention of length keeps it from being a rave.",
