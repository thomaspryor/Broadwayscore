    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for technical elements and engagement level, but single excerpt limits full assessment of verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the stagecraft and illusions, indicating a positive experience. Despite the warning about text quality, the language suggests an enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language (\"astonishing\", \"breathtaking\", \"never boring\"), suggesting a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring towards the higher end of the \"Positive\" bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strongly positive evaluative language ('astonishing', 'breathtaking', 'never boring'), indicating clear enthusiasm for the production's technical elements and pacing, placing it in the upper range of the Positive bucket per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts.",
