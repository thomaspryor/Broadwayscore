The mention of the play being long but never boring further supports a positive verdict. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language like \"astonishing\" and \"breathtaking\" and states the play is \"never boring\", indicating a strong recommendation despite the limited text.",
