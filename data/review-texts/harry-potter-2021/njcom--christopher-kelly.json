Rowling's masterful series of young adult novels, the new Broadway mega-production \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts One and Two\" is a magnificent treat — both an ingenious continuation of the Potter saga and a complete reinvention of it for an entirely new form. I sat through this two-part, five-and-a-half-hour effort alternately awestruck and giddy, much as — come to think of it — I felt first reading Rowling's books.\n\nBy the end, I would have been perfectly content to watch it carry on for five-and-a-half hours more.\n\nSam Clemmett, Brian Abraham and Anthony Boyle in a scene from \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.\" Photo by Matthew Murphy.\n\nThe producers of this reportedly $68 million show, which originated in 2016 in London and travels here with the seven main members of the original cast, have begged reviewers not to spill any of \"The Cursed Child\"'s secrets, so we'll stick to these (relatively spoiler-free) basics. The story, conceived by Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany and written by Thorne, picks up 19 years after the action of the seventh \"Harry Potter\" novel, with our heroes, Harry (Jamie Parker), Ron (Paul Thornley) and Hermione (Noma Dumezweni) now middle-aged and sending their own children to Hogwarts. Harry's old nemesis, Draco Malfoy (Alex Price), has a teenage child, too — and both his son, Scorpius (Anthony Boyle), and Harry's middle son, Albus (Sam Clemmett), are about to become unlikely allies.\n\nPart of the wonder of \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,\" directed by John Tiffany (\"Once\"), is how much it feels like a Potter novel, with its elaborate plot fueled by magical misdoing, and its mixture of silly humor and surprising pathos. The creative team has done an extraordinary job making room on stage for any number of Potter plot devices, whether Pollywog Potion, the Marauder's Map or Harry's invisibility cloak.\n\nAnd the Broadway translation of some of the book's richest details — the terrifying prison guards known as the dementors, or the oil portraits that sometimes talk — periodically sends gasps of amazement through the audience. The program credits Jamie Harrison with \"Illusions & Magic,\" which I assume is a catch-all for the show's wondrous special effects. Harrison's work — along with set designer Christine Jones, lighting designer Neil Austin, sound designer Gareth Fry and many others — make this one of the most visually majestic, consistently surprising Broadway productions ever mounted.\n\nWhat's most impressive about \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,\" though, is that it functions not as a gimmick or a theme park attraction, but as a genuine play, and a splendid one at that — smart in its plotting, complex in its emotion, probing in its consideration of both middle-aged malaise and adolescent alienation. Tiffany and his company move the story along at a breakneck clip, and never once let the trickery overwhelm the feeling.",
