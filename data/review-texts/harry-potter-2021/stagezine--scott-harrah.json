Rowling, Jack Thorne & John Tiffany Directed by John Tiffany Lyric Theatre 214 West 43rd Street 877-250-2929, https://www.harrypottertheplay.com/\n\nEditor’s Note: The following review is of the original two-part show. The show was condensed into one show in fall 2021.\n\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child: Parts One and Two is a Broadway blockbuster of a different type. It is groundbreaking like Hamilton and Book of Mormon, but as a play, not a musical, and an epic two-part show like Angels in America. It will always be known as the theatrical masterpiece that redefined how high-tech special effects should be done for the stage, but it is not merely a tour de force because of a bag of Broadway magic tricks. This is a classic saga of parents and children and the things in life threatening to tear them apart.\n\nThe show’s total price tag is a reported $68 million, and one knows no expense was spared from the moment upon arriving at the Lyric Theatre, which has been totally renovated to evoke the Harry Potter experience along with the grandeur of venerable British theaters in London.\n\nPlaywright Jack Thorne, director John Tiffany and creative genius J.K. Rowling have beautifully pulled off what might seem like an impossible task. They have taken beloved characters from Ms. Rowling’s popular franchise of books and films and created a stage book that is accessible to everyone, including “Muggles” (like this reviewer) who have never read the books or seen the Hollywood movie adaptations.\n\nOne doesn’t need to know anything about Ms. Rowling’s world of wizards and magic to appreciate, savor and enjoy nearly six hours of superlative acting, innovative special effects that never fail to amaze while propelling the story forward, and this touching tale of Harry Potter (Jamie Parker) as a 37-year-old father to Albus (Sam Clemmett). The saga is less about Harry Potter and more about the expectations and problems his son encounters as well as their complicated relationship.\n\nHarry Potter, now nearing middle age, is married to wife Ginny (Poppy Miller) and working for the Ministry of Magic with old friend Hermione Granger (Noma Dumezweni). The story opens in London’s Kings Cross Station as parents bid farewell to their children about to depart on a train to Hogwarts. Also on the train platform is Harry’s old nemesis Draco Malfoy (Alex Price) and his blond-haired lookalike son Scorpius (Anthony Boyle).\n\nAs Albus enters his first year at Hogwarts, he’s anxious having to follow in his famous father’s footsteps. The crux of the story is the growing friendship between Harry’s son Albus and Draco’s son Scorpius; particularly tricky and troublesome since their fathers were once archenemies.\n\nTo give too much of the plot away would be criminal because the true thrill of both shows is experiencing the myriad surprises, both from the play itself and the mind-blowing special effects. Suffice it to say, movement director Steven Hoggett, set designer Christine Jones, lighting designer Neil Austin, sound designer Gareth Fry, Illusions & Magic designer Jamie Harrison and countless other technical “wizards” transport us through J.K. Rowling’s vivid, imaginative world with characters and creatures that soar through the air with not a wire in sight—and so much more.\n\nUltimately, however, it’s not the technical spectacle of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child that moves audiences (though it’s all magical and a gorgeous visual feast yet is unobtrusive enough to never overshadow the material). Despite all the blazing fires and wild sets, what is truly timeless here and profoundly touching is the ongoing theme. The saga is about the consequences for children when parents are physically and emotionally absent.\n\nDirector John Tiffany (best known on Broadway for the ingenious reimagining of Tennessee Williams’ The Glass Menagerie in 2013 and his Tony Award-winning direction of Once in 2012) extracts exceptional performances from the entire cast. The standouts: Jamie Parker is consistently engaging as Harry, a father who is distraught about everything his son is experiencing. Noma Dumezweni, as Hermione Granger, is sheer perfection, from her imposing presence to her rapid-fire delivery of dialogue. Eclipsing everyone, however, are the two young actors portraying the prodigal sons. Sam Clemmett as Albus Potter never fails to pack an emotional wallop. Anthony Boyle gives the most richly textured and deeply nuanced performance, and he’s a show-stealer every moment he’s on the stage.\n\nEven without all the visual technical filigree, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is worth the expensive (and hard to get) ticket price alone for the elegant dialogue, the seamless scene set-ups and the consummate performances that drive the action to the finish line with a glorious message about good triumphing over evil and the power of love between parents and their children.\n\nEdited by Scott Harrah Published April 30, 2018 Reviewed at April 28, 2018 press performance.\n\n‘HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSED CHILD’: Brian Abraham & company.
