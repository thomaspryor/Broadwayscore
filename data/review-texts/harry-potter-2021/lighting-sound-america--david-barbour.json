Rowling's trademark airtight construction and psychological acuity, which combine to keep us utterly engrossed in this five-hour saga...And yes, there's plenty of stage magic, all of it breathtaking. But Rowling and company have got their priorities straight...character and narrative come first...The best thing about 'The Cursed Child' is that its creators refuse to bombard the audience with unnecessary displays of technology.\"",
