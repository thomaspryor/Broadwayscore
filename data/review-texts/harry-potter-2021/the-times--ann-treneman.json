  "bwwExcerpt": "This play, in two parts and at five hours plus, centres on the perils of childhood, particularly when there is a lack of love. Friendship, loyalty, betrayal, fear, evil. It's all kicking off in Potterland. The pacing is slow but as all Rowling fans know, she won't be hurried. Thankfully, the plot is ingenious, the characters superb and the set by Christine Jones atmospheric. The magic is well beyond abracadabra levels. (Aladdin, playing just a few streets away here, eat your heart out.) The stagecraft is out of this world, literally.",
