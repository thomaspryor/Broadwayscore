However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium, and the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Rave range. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"incredible\" and \"magic,\" indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt and truncated text warning, a more conservative score is appropriate.",
