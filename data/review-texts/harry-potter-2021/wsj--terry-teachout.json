Everyone else should find the plot trite, though there’s always something cool to see onstage, which helps a bit.\"",

The tone suggests a mixed experience with notable strengths and weaknesses. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the trite plot but also mentions the cool special effects, suggesting a mixed experience.

Rowling’s franchise of novels, films and theme parks, which has come to New York after a stupendously successful 2016 opening in London. This two-part, five-hour extravaganza is the most expensive nonmusical production ever to open on Broadway, and every dollar of the $68.5 million ponied up by the producers is visible. The special effects are sensational, especially if you like theatrical “black magic,” and each one was dutifully applauded by the audiences at the previews I saw.\n\nCopyright ©2025 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
