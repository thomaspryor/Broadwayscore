However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium, and the score is conservatively placed toward the middle of the rave range. | Gemini: The phrase \"dazzling spectacle\" suggests a positive experience, indicating a recommendation. Given the limited text and single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the middle of the positive range.",
