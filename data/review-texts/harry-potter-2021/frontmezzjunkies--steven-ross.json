    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong praise ('dazzling spectacle', 'magic') suggests clear positive recommendation, but low confidence due to limited text availability. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('dazzling spectacle', 'magic to life'), suggesting an enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt is strongly positive, calling the show a \"dazzling spectacle\" that \"brings magic to life.\" Given the limited information, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise with superlatives like 'dazzling' and 'magic,' indicating strong enthusiasm for the production. However, as only a single curated quote is available, confidence is reduced due to potential cherry-picking.",
