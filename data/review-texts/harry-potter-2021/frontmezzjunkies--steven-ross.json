However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as 'dazzling spectacle' and 'brings magic to life,' indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the lower end of the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The phrase \"dazzling spectacle that brings magic to life on stage\" is very positive and indicates a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the higher end of the positive range.",
