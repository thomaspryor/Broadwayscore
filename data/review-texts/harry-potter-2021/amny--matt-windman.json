However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review suggests that even those unfamiliar with Harry Potter can enjoy the show, indicating a positive experience, but the single excerpt and smaller outlet size suggest a more conservative score.",
