The magic of the wizarding world is conveyed by a truly amazing combination of choreography, set design, and old-fashioned magic tricks and misdirection. Beyond the core five, other characters from the books and movies appear and make grand entrances. Practically every scene has an Easter Egg for a fan to appreciate.",
