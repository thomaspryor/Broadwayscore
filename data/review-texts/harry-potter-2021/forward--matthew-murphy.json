  "bwwExcerpt": "Now, I don't mean to suggest that \"Cursed Child\" is an Ingmar Bergman movie. It's also a hell of a spectacle, filled with action, humor, and adventure. The magic of the wizarding world is conveyed by a truly amazing combination of choreography, set design, and old-fashioned magic tricks and misdirection. Beyond the core five, other characters from the books and movies appear and make grand entrances. Practically every scene has an Easter Egg for a fan to appreciate.",
