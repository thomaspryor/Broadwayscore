  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"An astonishing thrill ride packed with plentiful twists and turns in a production that marks a triumph of stagecraft and skillfully captures the spirit and sensibility of the series, itself an allegory that finds new resonance amid today's global politics of authoritarianism...Thorne has written the play so that even those who have never read the books can easily follow...Thorne's play excels and adds to the canon best when it delves into the psychological impact of the childhood traumas.\"",
