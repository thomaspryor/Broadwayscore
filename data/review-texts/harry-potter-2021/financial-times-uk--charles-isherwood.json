The production's five-hour-plus expanse flashes by in what seems like half the time.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Rave | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, the language is unmistakably enthusiastic with superlatives like 'thrilling,' 'almost awe-inspiring fluidity,' and claims it could convert even 'Potter-phobes.' The critic praises both artistic merit and technical execution unreservedly. | GPT-4o: The review is highly positive, praising the production's conception, execution, and technical brilliance. The critic describes the play as thrilling, moving, and sophisticated, with a fluid and awe-inspiring direction. The language used indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses highly positive language like \"thoroughly rewarding,\" \"accomplished,\" \"thrilling,\" and \"moving,\" indicating a strong recommendation. The phrase \"Even Potter-phobes could be seduced\" further suggests a broad appeal and positive experience.",
