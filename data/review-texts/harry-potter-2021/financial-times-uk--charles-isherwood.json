  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Thoroughly rewarding and accomplished, both in conception and execution...The play is a thrilling maze of adventures, yes, but it is also a moving and sophisticated exploration of the turbulent tides of adolescence...Even Potter-phobes could be seduced by both the tale itself and the production's technical brilliance...Tiffany...ushers us through the story's convolutions with an almost awe-inspiring fluidity. The production's five-hour-plus expanse flashes by in what seems like half the time.\"",

The critic praises the production's technical brilliance and the director's skill, indicating a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses very positive language, such as \"thoroughly rewarding\", \"accomplished\", and \"thrilling\".
