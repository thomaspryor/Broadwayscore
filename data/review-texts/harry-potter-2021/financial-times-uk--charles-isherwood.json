  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Thoroughly rewarding and accomplished, both in conception and execution...The play is a thrilling maze of adventures, yes, but it is also a moving and sophisticated exploration of the turbulent tides of adolescence...Even Potter-phobes could be seduced by both the tale itself and the production's technical brilliance...Tiffany...ushers us through the story's convolutions with an almost awe-inspiring fluidity. The production's five-hour-plus expanse flashes by in what seems like half the time.\"",

The language used suggests a strong recommendation, indicating a 'Rave' classification. | Gemini: The review uses very positive language such as \"thoroughly rewarding\", \"accomplished\", \"thrilling\", and \"moving\". It also suggests that even those who aren't fans of the source material could be won over.",
