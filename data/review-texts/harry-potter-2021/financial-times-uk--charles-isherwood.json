  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Thoroughly rewarding and accomplished, both in conception and execution...The play is a thrilling maze of adventures, yes, but it is also a moving and sophisticated exploration of the turbulent tides of adolescence...Even Potter-phobes could be seduced by both the tale itself and the production's technical brilliance...Tiffany...ushers us through the story's convolutions with an almost awe-inspiring fluidity. The production's five-hour-plus expanse flashes by in what seems like half the time.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong superlatives throughout ('thrilling', 'awe-inspiring fluidity', 'technical brilliance') with claims that even skeptics would be won over. Time flying by suggests complete engagement. However, single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('thoroughly rewarding', 'thrilling', 'awe-inspiring') indicating a highly favorable review. Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt contains overwhelmingly positive language, including \"thoroughly rewarding and accomplished\", \"thrilling maze\", \"moving and sophisticated\", and \"awe-inspiring fluidity\". Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's technical brilliance, direction, and emotional depth, explicitly recommending it even to those skeptical of the source material. As a single curated quote, the score is capped at the upper end of the Positive range per excerpt guidelines. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
