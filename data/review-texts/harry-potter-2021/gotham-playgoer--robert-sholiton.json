  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"There is a wonderful cast of 40, mostly imported from London, a striking set design by Christine Jones evocatively lit by Neil Austin, terrific movement direction by Steven Hoggett, excellent costumes by Katrina Lindsay and seamless direction by John Tiffany. The illusions and magic by Jamie Harrison are often breathtaking...The problem for me was that I found the plot both convoluted and repetitious. It did not succeed in holding my interested for over five hours.\"",
