Formed in partnership with University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW) NHS Trust, VerIQ will combine Warwick Medical School’s world-leading academic and clinical research expertise, providing an integrated national clinical trial platform that enables faster, higher-quality, and more cost-efficient evaluation of novel medical technologies. “VerIQ harnesses the success and strength of our scientific leadership and showcases the impact that academic–industry collaboration can achieve,” said Dr Tim Hart, Director of Warwick Innovations. “By enabling this new company to commercially leverage Warwick’s existing capabilities and expertise, we can help position the region and UK at the forefront of global Medtech innovation and evidence generation.” The launch of VerIQ supports the UK governments’ ambitions to make the UK the destination of choice for health technology development and evaluation, accelerating the pathway for innovation adoption within the NHS and improving patient outcomes. “When having surgery, our patients want access to the best technology available,” added Warwick Medical School Professor and UHCW orthopaedic surgeon Andy Metcalfe, Chief Medical Officer at VerIQ. “We need to deliver world-class studies that makes the UK the first place to come to for medical innovation. VerIQ will deliver efficient, high-quality medical research to ensure that patients get access to new technologies quickly and safely, improving their care and outcomes.” The spin-out will create an integrated clinical ecosystem that supports Medtech innovators – from early-stage start-ups to established multinational manufacturers – to design, launch, and execute clinical studies with unprecedented speed and scientific rigour. “The UK has the talent, infrastructure, and regulatory framework to lead the world in Medtech innovation,” said Dr Joe Dupere, Chief Executive Officer of VerIQ Limited. “VerIQ Limited will transform proven research excellence into an agile commercial platform, helping to ensure that life-changing technologies reach patients faster, without compromising scientific integrity.” Warwick brings extensive experience in translational research and clinical trial design, supported by strong partnerships with NHS Trusts and national health technology evaluation programmes. Initial work through VerIQ will focus on orthopaedics and wider Medtech trials, combining Warwick’s academic leadership with the new spin-out’s dedicated operational capacity to streamline trial start-up, accelerate participant recruitment, and deliver consistent, high-quality data.
