However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt contains very strong positive language, suggesting a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strongly positive language ('unforgettable', 'magical'), placing it in the upper Positive range (80-84) per instructions for cherry-picked excerpts. Low confidence due to limited text availability.",
