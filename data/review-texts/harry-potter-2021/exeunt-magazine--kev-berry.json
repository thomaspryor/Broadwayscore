Despite the single excerpt warning, the language used is strong enough to suggest a rave review. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"theatrical achievement\" and \"impeccable,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Since it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range.",
