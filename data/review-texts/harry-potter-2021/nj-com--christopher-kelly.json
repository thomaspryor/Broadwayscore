  "bwwExcerpt": "I can't speak for non-fans of all things \"Harry Potter\" (poor souls), but for those of us who treasure J.K. Rowling's masterful series of young adult novels, the new Broadway mega-production \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts One and Two\" is a magnificent treat - both an ingenious continuation of the Potter saga and a complete reinvention of it for an entirely new form. I sat through this two-part, five-and-a-half-hour effort alternately awestruck and giddy, much as - come to think of it - I felt first reading Rowling's books.  By the end, I would have been perfectly content to watch it carry on for five-and-a-half hours more.",
