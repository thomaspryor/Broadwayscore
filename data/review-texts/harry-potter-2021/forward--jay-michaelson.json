The magic of the wizarding world is conveyed by a truly amazing combination of choreography, set design, and old-fashioned magic tricks...Not everything is perfect...But there were many times when I gaped in amazement, choked up, laughed, cheered, and felt the warmth of old friends I thought I'd never see again...A spectacle, but it's also a courageous work of art.\"",
