  "fullText": "ENTERTAIN THISHarry Potter and the Cursed ChildAdd TopicReview: 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' is a massive, sometimes messy masterpieceMaeve McDermottUSA TODAYApril 23, 2018, 3:31 p.m. ETNEW YORK — It’s not hyperbole to say that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is like nothing that’s arrived on Broadway in years. Or maybe ever.\n\nThe show, which opened Sunday at the Lyric Theater, is an unprecedented feat, just by the fact of its existence. In its third week of previews, it became Broadway’s all-time highest-grossing play.\n\nLifted from London’s West End and transported wholesale to Broadway, Cursed Child required the Lyric to be torn down and rebuilt to fit its technical needs. In a spoiler-hungry climate, the show’s #KeepTheSecrets campaign has mostly kept plot details out of the headlines.\n\n'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' hits Broadway\n\nFor fans raised on J.K. Rowling's beloved Harry Potter franchise, Cursed Child will be a revelation. (The script is by Jack Thorne, based on a story by Rowling, Thorne and John Tiffany.)\n\nFor readers who stayed up all night to pore through the brick-sized books, the show’s five-plus-hour run time (over two nights) is only fitting. Our favorite characters (now adults and parents) all show up, and just as in the books, they’re different enough to show they’ve grown over the years, yet are exactly the same in their habits and hearts.\n\nJust as they’re depicted in vivid color through Rowling’s writing, they’re impeccably acted on stage. Jamie Parker delivers profoundly moving moments as Harry Potter, alongside Paul Thornley providing the show’s biggest laughs as a touchingly goofy Ron Weasley, and Noma Dumezweni giving Hermione the force-of-nature depiction that Rowling’s original character deserved.\n\nAnd then, there’s the magic of it all, depicted in visual effects in which even the most jaded audience members, burned out from years of comic-book movies’ eye-popping CGI, will almost certainly find wonder.\n\nIn concept, Cursed Child has a basic enough premise — picking up with Harry, Ron and Hermione as adults sending their kids off to Hogwarts — to welcome newcomers to Rowling’s wizarding world. And while the show is packed with familiar faces from the original books, knowing every detail of the lesser characters’ functions in the original novels isn’t necessary to understand what they’re doing in the play.\n\nBut it sure does help, especially considering that the callbacks to Rowling’s earlier texts add color to Cursed Child’s sometimes-murky plot machinations. From the start, when Cursed Child’s text was published as a stand-in of sorts for a new Potter novel, a main complaint has been the weaker elements of the plot, that the story reads almost like fan fiction, and doesn’t quite stand up to Rowling’s original books.\n\nThese “wait, what?” moments don’t sink the show, but they are annoyingly present, from the more benign scenes in which characters’ motivations don’t quite square up with fans’ understandings of the original novels, to Cursed Child’s most nefarious reveal, which may leave some Potter devotees scratching their heads.\n\nThankfully, Cursed Child is a loving depiction of the rest of Potter’s world, a greatest-hits tour of beloved characters, settings and wizarding wonders, largely told through the eyes of two new characters who more than deserve their place in the Rowling canon: Harry’s son Albus Potter, whose teenage growing pains are brilliantly articulated by 24-year-old Sam Clemmett; and Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Potter’s perennial rival Draco Malfoy, in a scene-stealing performance by 23-year-old Anthony Boyle that proves to be Cursed Child’s most pleasant surprise.\n\nThese two characters are proof of Cursed Child's true success as a Potter sequel, a work that's far more than the theatrical equivalent of the Wizarding World amusement park. Instead, Cursed Child spins the world of Harry Potter forward into a new generation, in a work of theatrical magic that has to be seen to be believed.",
