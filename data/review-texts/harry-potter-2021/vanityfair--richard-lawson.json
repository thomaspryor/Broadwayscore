  "fullText": "The thing I like best about Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which opened on Broadway on Sunday night, might be its title. The eponymous afflicted youth could be so many characters in the play. It could be Harry, now 40 and haunted by trauma and regret. It could be his son, Albus, whose early years at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are spent in the impossible shadow of his famous father. It could be Harry’s former bully, Draco Malfoy, or Draco’s son, Scorpius, with whom the lonely, outcast Albus forms a deep bond. Or the cursed child could be a couple of other people encountered throughout the two-part, five-hour play, names I won’t mention for fear of spoiling.\n\nThe multiple implications of its title may be the most layered aspect of the play, written by Jack Thorne, based on a story by Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling and the production’s director, John Tiffany. The Cursed Child is otherwise a fairly straightforward adventure, with a puzzle-solving structure similar to Rowling’s novels. The play doesn’t deliver the same emotional wallop as Rowling’s books, but I was still followed by a little melancholy murmur as I left the beautifully renovated Lyric Theatre at the end of my many-hour viewing marathon.\n\nA funny little quirk of mine is that I am a longtime, occasionally die-hard Harry Potter fan, a reader and re-reader of the books, watcher of the films whenever they’re on TV (and sometimes when they’re not), and half-proud, Pottermore-certified Hufflepuff. Weirdly, it turns out millions of other people, around the globe, happen to share my same interest in the Potterverse. So The Cursed Child is probably safe in assuming a certain level of familiarity and kinship with not just its main characters—Harry is joined, as ever, by Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley—but a whole roster of names and story lines from across Rowling’s original seven-book sprawl. When I saw the show, the majority of the audience seemed to pick up on the play’s myriad ties and references to the source material, knowing it like we know any other foundational myth.\n\nBut what of the parent or friend or partner who joins a Potter fan at the show, at great cost, and is unfamiliar with the dense, years-spanning narrative? Well, The Cursed Child could be tricky for them, despite the reasonably thorough primer provided in the program. I even worry that people who’ve only watched the films might have trouble with portions of the play, a ritualistic recitation of terms—places, events, bits of wizarding history—that are etched into the brains of readers of the books, but may have whizzed past in the movies. In that sense, The Cursed Child is a tall order, asking people to pay a lot for something that cannot stand on its own. It’s an awfully expensive supplement.\n\nThough, cushioning that reality a great deal is the production’s stagecraft, a ceaseless spell of practical magic, both simple and intricate. Tiffany spares no indulgence as his lavish production unfolds, giving us acrobatic wand fights, polyjuice transformations, flying Dementors, and a stunt involving water that still has me boggled. There’s a giddy bravado to a lot of this stuff, but the play isn’t showing off to show off. Tiffany smartly contextualizes the spectacle, figuring out how to make a live Harry Potter show feel magical in a way that’s unique to the theater. The “what are they going to do next, and how are they going to do it” of it all becomes an integral part of the experience, as much of an adventure as the story itself. The special effects only overwhelm toward the end, when the play has exhausted most of its energy and all the flames and flying starts to feel like a Universal Studios stunt show rather than a full-bodied piece of theater. Mostly, though, The Cursed Child’s wizardry is plucky, thrilling, and well-proportioned.\n\nSurprisingly, many of the show’s fine touches are breathtakingly simple. At first the actors dramatically flourishing their cloaks and capes during scene changes looks a bit silly, until you notice how often they’re doing it to disguise the removal of a bit of the set, a little analog sleight-of-hand trick that adds subtle undertones to the show’s magic. Two rolling staircases are central to the set’s design, and Tiffany finds ingenious ways to use them, articulating new spaces and creating movement and depth. They’re employed particularly effectively in a montage sequence depicting a fractured friendship, the stairs shifting and rearranging as two characters miss and avoid one another. It’s lovely, and involves nothing more complicated than a few stagehands—and Imogen Heap’s lilting, invaluable score.\n\nI’ve been vague on plot thus far because I’ve been asked to keep the secrets of The Cursed Child to myself, and because were I in your shoes I wouldn’t want anything spoiled. Broadly speaking, the play is about fathers and sons, and about the pains of legacy and expectation. Young Albus is quite unlike Harry in many ways, which causes grief for both. The play handles this divide sensitively, unafraid to show Harry being stubborn and, in one scene, cruel as he fumbles his way through fatherhood. It’s a bit alarming to see Harry like this, grown and angry and mulish. But Rowling was always careful to make her characters human, to address their flaws as much as their heroism. Without that crucial grounding, the busy and fantastical plots of the novels, and of The Cursed Child, might spin into incoherency. Maybe no one is going to the play specifically to see Harry Potter wrestle with adulthood and child-rearing, but it’s a necessary part of the equation.\n\nAnd it’s handled quite well by the actor Jamie Parker, who has a Michael Fassbenderian bearing with softer edges. Playing adult Harry Potter in a big Broadway production is sort of a strange thing to do, but Parker fearlessly commits to the task, and finds some graceful notes hidden in the play’s bluster. Sam Clemmett, as Albus, and Anthony Boyle, as Scorpius, are a bit shouty (Boyle especially), but they do have some touching scenes together. I only wish the play was brave enough to act on its obvious subtext. Disappointments to their fathers, ostracized by their classmates, and intensely devoted to one another, the boys are basically living a queer prep-school narrative—A Separate Peace in a world where spells can fix a broken leg. It’s probably safe to explore all that in this post-Dumbledore-is-gay era, and yet the play walks up to the line (there are several scenes that are downright romantic) only to skitter away. Ah, well. Maybe in the sequel.\n\nThough, there likely won’t be need of a sequel for some time. The new, letter-H-patterned carpet at the Lyric suggests that the producers are settling in for a long run, one that’s bound to satisfy audiences young and old (and somewhere in between). Though the script is tinny in parts, and the production often feels rushed despite its luxurious length, those problems are dimmed by the giddy magnificence of its design. And, yes, by the evocative way the play grapples with the past, intertwining itself with the treasured canon, coaxing out of us a heady mix of nostalgia and awe.\n\nThe feeling may be fleeting, and may be harder to come by when you haven’t been given a pair of free press tickets. But I’ve no doubt that many people will be transported by The Cursed Child, a strange son of Rowling’s lucrative universe that ought not disappoint its creators.\n\n“It’s Not So Black and White”: Gisele Bündchen, Self-Professed “Witch of Love,” Talks About It AllBy Michelle Ruiz\n\nErin Morrow Hawley Is Leading the Charge to Ban Abortion Medication.
