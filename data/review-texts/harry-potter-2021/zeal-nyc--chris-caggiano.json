    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Multiple superlatives ('resplendent', 'magic aplenty') and direct praise for story, characters, and production. Claims it improves on source material suggests strong recommendation despite single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the production, describing it as 'resplendent' and highlighting its ability to engage the audience with its characters and story. The positive tone suggests a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the production, story, and characters. The comparison to the films suggests a high level of satisfaction. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the production values ('resplendent,' 'magic aplenty') and story, explicitly calling it superior to the source films. Per the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the upper Positive range.",
