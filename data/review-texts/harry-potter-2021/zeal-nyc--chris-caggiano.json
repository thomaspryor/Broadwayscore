    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Multiple positive descriptors like 'resplendent', 'magic aplenty', and comparing favorably to the films suggest strong recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires conservative scoring within positive range. | GPT-4o: The review is highly positive, praising the production's fluidity, resplendence, and emotional impact. The critic highlights the show's ability to engage the audience with its characters and story, suggesting a strong recommendation. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, but the language used is strongly favorable. | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"fluid,\" \"resplendent,\" and \"magic aplenty,\" indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, the score is placed in the middle of the 'Positive' range.",
