  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Although some critics wrote 'Cursed Child' off as just fan fiction, the play feels very different when seen on stage. Much of that is thanks to Tiffany's brilliant, creative direction and the beautiful work from set designer Christine Jones and lighting designer Neil Austin. Together, they infuse the story with a mix of inventive and exciting stage magic that makes Cursed Child a must-see for Muggles everywhere...It's unlike anything seen on Broadway before.\"",
