  "fullText": "Skip to main contentOctober 4, 2022HomeUncategorizedThe Harry Potter universe includes seven spellbinding books, eight beloved movies, an untold number of T-shirts and mugs and capes—and now one perfect Broadway play.\n\nYou could surely buy a lot of Potter paraphernalia for the cost of a ticket to this show—which is actually two shows that run more than five hours—but then you would miss one of the most extraordinary stage presentations I've ever seen.\n\nWhen you leave the show, you are given a button that says \"Keep the Secrets.\" And I will. Even though the script to Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has already been published (making it essentially the eighth spellbinding book) and sold more than 4.5 million copies in the U.S., seeing it on stage is still a surprise.\n\nOf course there’s magic—I don't think I'm giving away any secrets to say that broomsticks rise into students' hands and spectres descend from on high—and I could never see any strings. (I was sitting in the seventh row and looking really hard, too.) At various times, one character transmogrifies into someone else, wands shoot out fire and people disappear from the stage. It's all right in front of you, not CGI, so you are happy to accept that this is simply—magic.\n\nThe story begins where the last book, Deathly Hallows, ends, with Harry Potter (a terrific Jamie Parker) all grown up and married to Ginny (Poppy Miller). They are with their children at the King's Cross railroad station where the anxious middle son Albus (Sam Clemmett, who looks like a young Matt Damon and is equally talented) is about to board the Hogwarts Express. On the train, he meets Draco Malfoy's son Scorpius (Anthony Boyle, bound to be a big star) and they become friends.\n\nBeing the son of Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, isn't easy for Albus. Caught in adolescent uncertainty, he wants to prove that he can undo one wrong his father caused.\n\nUltimately beyond the gorgeous stagecraft, the intriguing plot twists and the beautiful storytelling, this is a tale about fathers and sons, about friendship, about love and about coming to understand who you are and what you really want to be.\n\nAlbus finds a time-turner and in trying to fix the past, he creates alternate realities, including the one that starts the second play, a scary, dystopian Hogwarts. We also journey to the day that started it all, when Harry was just a baby.\n\nHow Long After Having COVID Are You Actually Protected Against Infection?

Though there may be prophecies and expectations, we can change them. In that way, Cursed Child offers a wonderfully positive message to the young people in the audience. Still, I wouldn’t recommend this for the very young—it is scary at certain parts, and the emotional drama needs a certain amount of sophistication to appreciate, too.\n\nMost of the cast members are based in physical appearance on their predecessors in the movies. Grown-up Harry Potter and Ron Weasley look like—well, grown-up Harry and Ron. Dumbledore and Snape are as you would expect from the movies. Only Hermione is dramatically changed (played by Noma Dumezweni). Broadway audiences often applaud when a famous actor first appears on stage, and this may be the only show I’ve been to where the audience applauded for a character they recognize.\n\nBut the young Potter and Malfoy carry both the day and the play. Albus Potter struggles against his father's legacy and though his adolescent eagerness almost destroys the world, you love and understand him every moment of the way. Similarly Scorpius manages to be both a moonstruck adolescent and a young man who powerfully understands what the world could become if we are not careful and present in our actions.\n\nYou can see this play in either one day, or as I did, in two successive nights. At some point during the second play, I realized that I was so thoroughly engrossed in the play's world that I never expected I would have to leave. I wanted to come back on yet a third night and spend more time with these wonderful characters.\n\nOriginally performed in London, Cursed Child has a precision and clarity in its stagecraft that is rarely matched. Not a gesture on stage is wasted. In one scene, Albus and Scorpius are standing on the top of a moving train shouting as the train spins, and they ultimately walk off into what seems like thin air. It’s all so smooth that even the people moving sets between scenes fling their capes as if making the pieces disappear.\n\nThe Potter universe is so beloved (500 million books have been sold and the movies have made over $7.7 billion worldwide) that to transfer the characters to stage seems almost daring. But nobody who loves this world will be disappointed, and even if you are new to the Potter-verse, you can easily follow the story and be enthralled.\n\nBecause ultimately, this play is about more than Hogwarts magic—it is about our ability to change and love and help each other. It is a reminder that people are more complex than we sometimes know and the good and bad are harder to discern than we think.\n\nThe two-part Potter reportedly cost some $68 million to mount on Broadway, making it the most expensive non-musical ever. But I don’t think the investors have to worry about making back their money.\n\nHarry Potterand the Cursed Child could play forever.",
