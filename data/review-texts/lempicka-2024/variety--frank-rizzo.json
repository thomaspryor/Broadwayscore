  "fullText": "To the list of larger-than-life, survivalist women in musical theater, add Tamara de Lempicka — but with an asterisk.\n\nThe name of the Polish-born portraitist who died in 1980 might not be familiar to many, but you might recognize her paintings. Lempicka’s Art Deco-era images depict lustrous women with self-assured gazes, endowing “the new woman” with a mixture of luminosity and strength that’s at the heart of “Lempicka,” a long-in-development but still uneven musical which finally made it to Broadway following runs at Williamstown Theatre Festival in 2018 and La Jolla Playhouse last year.",
  "bwwExcerpt": "Certainly Eden Espinosa, starring in the title role, brings both luminosity and strength to her powerful performance as the ambitious, visionary and resilient artist known for capturing the women of her day in an aspirational light: perfectly poised, coiffed and seemingly glowing from within. But the musical’s titular character is not so polished. Rather she’s a complicated woman — to a fault. This might not be as much of a concern in a thick biography, but it’s harder to convey successfully in",
