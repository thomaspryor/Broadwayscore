  "fullText": "To the list of larger-than-life, survivalist women in musical theater, add Tamara de Lempicka — but with an asterisk.\n\nThe name of the Polish-born portraitist who died in 1980 might not be familiar to many, but you might recognize her paintings. Lempicka’s Art Deco-era images depict lustrous women with self-assured gazes, endowing “the new woman” with a mixture of luminosity and strength that’s at the heart of “Lempicka,” a long-in-development but still uneven musical which finally made it to Broadway following runs at Williamstown Theatre Festival in 2018 and La Jolla Playhouse last year.",
