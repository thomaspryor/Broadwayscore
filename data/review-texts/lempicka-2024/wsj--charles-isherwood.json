Unhappily, “Lempicka” often seems to be all visible brushstrokes, a neatly constructed but surprisingly conventional show that turns the wild, imperious and wayward woman into a fairly standard-issue heroine, enduring trauma and searching for lasting love while also trying to assert her identity as an artist.",

The overall tone suggests a mixed experience, not strongly recommending or discouraging.",
