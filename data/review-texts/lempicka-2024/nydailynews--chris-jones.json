  "dtliExcerpt": "Frankly, the show would have been far better if it had simply evoked a savvy and brilliant artist in this richest of European eras. Shoving de Lempicka so aggressively through today’s ideological and aesthetic filters, unconscious as the act may be, has the effect of nullifying her singular ambivalence and complexity.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic explicitly states the show would have been 'far better' with different creative choices and criticizes how the production 'nullifies' the subject's complexity, indicating clear disappointment with the execution. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses dissatisfaction with the production's approach, suggesting it undermines the subject's complexity. The tone is clearly negative, indicating a recommendation to skip the show. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses a strong negative sentiment, indicating that the show's attempt to filter the artist through modern ideologies detracts from her complexity, suggesting the reviewer does not recommend the show.",
