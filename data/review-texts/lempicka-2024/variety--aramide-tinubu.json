    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite praising Espinosa's 'powerhouse performance,' the critic dismisses the musical itself as formulaic ('paint-by-numbers affair'). Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the metaphor clearly criticizes the show's lack of artistic depth. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges a strong performance by Espinosa but criticizes the musical as lacking originality and depth, suggesting it is formulaic. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The review praises Espinosa's performance but criticizes the musical as a whole, suggesting a mixed experience. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges Espinosa's powerhouse performance, the 'despite' construction and 'paint-by-numbers' description indicate the show itself is formulaic and unsatisfying, matching patterns of negative reviews where performer praise does not redeem the production.",
