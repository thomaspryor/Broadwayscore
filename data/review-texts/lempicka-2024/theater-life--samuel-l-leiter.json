    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic dismisses the show as pretentious without substance, calling it 'artsy-fartsy' rather than compelling. However, this is only a single excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, describing the show as lacking dramatic or musical impact. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is given with low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt is negative, stating the show is not dramatically or musically compelling. Given this is the only excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production as pretentious and lacking in essential dramatic and musical substance. With only this single curated quote available, the assessment is clearly negative but confidence is low due to the possibility of cherry-picking.",
