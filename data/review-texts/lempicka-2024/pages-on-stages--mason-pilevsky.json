This indicates a mixed review, as it highlights both positive and negative aspects. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a mixed opinion, praising the story but criticizing the music. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise for the narrative but explicitly advises ignoring the music, a major component of the production, suggesting a bifurcated experience that neither fully recommends nor discourages attendance.",
