  "dtliExcerpt": "Frankly, the show would have been far better if it had simply evoked a savvy and brilliant artist in this richest of European eras. Shoving de Lempicka so aggressively through today’s ideological and aesthetic filters, unconscious as the act may be, has the effect of nullifying her singular ambivalence and complexity.",

However, with only one excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the negative range. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the show has potential but is ultimately flawed due to its handling of the subject matter. The critic implies the show's attempt to apply modern filters detracts from the artist's complexity.",
