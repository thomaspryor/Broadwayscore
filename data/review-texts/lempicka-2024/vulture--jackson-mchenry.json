However, with only one excerpt available, this may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, indicating the musical's ambition is not matched by its execution. However, the single excerpt warning means the verdict could be unrepresentative, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a negative assessment, stating the musical fails to achieve its ambitious goals. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers a clear negative verdict criticizing the show as unfocused and lacking substance, failing to deliver on its ambitious thematic goals. With only one excerpt available, confidence is low.",
