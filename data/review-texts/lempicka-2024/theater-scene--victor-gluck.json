    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The phrase 'don't blame the cast' implies the show has problems beyond their control, and 'paper thin characterizations' is a clear criticism of the writing. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view of the show, criticizing the characterizations as 'paper thin' despite the cast's efforts. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the characters are poorly written, suggesting a negative assessment of the show's writing and overall quality. The phrase \"paper thin characterizations\" implies a lack of depth and development, leading to a negative recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the writing as 'paper thin' while noting the cast works hard to overcome weak material—a classic 'good actors, bad script' pattern that indicates a negative overall verdict despite performer praise.",
