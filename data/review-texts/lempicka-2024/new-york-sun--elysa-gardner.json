  "bwwExcerpt": "As Tamara, Eden Espinosa gets to once again use the siren-like belt and the mix of might and vulnerability she deployed during several stints as Elphaba in “Wicked” — this time while sporting a platinum-blonde bob that makes her look like 1990s-era Madonna (a noted Lempicka fan, naturally). Granted, the vocal showcases she is provided by composer Matt Gould and lyricist Carson Kreitzer — who collaborated on the book, brd on Ms. Kreitzer’s concept — are seldom as tuneful as they are flamboyant.",

Single excerpt warning requires caution, and the mixed tone suggests neither strong recommendation nor discouragement. | GPT-4o: The review highlights Eden Espinosa's performance positively but criticizes the music as lacking tunefulness. The mixed signals suggest a neither strongly positive nor negative verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on a positive aspect of the performance, but the caveat about the music being \"seldom as tuneful as they are flamboyant\" suggests some reservations. Given the single excerpt and aggregator context, a lower positive score seems appropriate.",
