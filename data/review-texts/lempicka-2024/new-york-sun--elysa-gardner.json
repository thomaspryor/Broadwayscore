  "bwwExcerpt": "As Tamara, Eden Espinosa gets to once again use the siren-like belt and the mix of might and vulnerability she deployed during several stints as Elphaba in “Wicked” — this time while sporting a platinum-blonde bob that makes her look like 1990s-era Madonna (a noted Lempicka fan, naturally). Granted, the vocal showcases she is provided by composer Matt Gould and lyricist Carson Kreitzer — who collaborated on the book, brd on Ms. Kreitzer’s concept — are seldom as tuneful as they are flamboyant.",

Single excerpt warning and aggregator context suggesting negative verdict requires conservative scoring. | GPT-4o: The review highlights Eden Espinosa's strong performance but notes that the musical numbers are more flamboyant than tuneful, suggesting a mixed impression. The single excerpt and aggregator context suggest a conservative score within the mixed range. | Gemini: The review praises Espinosa's performance but notes the music is not very tuneful. Given the single excerpt and aggregator context, a mixed score seems appropriate.",
