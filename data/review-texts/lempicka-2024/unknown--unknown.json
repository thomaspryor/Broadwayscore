    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Negative | Claude: The descriptors 'aggressively earnest' and 'assertively bombastic' suggest criticism of the show's tone and approach, but with only one curated excerpt available, the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed reaction, highlighting both earnestness and bombast, which can be seen as both positive and negative depending on context. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning necessitate a conservative score within the Mixed range. | Gemini: The description of the musical as \"aggressively earnest and assertively bombastic\" suggests a negative assessment, indicating the reviewer likely does not recommend the show. Given that this is the only excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the negative range.",
