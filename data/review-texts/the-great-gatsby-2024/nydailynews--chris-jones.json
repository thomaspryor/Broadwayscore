  "bwwExcerpt": "That said, this new musical, as penned by Kait Kerrigan with music composed by Jason Howland and lyrics by Nathan Dylan, makes you feel very little, except when Howland’s lush melodies are reaching their climax. Even then, the feelings that flow are more admiration for Howland’s craft than the kind of emotion that flows back into an embrace of story.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“This is an inventive and intriguingly populist new staging of an iconic novel that already has informed all manner of adaptations. Here, it is genuinely hard to tell the actors from the customers, only the elegant design of Vanessa Leuck’s costumes offers a meaningful distinction.”",

The inventive staging is a positive note, but the overall tone lacks strong endorsement. | Gemini: The review describes the staging as \"inventive and intriguingly populist\" but doesn't explicitly recommend or discourage seeing it.
