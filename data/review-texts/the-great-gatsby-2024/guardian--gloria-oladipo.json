I felt the warmth in The Great Gatsby, but it was begging to bring on the heat. Gloria Oladipo, The Guardian: The production splashes in excess, but of the Las Vegas residency kind. Golden-lacquered set pieces and a dizzying projection screen recreate the Gatsby mansion (and a bevy of other locations). The “nouveau riche” mansion isn’t as opulent or lush as one might imagine, feeling closer in spirit to a mega-church. Brian Scott Lipton, Cititour: These errors in judgment are also indicative of who “Gatsby” will work for – and who they won’t. Simply put, if you treasure the novel, don’t come to the theatre. If you’ve never read it (or don’t remember it), you’ll probably be fine.

The mixed nature and significant reservations place it in the lower mixed range. | GPT-4o: The review highlights significant issues with the production, particularly its failure to capture the essence of the original story and its excessive, yet ineffective, set design. The advice against attending if one values the novel suggests a negative recommendation. | Gemini: The review suggests the production is flawed and doesn't capture the essence of the novel, but it might be enjoyable for those unfamiliar with the source material, indicating a mixed recommendation.",
