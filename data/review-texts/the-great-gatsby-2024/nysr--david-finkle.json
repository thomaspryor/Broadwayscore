For some real resonance and depth, though, you may just have to wait a while—or reread the book. David Finkle, New York Stage Review: This musical take on The Great Gatsby presents Jay Gatsby and Daisy Fay Buchanan as a sympathetic couple caught in unfortunate Jazz Age circumstances. In other words, the transfiguration of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby is, sorry to report, a travesty. Caroline Cao, New York Theatre Guide: All in all, this Great Gatsby shies away from making us think hard of the blood spilled due to Gatsby’s dealings, which are relegated to lines of dialogue and the campy song “Shady.” Something about the production feels too spic and span by the time it ends: Missing is a mess left behind by the Roaring Twenties excess.

The term 'travesty' suggests significant dissatisfaction, aligning with a negative verdict. | Gemini: The review suggests the show is a spectacle but lacks depth. The critic's rating of 2/5 stars also indicates a mixed to negative sentiment, but the presence of 'spectacle' suggests some redeeming qualities.",
