  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The gathering’s raison d’etre is a theatrical experience—called ‘The Great Gatsby-The Immersive Show.’ Sadly, it pains me to report that director-adaptor Alexander Wright has done less-than-full justice to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic American novel—and that no amount of atmosphere changes that central fact.”",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic explicitly states it 'pains' them to report the negative assessment and says the production does 'less-than-full justice' to the source material. However, given this is only one excerpt and could be cherry-picked, I'm scoring conservatively within the negative range. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses disappointment that the production does not do justice to the source material, suggesting it fails to meet expectations. The language indicates a negative assessment, but the single excerpt limits full context, warranting a mid-range score within the Negative bucket. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the director's adaptation does not do justice to the novel, indicating a negative assessment of the show itself. The phrase 'it pains me to report' further emphasizes the disappointment.",
