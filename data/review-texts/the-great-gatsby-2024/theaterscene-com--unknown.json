  "fullText": "Editor : Jeannie Lieberman | \n    Submit an Article | \n    Contact Us\n\nJeremy Jordan, Eva Noblezada (Photo: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman)\n\nDirected\nby Marc Bruni, a musical adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's landmark novel The\nGreat Gatsby comes to Broadway this season with all the glitz and glamor of\nthe Roaring Twenties.� Following its sold-out world premiere at the Paper Mill\nPlayhouse in Millburn, N.J. last fall, this musical extravaganza winged into\nthe Big Apple in late April, landing at the capacious Broadway Theatre.\n\nThe\ngood news is that it's a visually stunning production, a veritable feast for\nthe eyes.� The not-so-good news is that the book by Kait Kerrigan doesn't have\nthe connective tissue that would allow the audience to know just who is telling\nthe story throughout. Although the character Nick Carraway is the designated\nnarrator in Fitzgerald's work, and Kerrigan at first seems to replicate this\nframing device, she intermittently shoehorns in other principals to shed light\non the titular character.\n\nSet\nin the fictive Long Island town of West Egg, The Great Gatsby is the\nstory of a mysterious millionaire, Jay Gatsby, who tries to regain the lost\nlove of his youth, Daisy Buchanan, a product of old money and now married to\nthe wealthy Tom Buchanan, a former polo player and shameless philanderer.� Gatsby,\nwell-known for hosting Dionysian parties at his opulent mansion, scarcely\nenjoys his own entertainments. Ever hopeful that he can relive the past, he devises\na plot, in which Daisy's cousin, Nick Carraway, a bond salesman on Wall Street\nand his next-door neighbor, arranges to bring Daisy and Gatsby together for an\nafternoon tea at his cottage. Tragedy ensues.\n\nLed by Jeremy Jordan as Jay Gatsby and Eva Noblezada as Daisy\nBuchanan, John Zdrojeski completes the m�nage � trois as Tom Buchanan. The\nother five principals entangled in this story of excess include Noah J.\nRicketts as transplanted Mid-westerner Nick Carraway, Samantha Pauly as golf\npro Jordan Baker, Sarah Chase as Tom's girl Myrtle Wilson, Paul Whitty as her\njealous husband George Wilson, and Eric Anderson as underworld figure Meyer\nWolfsheim. �\n\nAdd the supporting cast, ensemble, and additional party-goers, and\nyou witness 28 performers crossing the boards during this two and a half hour\nshow. Indeed, this production mostly succeeds in replicating\nFitzgerald's seminal novel, capturing the grandeur that the author so artfully imbedded\nin his 1925 work.\n\nJeremy Jordan, Noah J. Ricketts (Photo: Matthew Murphy and Evan\nZimmerman)\n\nThe\naction unspools on Paul Tate Depoo III's dream of a set that boldly blends Art\nNouveau with industrialism.� It boasts 50 set changes, with the audience able\nto see such jaw-dropping spectacles as a faux willow tree consisting of 3.600\nshimmering gold chains, a bandstand platform that accommodates 9 musicians, the\nfateful pool with railings that pop up from the orchestra pit, not to mention\nthe visual projections that are superimposed on every available surface on\nstage. Little wonder Depoo garnered the Outer Critics Circle Award for Set\nDesign.\n\nIf\nthe set design is impressive, Linda Cho's costumes complement it with the\nsartorial splendor of the Jazz Age.� With 350 outfits to grace the cast, Cho\nensures that each one enhances the uniqueness of the character or adds to the\nambience of any given scene. Whether it's Gatsby's distinctive suits, Daisy's\nchic dresses and elegant hats, or the sea of flapper dresses worn by the guests\nat Gatsby's parties, Cho's choices are right on the money. And, oh yes. Cho\nalso got tapped for an Outer Critics Circle Award for Costume Design.\n\nDominique\nKelley doesn't disappoint with his choreography.� It looks back to the twenties\nbut clearly resonates with today's cultural moment. He has dances of almost\nevery stripe in this show: jazz, tap, ballroom, street, and more. But no matter\nfrom what angle you view his choreography, it inevitably expresses freedom. For\nno matter how furiously the dancers shimmy and whirl, they never touch or try to\ncontain their partner in an embrace (except in the ballroom dance numbers).\n\nOf\ncourse, a musical isn't a musical unless it has music. Jason Howland (score)\nand Nathan Tysen (lyrics) make sure that The Great Gatsby has plenty of\nit. They have crafted 18 songs that include the jazzy opening number \"Roaring\nOn,\" sung by Ricketts, as Nick Carraway, with the company.� A more reflective\nduet \"My Green Light,\" sung by Jordan and Noblezada, poignantly closes out Act\n1. Then in Act 2, Noblezada, as Daisy, brings much pathos to \"Beautiful Little Fool,\"\na song inspired by the iconic words in Fitzgerald's novel. Or as Noblezada\ncroons it, with her sterling pipes: \"The best thing a girl can be in this world/Is\na beautiful little fool.\" �\n\nThe\nacting is excellent.� Jeremy Jordan, in the titular role, and Eva Noblezada, as\nDaisy, are the true standouts. That said, a shout out belongs to Paul Whitty\nwho acquits himself well in the unenviable part of the Valley of Ashes' car\nmechanic George Wilson.\n\nNoah J. Ricketts and the Ensemble (Photo: Matthew Murphy and Evan\nZimmerman)\n\nIndeed,\nThe Great Gatsby arrives with a flawed book on the Great White Way. But theatergoers\nwho hunger to see a live musical staging of Fitzgerald's 1925 masterpiece with an\neye-popping set, exquisite period costumes, and a first-rate cast who can sing,\nthis is your golden opportunity.�\n\nFor more information, visit www.broadwaygatsby.com.\n\nRunning time: 2 hours; 30 minutes with intermission.",
