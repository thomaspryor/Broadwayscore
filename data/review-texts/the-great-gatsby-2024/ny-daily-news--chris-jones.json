  "showScoreExcerpt": "“This is an inventive and intriguingly populist new staging of an iconic novel that already has informed all manner of adaptations. Here, it is genuinely hard to tell the actors from the customers, only the elegant design of Vanessa Leuck’s costumes offers a meaningful distinction.”",
