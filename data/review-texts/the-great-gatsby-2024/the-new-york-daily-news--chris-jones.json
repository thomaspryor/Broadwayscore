  "bwwExcerpt": "That said, this new musical, as penned by Kait Kerrigan with music composed by Jason Howland and lyrics by Nathan Dylan, makes you feel very little, except when Howland’s lush melodies are reaching their climax. Even then, the feelings that flow are more admiration for Howland’s craft than the kind of emotion that flows back into an embrace of story.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "“This is an inventive and intriguingly populist new staging of an iconic novel that already has informed all manner of adaptations. Here, it is genuinely hard to tell the actors from the customers, only the elegant design of Vanessa Leuck’s costumes offers a meaningful distinction.”",
