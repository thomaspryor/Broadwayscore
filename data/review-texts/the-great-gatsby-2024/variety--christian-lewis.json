  "fullText": "F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel “The Great Gatsby,” which captured the roaring twenties with shocking clarity, is a staple of high school curricula and has been immortalized in two famous film adaptations (in 1974 by Richard Clayton and in 2013 by Baz Lurhman). It's most remembered for the titular character's lavish parties, though as any good reader of the novel will tell you, the party's are all razzle dazzle — what really matters is what's underneath. The pain, the social climbing, the lack of ethics, and the post-war, orgiastic egoism are what the work is really about.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "For any fan of “The Great Gatsby,” though, it’s likely you’ll have moments of wanting more, of missing out on all the subtext, grit, and suffering beneath the sequins. Right as you have that pang, you’ll probably get distracted by another sweeping set change or production number, and as the opening and closing song playfully depict, the party will just keep rolling on and on and on, so you might as well join in and enjoy the ride.",
