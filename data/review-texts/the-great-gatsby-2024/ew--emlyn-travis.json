    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review explicitly divides audiences - some will be satisfied, others will feel adrift. This creates a mixed recommendation dependent on audience expectations, placing it in the middle of the mixed range. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the production delivers on surface-level entertainment but lacks depth for those seeking a more profound exploration of the novel's themes. This indicates a mixed reception, satisfying some but not all audiences. | Gemini: The review suggests that the show will satisfy some viewers but disappoint others, indicating a mixed reception. The single excerpt and aggregator verdict of 'Flat' further support this classification.",
