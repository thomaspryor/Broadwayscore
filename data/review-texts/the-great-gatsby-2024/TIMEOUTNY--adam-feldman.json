  "bwwExcerpt": "century on, retellers of his story, like his hordes of party guests, remain distracted by the spectacle. Here, Bruni and his designers lean into the roaring garishness almost to the point of cartoon. Adam Feldman, Time Out New York: The Great Gatsby looks great. If you want production values, this adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1925 novel, directed by Marc Bruni, delivers more than any other new musical of the overstuffed Broadway season. It’s the Roaring Twenties, after all—now as well as then—so why not be loud? Let other shows make do with skeletal, functional multipurpose scenic design; these sets and projections, by Paul Tate de Poo III, offer grandly scaled Art Deco instead. Linda Cho’s costumes are Vegas shiny for the party people and elegant for the monied types. The production wears excess on its sleeveless flapper dresses. Naveen Kumar, The Washington Post: This revisionary attempt to turn “The Great Gatsby” into a clown car of passionate entanglements skids off the road",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "“ ‘The Great Gatsby’ can be an entertaining night out on the town if you think of it less as a play and more as a night of dress-up...The beat goes on for those who ride the show’s current, eager to be borne back into the past.”",
