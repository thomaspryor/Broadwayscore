  "bwwExcerpt": "The musical, a patchwork quilt of discordant styles that belongs in a box, becomes the latest in a long line of adaptions of this beloved novel to mess up a story that’s far more satisfying to read and imagine. It completely misses its intoxicating atmosphere, meaning and layered characters. One of the rare smart decisions of the night is the casting of Noah J. Ricketts as our man Nick Carraway, a modest Midwesterner who moves to a Long Island cottage in “new money” West Egg.",
