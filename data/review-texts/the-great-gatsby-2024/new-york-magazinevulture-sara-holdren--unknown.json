  "fullText": "Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\n\nPhoto: Evan Zimmerman This review was published on April 25, 2024. At the 77th Tony Awards, The Great Gatsby won for Best Costume Design in a Musical.\n\nHere’s a low-level cosmic injustice: Fifteen years ago, Elevator Repair Service had to pay royalties to create its unforgettable opus Gatz out of (every word of) F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, but thanks to the novel’s entry into the public domain in 2021, the two Broadway Gatsbys that we’ll see this year got it for free. I’m all for the commons, but the point — as Fitzgerald knew and his narrator Nick Carraway learns to his cost — is that the high rollers never have to pay. Nick says as much to his cousin, the languid, sparkling, willingly caged bird Daisy Buchanan, as 2024’s first new musical of The Great Gatsby (with music by Jason Howland, lyrics by Nathan Tysen, and book by Kait Kerrigan) draws to a close. “​​You and Tom smash up things and creatures,” he tells her, angry tears in his eyes, “and then — you retreat back into your money or carelessness or whatever it is that keeps you two together.” Here and throughout, Kerrigan’s book sticks close to Fitzgerald’s — but sentences are one thing. Spirit is another.\n\nUnder Marc Bruni’s jazz-hands-happy direction, this Gatsby feels like it belongs on a cruise or in a theme park. It would make a good fit if Epcot’s pavilions expanded to include time periods as well as countries. Poor James Gatz, victim of his own disguise.\n\nShow \n 4 Comments / 4 New\n \n Comment\n \n\n Old Sport, New Tricks?
