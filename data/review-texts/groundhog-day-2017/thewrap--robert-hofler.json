  "fullText": "Need an antidote to the saccharine good-time, small-town vibe of “Come From Away”? You’ll find it in the inventive, acerbic, and thoroughly irreverent “Groundhog Day,” which opened Monday at the August Wilson Theatre.\n\nOriginal “Groundhog Day” screenwriter Danny Rubin, with much help from songwriter Tim Minchin and director Matthew Warchus, has successfully transferred his 1993 movie comedy to the musical stage; and in the process, taken even more swipes at the vapid, rodent-obsessed inhabitants of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Minchin and Warchus, being British and Australian, might have something to do with the show's overall anti-Americana flair. They also bring a nice Dickensian touch to the story. Like Ebenezer Scrooge, weatherman Phil Conners learns to be a human being during the course of 'Groundhog Day' without ever getting overly mushy about his transformation.The story of 'Groundhog Day' plays so well on stage because it reflects the dilemma of its performers. Whereas movie actors do a few takes and are done with it, the cast of any successful musical is fated to keep repeating itself for hundreds, if not thousands, of performances. 'Groundhog Day' mines that existential problem.",
