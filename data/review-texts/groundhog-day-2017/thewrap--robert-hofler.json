  "fullText": "Need an antidote to the saccharine good-time, small-town vibe of “Come From Away”? You’ll find it in the inventive, acerbic, and thoroughly irreverent “Groundhog Day,” which opened Monday at the August Wilson Theatre.\n\nOriginal “Groundhog Day” screenwriter Danny Rubin, with much help from songwriter Tim Minchin and director Matthew Warchus, has successfully transferred his 1993 movie comedy to the musical stage; and in the process, taken even more swipes at the vapid, rodent-obsessed inhabitants of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.",
