  "bwwExcerpt": "Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it's practiced by Andy Karl in 'Groundhog Day,' the dizzyingly witty new musical from the creators of 'Matilda.' Portraying a man doomed to relive a single day over and over and over again in a small town that becomes his custom-fitted purgatory, Mr. Karl is so outrageously inventive in ringing changes on the same old, same old, that you can't wait for another (almost identical) day to dawn.",
