  "bwwExcerpt": "Coming off of a well-received run in London at the Old Vic, Groundhog Day - with a book by the original film's screenwriter Danny Rubin, music and lyrics by Tim Minchin (Matilda the Musical), and direction by Matthew Warchus (also Matilda as well as The Norman Conquests and God of Carnage) - doesn't mess too much with that set-up. Why would anyone bother? It's jeweler precise after all. Instead, it gooses up the familiar with dazzling energy, creativity, wit, and heart. Besides Karl, much of the credit goes to the playful stage design and illusions by Rob Howell with Paul Kieve, and the whirling-dervish choreography of Peter Darling with Ellen Kane. At times, Groundhog Day feels more like a plate-spinning magic trick than a Broadway musical.",

Thankfully, they do...Manages to hold onto everything that made Ramis’ movie such a classic and adds songs bound to become nearly as memorable.\"\n\nRead more"
