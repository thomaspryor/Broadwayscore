  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Andy Karl’s magnetism elevates this decent and sugary musical adaptation of the celebrated film...A mildly entertaining production...Tim Minchin’s score is a pleasant blend of jazzy, pop and Country & Western music, but his lyrics are rudimentary...The talented ensemble all depicts their cartoony roles with excellent characterizations, but no one really makes much of an impact...This treatment of the original work is adeptly presented but it’s lacking in emotional resonance.\"\n\nRead more",
