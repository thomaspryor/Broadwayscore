  "bwwExcerpt": "The creators of 'Matilda' have worked their magic all over again. And again. 'Groundhog Day,' now open at the August Wilson Theatre, is a textured, twisted and ticklish comic musical from composer Tim Minchin and director Matthew Warchus. The book is by Danny Rubin, who also co-wrote the screenplay to the 1993 film starring Bill Murray. With a cast led by Andy Karl, as the cynical TV weatherman stuck in a time warp, 'Groundhog Day' shares with 'Matilda' both an intriguing darkness and enough on-stage razzle-dazzle to seize your attention and hold it across two generally gut-busting acts.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with 'worked their magic,' 'textured, twisted and ticklish,' and 'gut-busting acts.' Single excerpt warning suggests this is cherry-picked positive content, so scoring in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show with terms like 'textured, twisted and ticklish comic musical' and 'razzle-dazzle,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the creators of 'Matilda' have worked their magic again, calling the show \"textured, twisted and ticklish\" and noting its ability to seize and hold attention. This indicates a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise, comparing the show favorably to the creators' previous hit 'Matilda' and describing it as 'textured, twisted and ticklish' with 'gut-busting' acts, indicating an enthusiastic recommendation despite limited text availability.",
