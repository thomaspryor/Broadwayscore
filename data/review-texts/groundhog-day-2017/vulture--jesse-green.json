However, the brevity of the review limits the confidence level. | Gemini: The review states that the musical is a \"surprisingly successful adaptation\", which indicates a positive recommendation, but the word \"surprisingly\" suggests some reservations. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as 'surprisingly successful' and praises it for finding 'new emotional depths,' indicating a clear recommendation.
