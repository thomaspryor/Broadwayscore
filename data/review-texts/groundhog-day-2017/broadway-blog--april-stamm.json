  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"With vivacious energy, a lot of cockeyed optimistic humor, and a surprisingly poignant moment or two, 'Groundhog Day' pays out at least 70 percent on your big investment...The music is mostly forgettable...However, lyrically and conceptually Tim Minchin’s score strikes some interesting chords...Andy Karl steals the show...The musical is warm, funny, and quirky.
