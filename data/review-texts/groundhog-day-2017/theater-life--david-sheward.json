  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Exhilarating...‘Groundhog Day’ combines an innovative premise with a fresh, eclectic score influenced by many genres…Andy Karl rockets into the stratosphere in ‘Groundhog Day’…He’s equally credible and fun as a snide lout, a drunken lech, or a budding humanitarian, plus his vocals and physical movement skills are top-notch. The surrounding production, inventively staged by Matthew Warchus, is a feast of the imagination.”\n\nRead more",
