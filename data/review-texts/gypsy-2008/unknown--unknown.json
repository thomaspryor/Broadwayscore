    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performance ('stupendously affecting') but qualified assessment of the show overall ('a bit intermittently'). Single excerpt warning applies - this positive language suggests upper end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises McDonald's performance as 'stupendously affecting', suggesting a positive view of her role. However, it notes the show is only 'intermittently' affecting, indicating some reservations. Given the single excerpt and potential cherry-picking, the score is on the lower end of Positive. | Gemini: The review praises the lead performance highly but notes the show is \"a bit intermittently\" good, suggesting a qualified recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise for McDonald ('stupendously affecting') while qualifying that the show itself works only intermittently, suggesting a solid positive recommendation primarily for the star performance rather than the full production.",
