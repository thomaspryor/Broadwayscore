    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Single sentence praising LuPone's performance as exceptional, but lacks evaluation of the overall production. Confidence low due to extremely truncated text. | GPT-4o: The review offers high praise for Patti LuPone's performance, describing it as one of the most powerful in years, which suggests a strong recommendation to see the show. | Gemini: The review contains high praise for Patti LuPone's performance, calling it one of the most powerful on Broadway in years, which indicates a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs superlative language ('force of nature,' 'most powerful performances... in years') indicating unqualified enthusiasm for the lead performance. Confidence is low due to the brevity of the excerpt, which may not reflect the full review's assessment of other production elements. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
