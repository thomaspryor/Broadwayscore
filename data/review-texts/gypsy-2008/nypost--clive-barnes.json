However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"powerhouse performance\" and \"crackles with energy and emotion,\" indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers strong praise for both the lead performance and production energy, indicating clear recommendation, but limited context warrants reduced confidence.",
