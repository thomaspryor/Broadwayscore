However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, indicating this may not fully represent the review's overall sentiment. | Gemini: The single quote is positive, but without more context, it's hard to gauge the overall strength of the recommendation. I'm placing it in the lower end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strongly positive language ('a force') indicating praise for a central performance, but the extremely limited context warrants low confidence and a score at the lower end of the clearly-positive range.",
