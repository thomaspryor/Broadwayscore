  "bwwExcerpt": "What the production does give us is a trenchant, powerful lead performance from LaChanze as Wiletta Mayer, a veteran actor rehearsing a play about racism written and directed by White men. The gravitas, lived experience, and magisterial presence she brings to the role is worth the ticket price alone, and makes a fantastic case for an immediate revival of Gypsy. Looking gorgeous in Emilio Sosa's elegant costumes, she is unfussy and relaxed while still delivering Childress' critiques with the laser-sharp precision of a woman with decades of experience in the business.",
