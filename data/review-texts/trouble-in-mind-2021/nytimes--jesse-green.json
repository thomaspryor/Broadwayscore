  "bwwExcerpt": "For sheer crackling timeliness, the play most of the moment is in fact the oldest: Alice Childress's 'Trouble in Mind,' which opened on Thursday at the American Airlines Theater. Originally produced in 1955 in Greenwich Village, but derailed on its path to becoming the first play by a Black woman to reach Broadway - a distinction that went to Lorraine Hansberry's 'A Raisin in the Sun' four years later - it is only now getting the mainstream attention it deserves, in a Roundabout Theater Company production that does justice to its complexity.",
