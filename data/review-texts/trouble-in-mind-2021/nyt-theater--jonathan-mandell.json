  "bwwExcerpt": "There are a total of nine actors in 'Trouble in Mind,' the size of the cast one of the signs of a play written years ago. If a few of the characters come to feel extraneous, and some of the scenes feel like filter, the actors each have at least one scene where they are put to good use. Brandon Micheal Hall portrays John Nevis, a brash young Black newcomer to acting, which gives the playwright an opportunity to impart her hard gained wisdom about dealing with the white people in charge of show business: 'White folks can't stand unhappy Negroes... so laugh, laugh when it ain't funny at all.' John generally ignores her advice, thinking she's behind the times, and starts sounding just as glad-handing and fatuous as Al Manners. Chuck Cooper, a standout as usually, portrays Sheldon, a Black actor who has learned the lesson of accommodation too well. But there's one arresting moment when Manners is urging the cast to express more fear. 'I'm not asking you to dream up some fantastic horror... it's a lynching. We've never actually seen such a thing, thank God... but allow your imagination to soar, to take hold of it... think.' Sheldon speaks up and says he has, in fact, seen a lynching.",
