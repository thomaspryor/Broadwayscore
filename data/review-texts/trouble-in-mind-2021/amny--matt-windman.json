  "bwwExcerpt": "'Trouble in Mind' is worth seeing, as it speaks directly to current concerns in the theater industry over institutional and unconscious racism, as seen in the depictions of Black characters (which has led to recent revisions in shows such as 'The Book of Mormon' and 'To Kill a Mockingbird') and the handling of disagreements (which has led to the hiring of directors of diversity, equity, and inclusion). 'Trouble in Mind' may have waited 65 years to come to Broadway, but it is remarkably on point and on time.",
