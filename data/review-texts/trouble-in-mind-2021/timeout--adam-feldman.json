  "bwwExcerpt": "Trouble in Mind puts its main spotlight on LaChanze, who holds the whole play firmly in hand. She is this production's other revelation: Although she has played serious roles in musicals over the course of her 35-year career, this is the first time she has had the lead in a Broadway play. 'I want to be an actress,' says Wiletta. 'Hell, I'm gonna be one, you hear me?' An actress LaChanze proves herself to be, and not just when she's singing, and a hell of a good one at that.",
