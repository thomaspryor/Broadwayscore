  "bwwExcerpt": "The show is stocked with hugely capable actors, including Michael Zegen (as the imperious director), Jessica Frances Dukes, Don Stephenson, Danielle Campbell, Brandon Micheal Hall, Simon Jones, Alex Mickiewicz and Chuck Cooper, but many seem led toward extremes. The show feels conceived as a star vehicle for LaChanze, an enigmatic performer in every way, but this is an ensemble piece. And I suspect LaChanze, powerful as her performance can be, would have preferred it stayed that way",
