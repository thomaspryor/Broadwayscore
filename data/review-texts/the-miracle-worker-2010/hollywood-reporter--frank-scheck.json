Single excerpt warning applies - this may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates an 'uneven' production but acknowledges the 'emotional impact' still comes through. The single excerpt and lack of full context suggest a mixed review with some positive elements. | Gemini: The review uses the word \"uneven,\" which indicates a mixed reaction. The emotional impact still coming through suggests it's not entirely negative. | Kimi: While the critic notes the production is 'uneven,' the emphasis on the story's emotional power remaining effective indicates a qualified recommendation rather than a dismissal.",
