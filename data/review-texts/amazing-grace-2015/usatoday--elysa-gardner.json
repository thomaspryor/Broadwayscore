  "bwwExcerpt": "Sneer if you must, but it could be argued that in 2015, on Broadway, it's more irreverent to promote such beliefs than it is to satirize their practice. The much-celebrated Hand to God uses a demonic sock puppet to send up rigid distinctions between good and evil in a Christian community. And at last check, The Book of Mormon wasn't having any trouble selling tickets. If Grace has the courage of its convictions, it shows less daring, and little invention, as a creative work. With its mostly generic, sometimes bombastic score and stilted dialogue, this account of the pre-American Revolution U.K. can recall some of the more hot-air-filled musicals that invaded us from abroad (and some homegrown ones) in the '80s and '90s.",
