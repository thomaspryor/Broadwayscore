  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Unfortunately, while aspects of Newton’s tale are indeed noteworthy, maybe even amazing, the musical itself unfolds as an overstuffed history lesson trimmed in melodrama, with a standard-issue romantic subplot and some dutiful attempts to explore the lives of the slaves... 'Amazing Grace,' thick with such moralizing, naturally concludes on a note of uplift, or rather many notes of uplift: a choral singing of the title song... The song is simple, beautiful, immortal; the musical, not so much.\"\n\nRead more",

The positive note about the song contrasts with the overall negative tone towards the musical itself. | Gemini: The review praises the song \"Amazing Grace\" but finds the musical itself to be an \"overstuffed history lesson trimmed in melodrama\" and \"not so much\". | Kimi: While acknowledging the noteworthy subject matter, the critic dismisses the musical as an overstuffed, melodramatic history lesson that fails to match the power of its titular hymn, delivering a clear verdict against seeing the show.",
