Strong praise despite being only an excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as an 'inspirational powerhouse' and a 'family classic in the making', suggesting strong praise. The mention of a standing ovation and audience participation further indicates a highly positive reception. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"inspirational powerhouse\" and describes a standing ovation with audience sing-along, indicating a very positive reception. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers strong praise describing the show as an 'inspirational powerhouse' and a 'family classic in the making,' warranting a high-end Positive score despite the limited text available. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
