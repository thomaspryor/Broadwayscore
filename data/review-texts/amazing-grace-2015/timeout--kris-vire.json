    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic explicitly rejects \"amazing\" as a descriptor and settles on \"adequate\" or \"acceptable\" as more fitting, suggesting the show meets basic standards but doesn't excel. Single excerpt warning requires caution about incomplete verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show is ambitious but falls short of being amazing, with descriptors like 'adequate' and 'acceptable' indicating a mixed review. The single excerpt and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review uses words like \"adequate\" and \"acceptable\", which are not strong endorsements. It suggests the show is not particularly impressive but not terrible either, placing it in the mixed category. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as merely 'adequate' or 'acceptable' rather than 'amazing,' damning it with faint praise and indicating a lukewarm reception that falls short of its ambitions.",
