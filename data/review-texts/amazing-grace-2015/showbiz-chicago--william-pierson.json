    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite noting lack of memorable songs, the critic praises the 'powerhouse cast' and 'amazing staging effects' and predicts 'certain Broadway success.' Single excerpt warning applied with upper-end scoring for clearly positive language. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances and staging, predicting success despite the lack of memorable tunes. The single excerpt suggests a positive tone, but the limited text reduces confidence. | Gemini: Despite the initial comment about the lack of toe-tapping tunes, the excerpt concludes with a strong positive statement about the cast, staging, and overall success of the show. Given the single excerpt, I am placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: While the excerpt notes the lack of catchy songs, it offers strong praise for the 'powerhouse cast' and 'amazing staging effects,' explicitly predicting 'certain Broadway success.' Single excerpt limits confidence.",
