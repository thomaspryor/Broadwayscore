But is it ready for it?...The show is almost there, but not quite...If there are a few dramatic points left to be made, and perhaps a few bumps in continuity or motivation to be identified, those are minor compared to the achievement on stage.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic acknowledges achievement but explicitly states the show isn't ready for Broadway and has bumps to work out. Single excerpt warning requires caution - this appears genuinely mixed rather than positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates the show is nearly ready for Broadway with minor issues, suggesting a positive but reserved recommendation. Due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review states the show \"is almost there\" and that issues are \"minor compared to the achievement on stage\", indicating a positive but not rave review. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic notes the production isn't fully ready for Broadway ('almost there, but not quite'), they affirm it belongs in commercial theater ('It very much is') and minimize the remaining issues as 'minor compared to the achievement on stage,' indicating a qualified but genuine recommendation.",
