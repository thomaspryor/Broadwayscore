    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Unqualified superlatives like 'triumph not to be missed' and 'theater at its finest' indicate a rave. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong, enthusiastic language such as 'stage triumph' and 'theater at its finest', indicating a highly positive review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"stage triumph\", \"not to be missed\", and \"theater at its finest\", indicating a highly positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains unambiguous rave language ('triumph,' 'not to be missed,' 'finest') suggesting strong recommendation, but confidence is low given only one curated quote is available and may not represent full review. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
