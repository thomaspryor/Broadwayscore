Single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the play's appeal to specific audiences and highlights positive aspects like singing and special effects, despite noting awkward staging. The single excerpt suggests a mildly positive tone. | Gemini: The review acknowledges awkward staging but praises the singing and special effects, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic experience. The limited text and single excerpt lowers confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates a qualified recommendation—acknowledging staging weaknesses but praising singing and effects as compensatory strengths. Mildly positive tone suggests lower Positive range appropriate given excerpt limitations.",
