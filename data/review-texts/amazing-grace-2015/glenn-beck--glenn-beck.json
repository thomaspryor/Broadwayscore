  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"This show has the power of the spirit without EVER preaching. It shows slavery for what is was but it also shows the evil black princess who was also part of the evil as she sold her own people in to slavery. None of it felt PC, nor did it feel forced or worse yet like it was trying to teach a lesson. If you are anywhere near New York you must see this show. It is worth the drive, the airfare or whatever it takes to get there. 'Amazing Grace' isn’t just amazing, it’s a miracle.\"\n\nRead more",
