The direction and staging heaves under the viscous book and uninspiring score.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Pan | Claude: Devastating language including 'turkey,' comparison to middle school assembly, calls book 'viscous' and score 'uninspiring.' No redeeming qualities mentioned. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong negative language, comparing the show to a 'turkey' and criticizing its lack of charm and memorable melodies. The direction and staging are described as struggling under a 'viscous book and uninspiring score,' indicating a strongly negative verdict. | Gemini: The review uses extremely negative language, calling the show a 'turkey' and a 'Sunday School polemic' that 'fails to have any charm or memorable melodies.' The critic clearly does not recommend seeing it. | Kimi: The critic delivers a devastating assessment using theatrical slang for a flop ('turkey') and compares the production unfavorably to a middle school assembly project, condemning the book as 'viscous,' the score as 'uninspiring,' and the direction as failing under the weight of the material. Single excerpt warrants low confidence.",
