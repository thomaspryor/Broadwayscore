With some heavy rewriting of book and score, they might have a chance.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic identifies fundamental flaws in storytelling, character development, and music quality compared to the show's apparent aspirations. While acknowledging talented cast/creative team, suggests 'heavy rewriting' is needed, indicating the current production falls short of recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt criticizes the show for lacking clarity, a compelling hero, and memorable music, suggesting significant shortcomings. The mention of potential improvement with rewriting indicates some hope, but the current production is not recommended. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the talent involved but points out significant flaws in the storytelling and music, suggesting potential with revisions but not a clear recommendation in its current state. Given the excerpt-only warning, I'm scoring cautiously. | Kimi: The single excerpt criticizes the show for failing to achieve its Les Misérables-style ambitions, citing deficiencies in storytelling, characters, and music. While acknowledging the cast's caliber, the critic suggests heavy rewriting is needed, indicating the current production is not recommended.",
