The result is an alternately interesting, pleasant, and (mostly) boring production...The book is all over the map, hovering somewhere between a safe Disney live-action historical drama, a Hallmark Hall of Fame 'important' drama, and, rarely, a hard-hitting expose on one of history's darkest chapters.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic describes the show as 'mostly boring' with only 'flashes of what could have been', placing it in mixed territory but leaning toward the lower end due to the predominantly negative assessment. | GPT-4o: The review highlights significant issues with the production, describing it as 'mostly boring' and 'playing it safe.' While there are mentions of 'interesting' moments, the overall tone is negative, indicating a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review describes the show as having potential but ultimately being boring and all over the map, indicating a mixed reaction. The truncated nature lowers confidence. | Kimi: The critic finds the production uneven and disappointing, acknowledging 'flashes of what could have been' and moments that are interesting and pleasant, but ultimately criticizing it as '(mostly) boring,' 'playing it safe,' and having a book that is 'all over the map.'",
