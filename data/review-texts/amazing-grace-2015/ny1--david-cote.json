At best 'Amazing Grace' might manipulate audiences to tears, but in the end, it’s preaching to the choir.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic dismisses the show as a 'clunky period piece' with 'bombastic, generic anthems' and calls it a waste of money. Even the best possible outcome is audience manipulation, not genuine artistic merit. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show as a 'clunky period piece' with 'bombastic, generic anthems' and suggests it may only appeal to a limited audience. However, the text is an excerpt, so the full verdict is unclear. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses negative language such as \"clunky period piece\" and \"bombastic, generic anthems,\" indicating a negative assessment of the musical. The phrase \"preaching to the choir\" also suggests a limited appeal. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as a 'clunky period piece' with 'generic anthems,' suggesting producers are 'burning piles of money' and that it merely 'manipulates' audiences rather than genuinely moving them.",
