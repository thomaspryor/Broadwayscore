And besides the parts of Amazing Grace I really didn't like, most of the rest--including the pre-answered question about whether Newton would find salvation--I just didn't much care about.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Critic finds protagonist unlikable throughout, calls show 'off-putting' and expresses lack of care about the story. Single excerpt warning applies - may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses a clear negative sentiment, finding the show 'off-putting' and expressing disinterest in the narrative. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic found the protagonist unlikeable and didn't care about the story, indicating a negative experience. The single excerpt and truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states finding the show 'rather off-putting' and expresses indifference toward most of the narrative ('I just didn't much care about'), constituting a clear recommendation against seeing it.",
