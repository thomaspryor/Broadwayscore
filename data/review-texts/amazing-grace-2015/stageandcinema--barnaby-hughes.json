    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong opening praise ('impressive', 'hits all the right notes') with multiple positive elements cited (cast, music, design), but significant caveat about jingoistic content creating discomfort. Single excerpt warning suggests caution - this appears positive but qualified. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for various elements of the show, indicating a positive review. However, the mention of jingoism as a negative point suggests some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the lower end of the positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the show's design, staging, cast, and music, but notes a tendency towards jingoism, suggesting a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production's design, staging, cast, and music, with only one caveat regarding occasional jingoistic tone. Given the predominance of positive evaluative language, this falls in the upper range of Positive, though confidence is reduced due to the single-excerpt limitation.",
