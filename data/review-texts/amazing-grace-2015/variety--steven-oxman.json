  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Sincere earnestness, along with expert pacing, theatrical flair and superb, intense performances, carry this show with moments of genuine potency. But it’s an open question whether those strengths can ultimately overcome a mostly workmanlike score and a bold but elongated focus on the wretchedness of its main character, whose song-inspiring soul-saving doesn’t occur until halfway through the second act.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review balances significant praise (superb performances, genuine potency, expert pacing) against major concerns (workmanlike score, elongated focus on wretchedness). The 'open question' framing suggests uncertainty about overall recommendation, placing this in Mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights strong performances and theatrical qualities, suggesting a positive view, but notes issues with the score and pacing. The single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review highlights positive aspects like pacing and performances, but also mentions a \"workmanlike score\" and a focus on the character's wretchedness. The overall tone suggests a qualified recommendation, but the single excerpt and truncated nature lower confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the performances ('superb, intense') and production values ('expert pacing'), suggesting they successfully 'carry' the show. However, significant reservations about the 'workmanlike score' and elongated structure, plus the 'open question' framing, indicate this is a qualified recommendation at best.",
