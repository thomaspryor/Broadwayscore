  "fullText": "In Hollywood parlance, they call it “medicine”: a movie or TV show that’s good for you, that teaches you something, that hopefully leaves you inspired.\n\n“Amazing Grace,” which opened Thursday at the Nederlander Theatre, is definitely medicine — and it will teach you something about abolitionist history in 18th-century England, which makes it much more educational than any other musical now on Broadway with the possible exception of the soon-to-open “Hamilton.”",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Under Gabriel Barre's direction, 'Amazing Grace' feels like a long adult-ed lecture or a night at 'Parsifal'...Smith ends his musical with a stirring rendition of 'Amazing Grace,' but the rest of the score utterly lacks Newton's simplicity and instead treads heavily in the current Broadway vogue for bombastic anthems coupled with a strong percussive element that's meant to send audiences to their feet applauding...In their final exchange, Mary asks Newton why 'it took you so long' to give up his slave-trader ways. Theatergoers will be asking that question much earlier.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic compares the show to tedious experiences (adult-ed lecture, Parsifal), criticizes the score as lacking simplicity and being bombastic, and suggests audiences will be impatient with the pacing. While acknowledging one stirring moment, the overall assessment is clearly negative. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the production as feeling like a lecture and notes that the score lacks simplicity, instead opting for bombastic anthems. The final question posed by a character is mirrored by the audience, suggesting a lack of engagement. The single excerpt suggests a negative tone, but the limited text reduces confidence. | Gemini: The review criticizes the show's direction and score, finding it lacking in simplicity and overly bombastic. The final line indicates a negative overall impression. | Kimi: The critic finds the show overlong and didactic ('long adult-ed lecture'), criticizes the score as bombastic and lacking subtlety, and suggests the pacing makes the narrative drag. While acknowledging the final number is stirring, the overall verdict clearly discourages attendance.",
