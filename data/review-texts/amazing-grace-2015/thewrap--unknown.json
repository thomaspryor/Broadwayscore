  "fullText": "In Hollywood parlance, they call it “medicine”: a movie or TV show that’s good for you, that teaches you something, that hopefully leaves you inspired.\n\n“Amazing Grace,” which opened Thursday at the Nederlander Theatre, is definitely medicine — and it will teach you something about abolitionist history in 18th-century England, which makes it much more educational than any other musical now on Broadway with the possible exception of the soon-to-open “Hamilton.”",
