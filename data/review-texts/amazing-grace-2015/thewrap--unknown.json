  "fullText": "In Hollywood parlance, they call it “medicine”: a movie or TV show that’s good for you, that teaches you something, that hopefully leaves you inspired.\n\n“Amazing Grace,” which opened Thursday at the Nederlander Theatre, is definitely medicine — and it will teach you something about abolitionist history in 18th-century England, which makes it much more educational than any other musical now on Broadway with the possible exception of the soon-to-open “Hamilton.”",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Under Gabriel Barre's direction, 'Amazing Grace' feels like a long adult-ed lecture or a night at 'Parsifal'...Smith ends his musical with a stirring rendition of 'Amazing Grace,' but the rest of the score utterly lacks Newton's simplicity and instead treads heavily in the current Broadway vogue for bombastic anthems coupled with a strong percussive element that's meant to send audiences to their feet applauding...In their final exchange, Mary asks Newton why 'it took you so long' to give up his slave-trader ways. Theatergoers will be asking that question much earlier.",
