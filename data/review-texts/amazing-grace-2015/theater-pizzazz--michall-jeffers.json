    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative language calling the show 'ungainly,' 'flatfooted and crude,' and 'derivative.' These are strong criticisms indicating the critic does not recommend the show. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt is strongly negative, describing the show as 'flatfooted and crude' and 'derivative'. Given the lack of positive elements and the single excerpt warning, this suggests a deep pan. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses negative language such as \"ungainly pastiche,\" \"flatfooted,\" and \"crude,\" indicating a negative assessment. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous criticism, describing the production as 'flatfooted and crude' and an 'ungainly pastiche' with no redeeming qualities mentioned. Given this is the only available excerpt from the review, confidence is lowered, but the language clearly indicates a negative recommendation.",
