    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. Acknowledges genuine power and excellent cast but identifies significant structural flaws in the book. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges powerful moments and an excellent cast but criticizes the book as overstuffed and underdeveloped. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like the cast and songs, but criticizes the book as \"overstuffed\" and \"underdeveloped,\" resulting in a mixed assessment. The original rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic praises the cast and musical numbers but levels significant criticism at the book for being overstuffed and underdeveloped, resulting in a balanced, neither-here-nor-there assessment that aligns with the 60/100 rating.",
