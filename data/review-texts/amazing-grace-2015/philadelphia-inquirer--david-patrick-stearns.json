  "bwwExcerpt": "Most of the show's gravitas is generated by its African American cast members - Chuck Cooper as Newton's betrayed slave Thomas, Laiona Michelle as Mary's servant, and Harriett D. Foy as the imperious African princess who profits from the slave trade. If this show finds its way into the hit zone, they'll be among the primary reasons.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt focuses on praising specific cast members while implying uncertainty about the show's overall success. The conditional 'if this show finds its way into the hit zone' suggests mixed feelings about the production as a whole. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances by the African American cast members as a potential reason for the show's success, indicating a mildly positive view. However, the single excerpt and lack of a full review text limit confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the strength of the African American cast, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. However, it's a conditional statement, indicating some reservations. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic attributes the show's gravitas and potential success primarily to its African American cast members, offering clear praise for their performances as the main reason to see the production.",
