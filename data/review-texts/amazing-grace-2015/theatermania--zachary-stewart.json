    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic calls it 'mildly enjoyable' which is lukewarm praise, while acknowledging strong production values but criticizing the story as 'skeletal remains.' This suggests a mixed experience with reservations about core elements. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'mildly enjoyable' and praises the design and staging, but also mentions the score as 'window dressing' on a 'skeletal' story, indicating mixed feelings. | Gemini: The review excerpt is mixed, praising the design and staging but noting a weak story. The overall tone leans slightly positive, but the single excerpt and lack of full text reduces confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly calls the show 'mildly enjoyable' with 'sumptuous' design, warranting the lower end of the Positive bucket (70-74) per the single-excerpt guidelines. However, the severe criticism of the 'skeletal' story and the limitation of only one available excerpt necessitate low confidence. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
