  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The show ends with a stirring rendition of the song “Amazing Grace” that seemed to be an after thought. Of course, that was the only memorable song in the show...'Amazing Grace' needs to be re-thought. The Treasure Island style adventure needs to be squelched. As it now plays, there are some impressive moments and wonderful staging with terrific performances but we need to see more of how and why Newton’s epiphany occurred to believe it.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges positive elements (impressive moments, wonderful staging, terrific performances) but calls for the show to be 're-thought' and identifies significant structural problems. Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds like qualified disappointment rather than recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges impressive moments and performances but criticizes the overall execution and coherence of the show. The excerpt suggests a mixed reception with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges impressive moments, wonderful staging, and terrific performances, but also states that the show needs to be re-thought and that the adventure aspect needs to be squelched. This indicates a mixed opinion, with both positive and negative aspects. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the performances and staging ('terrific,' 'wonderful') but delivers significant criticism of the book and score, stating the show 'needs to be re-thought' and elements 'need to be squelched.' With only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low.",
