    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Critic uses positive language ('refreshing', 'admirably', 'spirited acting', 'inspirational', 'beautiful and emotional finale') and describes the journey as worthwhile with contemporary relevance. However, confidence is low due to truncated text - full verdict may be cut off. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the show for its coverage of significant themes and highlights the emotional impact of the finale. The use of 'refreshing' and 'admirably' suggests a strong positive recommendation, though the lack of full text limits confidence. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"refreshing,\" \"admirably,\" \"spirited,\" and \"inspirational.\" Given the truncated text, I'm scoring it as positive with medium confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt contains consistent praise for the production's acting, music, and emotional impact, describing the show as 'refreshing' and 'admirable' with a finale that resonates with 'relevance and hope,' though the limited excerpt warrants reduced confidence.",
