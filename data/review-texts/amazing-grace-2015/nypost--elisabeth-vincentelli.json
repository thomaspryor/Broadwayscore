  "bwwExcerpt": "More time on that period and less on swashbuckling would have added welcome nuance. This is par for the course in Gabriel Barre's production, which is handsome...but doesn't fully commit to either the story's gray areas or the full extent of its horrors...Smith's score seems to aim for 'Les Miz'-like grandeur, but falls short, despite some agreeable tunes...However awkward or heavy-handed the proceedings are up till then, 'Amazing Grace' doesn't fail to draw tears.",

This warrants a pan score. | Kimi: The critic delivers an unambiguous pan using devastating imagery ('stiff and lifeless as a corpse') and explicit condemnation ('amazing bore'), with no redeeming qualities mentioned to offset the harsh verdict.",
