    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Classic mixed review structure with 'on the other hand' construction. Lists specific positives (entertaining, historical lesson, songs, effects) but counters with significant negatives (fictionalized distortion, awkward narrative, stereotypical characters). Single excerpt warning applies - this balanced assessment suggests genuine ambivalence rather than clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges entertaining elements and virtues but criticizes the narrative as clichéd and characters as stereotypes. The mixed tone suggests a balance of positive and negative aspects. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive and negative aspects, suggesting a mixed experience. It mentions entertaining elements but also criticizes the narrative and characters. | Kimi: The excerpt presents a mixed but mildly favorable view, acknowledging spectacle value and entertainment while criticizing the narrative as clichéd and stereotypical. Given the single excerpt limitation and faint praise ('sufficiently entertaining'), this represents a qualified recommendation at the lower end of the Positive range.",
