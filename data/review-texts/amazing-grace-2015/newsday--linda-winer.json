  "bwwExcerpt": "...is it possible today to tell another slave history through the eyes of a white man and the noble woman who believes in him? So much effort, sincerity and talent -- not to mention cash -- have been funneled into 'Amazing Grace' that it would be nice to be able to answer yes to any of that...The production has been confidently directed by Gabriel Barre, with a first-class creative team and a large, excellent cast -- most impressively, Chuck Cooper and Laiona Michelle in supporting roles as the families' favorite slaves.",
