However, with only one curated quote available, the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a negative view of the character and a lack of satisfaction with the musical's resolution. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review expresses disappointment with the character's development and the overall pacing, suggesting a mixed experience. The truncated nature of the text lowers confidence.",
