  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"It is an amazing story, but it is told on stage mostly in less than an amazing way. The new musical combines a coming-of-age tale, love story, slave narrative, costume drama, and Saturday morning adventure serial. It tries to do many things at once. For all that, we don’t actually learn much about the song... Much time, talent and money has gone into this well-meaning project to tell the story of John Newton. But it’s a musical hobbled by a misunderstanding of what makes good theater.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning applies - this may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the effort and intention behind the musical but criticizes its execution, indicating it is 'hobbled by a misunderstanding of what makes good theater.' The excerpt suggests a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review states that the musical tries to do too many things and ultimately fails to deliver a compelling theatrical experience. The phrase \"hobbled by a misunderstanding of what makes good theater\" indicates a negative assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging the 'amazing' source material and good intentions, the critic finds the execution severely lacking, calling it 'hobbled by a misunderstanding of what makes good theater,' indicating a clear recommendation against seeing the show.",
