Clear rave despite being a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise with superlatives like 'most incredible' and 'once a decade', indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic uses superlatives like \"most incredible\" and states that plays like this are rare, indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise calling it one of the best plays the critic has seen and a 'once a decade' event, indicating a strongly positive verdict for this production.",
