  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Unfortunately, while aspects of Newton’s tale are indeed noteworthy, maybe even amazing, the musical itself unfolds as an overstuffed history lesson trimmed in melodrama, with a standard-issue romantic subplot and some dutiful attempts to explore the lives of the slaves... 'Amazing Grace,' thick with such moralizing, naturally concludes on a note of uplift, or rather many notes of uplift: a choral singing of the title song... The song is simple, beautiful, immortal; the musical, not so much.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative verdict calling the musical 'overstuffed,' with 'standard-issue' elements and excessive moralizing. The final comparison explicitly dismisses the show while praising only the source song. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the musical as an 'overstuffed history lesson' and 'thick with moralizing,' concluding that while the song is praised, the musical itself is not. The excerpt suggests a negative tone, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the song but finds the musical \"overstuffed\" and not as impressive, indicating a mixed assessment. The excerpt-only nature lowers confidence. | Kimi: While acknowledging the noteworthy subject matter and the beauty of the hymn itself, the critic dismisses the musical as an 'overstuffed history lesson trimmed in melodrama' with a 'standard-issue romantic subplot,' concluding that the show fails to match the immortality of its title song.",
