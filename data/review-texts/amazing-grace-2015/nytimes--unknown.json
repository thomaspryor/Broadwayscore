President Obama ended his stirring eulogy for the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, a victim of last month’s gruesome killings in a South Carolina church, by singing the song, a last-minute inspiration that made for an affecting viral media moment after a year (and more) of disturbing racial violence.\n\nThe hymn, which many associate with African-American culture and the civil rights movement of the 1960s, was written in the 18th century by John Newton, an Englishman who worked in the slave-trading business.\n\nMake a beeline for the Nederlander Theater, where the show, with a score by a musical theater newcomer, Christopher Smith, and a book by Mr. Smith and Arthur Giron, opened on Thursday. The peculiar story of Newton’s life forms the spine of the musical, which traces the gradual moral awakening that led to his conversion from a trafficker in human flesh to a deeply religious writer of hymns.\n\nUnfortunately, while aspects of Newton’s tale are indeed noteworthy, maybe even amazing, the musical itself unfolds as an overstuffed history lesson trimmed in melodrama, with a standard-issue romantic subplot and some dutiful attempts to explore the lives of the slaves (although the focus remains squarely and maybe a little uncomfortably on the British characters).\n\nWhile Mr. Smith’s score is pleasant and serviceable — even impressive given his lack of musical training and former career as a Pennsylvania police officer — unsurprisingly, the title song, which is performed in full only at the musical’s conclusion, far outstrips in majesty and musical richness anything else we hear.",

'Amazing Grace,' thick with such moralizing, naturally concludes on a note of uplift, or rather many notes of uplift: a choral singing of the title song... The song is simple, beautiful, immortal; the musical, not so much.\"\n\nRead more",

The final comparison explicitly dismisses the show while praising only the source song. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the musical as an 'overstuffed history lesson' and 'thick with moralizing,' concluding that while the song is praised, the musical itself is not. The excerpt suggests a negative tone, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the song but finds the musical \"overstuffed\" and not as impressive, indicating a mixed assessment. The excerpt-only nature lowers confidence. | Kimi: While acknowledging the noteworthy subject matter and the beauty of the hymn itself, the critic dismisses the musical as an 'overstuffed history lesson trimmed in melodrama' with a 'standard-issue romantic subplot,' concluding that the show fails to match the immortality of its title song.",
