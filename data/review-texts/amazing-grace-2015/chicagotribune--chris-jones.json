    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic fundamentally rejects the show's approach to depicting slavery as backdrop to a white romance, declaring it cannot work. Despite being excerpted text, the strong moral objection suggests a negative verdict. | GPT-4o: The critic strongly criticizes the show's premise and its handling of sensitive historical themes, indicating a negative view. The lack of full text reduces confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses strong disapproval of the show's handling of slavery, indicating a negative overall assessment.
