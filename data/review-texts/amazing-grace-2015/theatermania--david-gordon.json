    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative assessment despite acknowledging good intentions. The critic finds fundamental flaws in score and staging that undermine the production. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the musical's good intentions and important story but criticizes the score and staging as bland and uninspired. This indicates a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the good intentions and important story but criticizes the score and staging, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the show's good intentions and important subject matter, the clear verdict is that the bland score and uninspired staging make it not worth seeing, with no recommendation to attend despite the brief length.",
