However, the lack of superlatives or extensive praise keeps the score in the lower Positive range. | Gemini: The review states what makes the show 'work', which is a positive assessment. The language suggests a recommendation, though not an enthusiastic one. | Kimi: The review offers clear praise for the show's narrative construction and tone, specifically commending its coherent storytelling and avoidance of sentimentality. While the language is approving ('work,' 'genuine'), it lacks the superlatives of a rave, suggesting a solid but measured recommendation. Confidence is low due to the brevity of the excerpt.",
