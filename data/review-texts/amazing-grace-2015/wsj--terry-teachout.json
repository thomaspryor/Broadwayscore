However, this appears to be a brief excerpt, so confidence is low due to limited context. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the show's coherent storytelling and genuine redemption, suggesting a solid recommendation. The absence of sentimentality or preachiness is noted as a positive aspect, indicating a positive review. | Gemini: The review states what makes the show 'work,' implying a positive assessment, but without strong enthusiasm. | Kimi: The critic clearly approves of the production, praising its narrative coherence and tonal restraint, though the extreme brevity suggests this may be an excerpt rather than the full review.",
