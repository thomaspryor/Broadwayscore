You’ll have to wait to hear those two little words—almost two and a half hours. The good news: It’s worth it...If only the rest of 'Amazing Grace' had such force. While by no means unpleasant, Smith’s songs are lifeless and forgettable.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt shows mixed sentiment - praising the climactic moment as 'worth it' but criticizing the songs as 'lifeless and forgettable.' Single excerpt with conflicting signals warrants low confidence. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt suggests that the show has a strong moment with the song 'Amazing Grace', but overall the songs are described as 'lifeless and forgettable'. This indicates a mixed review with some positive elements but significant reservations. | Gemini: The review states \"It's worth it\" but then expresses reservations about the songs being \"lifeless and forgettable.\" Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states the show is 'worth it' despite harsh criticism of the songs as 'lifeless and forgettable,' indicating a barely positive recommendation. Confidence is low due to availability of only a single excerpt. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
