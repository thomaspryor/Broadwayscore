  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The producers of 'Amazing Grace' have hired some of the best in the business and these actors and designers give us their “A” game. But a musical’s gotta have music you want to hear again and again, and a character or two you pull for. Otherwise, you have a show like this – which is not wretched, but neither is it amazing.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Critic acknowledges high-quality production values but finds fundamental flaws in music and character development. The verdict 'not wretched, but neither is it amazing' clearly places this in mixed territory with a lean toward disappointment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast and design but criticizes the music and character engagement, indicating a mixed review. The lack of strong positive or negative language supports a middle-of-the-road score. | Gemini: The review states that the show is \"not wretched, but neither is it amazing,\" indicating a mixed or neutral opinion. The excerpt suggests that the music and characters are lacking. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges excellent production values and performances ('A' game from professionals) but criticizes the fundamental elements of the musical, noting it lacks memorable music and compelling characters, resulting in a lukewarm verdict that it is merely adequate rather than exceptional.",
