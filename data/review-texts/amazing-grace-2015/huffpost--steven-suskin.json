  "bwwExcerpt": "Amazing Grace earns a place right alongside the Aimee Semple McPherson musical, Scandalous, and the Shroud of Turin musical, Into the Light; not because of the faith-based subject matter, but due to the overall effect. There is nothing wrong with bringing to Broadway a new musical written by a newcomer; both The Music Man and 1776 came from first-timers, although both were professional musicians with pop song hits to their credit (and both had composed incidental music for Broadway plays). In this case, the program bio of Christopher Smith--'the concept creator, composer, lyricist and co-author of the book'--proudly states that this is his 'first work of professional writing.' While there is indeed a lightning strike on the stage of Nederlander, it comes courtesy of the electrician.",
