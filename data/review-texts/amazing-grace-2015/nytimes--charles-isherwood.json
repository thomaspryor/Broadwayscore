President Obama ended his stirring eulogy for the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, a victim of last month’s gruesome killings in a South Carolina church, by singing the song, a last-minute inspiration that made for an affecting viral media moment after a year (and more) of disturbing racial violence.\n\nThe hymn, which many associate with African-American culture and the civil rights movement of the 1960s, was written in the 18th century by John Newton, an Englishman who worked in the slave-trading business.\n\nMake a beeline for the Nederlander Theater, where the show, with a score by a musical theater newcomer, Christopher Smith, and a book by Mr. Smith and Arthur Giron, opened on Thursday. The peculiar story of Newton’s life forms the spine of the musical, which traces the gradual moral awakening that led to his conversion from a trafficker in human flesh to a deeply religious writer of hymns.\n\nUnfortunately, while aspects of Newton’s tale are indeed noteworthy, maybe even amazing, the musical itself unfolds as an overstuffed history lesson trimmed in melodrama, with a standard-issue romantic subplot and some dutiful attempts to explore the lives of the slaves (although the focus remains squarely and maybe a little uncomfortably on the British characters).\n\nWhile Mr. Smith’s score is pleasant and serviceable — even impressive given his lack of musical training and former career as a Pennsylvania police officer — unsurprisingly, the title song, which is performed in full only at the musical’s conclusion, far outstrips in majesty and musical richness anything else we hear.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",
