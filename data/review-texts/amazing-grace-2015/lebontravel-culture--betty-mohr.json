    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Overwhelmingly positive language with multiple superlatives and description of standing ovation, but confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this may be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives like 'astonishing', 'extraordinary', and 'incredible', indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. The description of the audience's reaction further supports a rave verdict. | Gemini: The excerpt uses a string of superlatives and describes a standing ovation, indicating a rave review. Despite only having a single excerpt, the language is strong enough to warrant a score in the Rave bucket. | Kimi: While the excerpt uses extreme superlatives (astonishing, spectacular, incredible) and describes a rapturous audience response, confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation which risks cherry-picking. The language places it at the top of the Positive bucket.",
