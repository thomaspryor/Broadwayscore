  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"In all honesty, I suspect 'Amazing Grace' needs a major overhaul to make it on Broadway. John Newton needs to be a specific individual we can care about rather than a generic angry young man, and all the other characters, Black and white, need to be real, complex people. The story needs to include more about what happened after his conversion, and the overblown scenes need to be trimmed and tightened. As it stands, the show is worth seeing only for a few of the performances.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | No bucket consensus - using median score | Claude: The critic explicitly states the show 'needs a major overhaul' and lists multiple fundamental problems with character development, story structure, and pacing. The final verdict is that it's only worth seeing for isolated performances, which is a clear negative recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show for needing a major overhaul and lacking character depth, suggesting it's only worth seeing for some performances. This indicates a negative view, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review suggests the show needs significant work but ultimately states it's \"worth seeing\" for the performances, indicating a barely positive recommendation. The single excerpt and need for overhaul lower confidence. | Kimi: While the excerpt lists significant structural problems and calls for a major overhaul, it explicitly states the show is 'worth seeing' for the performances, constituting a qualified recommendation. Single excerpt limits confidence. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Negative, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
