The mention that the score 'utterly lacks Newton's simplicity' is clearly negative. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt criticizes the direction and overall feel of the show, comparing it to a lecture, which suggests a negative view. The ending is noted as stirring, but the rest of the score is criticized. Given the single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt compares the show negatively to a lecture and Parsifal, and criticizes the score for lacking simplicity. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
