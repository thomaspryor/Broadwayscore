What I do know is that Smith and his production associates have given us an amazing show with an abundance of grit and grace.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language throughout - 'stirring,' 'spiritedly envisioned,' 'impressive,' and concludes with 'amazing show.' Despite some uncertainty about the composer's future, the overall verdict is clearly enthusiastic recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'amazing' with 'an abundance of grit and grace', indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"deeply felt\", \"spiritedly envisioned\", and \"amazing show\". Despite the caveat about Smith's future, the overall tone is enthusiastic. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strong praise ('amazing show,' 'abundance of grit and grace,' 'stirring') with only minor reservation about the composer's long-term status, indicating a clear recommendation.",
