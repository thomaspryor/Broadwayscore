  "bwwExcerpt": "Most of the show's gravitas is generated by its African American cast members - Chuck Cooper as Newton's betrayed slave Thomas, Laiona Michelle as Mary's servant, and Harriett D. Foy as the imperious African princess who profits from the slave trade. If this show finds its way into the hit zone, they'll be among the primary reasons.",
