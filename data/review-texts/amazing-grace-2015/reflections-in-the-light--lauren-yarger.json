    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for performances and staging ('engrossing, inspiring, bursting with excellent performances') but notes significant weakness in the score ('adequate, but lacks the swell of big Broadway'). Single excerpt warning applies - confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for performances and staging, calling the show 'engrossing' and 'inspiring'. While the score is noted as adequate, the overall tone is clearly positive. Due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is mostly positive, using words like \"engrossing\", \"inspiring\", and \"excellent\", but notes the score is only \"adequate\". Given the single excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the performances and staging ('engrossing', 'inspiring', 'excellent', 'heavenly') but includes a notable reservation about the score lacking Broadway grandeur, placing it in the upper Positive range rather than a Rave.",
