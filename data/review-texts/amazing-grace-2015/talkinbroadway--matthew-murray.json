The tone is clearly negative, indicating a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review states the show 'forgets to actually inspire', indicating a negative overall experience. | Kimi: The critic finds the show overly focused on meeting Broadway conventions rather than achieving genuine inspiration, resulting in a disappointing production that fails at its central goal.",
