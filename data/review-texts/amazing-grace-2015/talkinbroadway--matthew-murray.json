The tone is clearly negative, indicating a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review states that the show 'forgets to actually inspire,' indicating a negative assessment and a lack of recommendation. | Kimi: The critic delivers a concise negative verdict stating the show mechanically adheres to Broadway conventions but fundamentally fails at its core goal of being inspiring. The brevity of the text suggests this is an excerpt, warranting low confidence.",
