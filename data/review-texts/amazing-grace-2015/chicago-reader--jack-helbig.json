    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Rave | Claude: Strong superlatives ('absolutely riveting', 'terrific performances', 'amazing stage effects') with enthusiastic praise for multiple elements. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt offers strong praise with terms like 'absolutely riveting', 'fine songs', and 'amazing stage effects'. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly positive assessment. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"absolutely riveting,\" \"fine songs,\" \"stirring adventure,\" and \"terrific performances,\" indicating a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence due to the limited text.",
