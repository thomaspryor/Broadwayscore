And given the state of original dramatic musicals on Broadway, If this stays open after Labor Day, I'll be surprised.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Critic expresses doubt about the show's believability, identifies 'too many issues' despite acknowledging the cast, and predicts it won't survive past Labor Day. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the verdict is clearly negative. | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses skepticism about the show's success and highlights significant issues, suggesting a negative outlook. However, the single excerpt warning indicates potential cherry-picking, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review expresses doubts about the show's success due to numerous issues, suggesting it might not stay open long. This indicates a negative assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates fundamental problems with the show's believability and subject matter that override the cast's abilities, with the critic predicting an early closing. Single excerpt and truncated text warrant low confidence.",
