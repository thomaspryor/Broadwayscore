Single excerpt warning noted but tone is consistently enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, describing the show as 'unforgettable' and recommending it to 'anyone'. The language suggests a solidly positive review, but the single excerpt warning reduces confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language and a clear recommendation, but as it is only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt contains strongly positive language ('unforgettable', 'gladly recommend to anyone', 'wow the critics') indicating an enthusiastic recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the single-excerpt warning that the quote may be cherry-picked.",
