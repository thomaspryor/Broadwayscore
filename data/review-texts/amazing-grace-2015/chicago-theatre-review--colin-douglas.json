  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"What’s missing is that particular spark, that crucial moment when the audience sees Newton finding his spiritual foundation and becoming inspired to write 'Amazing Grace.' This universally-loved hymn, which the audience has been waiting to hear seems, at this stage, to be tacked onto the end of the musical, almost as an afterthought. With so many sweet sounds and moving performances emanating from this production, the promise of the entire story behind the hymn is missing.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt praises performances and sounds but identifies a fundamental flaw in the show's emotional core. Single excerpt warning applies - this could be from a more positive or negative overall review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights positive elements like 'sweet sounds and moving performances' but criticizes the lack of a crucial moment and the hymn feeling 'tacked on'. This suggests a mixed review with both strengths and weaknesses. | Gemini: The review notes \"sweet sounds and moving performances\" but states that the crucial moment and the story behind the hymn is missing, indicating a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
