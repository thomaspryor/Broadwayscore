    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive verdict with 'enjoyable? Certainly yes!' but explicitly states it's not amazing. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a positive view of the musical numbers, describing them as 'enjoyable' despite not being 'amazing'. The tone suggests a mild recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic review. The phrase \"enjoyable? Certainly yes!\" suggests a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise, acknowledging the show is not 'amazing' but affirming it is 'certainly' enjoyable with music that is 'quite good' and superior to other recent Broadway offerings. This represents a mild recommendation.",
