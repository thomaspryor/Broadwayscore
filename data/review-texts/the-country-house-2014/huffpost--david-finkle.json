  "bwwExcerpt": "Some plays about actors, acting and other theater concerns can be quite good--a worthy example being Anton Chekhov's 1895 work, The Seagull. Most plays about actors, acting and other theater concerns, however, are not so rewarding. Sorry to say that one of them is Donald Margulies's newest comedy-drama, The Country House...Curiously, one of the reasons the play falls short of Pulitzer Prize-winning Margulies's usual vaunted mark is that he's chosen, as many playwrights before him have, to make The Country House an homage to Chekhov...Although the characters forge through a good deal during the two acts, torpor gathers quickly. Something stultifying creeps in that lends The Country House the feel of a middling sitcom...As modern-day Chekhov counterparts, the six actors here acquit themselves well. To pay them and director Sullivan the best compliment under these circumstances is to say it would be a pleasure to see them tackling the real thing(s).",
