  "bwwExcerpt": "...this comfort-food of a play by Donald Margulies ('Time Stands Still') is like Goldilocks' porridge: not too hot, not too cold -- just . . . lukewarm...Margulies draws from Chekhov, especially 'The Seagull' and 'Uncle Vanya,' for his fractious weekend in the country. Spotting the parallels will keep you busy for a while, along with Danner, who's amusing and blessedly restrained in a role that could easily have turned into a caricature. Steele, so good as Alan Cumming's daughter on 'The Good Wife,' is earthy and keen, her character a breath of fresh air in this hothouse of self-regard. Under the direction of the prolific Daniel Sullivan, classy and subdued as usual, the show trots along at a solid clip, dotted with the expected bon mots...episodes of painful truth-telling, arguments and fights. Add a typically luxurious set by John Lee Beatty and you've got yourself a pleasant evening out. And yes, that is faint praise.",
