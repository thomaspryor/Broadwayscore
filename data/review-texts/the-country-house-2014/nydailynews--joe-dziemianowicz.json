  "bwwExcerpt": "The curtain rises on 'The Country House' by Donald Margulies to reveal a snazzy living room -- and you just know things will get ugly. That's standard operating Broadway procedure: Cozy interior, turbulent encounters. And aside from one exceptional performance, this clichéd, but ultimately harmless, comedy-drama directed by Daniel Sullivan is an old-fashioned, by-the-numbers affair...Margulies skimps on character details but gives his creations the gift of gab...The cast proves capable. Danner is solid in a role that's not much of a stretch. Lange turns on the emotions as required when the story takes a turn to 'Ordinary People' territory. Sunjata adds appeal as a sudden celebrity. Best of all, Steele transforms her character from more than a wounded, walking wisecrack into the show's heart and soul.",
