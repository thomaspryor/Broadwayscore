  "bwwExcerpt": "It's not that Mr. Margulies...has forsaken his usual high ambitions...But here, the elements seem to have come from different jigsaw puzzles, and the pieces feel jimmied into place...Like Chekhov, Mr. Margulies is a specialist in rueful regrets and misty glimpses of roads not taken. But his usually astute ear for matchingly wistful dialogue falters..Ms. Danner aside, the attractive cast members register as a little sheepish, as if self-conscious about trying to make ersatz Chekhov sound like the real thing while maintaining the rhythms of laugh-track banter. ..The most satisfying and exasperating aspect of 'The Country House' is Ms. Danner's performance. Because this actress is so good at playing an actress, she makes us long for another, deeper play that would allow her fuller range. As it is, Ms. Danner still commits fully to every trait, both magnetic and repellent, that Anna is meant to embody.",
