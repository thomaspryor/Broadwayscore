  "bwwExcerpt": "It is easy to understand why playwrights, especially those fascinated by the layers of human relationships, are drawn to the work of Anton Chekhov...Except for the fine cast led by the formidably elegant Blythe Danner, however, there is little else that feels right enough about 'The Country House.' Margulies...is straining here to update Chekhov's 'The Seagull' to a summer house full of theater people at the Williamstown Theatre Festival...Of course, it is always a pleasure to watch Danner have her way with a big character, even such a familiar one as the shrewd, tempestuous, increasingly insecure theatrical diva...[but] the banter is hackneyed and, ultimately, the crises are pointless. Worse, these people are dull.",
