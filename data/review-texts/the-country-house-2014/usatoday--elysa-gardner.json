  "bwwExcerpt": "Luckily, this Manhattan Theatre Club production...has the benefit of an expert director, Daniel Sullivan, and a cast -- led by a delicious Blythe Danner -- who bring this crew to life with a brisk, unfussy wit that flatters the material. Danner's Anna is a model of rumpled dignity and vanity, at once blowsy and elegant in her fashion...Yet House is at its funniest and most poignant when Anna comes to terms -- or doesn't -- with her fading powers, and the ephemerality of life. Her daughter's absence is, of course, a stinging reminder of the latter, and Danner makes that pain clear, even while delivering a wonderfully relaxed comedic performance...Narcissism and banality are, after all, hardly unique to one character in The Country House. Still, given the strong foundation it's provided here, it's not a bad place to spend a few hours.",
