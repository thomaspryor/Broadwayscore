  "bwwExcerpt": "If you're the kind of person who enjoys Chekhov but wishes it were more, you know, relatable--a kind of person who probably doesn't and certainly shouldn't exist-then The Country House is just the play for you. Donald Margulies's dozy family drama transplants Uncle Vanya to a cottage near the theater retreat of Williamstown, with modern jokes and bits of The Seagull patched in for variety...The essential banality of this bubbleless soap seems intended to be tempered by our inherent fascination with show business. The play depicts an insular and obsolescent theater world, and exemplifies it.",

The 60 rating from the critic confirms this as a mixed review that neither recommends nor discourages. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review, acknowledging the play's thoughtfulness but noting it falls short of its emotional aims. | Gemini: The review is mixed, acknowledging thoughtfulness but also noting that it doesn't always achieve its goals. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The review praises the play as 'thoughtful' but explicitly notes its failure to achieve intended emotional depths, resulting in a balanced, middle-of-the-road assessment consistent with the 60 rating.",
