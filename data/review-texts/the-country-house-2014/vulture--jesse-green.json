  "bwwExcerpt": "What went wrong? Manhattan Theater Club, which did such a fine job on Margulies's Time Stands Still four years ago, has applied its usual polish, with Daniel Sullivan again directing. Yet the tone wobbles like one of those air socks at a car dealership: now inflated, now bent, mostly becalmed and flaccid. Perhaps the problem is that the play was purpose-built, commissioned by MTC, and too closely tailored to the interests, if not the real talents, of its star. Neither Danner nor the rest of the well-cast cast (Daniel Sunjata as the action star and Sarah Steele as the Yalie at least look spot-on) are able to get out ahead of their characters, to apply that spin that can make theater people, with their ludicrous vanities and bitter envy, enjoyable to watch. As a result, Anna and the others all just seem vain and entitled, which may have been accurate up in the Berkshires in Psacharopoulos's day but was never much worth watching.",
