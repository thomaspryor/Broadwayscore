  "bwwExcerpt": "To single out Ms. Steele and Mr. Lange is not, however, to suggest that their colleagues are less than excellent. They are, in fact, uniformly superior, and Daniel Sullivan has staged the play with an ungimmicky simplicity that allows each one to shine in turn-but it is the author who makes them real. If 'The Country House' is a backstage drama by virtue of its setting, its actual subject is how the members of a close family can hurt one another without meaning to do so. You needn't have done time on the far side of the proscenium to know all about that, to recognize how fully Mr. Margulies understands it or to appreciate the seasoned skill with which he has turned that hurt into the stuff of a truly affecting play.",
