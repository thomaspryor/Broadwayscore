  "bwwExcerpt": "It's also not a good idea to have your wisest character reprimand another character for 'sounding like a Lifetime movie' when, in fact, Margulies turns his second act into a Lifetime movie...After Danner's playing good cop to Robert De Niro's bad cop in all those 'Focker' movies, it's fun to see her let go with a bad-momma character. Actually, Anna's not even a bad mom; rather, she's just a little chilly. And Danner plays chilly with real panache...'The Country House' is actually two plays: the sentimental drama of the second act, and the sitcom comedy of the first act. No wonder director Daniel Sullivan can't make sense of it. He has no choice but to open the play with broad performances to replicate what's happening in the cute twists of the overly complicated plot.",
