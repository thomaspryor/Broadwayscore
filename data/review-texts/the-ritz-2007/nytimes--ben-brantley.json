The tone is appreciative but measured. | GPT-4o: The review describes the production as having a 'cheerful vulgarity' and 'candy-colored exuberance,' suggesting a positive tone despite the lack of detailed evaluation. | Gemini: The review describes the production with positive terms like \"cheerful vulgarity\" and \"candy-colored exuberance,\" suggesting an enjoyable experience, although the term \"cartoon sensibility\" implies it may not be for everyone. | Kimi: The critic praises the production's aesthetic choices ('cheerful vulgarity,' 'candy-colored exuberance') and approves of how the mounting suits the material's farcical nature, indicating a solid recommendation despite the brief excerpt.",
