  "bwwExcerpt": "This meta theatrical concept is oddly appropriate for the campy concoction that is 'The Cher Show.' Directed by Jason Moore ('Avenue Q'), with bizarre and skimpy costumes designed by Bob Mackie and arena tour-style choreography, the production proves to be more tolerable than similar star-worship vehicles, though nowhere near as satisfying as 'Jersey Boys' (The Four Seasons) or even 'Beautiful' (Carole King).",
