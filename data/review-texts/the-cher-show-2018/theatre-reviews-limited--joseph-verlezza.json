  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The book...although a bit campy...is crystal clear and informative...’The Cher Show’ might be billed as a jukebox musical; however...her songs fit perfectly into her life story...Gattelli gives...energetic production numbers...Moore moves the evening along at a fast pace...Then there are the costumes...An endless parade of astonishing outfits...There is nothing groundbreaking about this show, but it is good solid entertainment with performances that would be hard to beat.”\n\nRead more",
