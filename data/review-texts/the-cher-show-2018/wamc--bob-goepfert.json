  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A positive aspect of the production is the talent...Cher is played by three extremely gifted women...Two and a half hours of pleasant familiar music that is well-sung and expertly performed. It is attractively presented and is packaged with a positive message...There are many things to appreciate in 'The Cher Show,' but little to hold onto an hour after the curtain falls...Your enjoyment of the show is directly related to the appeal one has for Cher as a performer.\"\n\nRead more",
