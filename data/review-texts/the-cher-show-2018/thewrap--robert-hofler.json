  "bwwExcerpt": "Being compared to television isn't a compliment in the theater, but it's probably what director Jason Moore, choreographer Christopher Gattelli and book writer Rick Elice intended: Watching 'The Cher Show' is as much fun as watching old network TV, namely 'The Sonny and Cher Show' on CBS. The jokes are lame, segues between scenes are blunt or nonexistent, and a general lack of inventiveness pervades the entire enterprise.",
