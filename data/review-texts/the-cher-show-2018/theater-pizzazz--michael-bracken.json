  "showScoreExcerpt": "“’Cher’ needs three actresses to play its title character because it spans most of Cher’s life...Block stands out with a take no prisoners performance that is simply fantastic...Being a superstar is hard work, and I have no doubt that Cher paid her dues and then some, but it’s a stretch to buy into her being a victim...Luckily, there is far more singing than sulking...The show, like Cher’s career, has a few valleys, but for the most part...Moore keeps it exciting, with lots of glitz and glitter.”\n\nRead more",
