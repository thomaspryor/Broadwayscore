  "showScoreExcerpt": "“’'The Cher Show' is not exactly brilliant art. It's silly and breezy and light...This is the kind of jukebox musical that elicits gleeful applause at the opening notes of a pop standard, or when an actor manages a passable impersonation...’The Cher Show’ is hardly deep: you won't get much about Cher's life here...Still, the show's constant nod to the importance of women speaks volumes...This is a fluffy bauble that knows exactly what it is and exactly how to entertain.”\n\nRead more",
