  "bwwExcerpt": "While The Cher Show is flashy entertainment from start to finish, full of vibrant artists giving splashy turns, the center of it all is Block's solidly grounded acting performance, portraying a woman trying to maintain an idealized public image while privately grasping for control of her career in a business that hasn't quite heard the messages of the growing Feminist movement. Whether camping it up for 'Turn Back Time' or ripping her heart out in 'The Way Of Love' Block commands attention as Cher discovers her own path to liberation through self-reinvention.",
