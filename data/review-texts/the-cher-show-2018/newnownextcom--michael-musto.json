  "showScoreExcerpt": "“I enjoyed ‘The Cher Show’ starring three interacting women at different phases of her life...The musical is honest about some dark stuff, like Cher’s difficulty reading and the way she was bullied as a child...A glorified Vegas tribute—veered between bouts of grinning and sympathizing. After a too jokey start—it settles into a lively swirl of dramatics, fashion, and music, with fun juxtapositions of the ladies, as they ‘turn back time’ and show how they made their dreams come true.”\n\nRead more",
