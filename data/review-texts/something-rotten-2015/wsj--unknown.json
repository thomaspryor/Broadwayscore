  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Something Rotten!\" is a Mel Brooks-style Elizabethan-era backstage spoof...Alas...Wayne and Karey Kirkpatrick have blown it up to 21/2 half hours by inserting 15 mostly comic songs, none of whose lyrics are sharp enough to penetrate their targets...The cast is resolutely lively, and Casey Nicholaw has staged \"Something Rotten!\" with enough punch to partially conceal the thinness of the material. Nevertheless, this one's for backward sophomores only.",
