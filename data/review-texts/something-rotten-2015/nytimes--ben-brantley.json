  "bwwExcerpt": "Unchecked enthusiasm is not always an asset in musical comedy, despite the genre's reputation for wholesale peppiness. \"Something Rotten!\"...dances dangerously on the line between tireless and tedious, and winds up collapsing into the second camp...\"Sophomoric\" is the right adjective for \"Something Rotten!\"...this production wallows in the puerile puns, giggly double-entendres, lip-smacking bad taste and goofy pastiche numbers often found in college revues...With his resolute jaw, gleaming smile",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The word 'cheerfully' suggests positive sentiment, and describing it as a 'kaleidoscope' implies richness and entertainment value. However, this appears to be a truncated excerpt with limited evaluative content, so confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"cheerfully anachronistic\" and a \"kaleidoscope of inside jokes,\" indicating a positive but potentially niche appeal. | Kimi: The critic employs distinctly positive descriptors ('cheerfully', 'kaleidoscope') to characterize the show's meta-theatrical conceit, suggesting appreciation for its playful cleverness. However, the text is extremely brief (under 50 words), lacking a definitive verdict or clear recommendation language, warranting low confidence.",
