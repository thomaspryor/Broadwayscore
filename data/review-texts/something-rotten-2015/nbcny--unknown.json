  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Rotten!\" delivers the same sort of accessible and over-the-top laughs as \"Mormon\"...A generous sampling of Shakespearean conventions helps elevate an otherwise-thin and double entendre-laden plot. While Borle's role is flashier, it's d'Arcy James...who does the heavy-lifting. He's the closest thing \"Something Rotten!\" has to a serious character...Tony-winner Borle...is clearly beside himself with glee at the chance to play the preening rock-star scribe who throws parties in the park...\"Rotten!\"",
