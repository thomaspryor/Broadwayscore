However, the review is very brief, so the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The critic states that the musical is \"something wonderful,\" which indicates a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic delivers enthusiastic praise calling the show 'something wonderful,' indicating a strong recommendation. Confidence is low as this appears to be a brief excerpt with limited context.",
