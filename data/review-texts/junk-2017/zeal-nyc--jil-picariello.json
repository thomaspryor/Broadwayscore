  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The only thing risky about this play is its title...The production is awesomely slick, with shiny black two-tiered sets and crisp direction...Robert Merkin played by a whittled Pasquale, is knife sharp...The character doesn’t offer a whole lot of range, but Pasquale runs the gamut, from A for anger to B for brutality...The drama is brisk, but chilly, and entertaining…enough. The play’s title promises the rich disorder of human life. But in the end, it’s all too tame and tidy.”\n\nRead more",
