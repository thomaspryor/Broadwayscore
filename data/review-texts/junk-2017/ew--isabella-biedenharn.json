  "bwwExcerpt": "Still, it's an enthralling production: John Lee Beatty's grid of a set is like an Excel spreadsheet come to life - and when those illuminated cubes are combined with Doug Hughes' direction, Ben Stanton's lighting, and Mark Bennett's sound, they can make a board meeting feel as dramatic as the Super Bowl. And despite each character's path seeming inevitable, their choices - or lack thereof - will stick with you long after the final bow.",
