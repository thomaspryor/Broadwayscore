  "bwwExcerpt": "'Junk' marks a critical departure point for Akhtar, a Pakistani-American writer whose prior dramas involved Pakistani-Americans (the Pulitzer Prize-winning 'Disgraced,' 'The Who & The What') and an American kidnapped by a Pakistani terrorist ('The Invisible Hand'). Even while many of the characters are underdeveloped, the commentary on anti-Semitism feels tacked on and the industry lingo can throw off a layperson, 'Junk' is engrossing from start to finish and Doug Hughes' sleek, high-powered and fluid production (staged around a two-story set of empty squares and shining surfaces) never lags in momentum.",
