  "bwwExcerpt": "Seeing it today, you have to roll up the nearest Playbill and scratch your head in wonderment at why the talented writer of 'Disgraced' bothered with a subject that movies from 'Margin Call' to 'Wolf of Wall Street' to 'The Big Short' have handled so much more effectively in recent years. Even a far weaker effort, like Oliver Stone's 'Wall Street,' had the advantage of a timely release date: December 1987.",
