  "bwwExcerpt": "Ayad Akhtar's \"Junk\" is a parable of capitalism and its discontents whose villain-in-chief is a junk-bond salesman named, none too discreetly, \"Robert Merkin\" (Steven Pasquale). It's performed at breakneck speed by a budget-busting cast of 23 actors, an ensemble so huge that it would have taken a Tom Stoppard-or a Shakespeare-to portray the individual characters as anything other than stick figures. Mr. Akhtar is talented, but not that talented.",

This indicates a mixed reaction, neither strongly recommending nor discouraging it. | Kimi: The critic describes the production as nearly terminally dull but credits the playwright's authentic ear for financial jargon and convincing characterization as redeeming qualities. The text appears to be an excerpt, making the final verdict unclear.",
