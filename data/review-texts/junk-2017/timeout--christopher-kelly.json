  "bwwExcerpt": "Much like this year's Tony-winning 'Oslo,' which previously occupied the Vivian Beaumont, 'Junk' -- bracingly and briskly directed by Doug Hughes on a stylish, two-tiered set by John Lee Beatty -- employs an enormous cast (23 actors) in order to show you how an entire system operates. Among the players are various inside traders, federal investigators, lawyers, union workers, journalists and even a Rudy Giuliani stand-in, all trying to play the angles, and all of whom -- even the purported 'good guys' -- are motivated by self-interest.",
