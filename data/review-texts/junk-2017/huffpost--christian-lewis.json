  "bwwExcerpt": "Ayad Akhtar, Puiltzer Prize-winning playwright of 'Disgraced,' has a new drama, 'Junk,' directed by Doug Hughes at the Vivan Beaumont at Lincoln Center. Sadly, this new play cannot compare to his previous hit, which tackled race and religion with such incredible nuance. In 'Junk,' Akhtar explores the financial world of the 1980s, including an aggressive tackover, insider trading, stock manipulation, million dollar investment portfolios, and of course, controversial junk bonds.",
