  "bwwExcerpt": "Overall, it's as if Shanley, director Doug Hughes and the Manhattan Theatre Club had been afraid to let this play be as small as it needs to be. Even the production overcompensates, with meticulous rotating sets by John Lee Beatty and elaborate water effects. It's never a good sign when you find yourself looking away from actors to watch falling rain.",

However, the brief length of the text limits the depth of evaluation, resulting in medium confidence. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as 'perfectly matched,' 'tender,' and 'funny,' indicating a positive assessment of the play. | Kimi: The critic praises the lead performances as 'perfectly matched' and the play as both 'tender' and 'funny,' indicating a clear recommendation despite the brevity of the excerpt.",
