  "bwwExcerpt": "Mullingar is Shanley's best play since Doubt, and like that hit from a decade ago, it's lean, dialectical and packed with wise saws and aphoristic gems. The Irish setting also gives him license to wax lyrical-pastoral-a pleasure if you've no allergy to rants and blarney. 'You might as well try to stop the calendar from naming the days,' Rosemary loftily informs stubborn Tony. 'I've been older than all of you since I was born, and sure I ache for my own youth.' If such stuff doesn't cause a wild rose to bloom in your heart, it's turned barren as stone.",
