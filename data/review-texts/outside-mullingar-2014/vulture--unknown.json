  "bwwExcerpt": "Outside Mullingar is comforting in its theatrical familiarity. On the packing list of required elements, no item is left unchecked. Irish-ish stars? Sure: The production is headed by Brían F. O'Byrne (born in County Cavan) and Debra Messing (hey, she's got red hair). Dank setting? John Lee Beatty's scenery looks like it was dredged from a peat bog. An old Hibernian air? Please join me in singing 'Wild Mountain Thyme.' Everything, including the kitchen sink, screams Ireland as we know it from plays great and small: the wellies, the crucifix, the rain, the mad stories, the fierce colleen, the crafty old man, the wake, the Guinness, the touch of the poet. It begins with a yarn and is itself a yarn.",
