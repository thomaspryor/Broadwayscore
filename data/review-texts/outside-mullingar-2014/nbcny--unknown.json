  "bwwExcerpt": "Debra Messing, a nice Jewish girl, slides effortlessly into a foursome of otherwise Irish actors in the wistful 'Outside Mullingar,' a new romantic comedy - that is, by the time it resolves an identity crisis - from award-winning writer John Patrick Shanley ('Doubt')...That Messing makes for a fine ensemble actress is hardly astounding...What is surprising is how convincingly she plays an Irishwoman in her Broadway debut...The erratic, or at least elastic nature of the script almost doesn't matter, though, because the dialogue is so colorful (the college-aged victims of an auto wreck are said to be found with a 'badger licking the blood' off their bodies - hey, this is an Irish play) and the acting so sharp, that the 95-minute, intermission-less rom-com, or whatever-this-is, seems to fly by.",
