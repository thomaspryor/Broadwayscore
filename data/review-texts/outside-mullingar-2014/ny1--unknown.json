  "bwwExcerpt": "Shanley has captured a very authentic voice with these characters. The lonely gentleman farmer, the plain-spoken, dry-humored elders and the spunky girl next door may at first seem to be standard types, but Shanley has nicely shaded them in. And Doug Hughes' immaculate production provides a very satisfying emotional arc.",
