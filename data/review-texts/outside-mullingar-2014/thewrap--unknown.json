  "bwwExcerpt": "Far more the stage veteran, the supremely talented O'Byrne is oddly colorless here - until the final scene when he hesitatingly describes himself in tremulous voice as a 'honey bee' and Rosemary as a 'flower.' Somehow, as the way it is played here under Doug Hughes's direction, Anthony comes off as a violet to Rosemary's hornet. While many in the audience made it clear that they found this scene both hilarious and touching, others may applaud in relief at the Delayed Curtain.",
