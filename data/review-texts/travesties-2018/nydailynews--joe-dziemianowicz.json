  "bwwExcerpt": "Broadway's spry revival of 'Travesties' is guaranteed to work your gray matter. Its author is brainy British playwright Tom Stoppard; that's how he rolls. The happy bonus of the brightly acted Roundabout production at the American Airlines Theater is how often the 1974 comedy engages one's smile muscles.",
