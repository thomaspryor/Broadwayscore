  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Patrick Marber must be commended for enlivening the high-brow farce with delightfully madcap interludes. The performances are striking. The ability alone to memorize and recite all that madcap material is impressive enough. But these multi-talented thespians do it with such zesty effortlessness, they make it all seem like so much fun.",
