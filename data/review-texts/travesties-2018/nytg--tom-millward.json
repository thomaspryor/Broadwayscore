  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"You don't need to know a lot to enjoy this entertaining and thought-provoking piece of theater. It's that this is a play about memory, art, revolution and OK, a little history...Hollander gives a tour de force performance as Carr...Marber deserves credit for the tight, brisk and specific production...Truly, there are so many levels on which you can enjoy this work. I recommend that you strap yourself in and go for the ride. You won’t regret it.\"\n\nRead more",
