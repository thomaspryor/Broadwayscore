  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Tom Stoppard's 'Travesties' will seem totally obscure to those unprepared, delicious for those who are. A challenging comedy of ideas on art, politics and memory, 'Travesties' will prove caviar to the general but intoxicating theater for those who are disposed to its intricacies. Tom Hollander and company do a superb job of a play that does not easily give up its secrets. This is a literary play that it either completely opaque or as obvious as an open book depending on your preparation.\"\n\nRead more",
