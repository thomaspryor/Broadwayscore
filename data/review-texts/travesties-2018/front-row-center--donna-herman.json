  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Stoppard is a wordy intellectual...He likes to grapple with big questions and themes...In 'Travesties,' he does it with wit, humor and through the lens of the absurd...You don’t need to know a lot to enjoy this entertaining and thought-provoking piece of theater. It’s that this is a play about memory, art, revolution, and a little history...Truly, there are so many levels on which you can enjoy this work. I recommend that you strap yourself in and go for the ride. You won’t regret it.\"\n\nRead more",
