  "bwwExcerpt": "That about-face joke perfectly captures Stoppard's wry humor. But it also illustrates his back-handed way of questioning (or is it mocking?) his own artistic attempt to address the subject of war within the context of farce. What's funny about war; or, for that matter, what's funny about social revolution, which both claim human lives? Even when the artist dares to grapple with such a question, doesn't it all seem like, well, a Dadaist joke?",
