  "bwwExcerpt": "It may be easier to inventory what the Broadway revival of Tom Stoppard's 1974 tour de force isn't about than what it is: A gushing waterfall of wordplay, a fine-tuned literary torrent that only begins by covering love, sex, war, memory, and Marxism. Also James Joyce, Dada, the fine art of men's tailoring, and The Importance of Being Earnest.",
