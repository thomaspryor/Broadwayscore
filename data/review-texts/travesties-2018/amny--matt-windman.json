  "bwwExcerpt": "Good luck making sense of 'Travesties,' Tom Stoppard's difficult, diffuse and dense 1974 comedy of faulty memory and early 20th century European history and culture, which has returned to Broadway in a robust revival produced originally by London's Menier Chocolate Factory and brought to New York by the Roundabout Theatre Company.'",
