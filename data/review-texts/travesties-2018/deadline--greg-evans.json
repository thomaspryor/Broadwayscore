  "bwwExcerpt": "Tom Stoppard's Tony-winning 1974 play Travesties, stuffed thick as a English gentleman's armchair, its ideas on art, war, patriotism and purposeful nonsense fashioned into a nonstop tourney of wit and erudition, has often been called a brainteaser, but brain tickler comes so much closer to the jubilant staging presented by Broadway's Roundabout Theatre Company.",
