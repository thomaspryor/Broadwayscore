However, the review is brief, leading to medium confidence. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language, calling Hollander's performance a \"tour de force\" and the play \"brilliant.\" This indicates a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives ('tour de force,' 'brilliant') to praise both the lead performance and the play itself without reservation, indicating an enthusiastic recommendation despite the excerpt's brevity. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
