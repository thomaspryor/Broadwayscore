However, the review is brief, so confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review praises Tom Hollander's performance as a 'tour de force' and calls the play 'brilliant,' indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs unqualified superlatives ('tour de force', 'brilliant') with no reservations, indicating strong enthusiasm for the production. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
