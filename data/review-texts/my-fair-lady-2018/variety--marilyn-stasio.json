  "bwwExcerpt": "If you've got it, flaunt it. The splendid Beaumont stage at Lincoln Center was made for great classic musicals like Lerner and Loewe's 'My Fair Lady,' and helmer Bartlett Sher was born to stage them. This jubilant revival is meticulously mounted and entirely welcome - despite the eccentric casting choice of Lauren Ambrose as Eliza Doolittle.",

The phrase \"making some subtle but meaningful adjustments\" suggests a positive reinterpretation, but the reference to \"retrograde sexual politics\" indicates a reservation. | Kimi: The critic uses enthusiastic language ('sumptuous,' 'reverence due a classic') to praise the production's quality and thoughtful modernization of the material, indicating a strong recommendation despite the brevity of the excerpt.",
