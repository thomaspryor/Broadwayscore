  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A grand, first rate, feminist revival of Lerner and Loewe’s classic musical, 'My Fair Lady.' Perfectly keyed to this moment while honoring the greatness of its text and score, director Bartlett Sher hits another home run, and Lauren Ambrose and Harry Hadden-Paton give smashing, revolutionary performances as Eliza Doolittle and Professor Higgins. A great revival of a great musical to end the season on a high note.\"\n\nRead more",
