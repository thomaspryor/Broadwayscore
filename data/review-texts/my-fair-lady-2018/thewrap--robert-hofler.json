  "bwwExcerpt": "This visual splendor would amount to nothing more than a momentary 'Wow!' if Sher hadn't imbued the Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe classic with performances that vividly conjure up George Bernard Shaw's original characters. Yes, the playwright never wanted his 'Pygmalion' turned into a musical or a romance, but Sher's take on 'My Fair Lady' brings the show closer to what the playwright had in mind.",
