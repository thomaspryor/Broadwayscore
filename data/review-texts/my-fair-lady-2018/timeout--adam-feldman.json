  "bwwExcerpt": "The musical pulls out all the stops for a raucous production number, 'Get Me to the Church on Time,' which marks the begrudging transformation of Eliza's father (Norbert Leo Butz, with his usual impatience de vivre) from ne'er-do-well to well-to-do. But its default mode is elegance. Sher is acutely alert to the shifts of balance within both My Fair Lady itself and the way it plays to contemporary audiences, and nowhere is that clearer than in his clever solution to the show's notoriously slippery ending. This revival has devised a way to have its scone and eat it too.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic's own 80 rating aligns with positive territory. Language like 'delivers the goods with style and warmth' and 'crowd-pleaser' indicates clear recommendation despite noting it 'plays things relatively safe.' | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as a 'crowd-pleaser' with 'style and warmth,' indicating a positive recommendation. The original rating of 80 aligns with a solid positive score. | Gemini: The review is positive, calling the revival \"handsome\" and \"well-sung\" and a \"crowd-pleaser.\" The phrase \"plays things relatively safe\" indicates a reservation, placing it in the positive bucket but not at the very top. | Kimi: The critic's own 80/100 rating aligns with the review's praise for the revival as 'handsome,' 'well-sung,' and a 'crowd-pleaser' that 'delivers the goods,' indicating a solid positive recommendation despite playing things safe.",
