Photo: Joan Marcus/©2018 Joan Marcus A week ago, I wrote about my problems with the current Broadway revival of a very well-loved musical. If shows like Carousel, My Fair Lady, and Kiss Me Kate want to avoid getting shelved, I argued, then they’ve got to be approached with new points of view, with — to put it bluntly — a basic awareness of the world we’re living in today. As if upon command, Bartlett Sher’s glowing revival of Lerner and Loewe’s My Fair Lady has arrived at Lincoln Center to prove that it can be done. A beloved musical from another era can keep on kicking, and, as is the case here, it can even do so without making radical shifts in aesthetic, as long as it’s got its eyes wide open.\n\nGranted, Sher and his company — led by the luminous Lauren Ambrose in an intrepid, intelligently scored performance — have an advantage over their clam-baking colleagues: Their source material is already relatively self-aware. Alan Jay Lerner adapted the book of My Fair Lady from George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion, a complex social comedy about class and gender (more deliberately about class) that started giving its author headaches as soon as it hit the London stage. Shaw never intended his protagonists — the undaunted Cockney flower-girl, Eliza Doolittle, and the self-satisfied phonetics professor, Henry Higgins, who teaches her to speak “like a lady” — to end up romantically linked.\n\nShow \n 10 Comments / 10 New\n \n Comment\n \n\n Theater Review: An Unaccustomed New Approach to My Fair Lady\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n Your product is saved!
