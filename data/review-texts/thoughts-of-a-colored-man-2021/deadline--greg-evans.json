  "bwwExcerpt": "ixing spoken word, slam poetry, laugh-out-loud comedy, drama and razor-sharp dialogue, Scott's words are met with Steve H. Broadnax III's directorial flourishes that are so lovely they elicit gasps. Both playwright and director are Broadway newcomers, and their Thoughts of a Colored Man is a marvel from start to finish.",
