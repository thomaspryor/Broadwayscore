  "bwwExcerpt": "It's a question that Scott's Broadway debut, which opened on Wednesday night at the John Golden Theater, doesn't quite know how to answer. Incorporating slam poetry, prose and songs performed by its cast of seven, 'Thoughts of a Colored Man,' which first premiered in 2019 at Syracuse Stage in a co-production with Baltimore Center Stage, aspires to be a lyrical reckoning with Black life in America but only delivers a gussied-up string of straw-man lessons.",
