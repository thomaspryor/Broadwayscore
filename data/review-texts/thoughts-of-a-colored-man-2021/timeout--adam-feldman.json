  "bwwExcerpt": "Under Steve H. Broadnax III's artful direction, however, the cast avoids falling too neatly into types, and Depression and Happiness emerge with particular individual clarity. When the play is at its best-when the rhythms kick into place, and the details pop, and the language sharpens to a cutting edge-one is grateful for the voices that Scott has brought to Broadway.",
