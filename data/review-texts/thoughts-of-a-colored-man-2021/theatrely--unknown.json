  "bwwExcerpt": "The play's title, loose structure, and code-named characters bring to mind For Colored Girls, Ntozake Shange's landmark 1975 choreopoem that similarly explores the trials and tribulations of American people of color. That brilliant exercise in communal triumph and warmth in the face of unceasing adversity, however, hits the raw nerve of confession-of words feared to be uttered, but necessary for survival and understanding. Scott's play is not without its moments, but is otherwise a rote recitation with little at stake.",
