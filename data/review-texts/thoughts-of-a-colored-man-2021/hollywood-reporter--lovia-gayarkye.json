  "bwwExcerpt": "Thoughts of a Colored Man is the kind of play I make excuses for. The Broadway production of Keenan Scott II's new work is a study of Black masculinity and 'blends spoken word, slam poetry, rhythm and humor' to tell the stories of a group of Black men living in Brooklyn. Based on this description alone, it sounds like the kind of project - experimental in structure, bold in vision and written and directed by Black people - that I want to succeed in the glaringly white world of theater. And yet, days after seeing this entertaining but emotionally inert play, I am resistant to passing judgment, plagued by the ways it fell short for me.",
