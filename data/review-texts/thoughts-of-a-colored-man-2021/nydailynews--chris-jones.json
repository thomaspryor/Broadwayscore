  "bwwExcerpt": "I'd argue that the piece actually could use yet more of those titular thoughts on the state of the nation, of New York City, of Black America. It's striking that the characters are named after emotions rather than ideas, although there certainly are examples of both here. It also could range yet deeper when it comes to exploring the clash of what we might think of as traditional values, such as the centering influence of church or community, versus new overtly secular notions of socialism, gender complexities and intersectionality, flowing out of college campuses and now fighting for influence with the Black men of New York, as every election reveals.",
