  "bwwExcerpt": "A happy surprise of 'Thoughts of a Colored Man,' which opened Wednesday night on Broadway, is that it's much more entertaining than its portentous and literary-sounding title would suggest. What you expect to resemble a book from a college syllabus actually gets belly laughs and a tear or two. And at 90 minutes, the show is not a second too long or short. Keenan Scott II's new play at the Golden Theatre, with refreshing warmth, gives us what it promises: the internal musings of a group of New York black men.",
