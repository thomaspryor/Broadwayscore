This suggests neither recommendation nor strong discouragement. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'mediocre' and lacking substance, indicating a negative verdict without strong redeeming qualities. | Gemini: The review states that the show is still more foundation than substance, indicating a lack of depth despite improvements. This suggests a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the Broadway production as superficial ('more foundation than substance') and maintains that despite improvements since Chicago, it remains mediocre with no recommendation to see it.",
