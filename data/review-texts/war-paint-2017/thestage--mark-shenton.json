  "bwwExcerpt": "The fierce, always formidable lightning rod that is Patti LuPone, plays a heavily accented, not always vocally distinct Rubinstein, while the vital, vivacious Christine Ebersole plays Arden. The production becomes a spellbinding study in the competition of wills. It also explores the difficulties of that their confidantes - Douglas Sills as Rubinstein's gay associate and John Dossett as Arden's husband - faced, as men in a women's world. Michael Greif's production is a multi-layered, extraordinarily textured story of the business of beauty and fashion that lets the women put, as the show has it, their best faces forward. As Arden says, 'Every woman has a God-given right to loveliness!'",
