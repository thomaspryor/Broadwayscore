  "bwwExcerpt": "'War Paint' may not be one of the great musicals, but it is an enormously satisfying one. Yes, it is a showcase for established artists hungry for new material. But the show, sleekly and compassionately directed by Michael Greif and created by the team that made the haunting 'Grey Gardens,' looks at American women from 1934 to 1964 through a new lens - from the lives of two business titans who took lipstick from harlots to high society.",
