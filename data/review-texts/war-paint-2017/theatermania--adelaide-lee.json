  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"LuPone and Ebersole are wonderfully suited to play the two titans…LuPone is as powerful as she has ever been…By the end of Act 1 the rhythms grow predictable...When the pace slows down enough for the characters to speak to one another, their dialogue is moving and engaging. Frankel and Korie's songs are exquisite, and perfectly performed...While 'War Paint' needs some contouring, all the elements of an excellent musical are onstage. It should absolutely not be missed.\"\n\nRead more",
