  "bwwExcerpt": "The last half-hour or so of War Paint, the beguiling but frustrating new musical about beauty legends Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden, is just about everything you could want from a Broadway show. The two leads - Patti LuPone as Rubinstein and Christine Ebersole as Arden - each get a gorgeous, perfectly conceived solo: 'Forever Beautiful' for LuPone and 'Pink' for Ebersole. Then comes a rueful duet finale ('Beauty in the World') to complete the arc of their double biography with some twin-engine vocalizing.",
