  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Ms. Ebersole and Ms. LuPone go a great distance in disguising the show’s essential sameness. Ms. LuPone is as imposing as Rubinstein must have been, and presumably a whole lot funnier. Ms. Ebersole is equally formidable in a lighter vein. And Frankel and Korie have written numbers for their stars that cannily play to their separate but equal strengths…So, though my eyes occasionally glazed seeing ‘War Paint,’ I wouldn’t have missed it, if only to hear its leading ladies’ climactic ballads.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic acknowledges flaws ('essential sameness,' 'eyes occasionally glazed') but concludes they 'wouldn't have missed it' and praises the leading performances. This is a qualified positive recommendation, but the single excerpt warning and admission of boredom keeps it at the lower end of Positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of the leading ladies and the songs written for them, suggesting a positive experience despite some reservations about the show's 'sameness'. The recommendation is mild, with specific praise for the stars' performances. | Gemini: The reviewer acknowledges some issues ('eyes occasionally glazed') but ultimately states they 'wouldn’t have missed it,' indicating a positive, though qualified, recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise, noting the show's 'essential sameness' and occasionally glazing eyes, but ultimately recommends seeing it specifically for the formidable performances of Ebersole and LuPone. Given this is a single excerpt, the score reflects a cautious lower-positive range.",
