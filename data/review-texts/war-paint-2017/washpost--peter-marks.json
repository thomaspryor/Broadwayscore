  "bwwExcerpt": "That 'War Paint' takes pains to reveal this parallel emptiness speaks to one of the musical's worthiest achievements: making room on a stage, to a degree virtually never seen, for star turns by two sublime female veterans of the musical theater. When Rubinstein and Arden were in their 60s, they were nowhere near ready to be ushered into the wings. And neither, thank goodness, are LuPone and Ebersole.",

Classic pattern of performer praise not redeeming overall disappointment. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges strong performances but ultimately criticizes the show as 'overstuffed and undercooked', indicating a negative overall verdict. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that even the talented performers cannot save the show, indicating a negative overall assessment. The phrases 'overstuffed and undercooked' further reinforce this negative view. | Kimi: While acknowledging the 'powerhouse' talents of its stars, the critic explicitly states they cannot salvage a production that is 'overstuffed and undercooked,' delivering a clear verdict against seeing the show.",
