  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The sad truth is that the new show is boring…The musical goes on too long and, it’s easy to lose interest unless the two stars are onstage…Ebersole gives a solid performance and has a beautiful voice but Lupone’s character is the more caustic of the two, so she gets to deliver the best comic zingers…There are several unnecessary scenes that prolong the musical…If you are an Ebersole or Lupone fan, you will love listening and watching the incredible ladies onstage.”\n\nRead more",
