  "bwwExcerpt": "One of the best scenes is the finale: an invention of the authors, in which Rubinstein and Arden finally meet for the first time ever while in a green room before a speaking engagement. Years have passed - both women walk a bit slower; Arden carries a cane - and after huffs and puffs, in their own way, the moguls come to an understanding. They compare lipstick application tips, admit to - gasp! - admiring each other's products, and finally sing in unison, questioning whether they helped to free or enslave women.",
