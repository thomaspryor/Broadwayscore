  "bwwExcerpt": "Legendary talents Patti LuPone and Christine Ebersole play rival cosmetics titans in a highly anticipated new musical that -- hear this, clearly -- is not a two-act cat fight between dueling so-called divas, but rather a smart portrayal of the obstacles faced by a pair of America's earliest female entrepreneurs. 'War Paint,' directed by Michael Greif ('Dear Evan Hansen') and now open at the Nederlander Theatre, benefits foremost from the remarkable symmetry between its leads.",
