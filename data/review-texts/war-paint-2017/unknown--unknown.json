  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Ms. Ebersole and Ms. LuPone go a great distance in disguising the show’s essential sameness. Ms. LuPone is as imposing as Rubinstein must have been, and presumably a whole lot funnier. Ms. Ebersole is equally formidable in a lighter vein. And Frankel and Korie have written numbers for their stars that cannily play to their separate but equal strengths…So, though my eyes occasionally glazed seeing ‘War Paint,’ I wouldn’t have missed it, if only to hear its leading ladies’ climactic ballads.”\n\nRead more",

Praises lead performances but acknowledges show's 'essential sameness.' | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of Ms. Ebersole and Ms. LuPone, suggesting the show is worth seeing for their climactic ballads despite some reservations about the show's 'essential sameness'. The positive mention of the stars' performances suggests a mild recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the performances of the leading ladies and their numbers, but also mentions that the reviewer's eyes occasionally glazed over. This suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic notes the show's 'essential sameness' and moments of boredom ('eyes occasionally glazed'), the final verdict 'I wouldn't have missed it' constitutes a qualified recommendation, primarily for the star performances.",
