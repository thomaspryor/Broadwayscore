  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Incandescently portraying the warring women are LuPone and Ebersole…The show works equally well as an unspooling period piece…Two 11 o’clock numbers suit the headliners’ individualized magic…Unfortunately at times ‘War Paint’ goes no deeper than the title…Happily, the vast vulnerability and awesome actuality that these beautiful belters evoke rescues the musical from its static situations…Our dynamic duo make their vehicle a blast from the past and a thing of beauty.”\n\nRead more",
