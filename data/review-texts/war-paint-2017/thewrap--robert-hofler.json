  "bwwExcerpt": "'War Paint' is never better than when it puts its two heroines in the same space and mind set. Also exquisite is 'Pink,' which is Arden's 'Is that all there is?' moment. These songwriters are good at the reflective; they know how to get under a character's skin and make us feel her pain, as well as her fierce determination.",
