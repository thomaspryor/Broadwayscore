    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic finds the revival 'dramatically inert' and says it 'never generates the heat' - clear negative assessment despite acknowledging it's 'sweet-natured'. Single excerpt limits confidence but the verdict is clearly unfavorable. | GPT-4o: The review describes the revival as 'sweet-natured' but 'dramatically inert,' indicating a lack of strong recommendation. The use of 'never generates the heat' suggests it falls short of expectations, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the production as \"dramatically inert\" and failing to generate heat, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt presents a balanced but lukewarm assessment, acknowledging the production's gentle charm ('sweet-natured') while criticizing its fundamental lack of dramatic energy and vitality ('dramatically inert'). Without a clear recommendation to attend and with significant reservations about the show's impact, the review falls into mixed territory. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",
