    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows acknowledgment of good elements ('impressive individual contributions') but overall disappointment that it 'never quite captures the magic.' This suggests neither recommendation nor strong discouragement - a mixed verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a negative verdict, noting the revival fails to capture the original's magic despite some positive elements. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, but the overall tone is not positive. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (\"impressive individual contributions\") but ultimately finds the revival lacking compared to the original, indicating a mixed assessment. Given that only one excerpt is available, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges strong individual performances, the overall verdict is that the production falls short of the original's quality, constituting a disappointing revival rather than a recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
