    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for McDonald's 'powerhouse performance' with 'vocal magnificence and emotional depth' suggests positive recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Audra McDonald's performance with strong language ('powerhouse', 'vocal magnificence', 'emotional depth'), suggesting a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on Audra McDonald's 'powerhouse performance' and 'vocal magnificence,' indicating a strong positive element. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Audra McDonald's performance ('powerhouse,' 'vocal magnificence'), suggesting the revival is worth seeing for her work. However, given this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's assessment of other production elements, confidence is low and the score reflects positive but not rave-level recommendation.",
