Single excerpt warning applies - this could be from a longer mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show lacks sufficient quality to warrant a Broadway revival, indicating a negative assessment. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The critic states the show isn't bad, but also not good enough to justify a revival, indicating a mixed opinion. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the production is competent ('isn't a bad show') but delivers a clear negative verdict that it fails to merit a Broadway revival, recommending against the production. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
