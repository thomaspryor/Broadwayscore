  "bwwExcerpt": "That's partly because this gripping piece of docudrama - the three-act script is by the Italian writer Stefano Massini as adapted by Ben Power and directed by Sam Mendes - is so precise in its storytelling. It's partly because the Broadway cast is made of three masterful British actors in Simon Russell Beale, Adrian Lester and Adam Godley, playing successive generations of Lehmans running the firm as it morphed from a tatty fabric store in Montgomery, Ala., to a glittering titan of Wall Street.But it's mostly because this show, an import from Britain's National Theatre and far and away the best thing I've seen on any stage since before the start of the pandemic, is determined to explore the story of the Lehman Brothers from myriad angles.",
