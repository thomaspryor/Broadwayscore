    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'monumental work' and 'gripping' aligns with critic's 80 rating. However, extremely brief text limits confidence in full assessment. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 80 aligns with a strong positive recommendation, and the review text describes the show as 'monumental' and 'gripping', indicating a solid endorsement. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"monumental\" and \"gripping\" to describe the show, indicating a positive recommendation. The critic's rating of 80 supports this classification. | Kimi: The critic's explicit 80/100 rating places this in the Positive bucket, and the review describes the show as a 'monumental work' that is 'gripping' and 'intimate', indicating strong praise without reaching the highest ecstasy of a rave.",
