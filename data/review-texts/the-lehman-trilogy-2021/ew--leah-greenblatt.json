  "bwwExcerpt": "As deeply flawed as its many characters can be - ornery and petty and blind to their own faults - the story rarely deigns to judge them. Instead, it lets them simply exist in the context of the dreams they're chasing and the crashing convergence of events that marked the century and a half their narratives move through: Civil Wars, stock-market crashes, all the ordinary loves and losses that make up a life. 'Money is a ghost. Money is numbers. Money is air,' one character declares ruefully, somewhere late in the third act. Whatever billions were lost on paper - and how ever many essential truths about the Lehmans have been lost to history - this Trilogy finds the thrill in letting them live again on stage: the heart, the hand, and the potato, spinning myth (and cotton) into gold.",
