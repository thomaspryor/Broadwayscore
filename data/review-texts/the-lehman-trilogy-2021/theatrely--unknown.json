  "bwwExcerpt": "A medium of breathtaking modernity with European roots but American escalation, the birth of film soon begat The Birth of a Nation, that infamous and, unfortunately, impactful false narrative about White advancement in this country. Through the score-an invaluable part of the production-The Lehman Trilogy seems to say that modernity, and its corresponding progress, must always be followed by vile selfishness.",
