  "bwwExcerpt": "One of the reasons we expect so much out of Broadway shows is that they cost so much to see. Nicky Silver's 'The Lyons,' which transferred to Broadway this week, is a clever little dysfunctional-family comedy that contains at least twice its fair share of laughs. Though it's more than a bit of a mess, 'The Lyons' has its moments, and Linda Lavin, the star, is in sensational form. Off Broadway, that amounted to a passable bargain—but is it really worth $126.50 to see an amusing but inconsistent show? All I can tell you is that despite its extreme unevenness, 'The Lyons' is never boring.",
