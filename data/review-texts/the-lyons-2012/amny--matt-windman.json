  "bwwExcerpt": "As a dysfunctional family drama, 'The Lyons' is hardly as penetrating as 'Clybourne Park' or 'Other Desert Cities.' But as directed by Mark Brokaw, it's entertaining and full of witty one-liners. Lavin delivers a wild performance marked by wide facial expressions, an often screeching voice and kooky personality. She is nicely supported by an emaciated Latessa, tortured Grant and seemingly helpless Esper.",
