    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed signals - acknowledges Washington's 'commanding performance' and 'gripping' elements, but expresses confusion with 'too baffling'. The contradictory nature suggests ambivalence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a strong performance but also hints at confusion or lack of clarity, indicating a mixed impression. The single excerpt and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performance but also notes that it is \"too baffling,\" indicating a mixed reaction. Given the single excerpt and truncated nature, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance ('commanding,' 'gripping') but criticizes the content as 'too baffling,' indicating significant reservations without a clear recommendation to see or skip the show.",
