  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Gyllenhaal, who plays Iago, certainly gives the Moor of Venice plenty to fight against, if he chose to do so. Here is far and away the most dynamic performance of the night, a riveting, turbo-charged interpretation that avoids any and all villainous cliches, or flowery self-doubts, and just presents a malevolent but highly effective military guy who sets out to do what he wants to straightforwardly do, a train hurtling down a track, gaining speed with every scene, determined to knock the Othello and Desdemona carriage into the ditch.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for Gyllenhaal's performance with vivid, enthusiastic language ('riveting', 'turbo-charged', 'far and away the most dynamic'). However, this is only one excerpt focusing on a single performance, so confidence is low as the overall verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Gyllenhaal's performance as dynamic and riveting, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment of the review is uncertain, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on Gyllenhaal's performance as Iago, calling it the most dynamic of the night and praising its interpretation. Given the single excerpt, I am placing it in the positive bucket with a high score. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains enthusiastic praise for Gyllenhaal's performance ('riveting', 'turbo-charged', 'most dynamic'), suggesting a positive recommendation despite limited context.",
