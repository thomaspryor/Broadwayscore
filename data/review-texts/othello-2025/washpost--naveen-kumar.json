  "bwwExcerpt": "It pains me to say, as an admirer of thorny texts and risk-taking celebrities onstage, that “Othello” offers scant reward, even if your only sacrifice were time — and even that is arguably too precious. What does “Othello” have to say about “the near future,” where a projection at the outset places us? It’s a question that, by its own admission, the first Broadway revival in more than 40 years needs to contend with. But this staging from director Kenny Leon offers little provocation to suggest it’s even worth asking.",
