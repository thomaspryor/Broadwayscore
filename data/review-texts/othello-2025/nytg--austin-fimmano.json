  "fullText": "Read our review of Othello on Broadway, a revival of Shakespeare's tragedy directed by Tony Award winner Kenny Leon, at the Barrymore Theatre through June. It’s a season of Shakespearean tragedies. On the heels of starry New York productions of King Lear and Romeo + Juliet from the fall, director Kenny Leon’s hotly anticipated production of Othello is finally on Broadway. With Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal in the storied roles of Othello and Iago, it promises the showdown of a lifetime in this tragedy about a military commander whose fatal flaw is trusting everyone except his own wife. However, Washington’s approach to the character is competent but largely dispassionate. Besides having a bit of the swagger of new love, his Othello is mostly tempered with fatigue — whether of war, leading, or even age, it’s hard to say. Othello himself admits that he is “declined into the vale of years,” and Washington, aged 70, seems to lean into references to the character's age. In the play’s final, tragic scene when he murders his wife, Washington’s Othello is oddly cold and matter-of-fact, as if emotionally resigned to the deed he believes he must do. Opposite him is Gyllenhaal as Othello’s Macchiavellian underling driven by jealousy and resentment. For his first foray into Shakespeare, Gyllenhaal is a natural. He handles Iago’s lines — and there are plenty — with an effortless, accessible cadence, and he confides in the audiences through soliloquies with the ease of Jim Halpert shrugging at the camera. It’s not hard to believe this sweet-faced Iago has everyone fooled into thinking him the most honest man in the army. In Leon's stark production, the military setting is emphasized for modern audiences by having the soldiers (including Othello) almost always wearing army fatigues. This choice also visually reminds us that Desdemona, usually dressed in crisp outfits like a statesman’s wife, is an outsider in this world. Casting the 27-year-old Molly Osborne as Desdemona creates a striking age difference between her and her new husband, but Osborne has an easy chemistry with Washington that makes the match work. All this casts an even darker light on the character’s tragic death. For all its star power and chemistry between the leads (Washington-Gyllenhaal and Washington-Osborne), however, not much of this production is particularly original or groundbreaking. Standout Kimber Elayne Sprawl is a breath of fresh air as a whip-smart Emilia. But setting aside the excitement of a beloved lead in an iconic role, Leon’s buttoned-up production is a perfectly enjoyable, if not particularly memorable Othello. One of Shakespeare’s great tragedies, Othello begins on the night when Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army, elopes with Desdemona, a Venetian senator’s daughter. Meanwhile, Othello’s ensign, Iago, is upset because Othello has passed him over for a promotion to lieutenant. Iago begins scheming to take down Othello and his new bride, along with anyone else he thinks has wronged him. He weaves a web of lies behind everyone’s backs, leaving no prisoners while still pretending to love and support Othello. Leon’s Othello is set vaguely in “the near future,” a move that must invite comparisons between the pointed language Othello’s colleagues use to describe him and the current political climate. The production is visually austere, but the relatively minimalist set — made up of large columns, a raised walkway, and not much else — reveals its depth as the columns move to change the layout of each scene. This design by Derek McLane, combined with the lighting design of Natasha Katz, ensure that each scene is distinct despite the lack of props in most. For this production, all audience members must turn off their phones and lock them in Yondr pouches (provided by the theatre) until the end of the show. At the time of publication, Othello has a 54% audience approval rating on Show-Score, with mixed reviews from theatregoers. Read more audience reviews of Othello on Show-Score. Kenny Leon’s production is a valiant stab at bringing the Bard to Broadway, but even with the mass appeal of its two powerhouse leads, this Othello struggles to distinguish itself.
