  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Directed by Tony winner Kenny Leon, who guided Washington to a Tony in 2010's Fences, this austere, underwhelming take on Shakespeare seems to acknowledge that people are not paying for a revival of this particular play, which hasn't been on Broadway since 1982 and still has rich insights on the masculinity, human fallibility and race over 400 years after its debut. Instead, it's for the opportunity to see Gyllenhaal, one of the most versatile and thrilling millennial actors, and especially the widely beloved Washington, rightly hailed in the Playbill as \"the most lauded stage and screen actor of his generation\", without the mediation of a screen.\""
