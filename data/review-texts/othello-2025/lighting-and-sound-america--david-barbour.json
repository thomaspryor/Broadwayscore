    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The quote suggests the performances feel rehearsed rather than authentic, which is a significant criticism. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a lack of engagement or authenticity in the performances, indicating a negative impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a lack of genuine performance, indicating a negative experience. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the performance as seeming under-rehearsed and mechanical, suggesting a fundamental lack of polish in the production. While a single excerpt may not capture the full review, this specific criticism indicates the critic found the acting quality disappointing.",
