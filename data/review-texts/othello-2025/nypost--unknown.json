However, this is only one excerpt, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative experience, with audiences struggling to find engagement and resorting to laughter out of place. The tone implies disappointment, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review suggests the play is not enjoyable and that the audience is struggling to find something to appreciate. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic describes the production as a 'long, chilly ride' where audiences struggle to engage, laughing inappropriately due to lack of emotional connection, suggesting it fails to deliver the intended dramatic impact despite the high ticket prices.",
