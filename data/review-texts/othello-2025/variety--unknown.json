  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Clumsily staged by director Kenny Leon, this \"Othello\" seems to have little on its mind beyond a gritted-teeth determination to carry across the text of the play. \"Othello\" is \"Othello\"  one of the richest and most wrenching of Shakespeare's tragedies. It would take a wildly misbegotten production to spoil it entirely. But that hypothetical wildly misbegotten production might contain some genuinely big risks; this production, instead, simply falls flat.\"",
