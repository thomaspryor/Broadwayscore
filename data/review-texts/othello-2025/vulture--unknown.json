    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative assessment calling the production 'passionless' and 'disconcertingly sleepy and beige,' but confidence is low due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'passionless' and 'disconcertingly sleepy and beige,' indicating a negative assessment. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the production as \"passionless,\" \"sleepy,\" and \"beige,\" indicating a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic describes the production as passionless, sleepy, and beige, indicating a lifeless staging that fails to engage emotionally, warranting a clear recommendation against seeing the show.",
