    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: This single excerpt expresses confusion and disconnection from the production despite acknowledging its power. The critic feels the show's force but doesn't understand its purpose, suggesting a mixed but leaning negative experience. Low confidence due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, indicating confusion and lack of understanding of the production's purpose. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic states that they grasped the production's aims less and less, indicating a negative experience. Given this single excerpt and the negative sentiment, I've classified it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates the critic found the production heavy-handed yet increasingly unclear, suggesting it fails to effectively convey its intentions. This confusion represents a significant criticism of the production's clarity and direction.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "In short, as I felt the production’s blunt force more and more, I grasped its aura and aims less and less. “Othello,” unique among Shakespeare’s tragedies, is lean. (It’s even leaner in this production, thanks to some judicious cutting.) It has fewer major characters than most, and fewer sideshows. (Among the cuts: the annoying clown.) Its poetry is extraordinary. And though four principals die, all ultimately by Iago’s hand or influence, it does not tumble indiscriminately toward the blood bath. The deaths are specific and necessary to its themes. Leon’s “Othello” gets all that, except the themes. A good enough bargain, I suppose — or would be, except that center orchestra tickets are selling for $921. You could spend a lot less — or a lot more — to learn the sad truth “Othello” dramatizes: that those who choose to assume the best in people are most vulnerable to the worst. Innocence is ignorance, certainty a death wish. In a world (and on a stage) that loves not wisely but too well, Iago will always win.",
