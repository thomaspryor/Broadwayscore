    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: This single excerpt expresses confusion and disconnection from the production despite acknowledging its power. The critic feels the show's force but doesn't understand its purpose, suggesting a mixed but leaning negative experience. Low confidence due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, indicating confusion and lack of understanding of the production's purpose. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic states that they grasped the production's aims less and less, indicating a negative experience. Given this single excerpt and the negative sentiment, I've classified it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates the critic found the production heavy-handed yet increasingly unclear, suggesting it fails to effectively convey its intentions. This confusion represents a significant criticism of the production's clarity and direction.",
