The critic is struggling to understand the show's purpose. However, with only one curated quote, the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, indicating a disconnect between the production's impact and its intended message. However, with only a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a negative experience, indicating a lack of understanding and appreciation for the production's goals. | Kimi: The excerpt suggests the production has physical impact but lacks clarity of purpose, with the critic becoming increasingly confused about its intentions as the show progressed. Given only a single curated excerpt is available, the confidence is low.",
