    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt uses 'deflates' and 'tiresome pattern' indicating disappointment with the show's handling of romantic relationships. However, with only one negative fragment available, confidence is low as the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a significant flaw in the show, describing it as 'deflated' by a 'tiresome pattern,' indicating a negative assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is negative, stating that something \"really deflates\" the show. Given the single excerpt and negative tone, I'm placing it in the negative bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The single available excerpt identifies significant structural flaws, describing the romantic subplot pattern as 'tiresome' and stating it 'deflates' the production, indicating clear disappointment. However, given this is only one curated excerpt, confidence is low regarding the full review's sentiment.",
