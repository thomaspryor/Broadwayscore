  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "As bio-musicals go, A Wonderful World doesn't break any new ground, and the book by Aurin Squire is pretty much by-the-numbers, hitting most of the highs and lows spanning 70 years in Armstrong's storied career. But as conceived by Andrew Delaplaine along with Christopher Renshaw (who also directed), there's so much charm, artistry and buoyant entertainment here that we are riveted for the entirety of the show's two and a half hour running time.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Acknowledges formula limitations but emphasizes strong positives (charm, artistry, riveting entertainment). Single excerpt warning requires caution - this sounds clearly positive so scoring at upper end of positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the charm, artistry, and entertainment value of the show, indicating a strong positive impression despite noting the book is 'by-the-numbers'. The single excerpt suggests a positive verdict, so a score in the upper end of the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The review states that the show doesn't break new ground and the book is by-the-numbers, but it also says there's a lot of charm, artistry, and buoyant entertainment that keeps the audience riveted. Given the single excerpt and the positive tone, I'm placing it in the Positive bucket with a score of 79. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the conventional book and lack of innovation, but praises the production's abundant charm, artistry, and entertainment value, noting that the show remains captivating throughout its runtime.",
