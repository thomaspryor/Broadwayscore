  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "As bio-musicals go, A Wonderful World doesn't break any new ground, and the book by Aurin Squire is pretty much by-the-numbers, hitting most of the highs and lows spanning 70 years in Armstrong's storied career. But as conceived by Andrew Delaplaine along with Christopher Renshaw (who also directed), there's so much charm, artistry and buoyant entertainment here that we are riveted for the entirety of the show's two and a half hour running time.",
