The absence of strong positive or negative language supports a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses phrases like \"tends toward the same blocking and gestures\" and \"played as straight as possible\", suggesting a lack of originality and excitement, leading to a negative assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production for relying on standard bio-musical conventions ('same blocking and gestures,' 'common bio-musical trope') and lacking clear intention, suggesting a disappointing but not disastrous execution. With only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low.",
