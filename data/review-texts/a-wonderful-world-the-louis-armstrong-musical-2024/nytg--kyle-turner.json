  "fullText": "Read our review of A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical on Broadway, playing at Studio 54 and featuring many of the jazz legend's greatest hits. Bio-musicals — those that use a person’s songs to tell their life story — have become a staple of Broadway theatre in the way a hamburger is a staple of a diner menu. Rarely are they exceptional, but they are often palatable, with the safety net of (usually) beloved songs from the past if all else fails. But once in a while, a bio-musical exceeds expectations and, even within the confines of its genre, has enough pizzazz to be an exception to the rule. A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical, now at Studio 54 has old-fashioned, gleeful tap numbers, ensemble dance lines, and superb musical sequences of classic big-band jazz, but there are also moments of surprising subversiveness. While tracing the life of trumpeting jazz icon Louis Armstrong — with James Monroe Iglehart breathing an air of beguiling, befuddled naivete into the musician — A Wonderful World refuses to look away from the racism that latched its claws into Armstrong's career, from him watching former band members be brutalized by bigots in New Orleans to navigating the Hollywood industry that helped make Armstrong the King of Jazz. Iglehart’s Armstrong wants to share the joy and electricity jazz brings him, but A Wonderful World avoids flattening that idea into a brainless call for uncomplicated love: That 500-watt smile of Armstrong’s contains pain. In a showstopping scene, Armstrong meets Lincoln Perry (Dewitt Fleming Jr.), better known as Stepin Fetchit. Perry tells Armstrong to acquire “a white man” to help him deal with the business side of the industry and basically advises him to code-switch — that is, to create a persona for a white audience. Armstrong and the fleet-footed, mesmerizing Perry turn “When You’re Smiling” from a cheerful song into an incisive one about the shield people of color must maintain to succeed in white America. Armstrong repeatedly says jazz is about “the choices you make in between the notes.” Book writer Aurin Squire and conceivers Andrew Delaplaine and Christopher Renshaw toggle between conventional bio-musical choices and more challenging ones, keeping A Wonderful World lively and interesting. Shying away from an unblemished portrait of Armstrong and instead acknowledging his womanizing and self-involvement, A Wonderful World makes space for a version of Black artistry that confronts the complexities of artists as humans, and how the world around them may fail them. In the 1970s, Louis Armstrong is preparing for a retrospective concert revue while reminiscing about his life. As Armstrong recalls his memories, the show examines how he became an icon. A Wonderful World begins in his home of New Orleans, where he came up in King Joe Oliver’s jazz band, and then takes us from the gangster-laden town of Chicago to his stint in Hollywood at the infancy of the sound era, and finally to New York. Many of Armstrong’s greatest hits get love, from “Kiss of Fire” to “It Don’t Mean a Thing” to \"Cheek to Cheek.\" There's also incredible choreography (by Rickey Tripp, with tap choreography by Fleming) to songs like “It’s Tight Like That” and “I Double Dare You,” and you’ll be sure to leave the show tapping your toes. A Wonderful World is not only constructed around the creation of a concert revue (intended, in the story, for an audience of people from Louis’ community), but also around his four wives: Daisy Parker (Dionne Figgins), Lil Hardin (Jennie Harney-Fleming), Alpha Smith (Kim Exum), and Lucille Wilson (Darlesia Cearcy). There’s glitz and glamor throughout, but these women set the show on fire. They're not just wilting wives suffering from the neglect of a self-interested musician on the road, but women with fleshed-out ambitions and desires that contrast Armstrong’s decisions. A Wonderful World has a 90% audience approval rating on the review aggregator Show-Score, with positive responses to nearly all aspects of the show, from the performances to the visuals to the choreography. Read more audience reviews of A Wonderful World on Show-Score. A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical showcases the peaks and valleys of Armstrong's celebrity, as all bio-musicals do, but the show is willing to engage with the sociopolitical challenges that contribute to those factors, setting A Wonderful World apart. A Wonderful World never ignores the innocence of its title, but by engaging with the harsh reality of Armstrong’s world, you can see how he found wonder in it anyway.

While noting genre conventions, the overall assessment is positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as having 'gleeful tap numbers' and 'superb musical sequences,' while also engaging with complex themes. The positive tone and the mention of a high audience approval rating suggest a positive verdict, but the text is truncated, so the final verdict may be missing. | Gemini: The review highlights both the positive aspects of the show, such as the music, dance numbers, and performances, and the more challenging aspects of Armstrong's life. The truncated text and reliance on aggregator excerpts lower the confidence. | Kimi: The reviewer praises the performances, choreography, and nuanced engagement with racial themes, calling the production an exception that exceeds genre expectations, though the truncated ending necessitates caution.",
