    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Multiple superlatives (incredible, impressive, outstanding) across all major production elements suggests strong enthusiasm, but single excerpt warning requires low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly positive language ('incredible', 'impressive', 'outstanding') suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language to describe multiple aspects of the show, indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt features strong superlatives ('incredible', 'outstanding') indicating clear enthusiasm for the production's technical and artistic elements. Per the single-excerpt guidelines, this clearly positive quote warrants the upper end of the Positive bucket, though confidence remains low due to limited available text.",
