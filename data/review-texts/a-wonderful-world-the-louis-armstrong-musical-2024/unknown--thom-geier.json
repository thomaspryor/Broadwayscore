    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified negative language - 'serviceable' is lukewarm praise while 'overstuffed' is criticism. However, with only one curated quote available, the full verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed opinion, describing the book as 'serviceable' but also 'overstuffed'. The lack of additional context or a clear recommendation results in a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a mixed assessment, describing the book as \"serviceable but overstuffed.\" This suggests neither strong praise nor strong criticism, placing it in the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers faint praise ('serviceable') tempered by clear criticism ('overstuffed'), indicating a mildly positive assessment with reservations about the writing. Following single-excerpt guidance for mildly positive content, scored at the lower end of the Positive range with low confidence due to limited available text.",
