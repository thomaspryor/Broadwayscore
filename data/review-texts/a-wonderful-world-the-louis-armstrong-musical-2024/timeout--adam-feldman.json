  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "At the start of the new biomusical A Wonderful World, each of Armstrong's four wives calls him by a different name, as though to suggest the interior multitudes of a performer who, in public, always wore a famously broad smilepartly as an invitation to joy but partly as a mask of comedy. The musical offers a pleasing depiction of that joy and that mask, if not of those multitudes."
