  "bwwExcerpt": "The outstanding James Monroe Iglehart, who plays Armstrong, has that smile down: a grin so wide and bright that, when the lights go out, you half expect it to linger behind like the Cheshire Cat’s. Iglehart has mastered Armstong’s mannerisms, too, and the churning gravel of Armstrong’s unmistakable voice (to an extent that makes you fear for his long-term vocal health); in Toni-Leslie James’s snazzy costumes and a series of first-class wigs, he summons Armstrong",

  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "At the start of the new biomusical A Wonderful World, each of Armstrong's four wives calls him by a different name, as though to suggest the interior multitudes of a performer who, in public, always wore a famously broad smilepartly as an invitation to joy but partly as a mask of comedy. The musical offers a pleasing depiction of that joy and that mask, if not of those multitudes."
