    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic explicitly calls the show 'delightful, even wonderful' despite acknowledging flaws ('obvious warts'). This is clearly positive, but confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential for cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('delightful', 'wonderful') despite acknowledging flaws, indicating a positive recommendation. Due to the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is clearly positive, calling the show \"delightful, even wonderful,\" despite acknowledging \"obvious warts.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic employs enthusiastic superlatives ('delightful,' 'wonderful') but qualifies them with acknowledgment of significant flaws ('obvious warts'), indicating a solid but qualified recommendation for the production.",
