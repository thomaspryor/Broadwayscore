  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Wonderful World is too expansive in chronological scope to delve too deeply into the crucial question of what made Armstrong such an incomparable figure in the history of American music, but with Iglehart and a fine supporting cast of excellent singer-actresses portraying Armstrong's four wives... the musical rarely gives us enough time to ponder what's being left out. What we're seeing on stage is too entertaining.",
