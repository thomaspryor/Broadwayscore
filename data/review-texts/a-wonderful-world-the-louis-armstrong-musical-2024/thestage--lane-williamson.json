    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed evaluation - praising lead performance while criticizing structural issues. Text appears cut off mid-sentence. Low confidence due to incomplete information. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a mixed review, praising Iglehart's performance but criticizing the show's focus and structure. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review praises the lead actor's performance but criticizes the musical's unfocused direction and the dimming of Armstrong's character, suggesting a mixed experience. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers genuine praise for Iglehart's performance but raises significant concerns about the show's structural focus and direction, suggesting the production is unfocused and relies too heavily on exposition. With only one truncated excerpt available, the overall sentiment appears mixed rather than clearly recommending or discouraging attendance.",
