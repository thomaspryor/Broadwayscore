    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic suggests the show lacks cohesive vision, implying structural problems. However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict is unclear, warranting low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a critique of the show's coherence or direction, indicating a mixed review. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious, low-confidence score. | Gemini: The critic's statement suggests a lack of cohesion or a conflicting vision within the production, indicating a mixed or lukewarm reception. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic explicitly contrasts their view with positive reception others may have, noting a significant structural flaw regarding the show's creative direction. The measured criticism and acknowledgment of differing opinions suggests a mixed assessment rather than a clear recommendation or rejection.",
