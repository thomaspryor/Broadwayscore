    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a positive aspect of the performance, focusing on Iglehart's ability to engage the audience. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, the confidence is low and the score reflects a mildly positive sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Iglehart's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. Given it's the only excerpt, and therefore potentially cherry-picked, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the lead performer's ability to engage audiences but represents mild rather than enthusiastic endorsement. As a single curated excerpt, the overall verdict may differ significantly from this isolated observation.",
