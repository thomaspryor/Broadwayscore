However, with only one curated quote available, the overall sentiment is uncertain, warranting a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Iglehart's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall verdict remains uncertain, leading to a lower confidence and a score on the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers strong, unqualified praise for the lead performance ('considerable charm,' 'vocal prowess,' 'warmth and authenticity'), suggesting a recommendation in the upper Positive range (80-84) as instructed for clearly positive excerpts, though confidence is low due to limited context on other production elements.",
