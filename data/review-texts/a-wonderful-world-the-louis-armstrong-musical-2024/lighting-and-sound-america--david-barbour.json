However, with only a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is negative, suggesting the show fails to illuminate its subject. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the negative statement warrants a negative score. | Kimi: The excerpt suggests the show fails at its basic purpose of illuminating its subject's life, indicating a disappointing, unrecommendable experience. Confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation.",
