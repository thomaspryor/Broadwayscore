    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the creative team for keeping the show 'lively and interesting' through a mix of conventional and challenging choices. However, this is only one curated excerpt, so confidence is low and the score reflects cautious positivity. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view, highlighting the show's liveliness and interest. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review text necessitate a lower confidence and a score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt states the show is \"lively and interesting,\" which is a positive sentiment. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, and the score is in the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the creative team's structural choices, describing the show as 'lively and interesting,' which indicates a solid positive recommendation. Confidence is low due to limited excerpt availability.",
