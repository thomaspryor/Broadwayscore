    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite the 80 rating, the review language is lukewarm - 'handsome' and 'well-sung' are modest praise, and 'without bringing much that's new' suggests it's merely competent rather than compelling. The phrasing doesn't contain clear recommendation language. | GPT-4o: The critic gives a positive assessment of the production as 'handsome' and 'well-sung', aligning with the original rating of 80, indicating a solid recommendation despite noting a lack of novelty. | Gemini: The review is positive, calling the production \"handsome\" and \"well-sung.\" However, it notes that the revival doesn't bring anything new, indicating a reservation. Given the original rating of 80, a score of 75 seems appropriate. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise, calling the production handsome and well-sung while noting it breaks no new ground, resulting in a solid but not enthusiastic recommendation that aligns with the 80-point rating.",
