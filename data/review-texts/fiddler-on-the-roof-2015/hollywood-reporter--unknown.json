  "bwwExcerpt": "Burstein's performance admittedly is more measured than the familiar and still appealing Topol model of burly physicality and bear-like masculinity. (I can't compare with the original Tevye, Zero Mostel.) But Burstein does larger-than-life by subtler means, which is nowhere more evident than in his full command of the character in 'If I Were a Rich Man.' The faintest trace of the Borscht Belt in his humor and his wryly self-dramatizing dialogues with God also provides a further bridge in the director's vision of the story as one that still has relevance to contemporary American life.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises Burstein's performance with phrases like 'full command' and describes his approach as effectively achieving 'larger-than-life' through 'subtler means.' However, this is only one curated excerpt focusing solely on the lead performance, not the overall production. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Burstein's performance and suggests the production's relevance to contemporary life. The positive tone and focus on the lead actor's effective portrayal indicate a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Burstein's performance and its relevance to a contemporary audience, suggesting a positive, though possibly qualified, recommendation. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Burstein's lead performance, highlighting his subtle command and contemporary relevance, though confidence is reduced due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Sher's staging mines every dramatic nuance and every ounce of character-based humor in Joseph Stein's indestructible book…The dancing is simply extraordinary…The revival owes much of its emotional heft to impeccable casting..The duality of humor and horror is essential to 'Fiddler,' and as in every other aspect, this superb production captures that balance with enormous soulfulness...The show also closes the Broadway year on a magnificent note.\"\n\nRead more"
