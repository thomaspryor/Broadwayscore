  "fullText": "Less than a decade has passed since the last revival of Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick’s “Fiddler on the Roof” had its sunrise, sunset on Broadway. And now Bartlett Sher, the director of sparkling Tony-winning revivals of the Rodgers and Hammerstein classics “South Pacific” and “The King and I” at Lincoln Center, has taken on this beloved chestnut in a moving but occasionally muddled new Broadway production.",

The critic acknowledges positive aspects but also points out flaws. | Kimi: The review offers a split verdict, praising the production as 'moving' while criticizing it as 'occasionally muddled.' The text appears truncated, cutting off before a full conclusion.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "By the finale, the production settles into the routine of rejection - of a daughter who weds outside the faith, of an entire community cast out for that very faith. (In czarist Russia, it seems, goys will be goys.) And audiences will feel the customary tug of sentiment, caught up in the sweep of this family, this village and this culture. As Tevye might ask, Do you love me? How can anyone resist?",
