  "bwwExcerpt": "Zero Mostel, the first Tevye, was indisputably magnetic but often a self-indulgent clown. At least one Fiddler collector preferred his successor, Luther Adler, who restored revelatory degrees of dignity and solemnity. Danny Burstein, the newest heir to the hero's milk cart and paternal woes, is agreeable, self-effacing and, alas, somewhat dull. Call him smaller than life. He enjoys sensitive support, however, from Jessica Hecht as his long-suffering wife, Alix Korey as the town matchmaker and, perhaps best, Adam Dannheisser as Lazar Wolf, the would-be amorous butcher. The nostalgic crowd at the preview on Thursday appeared to love everything.",
