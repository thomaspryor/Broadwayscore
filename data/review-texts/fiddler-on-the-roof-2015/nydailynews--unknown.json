  "fullText": "ExpandDanny Burstein as Tevye (Joan Marcus)\n\n\"Fiddler on the Roof\" is one of the great and most enduring Broadway musicals. The new revival at the Broadway Theatre does a fine job mining this rich vein of material. That's not so hard — this 51-year-old show is the mother lode.\n\n\"Fiddler\" always makes a deep impact because it is about things that matter — life, love, family, tradition — and embraces the hard fact that joy is forever tempered by pain.\n\n\"Sunrise, Sunset,\" by composer Jerry Bock and lyricist Sheldon Harnick, says it simply. Our lives are \"laden with happiness and tears.\" The plain-spoken eloquence and economy of this number runs throughout the score. \"Life has a way of confusing us, blessing and bruising us,\" the citizens of Anatevka observe in \"To Life!\"\n\nAnd in the beautiful \"Far from the Home I Love,\" a young woman marvels at the reality that a man \"would change the shape of my dreams...\" So few words, such evocative imagery.\n\nJessica Hecht as Golde (Joan Marcus/©2015 Joan Marcus)\n\nThe book by Joseph Stein, based on Sholem Aleichem stories, is also lean. The political revolution of 1905 Russia is seen through the changing personal world of Jewish dairyman Tevye, his wife and their five daughters.\n\nDirector Bartlett Sher puts his stamp on the show immediately with a framing device that fuses past and present. It echoes the start of his production of \"The Light in the Piazza,\" a show that begins with a question: What happened here? What indeed. Life! And it often repeats itself.\n\nDanny Burstein brings exuberance along with wry eyes and an open-heart to his Tevye. His star turn lights the way for everyone. Jessica Hecht is touching as his wife Golde.\n\nAdam Kantor and Alexandra Silber as Motel and Tzeitel (Joan Marcus/©2015 Joan Marcus)\n\nAlexandra Silber is the daughter, Tzeitel, who upends tradition by marrying poor tailor Motel, played by Adam Kantor. His \"Miracles of Miracles\" is a highlight. Samantha Massell and Melanie Moore are Tevye's daughters Hodel, who chooses life far away with student Perchik (Ben Rappaport), and Chava, who goes outside her faith to wed Fyedka (Nick Rehberger).\n\nPerformances are very good, as is the lively dancing choreographed by Hofesh Schechter that taps tradition and some contemporary moves. But the curious scenery often gets in the show's way. It makes for a distracting, busy and slow-pokey production of a tightknit musical.\n\nAs always, it ends on a strong note. Tevye's acknowledgment, \"God be with you,\" to the disavowed Chava will change the shape of her life, her fathers' and everyone's. You'd have to be made of granite not to be moved to happiness and tears.",
