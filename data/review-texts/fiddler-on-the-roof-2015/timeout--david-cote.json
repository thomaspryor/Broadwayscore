  "bwwExcerpt": "A great Tevye, and Burstein is nothing short of a miracle, finding the modern mensch in Tevye, as well as the hard-nosed, belief-bound peasant. Rather than bluster or roar his way through the role, Burstein has a delicate, almost motherly touch, kibbitzing with God for laughs and tearing out our hearts by the end. No other actor could juggle the comedy and tragedy masks with such style, such a bittersweet dance with tradition.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Critic uses superlatives like 'miracle' and 'great' with unqualified praise for Burstein's performance. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt limitation - this could be cherry-picked praise from a mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides high praise for Burstein's performance, describing it as miraculous and capable of balancing comedy and tragedy with style. The language used is enthusiastic and suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising Burstein's performance as a 'miracle' and highlighting his ability to balance comedy and tragedy. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive with high end score but low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers extraordinary praise for the lead performance, describing it as 'nothing short of a miracle' with a 'delicate, almost motherly touch' that tears out hearts by the end. While limited to a single curated quote focusing on one actor, the evaluative language is strongly enthusiastic. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
