  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The superb new production certainly honors the show’s ebullience of spirit…But as directed by Bartlett Sher with his customary sensitivity, this multihued staging moves to a heart-stopping conclusion.…It’s just a musical, no? Yes, but what a musical. The score enters your bloodstream, indelibly, upon a single hearing...And Joseph Stein’s book miraculously blends borscht belt humor with a moving depiction of Tevye’s conflicted heart.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise throughout with 'superb,' 'heart-stopping,' score 'enters your bloodstream indelibly,' and 'what a musical.' Single excerpt warning noted but language is consistently enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is highly positive, praising the production as 'superb' and 'heart-stopping'. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language such as \"superb,\" \"ebullience of spirit,\" \"heart-stopping conclusion,\" and praises the score and book. Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers enthusiastic praise for the production ('superb'), direction ('heart-stopping'), and writing ('miraculously blends'), warranting a high-positive score, though the limited excerpt context prevents higher confidence or a Rave classification.",
