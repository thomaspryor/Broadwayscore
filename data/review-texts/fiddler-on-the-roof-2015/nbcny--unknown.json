  "bwwExcerpt": "This 'Fiddler,' helmed by the protective Bartlett Sher ('The King and I'), is bookended by scenes featuring a man we can interpret to be a present-day descendant of the tradition-cherishing milkman, famously 'blessed' with five daughters. This new 'Fiddler,' gorgeous and affecting, is a respectful staging of the Jerry Bock-Sheldon Harnick classic, with modernities here and there to keep us on our toes.",
