  "bwwExcerpt": "This 'Fiddler,' helmed by the protective Bartlett Sher ('The King and I'), is bookended by scenes featuring a man we can interpret to be a present-day descendant of the tradition-cherishing milkman, famously 'blessed' with five daughters. This new 'Fiddler,' gorgeous and affecting, is a respectful staging of the Jerry Bock-Sheldon Harnick classic, with modernities here and there to keep us on our toes.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('gorgeous and affecting') with appreciation for the direction and production, but limited excerpt makes full verdict uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'gorgeous and affecting,' indicating a strong positive impression. The use of 'respectful staging' suggests a high-quality production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"gorgeous and affecting\" and \"respectful staging,\" indicating a positive recommendation. However, as this is only a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise with words like 'gorgeous and affecting,' indicating a strong recommendation for this revival. However, confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation which may not capture the full review's nuance.",
