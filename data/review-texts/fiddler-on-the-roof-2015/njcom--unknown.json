  "bwwExcerpt": "Miracle of miracles, indeed: Just when you think you know a classic musical backwards and forwards, along comes director Bartlett Sher to prove otherwise. Just as with his seminal 2008 staging of 'South Pacific' (and his less successful, but still laudable version of 'The King and I' from earlier this year), Sher's take on 'Fiddler on the Roof' feels at once bracingly modern and gloriously old school.",
