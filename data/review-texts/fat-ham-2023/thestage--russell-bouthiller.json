Given single excerpt warning and qualified positive language, scoring lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a positive reception with praise for the production's energy and entertainment value, despite noting it may not meet all expectations for a Pulitzer-winning work. The single excerpt and text quality warning suggest caution, so a lower score within the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates the audience enjoyed the production, citing lighthearted laughs and colorful characters, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows qualified praise: critic notes the show falls short of Pulitzer standards but praises its zippy pacing, humor, and staging as enjoyable entertainment.",
