    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear recommendation ('thoroughly enjoy') but limited text prevents assessment of full verdict strength. Positioned at lower end of Positive bucket due to single-quote limitation and accessible enjoyment emphasis. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive experience, especially for those familiar with Hamlet, indicating a recommendation with some reservations. The lack of full context and single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious, lower-end positive score. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the show is enjoyable, but the caveat about needing to know Hamlet implies a reservation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unambiguously positive evaluative language ('thoroughly enjoy,' 'richer the experience') recommending the show, placing it in the upper range of the Positive bucket per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts.",
