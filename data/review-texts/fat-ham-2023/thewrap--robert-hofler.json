  "fullText": "Marcel Spears doesn’t just make a spectacular Broadway debut — he does it the hard way, by being subtle and tenderly nuanced in his portrayal of Juicy, the haunted (literally) hero of James Ijames’ wonderful new comedy, “Fat Ham.” After winning last year’s Pulitzer Prize for drama for its run at the Public Theater, “Fat Ham” opened Wednesday on Broadway at the American Airlines Theatre.",
