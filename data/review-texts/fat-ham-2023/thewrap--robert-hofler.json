    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Superlative claim ('most fun...this Broadway season') indicates strong enthusiasm and clear recommendation, placing this firmly in Rave territory despite being a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a strong, enthusiastic recommendation, suggesting 'Fat Ham' is the standout play of the season. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language is clear and superlative. | Gemini: The single quote is extremely positive, calling it the most fun play of the season. Given the lack of full text, confidence is low, but the enthusiasm warrants a high positive score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers an unqualified superlative endorsement declaring it the season's most entertaining play, warranting the top of the Positive range despite the risk of cherry-picking with only one quote available. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Time after time in “Fat Ham,” when someone in the family has misbehaved outrageously, usually to great comic effect, it is up to Juicy to occupy the middle ground and address the audience directly in a soliloquy that binds us irrevocably to this most empathetic character. Spears plays these moments to the hilt by always underplaying them. His many dead pans and weighted pauses invariably bring down the house. As for that wonderful ghost, much of his magic derives from Maruti Evans’ set, Dominque Fawn Hill’s costumes, Bradley King’s lighting, Earon Chew Nealey’s hair and wigs, Mikaal Sulaiman’s sound and, above all, Skylar Fox’s illusions design. So don’t let that Pulitzer Prize fool you. “Fat Ham” is the most fun you’ll have at any play this Broadway season.",
