    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('most delightful,' 'vibrant,' 'uniformly great') indicates clear recommendation. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but tone suggests upper-positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a strong positive impression with phrases like 'most delightful' and 'characters are vibrant.' However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"most delightful\", \"vibrant\", and \"uniformly great\", indicating a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong praise calling it 'probably the most delightful' Hamlet adaptation ever with 'vibrant' characters and 'uniformly great' cast, indicating a strong recommendation. Score reflects upper Positive range per single-excerpt guidance, with low confidence due to limited available text.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Which is why Fat Ham feels so fresh and clever. Ijames could have easily transposed Hamlet beat by beat, or pulled a Baz Luhrmann and have his modern-day characters speak in Iambic pentameter (a couple of monologues notwithstanding). But Ijames' characters are as American as pulled pork and baby back ribs, which emphasizes the universality of Shakespeare's work. The credo of Fat Ham is that famous quote about being true to thine own self. That advice was given to Laertes, not Hamlet, who probably could've used it. Juicy, however, follows it to a tee. To take one of the most definitive and hallowed works in English literature and retell it as a comedy about a young, thicc, queer Black boy in the South is revolutionary in its own way, but like 'A Fifth of Beethoven,' there's a bit of a novelty to Fat Ham, which may say more about the culture in which we live than the play itself.",
