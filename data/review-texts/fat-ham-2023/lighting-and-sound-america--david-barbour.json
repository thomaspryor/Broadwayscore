  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It's understandable that Ijames -- author of the electrifying Kill Move Paradise, about the slaughter of young Black men -- wants to spin a scenario with some joy in it; this is also true of Lynn Nottage, Antoinette Chinonye Nwandu, and Keenan Scott II in their recent works. But Ijames takes the easy route here, spending ninety minutes minting outrageous gags at the characters' expense before pronouncing a happy ending by authorial fiat. Fat Ham is fun in a shallow, sketch-comedy way, but the playwright is, for once, too hooked on pleasing the audience.”\n\nRead more",

Low confidence due to single excerpt warning and potential for fuller context in complete review. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'fun' but criticizes it for being 'shallow' and 'too hooked on pleasing the audience.' This indicates a mixed sentiment, acknowledging entertainment value but with significant reservations. | Gemini: The review states the play is \"fun in a shallow way\" but also criticizes the playwright for being \"too hooked on pleasing the audience.\" This indicates a mixed reaction. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show is fun and entertaining but criticizes it as shallow, relying on easy gags, and featuring a contrived ending by authorial fiat, suggesting artistic compromise.",
