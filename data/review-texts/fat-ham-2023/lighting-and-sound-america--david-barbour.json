  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It's understandable that Ijames -- author of the electrifying Kill Move Paradise, about the slaughter of young Black men -- wants to spin a scenario with some joy in it; this is also true of Lynn Nottage, Antoinette Chinonye Nwandu, and Keenan Scott II in their recent works. But Ijames takes the easy route here, spending ninety minutes minting outrageous gags at the characters' expense before pronouncing a happy ending by authorial fiat. Fat Ham is fun in a shallow, sketch-comedy way, but the playwright is, for once, too hooked on pleasing the audience.”\n\nRead more",
