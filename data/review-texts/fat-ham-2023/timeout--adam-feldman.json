The language suggests this transcends typical positive territory into rave. | GPT-4o: The review praises the play as both hilarious and deeply moving, indicating a strong recommendation. The original rating of 80 supports a solid positive classification. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly positive, calling the play a \"riot\" and \"truly special.\" The critic praises the playwright's creation and its ability to be both funny and moving, indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 80 places this in the Positive range, and the review describes the show as 'truly special' with enthusiastic praise for its humor and emotional depth.",
