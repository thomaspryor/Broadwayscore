    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: This excerpt suggests the play has good moments but is hampered by heavy-handed symbolism. The phrase 'at its best when' implies inconsistency, and the criticism of characters as 'symbolic vessels' points to structural flaws. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the play succeeds in certain aspects but implies limitations by contrasting 'messy and human' with 'symbolic vessels'. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the play has both strengths and weaknesses, indicating a mixed review. The phrase \"at its best when\" implies that there are also times when it is not at its best. | Kimi: The qualified praise ('at its best') implies the production succeeds only intermittently, with the critic suggesting it too often relies on heavy-handed symbolism rather than authentic character work, indicating an inconsistent overall assessment.",
