  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"The pleasure of watching Shucked is not only that it's very funny, it is also a musical comedy comfortable in its merry skin, thanks to Jack O'Brien's equally mischievous direction, full of stop-starts, playing to the audience, and letting the jokes and reaction to the jokes breezily pace the show.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('pleasure', 'very funny', 'comfortable in its merry skin') with praise for direction and pacing. Single excerpt limitation prevents higher confidence, but tone suggests enthusiastic recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for being very funny and well-directed, indicating a strong positive reception. The use of 'pleasure' and 'comfortable in its merry skin' suggests an enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the show as \"very funny\" and a \"musical comedy comfortable in its merry skin\", indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the show's comedy and direction, describing it as a 'pleasure' and 'very funny' with 'mischievous direction,' indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited context of a single curated quote.",
