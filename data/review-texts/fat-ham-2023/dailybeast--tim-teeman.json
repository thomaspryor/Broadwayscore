  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"The pleasure of watching Shucked is not only that it's very funny, it is also a musical comedy comfortable in its merry skin, thanks to Jack O'Brien's equally mischievous direction, full of stop-starts, playing to the audience, and letting the jokes and reaction to the jokes breezily pace the show.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for humor and direction with language like 'pleasure,' 'very funny,' and 'mischievous.' Single excerpt warning noted - this clearly positive language suggests upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'very funny' and praises the direction as 'mischievous' and 'breezily paced.' The positive tone and specific praise suggest a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, highlighting the humor and direction. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive range, but with low confidence due to the limited information. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the show's humor and direction, describing it as a 'pleasure' and 'very funny.' Following instructions for single clearly positive excerpts, it scores in the upper Positive range, though confidence is reduced due to reliance on a single curated quote.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "The play is a compact 95 minutes, but it’s as dense and thoughtful as it is light on its feet and irreverent. Tio (Chris Herbie Holland), a modern-day echo of Horatio, begins the play by trying to figure out if the world of porn is for him, and later delivers an extremely passionate soliloquy-when-high about the sexual pleasures of getting down with gingerbread men.",
