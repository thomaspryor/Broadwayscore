    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as a 'joyful celebration' with positive transformation of source material. However, this is only one curated quote and may not reflect the full review verdict, warranting low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt presents a positive transformation of the source material into something joyful and celebratory, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as a \"joyful celebration of love,\" which is a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly positive language ('joyful celebration,' 'fanciful') to praise the Pulitzer-winning work's transformation of Hamlet, though the single-excerpt format requires cautious scoring at the upper end of the Positive range.",
