    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as a 'joyful celebration' with positive transformation of source material. However, this is only one curated quote and may not reflect the full review verdict, warranting low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt presents a positive transformation of the source material into something joyful and celebratory, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as a \"joyful celebration of love,\" which is a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly positive language ('joyful celebration,' 'fanciful') to praise the Pulitzer-winning work's transformation of Hamlet, though the single-excerpt format requires cautious scoring at the upper end of the Positive range.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "What remains blissfully in place is the same delightful cast and director Saheem Ali on hand to spread positive vibes and laughter in great abundance. But it is what has been gained that marks this as a most welcome addition to the Broadway season. For even though a demolition of the fourth wall is built into the script, with characters periodically acknowledging our prying eyes, there is now a lovely looseness to that relationship, giving the production a surprising sense of improv and intimacy in a venue that might well have overwhelmed things by distancing us from the action. You can't help but feel welcome, drawn in, and caught up in the story.",
