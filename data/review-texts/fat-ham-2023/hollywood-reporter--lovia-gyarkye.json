    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The 'double-edged sword' phrase signals mixed feelings - praising the entertainment value while implying drawbacks. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, noting both positive elements (humor, expressive deliveries) and a potential downside (double-edged sword). The lack of full context and the single excerpt warning lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt notes both positive and negative aspects, indicating a mixed reaction. The phrase \"double-edged sword\" suggests that while the humor is engaging, it may also detract from other elements. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges the production's energy and entertainment value ('leave little room for boredom') but explicitly frames these qualities as a 'double-edged sword,' indicating significant reservations or drawbacks. The sitcom comparison suggests the tone may undercut the source material's gravity. Single excerpt with truncated text limits confidence.",
