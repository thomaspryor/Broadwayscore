    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The 'CRITIC'S PICK' designation combined with calling the show 'a revelation and a balm' that accomplishes theater's most important function indicates strong enthusiasm. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'revelation and a balm,' indicating strong praise and a must-see recommendation. The critic's pick designation further supports a rave classification. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"revelation\" and \"balm,\" and it's a Critic's Pick, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, since it's a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt carries a 'Critic's Pick' designation and uses superlative praise ('revelation and a balm', 'most important things we ask of theater'), indicating a strong recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, the overall review context is unknown, warranting reduced confidence. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
