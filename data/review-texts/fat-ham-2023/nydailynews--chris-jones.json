  "bwwExcerpt": "But there is nothing dour or overly academic about “Fat Ham,” which has been given a blisteringly well-acted production helmed by director Saheem Ali and staged on the wittiest of satirical sets from Maruti Evans. At no point does this play feel like anything other than a big-fun Broadway show: it’s a smart, fearless and often wildly entertaining 90 minutes, filled with radical ideas and absurdist spectacle. To his credit, Ijames is willing to blow up even his own assertions. You get musical numbers, tableaux, crazy comedic antics and a suite of outsized performances from the likes of the superb Nikki Crawford, making her Broadway debut, like many in this knockout cast. I’d go so far as to say I can’t recall such a well-acted Broadway show with so many first-timers.",

The use of 'big-fun Broadway show' suggests a highly positive experience, placing it in the Rave category. However, due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, describing the show as \"smart, fearless and often wildly entertaining.\" This indicates a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic, unqualified praise ('wildly entertaining,' 'smart,' 'fearless') without any reservations, indicating a strong recommendation. However, as a curated excerpt with limited context, confidence is reduced.",
