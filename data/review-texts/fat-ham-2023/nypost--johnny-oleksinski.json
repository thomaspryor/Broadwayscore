    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Strong praise calling it a 'remarkable achievement' with 'impressive skill,' though limited text prevents deeper assessment of enthusiasm level. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language such as 'remarkable achievement' and praises the balance of humor and heartbreak, indicating a highly favorable opinion. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"remarkable achievement\" and praises the balance of humor and heartbreak, indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives like 'remarkable achievement' and 'impressive skill' to enthusiastically praise the production's ambitious concept and execution. Confidence is low due to the text's brevity, suggesting it may be an excerpt or truncated review. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
