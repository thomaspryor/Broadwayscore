  "showScoreExcerpt": "When it comes to modern adaptations of Shakespeare plays, many theatergoers tend to treat them like a test, mentally annotating plot and character correlations as if their high school English teachers were going to tap them on the shoulders and ask, \"Did you catch that one?\" If you suffer from this same hang up, then consider James Ijames' Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Fat Ham\" therapy, not only encouraging its audience to break free from fawning fidelity to the Bard but also, more poignantly, tragic endings. Simply put, for Ijames' insightfully idiosyncratic take on \"Hamlet,\" we're not in Elsinore anymore, and that's a good thing.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear enthusiasm for the adaptation, calling it 'therapy' and 'insightfully idiosyncratic' with the positive verdict 'that's a good thing.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation and 'Read more' truncation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a refreshing and insightful adaptation, suggesting it offers a positive and engaging experience. The use of 'therapy' and 'good thing' indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive reception to the modern adaptation of Hamlet, praising its unique take and encouraging audiences to break free from traditional interpretations. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of positive. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers clear praise for the play's idiosyncratic approach and explicitly positive verdict ('that's a good thing'), though limited context necessitates lower confidence.",
