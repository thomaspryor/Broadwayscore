  "bwwExcerpt": "Margulies gets a lot of mileage out of the older-man-younger-woman situation — as Sarah says to Richard: 'I think it's sweet: You always wanted a little girl' — but he admirably makes Mandy more than just a pretty little punchline. In her stage debut, the doe-eyed Ricci holds her own with her three costars, theatrical heavyweights all. And in her second go at the role, Linney has zoomed in on little bits of warmth in the detached, screwed-up woman who lives her life, unapologetically, behind the lens.",
