  "bwwExcerpt": "On one level, this work -- about a female photojournalist and her writer boyfriend coping with the physical and emotional aftereffects of her near-death experience while covering the Iraq War -- deals with such themes as the responsibilities of journalists to their subjects and the thrill-seeking addiction that drives them. But the playwright cannily uses this as a framework to explore the shifting trajectories of relationships, with longtime but unmarried couple Sarah (Linney) and James (d'Arcy James) discovering that the incident has dramatically shifted their priorities and emotional needs.",
