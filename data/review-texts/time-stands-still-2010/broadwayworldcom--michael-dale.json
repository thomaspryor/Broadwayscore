  "bwwExcerpt": "In its limited run, Time Stands Still was one of last season's best new plays and among the most satisfying evenings on Broadway. Its return open run, with Ricci's replacement of Alicia Silverstone the only cast change and the three returning actors giving even richer performances, is bound to be among this season's cream as well.",
