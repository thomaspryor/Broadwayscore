  "bwwExcerpt": "Following a limited run at Manhattan Theatre Club’s Samuel J. Friedman Theatre last season, Donald Margulies’s dexterous drama has now returned for another shot. If the writing is occasionally well-crafted to a fault, this minor flaw is mitigated by Daniel Sullivan’s attentive direction, which elicits an exquisitely nuanced central performance from Linney and strong supporting ones from the rest of the cast, which includes a rumpled Eric Bogosian as a magazine editor and Christina Ricci (stepping in for Alicia Silverstone) as his unsophisticated young girlfriend. For all its carefully woven-in themes—about personal versus professional priorities, the ethics and limits of representation, and more—the play is perhaps best appreciated as an artfully composed picture of a woman in a quiet crisis of her own, who feels safer in war than in love.",
