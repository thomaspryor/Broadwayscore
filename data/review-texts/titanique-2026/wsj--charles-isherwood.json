  "bwwExcerpt": "Admirers of the movie and of Ms. Dion are obviously the target audience; to get the most out of the show it’s best to be a fanatical double-partisan. I admired the plush cinematic richness of the movie, while deploring its length (the Titanic sank more quickly), and as someone unfamiliar with much of Ms. Dion’s extensive songbook, I was more taken with the sheer loopiness of the show than the blandly “adult contemporary” music. But whether blasting out pop balladry or silly shtick, the engaging cast beams joy at the audience, and receives it in turn, throughout.",
