However, confidence is medium due to limited excerpt availability. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the production's appearance, suggesting it is outdated and poorly maintained. This indicates a negative impression, though the lack of a full review text limits certainty. | Gemini: The review excerpt is strongly negative, criticizing the show's appearance and suggesting it hasn't been updated well. This indicates a lack of recommendation.",
