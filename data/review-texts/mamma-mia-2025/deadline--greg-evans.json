With the touring production of the hit ABBA musical making a six-month stop on Broadway , the flawed, fun-loving show returns to the venue &#8211; the Winter Garden Theatre &#8211; where it held sway back when the century was new. The ninth-longest running Broadway show of all time, Mamma Mia! ran for 14 years at the Winter Garden following its opening shortly after the Towers fell. This touring production&#8217;s stop at the Garden has all the makings of a homecoming, and it&#8217;s a strenuously joyous one.
