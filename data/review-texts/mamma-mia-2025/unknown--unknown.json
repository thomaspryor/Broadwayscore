Single excerpt warning prompts conservative scoring within positive range. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some downsides, such as a flimsy set, but ultimately describes the production as a 'fine iteration' and 'sprightlier' than before, indicating a positive recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review indicates that the production is \"fine\" and \"sprightlier\" than before, suggesting a positive experience, but the mention of a \"flimsy\" set implies reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring conservatively.",
