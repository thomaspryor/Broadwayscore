  "dtliExcerpt": "Book writer Catherine Johnson deserves credit for trying to make the mother-daughter relationship resonate, although she is more often lauded for having worked in twenty-two ABBA songs into the story in sometimes clever ways, without changing almost any of the lyrics. But the lyrics don’t always fit snugly with the narrative; and some of the melodies – all of which were already oldies when the musical debuted – aren’t really evergreens. A reimagined “Mamma Mia” could have benefitted from dropping some of the songs, and making the show shorter.",
