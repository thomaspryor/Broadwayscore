Positive but not enthusiastic. Low confidence due to truncated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt describes the production as 'fine' and 'sprightlier' than before, indicating a positive view despite some reservations about the set. The lack of a full review text and the mention of downscaling suggest a lower confidence level. | Gemini: The review states that this is a \"fine iteration\" of the show, but notes that it is \"slightly downscaled for the road.\" This suggests a positive recommendation with reservations.",
