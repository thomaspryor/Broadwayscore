On the other hand, the music — Abba hits by the group’s members Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus (with a little help from Stig Anderson) — still has what it has, energy and catchiness and emotional immediacy. Catherine Johnson’s book has been criticized, justifiably, as less than Pulitzer Prize-worthy, but you have to admire the forthrightness with which she set out to build a story connecting songs like “Honey, Honey,” “Money Money Money,” “Chiquitita” and “The Winner Takes It All.” The script is distinguished by her deadpan dialogue lead-ins.\n\nThe show was never a star vehicle. Louise Pitre was Broadway’s first Donna, a single mother and former disco-group frontwoman who owns a taverna on a Greek island. Tina Maddigan played her daughter, Sophie, who is getting married and wants to know finally who her father is. (According to Donna’s old diary, it could be any of three men she spent passionate nights with the summer that Sophie was conceived.) Joe Machota (who has since become a successful agent) was Sky, her fiancé. The biggest name in the original cast was Judy Kaye as Rosie, one of Donna’s former bandmates, part of the perky coterie of old friends who descend on the island for the wedding.\n\nJudy McLane, who plays Donna now, has a serious voice and real presence. Lauren Cohn’s portrayal of Rosie does leave me nostalgic for Ms. Kaye, and when Donna’s old trio (Felicia Finley plays the third, Tanya) puts on its old costumes and bursts into song and outdated dance, the moment’s sense of the ridiculous feels forced, despite the ruffled jumpsuits and space age silhouettes.\n\nOn the other hand, when Ms. Cohn begins “Take a Chance on Me,” the playfulness is contagious. Jon Jorgenson, who now plays Sky, is a charmer. Elena Ricardo, as Sophie, has risen from the show’s ensemble.\n\nBut the who’s-this-guy moment comes in Act II. Sam Carmichael, one of the three men who may be Sophie’s father, takes center stage to perform “S.O.S.” (“When you’re gone/How can I even try to go on?”) with a gravitas that defies the song’s title and relatively uninspired lyrics. Sam is now played by Alan Campbell, who earned a Tony nomination for his Broadway debut 20 years ago, opposite Glenn Close in “Sunset Boulevard.” When he sings, “Mamma Mia!” feels muscular and new.\n\nShows do fade. I could swear that the Greek sun no longer shines as brightly as it used to. The taverna looks flimsy and cramped on the Broadhurst stage. But the show’s real appeal, beyond those songs, has always been its innate sweetness. The 2008 movie adaptation, with Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan, managed to bury much of that in adolescent humor and slapstick — surprising, because it was directed, like the stage version, by Phyllida Lloyd. The Broadway production maintains the sweetness, and that’s a joy.\n\nCritics take another look at long-running Broadway shows.\n\nShare full articleRelated ContentAdvertisement",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Despite being slightly downscaled for the road — most notably in a set that feels a little flimsy — this is a fine iteration of “Mamma Mia!” It certainly is sprightlier than it was the last time I saw the show, dejectedly limping toward the end of the first Broadway run. The band, under Will Van Dyke’s direction, was percolating with precise energy at the performance I attended, and the cast members had a spring in their step moving through Phyllida Lloyd’s staging and Anthony Van Laast’s choreography.",

And the score consists entirely of songs made famous in the disco era by Abba, music that people seldom admit to having danced to, much less sung in their showers. Yet these elements have been combined, with alchemical magic, into the theatrical equivalent of comfort food.\"",
