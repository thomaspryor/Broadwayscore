  "fullText": "It's the same show, maybe a bit more bumptious, but still a feast for your pleasure centers.\n\nI have a theory about the music of ABBA (it's just my experience, but maybe it's yours too). Their songs, composed and produced by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus and sung by Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, are so propulsively beautiful, so catchy and timeless and addictive, so sublime in their blend of joy and heartbreak that your all-time favorite ABBA song will always be... the one you happen to be listening to.\n\n“Mamma Mia!,” the indelibly exuberant jukebox musical that's being revived on Broadway for a six-month limited engagement (it opens tonight at the Winter Garden Theater, where the original Broadway production opened in 2001 and ran for 14 years), is a show built around the belief that each and every ABBA song is its own perfect epiphany of pop rapture. There are no lame numbers, no filler; the show is all high points, which is why it generates a kind of wall-to-wall karaoke ecstasy. For the audiences that have flocked to “Mamma Mia!” over the last 25 years, and will now continue to do so, hearing those songs can make one feel like the music-fan equivalent of a blissed-out cokehead doing lines. You just want another, and another, and another...",
