  "fullText": "This is not a dark Brechtian take on a well-known musical, nor a queer reclamation of mainstream pop culture—but I’m not sure anyone needs that from Mamma Mia!, a show that knows what it is and consistently delivers. When confronted with such a chronically enjoyable juggernaut, one can only say, “Thank you for the music.”",

  "dtliExcerpt": "A revival in the truest sense opens at the Winter Garden Theatre.\n\nCritics perform a kind of theater too: stroking our chins, dispassionately taking notes, and steadfastly refusing to stand for the now ubiquitous curtain call.

Wallace endows Sam with bedside eyes and a twinge of sadness in his singing voice. He’s like a Florida meteorologist brooding over a summer squall, a vibe that gives the second act number “SOS” a surprise emotional kick.\n\nBut no one does a better job of illuminating the real stakes in this slim plot than Sherrill, a veteran of the touring and Las Vegas productions who is making her Broadway debut. She approaches every number not like an\n\nUnfortunately, Sherrill doesn’t possess the raw vocal power of\n\nDirector Phyllida Lloyd’s production is essentially the same one that first played the Winter Garden in October 2001, with vibrant concert lighting by Howard Harrison, clever retro choreography by Anthony Van Laast (love those boys in flippers), and whimsical costumes by Mark Thompson. Thompson’s set, which features two large moving pieces of faux Santorini stone that can be endlessly rearranged, still helps the cast tell this story with efficiency, and harks back to a time before the set design arms race really took off on Broadway.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.
