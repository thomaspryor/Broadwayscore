The use of 'inevitably going, My, my, how can I resist you?' implies a positive, albeit light-hearted, recommendation. However, the text quality warning and single excerpt caution suggest scoring conservatively. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's flaws but ultimately suggests it's enjoyable and hard to resist, indicating a positive but not rave recommendation.
