    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt acknowledges the show isn't sophisticated but praises its clear vision and strong direction. Single excerpt with qualified praise suggests lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the show's self-awareness and direction, though it lacks strong enthusiasm. Given the single excerpt and text quality warning, the score is set at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. The phrase \"not exactly a sophisticated evening of Sondheim\" implies some reservations, but the overall tone is positive. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers qualified praise, acknowledging the production lacks sophistication while commending its cohesive identity and consistent directorial vision. As a mildly positive standalone quote, scores at the lower end of the Positive range.",
