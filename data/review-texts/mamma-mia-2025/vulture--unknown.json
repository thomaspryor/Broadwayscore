    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic uses dismissive language calling the show dated ('long in the tooth') and suggests the exclamation point should be replaced with uncertainty ('question mark') or resignation ('ellipsis'). The final line reads as sarcastic dismissal rather than praise. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the show feels dated and questions its current relevance, indicating a mixed reception. The tone is not overtly negative, but it lacks enthusiasm, suggesting a middle-ground assessment. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the reviewer finds the show somewhat dated and repetitive, but acknowledges the presence of ABBA songs, implying some entertainment value. The overall tone is neither strongly positive nor negative.",
