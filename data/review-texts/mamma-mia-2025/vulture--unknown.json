However, the mention of ABBA songs hints at some enjoyment for fans, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the show is somewhat dated but acknowledges the presence of ABBA songs, indicating a mixed assessment. The tone is not overtly negative, but not strongly positive either.",
