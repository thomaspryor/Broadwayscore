This suggests a strong recommendation. However, given the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses positive language like \"pure sunshine\" and \"how could we resist this?\" suggesting a recommendation, although the single excerpt and lack of a specific rating warrant a score in the middle of the positive range.",
