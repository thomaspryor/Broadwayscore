The phrase 'chronically enjoyable juggernaut' indicates a positive experience, though the lack of a full review text means the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's limitations but ultimately concludes with a positive sentiment, suggesting it consistently delivers enjoyment. Given the single excerpt, a score in the middle of the positive range is appropriate.",
