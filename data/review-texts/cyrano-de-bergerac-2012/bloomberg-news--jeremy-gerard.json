    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | No bucket consensus - using median score | Claude: The excerpt devastatingly compares the lead performance to a 'frat boy' and the entire production to a sitcom, suggesting fundamental misinterpretation of the classic. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked negative commentary from a more balanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes an 'unprecedented interpretation' but also uses terms like 'frat boy' and compares it to a TV episode, suggesting a mixed or unconventional take. With only one excerpt, the sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence mixed score. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the actor's interpretation as unprecedented and compares the production to \"Arrested Development,\" which is neither explicitly positive nor negative, suggesting a mixed or neutral assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt emphasizes unflattering physical descriptors ('blank expression,' 'stringy wig,' 'paunchy and derelict') and unfavorably compares the production to a TV sitcom, suggesting the interpretation misses the mark. With only one excerpt available, confidence is reduced. | Buckets: claude=Pan, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
