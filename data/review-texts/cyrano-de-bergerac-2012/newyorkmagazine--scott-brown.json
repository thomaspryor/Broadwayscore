    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - calls the performer an 'enormous talent' doing 'excellent work' but the critical 'but' suggests the performance feels labored or artificial, indicating mixed feelings about the execution. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Hodge's talent and work but notes a flaw, indicating a mixed impression. With only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Hodge's talent but suggests his performance feels labored. This indicates a mixed assessment, as it acknowledges skill but implies a lack of naturalness or ease. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers qualified praise for the lead performance—acknowledging excellence while noting it appears effortful—consistent with a mild positive recommendation in the 70-74 range.",
