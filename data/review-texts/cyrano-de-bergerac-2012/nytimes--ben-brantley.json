  "bwwExcerpt": "his gale force has a name, Douglas Hodge, and it is inhabiting, enlivening and almost exploding the title character...Mr. Hodge is as light and oxygenating as air, even as the pure physical impact of his performance sets you reeling. Still, though I hate to say it, that old ennui crept up on me whenever Mr. Hodge wasn’t onstage. Mercifully, that’s only a small fraction of the production.",
