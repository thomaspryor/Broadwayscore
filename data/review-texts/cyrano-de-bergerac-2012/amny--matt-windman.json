  "bwwExcerpt": "Edmond Rostand's 1897 sentimental fairy tale romance 'Cyrano de Bergerac' is not so much a great play as it is a durable star vehicle for a skilled actor who can handle rhymed verse, swordplay and a giant prosthetic nose...The Roundabout Theatre Company's new production proves to be not as fortunate in its casting of Douglas Hodge, an indulgent English actor.",
