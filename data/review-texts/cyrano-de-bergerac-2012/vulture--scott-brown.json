    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt praises the performer's talent and work quality but expresses a significant reservation about the performance feeling labored. The 'but' signals mixed feelings rather than clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Hodge's talent but suggests a lack of effortlessness in his performance. With only one curated quote, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt acknowledges talent but suggests a lack of naturalness, indicating a mixed assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance ('enormous talent,' 'excellent work'), indicating a clear recommendation despite a minor caveat about visible effort. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict.",
