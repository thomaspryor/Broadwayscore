  "bwwExcerpt": "Credit helmer Jamie Lloyd with an original concept for staging Rostand's 19th-century romantic drama. Ditching the affected manners, elaborate court dress, and elegant verse readings associated with classic presentations of this French masterpiece, the Brit director portrays Cyrano as a swashbuckling military leader with the same lusty appetites as his soldiers -- who happen to enjoy a good poetry contest as much as a tavern brawl. But a lack of restraint spoils the fun, making it all seem too big (Cyrano's honker), too much (stomping on tables), and over the top (Douglas Hodge's star turn).",

  "wrongFullText": "A wrenching yarn about a mother seeking justice for the rape of her daughter.\n\nA wrenching yarn about a mother seeking justice for the rape of her daughter, “Azooma” is more about bullying as a social malaise in South Korea than about sexual assault. Effectively inflammatory in depicting the characters’ uphill battle against corrupt, male-dominated systems, the film reps an opportune vehicle for thesp Jang Young-nam to deliver an all-consuming perf. Debuting helmer Lee Ji-seung’s artily edited and compulsive storytelling tactfully sidesteps the subject’s lurid horrors, but still skirts too close to exploitation with a literally jaw-dropping payoff. Extreme Asian ancillary sales and fest play are assured.\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Damon Lindelof Sets Limited Series 'The Chain' at HBO Under New Overall Deal \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n 'It's Florida, Man' Renewed for Season 3 at HBO\n\nAlthough the film was made on a thrifty budget, helmer Lee (who produced such lavish blockbusters as “Haeundae”) demonstrates clear aspirations to quality arthouse filmmaking, using multiple stylized flashbacks to visualize the deeply injured subconcious of his mother-daughter protags.\n\nThe pic opens with one such montage, in which insurance agent Yoon Young-nam (Jang) chases a mugger (Hwang Tae-kwang) through Seoul’s filthier byways. Flashbacks show Yoon discovering her 10-year-old daughter, Yeon-ju (Lee Jae-hee), bleeding excessively in a rubbish heap. The rest of the incident, including Yoon’s backstory, is economically revealed in further flashbacks identifying the mugger as the perp who drove up to the girl and tricked her into getting into his car.\n\nYoon corners the suspect in a cul-de-sac, but she’s become so hysterical that the police accuse her of assault when they arrive. The cops’ visible reluctance to take her side is just the film’s first example of how male-centric authorities mistrust and disrespect women by default; thus, Yoon is addressed as “Azooma,” which means “married woman” but carries implications of social inferiority. Just as shocking as the inaction of the corrupt police force is the reaction of Yoon’s ex-husband (Bai Song-woo).\n\nOver the course of the film, Yeon-ju’s ordeal is re-enacted partly via her own patchy recollections, and partly as Yoon’s self-tormenting visualization of what happened. Whereas several recent Korean films, such as “Silenced,” revel in torturous depictions of pedophilia and rape (and there are enough to constitute a subgenre), the deliberately nebulous lensing by d.p. Hwang Ki S. and snappy editing by Shin Min-kyoung skip over the graphic sexual details here, while unequivocally implying their heinousness.\n\nJang, who received the Directors’ Guild of Korea’s actress award, goes over-the-edge to hypnotic effect, provoking more fear than the cool, collected rapist. Her perf will grate for many, but could be interpreted as a skilled projection of what a nuisance she appears in the eyes of an apathetic society. Acting as a quiet foil, Lee expresses internalized trauma with minimum dialogue.\n\nGiven what Yoon’s gone through, one can readily sympathize with her, and hope that she gets the justice she seeks. Still, only a cynic could see the film’s grisly payoff as cathartic, though the pic does suggest the angst of a national psyche that feels overwhelmed by widespread injustice (as denoted by the ironic Korean title, “A Fair Society”).\n\nIn the hands of a lesser editor, the film’s nonlinear structure might be confusing, but the story’s progression is suspenseful yet logical. Tech credits are average, except for the desaturation of image color, which smacks of faux arthouse grunginess.",
