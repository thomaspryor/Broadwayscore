  "bwwExcerpt": "Mr. Hodge gets what 'Cyrano' is all about, and in its quiet moments his performance is deeply moving—but there aren't enough of them. Not only is Jamie Lloyd's staging as noisy as a concert by a band of jackhammers, but the Roundabout's production makes use of a boisterous new rhyming translation by Ranjit Bolt that updates the play's language to inconsistent effect. Mr. Bolt has salted Rostand's couplets with anachronistic colloquialisms like 'No can do' and 'I'll eat my hat,' and he lacks the easy virtuosity necessary to charge them with the sparkling flair that comes so naturally to Cyrano.",
