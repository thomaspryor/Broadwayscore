However, the lack of superlatives or strong enthusiasm keeps it in the mid-positive range. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"frothy\" and \"old-fashioned entertainment\" and says it \"showcases great Gershwin songs\" and \"provides a vehicle for its stars to charm the audience.\" This is a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The critic commends the show for successfully achieving its goals as light entertainment, praising the Gershwin score and star performances, though the excerpt's brevity limits certainty about the full verdict.",
