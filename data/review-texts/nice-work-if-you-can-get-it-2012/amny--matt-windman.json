  "bwwExcerpt": "While Kathleen Marshall's crowd-pleasing production lacks the inspired showstopper choreography of her revival of 'Anything Goes,' it makes for nonstop giddy fun thanks to its dynamic cast, Joe DiPietro's wickedly funny dialogue and a treasure trove of timeless Gershwin favorites and rarities. At first, Broderick seems ill at ease, especially while dancing. But soon enough he wins over the audience with his charm and thin but pleasant singing voice. O'Hara, best remembered as Nellie Forbush in the 'South Pacific' revival, proves that she can also sparkle in a silly comedy.",
