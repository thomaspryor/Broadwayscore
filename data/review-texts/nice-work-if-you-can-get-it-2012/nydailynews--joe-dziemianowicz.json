    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. Acknowledges positives (songs, Broderick's charm) but significant criticism of the book being old-fashioned suggests neither strong recommendation nor discouragement. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges positive elements like Gershwin songs and Broderick's charm but criticizes the book as old-fashioned. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive elements (Gershwin songs, Broderick) but criticizes the book as old-fashioned, resulting in a mixed assessment. The original rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The review balances praise for the Gershwin songs and Broderick's performance against criticism of the old-fashioned book. The critic's own 60/100 rating confirms a middle-of-the-road assessment that neither recommends nor discourages attendance.",
