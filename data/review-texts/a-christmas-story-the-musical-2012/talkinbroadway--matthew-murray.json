Single excerpt warning suggests this represents a favorable overall assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation, describing the show as 'gentle, sweet, and ultimately satisfying.' Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed on the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"gentle, sweet, and ultimately satisfying\", suggesting a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive tone warrants a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers clear endorsement with 'succeeds' and 'ultimately satisfying,' though with modest praise suggesting solid rather than exceptional achievement.",
