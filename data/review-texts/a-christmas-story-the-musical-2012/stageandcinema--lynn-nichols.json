    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Positive language ('sweet', 'charm', 'captures the essence') indicates recommendation, but brief text and lack of stronger superlatives keeps it in mid-Positive range. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'sweet' and 'nostalgic' with 'theatrical charm,' indicating a positive recommendation. However, the brevity of the review and lack of detailed evaluation suggest a moderate level of enthusiasm. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"sweet\" and \"captures the essence\" indicating a positive recommendation, but it is not overly enthusiastic, so it falls into the positive bucket. | Kimi: The reviewer praises the adaptation for capturing the film's essence while adding theatrical charm, using warm adjectives like 'sweet' and 'nostalgic' that clearly recommend the show despite the mild tone.",
