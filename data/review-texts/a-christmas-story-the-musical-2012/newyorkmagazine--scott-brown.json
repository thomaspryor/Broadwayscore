(Only one moment doesn't stand the test of time: I believe Western culture may be ready to retire the familiar and beloved and, yes, ragingly offensive scene where the waitstaff of a Chinese restaurant serenade the family with \"Deck de harrs with hows of horry!\") Jean Shepherd's America — whether it ever existed or not — is in excellent hands.",

Single excerpt warning requires caution, but tone is clearly positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for its respect for the source material and talent, indicating a strong positive sentiment. The mention of a single outdated scene does not significantly detract from the overall positive tone. | Gemini: The review opens with high praise, calling the show a product of \"rare respect\" and \"unimpeachable talent.\" While it notes one potentially outdated scene, the overall tone is very positive and recommends the show. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production's 'unimpeachable talent' and 'excellent' handling of the source material, with only minor criticism regarding one dated scene, indicating a highly favorable assessment.",
