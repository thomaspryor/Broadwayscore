  "bwwExcerpt": "Broadway has recently seen such a steady stream of family musicals devised to rake in Thanksgiving-to-New Year's dollars. \"A Christmas Story,\" as its well-known title indicates, is yet another such specimen, but one that distinguishes itself.

Single excerpt warning suggests upper end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for its heartwarming story, impressive score, and effective staging. The positive tone and specific commendations suggest a strong recommendation, despite the limited excerpt. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights several positive aspects of the show, including a heartwarming story, impressive score, canny staging, and laugh-out-loud production numbers. This suggests a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
