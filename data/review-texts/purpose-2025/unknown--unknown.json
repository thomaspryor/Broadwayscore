    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows praise for the first half ('brilliant sitcom') but clear disappointment with how it ends ('jumps the shark'). Classic mixed review pattern but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'deeply imagined' and 'brilliant' but also notes it 'jumps the shark,' indicating a mix of positive and negative elements. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The review starts positively but then indicates a decline in quality, suggesting a mixed reaction overall. The truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strong praise ('brilliant', 'deeply imagined') suggesting merit, but the 'jumps the shark' caveat indicates significant disappointment in the show's later development. With only one curated excerpt available, the overall verdict is interpreted as a cautious, qualified recommendation.",
