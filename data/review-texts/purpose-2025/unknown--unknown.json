Classic mixed review structure with both positive and negative elements. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'deeply imagined' and 'brilliant' but criticizes it for 'jumping the shark,' indicating a mix of positive and negative elements. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The review starts with praise but then states it \"jumps the shark\", indicating a decline in quality. The overall sentiment is mixed, but I am scoring it with low confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('brilliant sitcom') but ends on a significant negative note ('jumps the shark'), suggesting a decline in quality. With only one curated excerpt available, the review appears to offer a genuinely mixed assessment.",
