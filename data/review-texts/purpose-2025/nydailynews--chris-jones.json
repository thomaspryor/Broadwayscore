  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "In the end, \"Purpose\" is a major new American play about what it's like to be trapped by powerful parents whose public personas their children can easily see through, even as they are condemned to try and live up to their import. A thumping blend of tragic-proximate horror and schadenfreude, it's riveting to watch."
