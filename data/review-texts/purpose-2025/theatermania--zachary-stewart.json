This indicates a highly positive verdict, placing it in the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests high praise, calling the play potentially one of the greatest American dramas. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise ranking the production among the greatest American dramas of all time, indicating an enthusiastic must-see recommendation.",
