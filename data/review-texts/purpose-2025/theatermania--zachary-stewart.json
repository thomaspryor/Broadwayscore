However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses a very positive sentiment, suggesting the play is destined to be among the greatest American dramas. Given the single excerpt, the score is placed at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise ranking the show among the greatest American dramas of all time, indicating an unqualified, enthusiastic recommendation despite limited context.",
