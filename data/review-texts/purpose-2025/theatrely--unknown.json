  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "It's a fascinating treatise on respectability, conservatism, preservation and legacy which, in Jacobs-Jenkins fashion, is also an enthralling drama which draws the most biting comedic blood from its human tragedy.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "With its dynastic family headed by a patriarch who finds a late-in-life distaste for mendacity, Jacobs-Jenkins seems to be not just riffing on Tennessee Williams’ Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, but grounding it at a fascinating historical crossroads for Black Americans; a sort of impasse between a modern sense that the storied Civil Rights era’s respectability has badly ossified and a contemporary moral anarchy during which 'young people these days,' as Solomon points out, are nevertheless 'too obsessed with being history, making history.'",
