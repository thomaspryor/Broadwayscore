  "bwwExcerpt": "There’s so much of this direct-address material that its effectiveness can vary wildly from moment to moment. At the outset, it’s helpful scene-setting, and once the family sparks start to fly, Hill manages some quick asides that bring the house down. But Jacobs-Jenkins also uses Nazareth’s soliloquies to explain character motivations, fill in brief time jumps, underline themes, and sometimes just flat-out describe scenes that aren’t actually dramatized. If this self-interrupting technique functioned as a running commentary more consistently, it might feel like a subversion of familiar melodrama. Instead, these moments often bear so much weight that they come across like a hasty solution to writing problems that Jacobs-Jenkins couldn’t quite crack.",
