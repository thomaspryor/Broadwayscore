The limited excerpt and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review suggests there are reasons to see the show, specifically LaTanya Richardson Jackson's performance, which implies a positive recommendation, but the single excerpt and lack of detail lowers confidence. | Kimi: The critic explicitly recommends seeing the show and compares LaTanya Richardson Jackson's performance to legendary stage actress Laurette Taylor's iconic turn in 'The Glass Menagerie,' indicating exceptional praise for the lead performance.",
