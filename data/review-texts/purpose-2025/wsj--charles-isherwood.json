    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt suggests the show starts strong but loses momentum. The phrase 'doesn't sustain excitement' indicates structural problems, pointing to mixed reception rather than positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a drop in excitement in the second act, suggesting a mixed review. However, due to the limited excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a decline in quality in the second act, suggesting a mixed experience overall. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates the production initially generates excitement but falters in its longer second act, suggesting an uneven theatrical experience. With only a single curated excerpt available, confidence in the overall verdict is reduced.",
