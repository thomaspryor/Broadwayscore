    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong positive language ('blistering powder keg', 'gasps and guffaws') suggesting an engaging, impactful production. However, limited text and excerpt warning require low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as 'blistering powder keg' and mentions audience reactions like 'gasps and guffaws', indicating a highly impactful and engaging production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the play as a \"blistering powder keg\" and mentions \"gasps and guffaws,\" suggesting a positive, albeit potentially intense, experience. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strongly positive descriptors ('blistering,' 'densely packed') and praises the playwright's effectiveness ('gasps and guffaws'), indicating a clear recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full verdict.",

Moments of real uncertainly — when it seems that just about anything could happen next — are a rare and wonderful feat. If a bit of patience is required in return, call it a fair trade.",
