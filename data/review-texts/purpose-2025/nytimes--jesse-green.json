However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is highly positive, describing the play as deeply imagined, grave, and like a brilliant sitcom, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('brilliant sitcom', 'laughing so hard') but focuses only on the first act and limited text necessitates low confidence.",
