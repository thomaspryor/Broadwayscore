  "bwwExcerpt": "Pulling it all together is Rashad, who directs her excellent cast with insight and nuance, no false moves from beginning to end. The play doesn’t pretend to answer all the lofty questions it raises – how could it? Finding purpose is an elusive and difficult endeavor, and Jacobs-Jenkins has fashioned a play that, more than anything, embraces the search.",
