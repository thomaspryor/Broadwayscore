    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Despite being only an excerpt, the superlative 'simply the best...of the season' indicates strong enthusiasm. However, confidence is low due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a highly positive evaluation, calling it the best play of the season. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the superlative \"best,\" indicating a very positive review. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise declaring the show the best new play of the season, indicating a strong recommendation. However, given this is a single curated excerpt that may be cherry-picked, the score is placed at the high end of the Positive bucket rather than Rave. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
