    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('incredibly well written', 'exceptionally acted') suggests clear recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness of full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for both the writing and acting, suggesting a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt contains high praise for the writing and acting, indicating a strong positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Strong superlatives ('incredibly', 'exceptionally') praising the writing and performances indicate an enthusiastic recommendation. Per guidance for clearly positive single excerpts, scoring at the upper end of the Positive bucket (80-84).",
