    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for dialogue, acting, and thematic content with vivid positive language ('feast of the good stuff', 'crackling', 'powerhouse'). Single excerpt warning applied - sounds clearly positive so scored in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the dialogue, acting, and themes, indicating a positive review. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language like \"feast,\" \"crackling dialogue,\" and \"powerhouse ensemble acting,\" suggesting a strong recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the play's dialogue, ensemble, and themes using strong descriptors like 'feast,' 'crackling,' and 'powerhouse,' warranting a high Positive score, though confidence is reduced given the limited context of a single curated excerpt.",
