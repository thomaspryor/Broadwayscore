    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for dialogue, acting, and thematic content with vivid positive language ('feast of the good stuff', 'crackling', 'powerhouse'). Single excerpt warning applied - sounds clearly positive so scored in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the dialogue, acting, and themes, indicating a positive review. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language like \"feast,\" \"crackling dialogue,\" and \"powerhouse ensemble acting,\" suggesting a strong recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the play's dialogue, ensemble, and themes using strong descriptors like 'feast,' 'crackling,' and 'powerhouse,' warranting a high Positive score, though confidence is reduced given the limited context of a single curated excerpt.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "“Purpose” toggles between the old and new — be it in discussions about political sacrifice, queerness or parenthood. This tension is so essential that designer Todd Rosenthal builds it into his set: a nod to classic architecture and proverbial Afrocentric homeyness accented with contemporary touches of recessed lighting and a trendy bouclé couch. This production has officially mastered the balance of distilling complex, intergenerational conflict into accessible, modern drama. And though many are the plays that have tried, it is “Purpose” that prevails.\nBrittani Samuel\nMarch 18, 2025 . 12:46 AM 9 min read\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Facebook\nShare on LinkedIn\nShare via Email",
