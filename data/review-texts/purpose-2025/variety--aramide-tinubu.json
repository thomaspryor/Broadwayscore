  "bwwExcerpt": "A whirlwind of a play, the cast delivers incredible performances and seems at ease in this world cultivated by Jacobs-Jenkins and structured by Rashad. The play acknowledges how much our families and our places within them shape, define and break us. ‘Purpose’ is a brilliant and profound narrative about legacies, ambition, mental illness and who you may become if you were never allowed to know yourself.",
