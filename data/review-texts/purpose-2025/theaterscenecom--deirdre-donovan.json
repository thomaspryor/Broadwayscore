    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: The critic explicitly calls the show a 'must-see' which is unqualified recommendation language typical of rave reviews. However, confidence is low due to the extremely limited excerpt available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses the phrase 'must-see,' which strongly indicates a rave review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The phrase \"must-see\" indicates a very strong, enthusiastic recommendation, placing it in the Rave bucket. However, the confidence is low due to the very short excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strong enthusiastic language ('must-see'), but per instructions for single curated excerpts, this falls in the upper Positive range (80-84) rather than Rave due to the risk of cherry-picking. Confidence is low given only one excerpt is available.",
