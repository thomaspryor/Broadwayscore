  "bwwExcerpt": "Such basic storytelling, a collection of vignettes peppered with musical passages, could have been presented quite minimally, but MTC wraps Santiago-Hudson's colorful yarns in a handsome package. Michael Carnahan's grandly dilapidated proscenium arcs over the stage; Jen Schriever's lights evoke the ghosts and shadows of yesteryear; Darron L. West's sound design balances speech and music - of which there's an abundance. Santiago-Hudson isn't alone on stage: He's backed by accomplished guitarist Junior Mack, who strums and frets the original blues score by Bill Simms, Jr. Santiago-Hudson jams along on harmonica, wailing and keening into the air when words just aren't enough.",
