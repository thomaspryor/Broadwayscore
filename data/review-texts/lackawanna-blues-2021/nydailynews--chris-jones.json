  "bwwExcerpt": "Playing at the Samuel J. Freedman Theatre,' Lackawanna Blues' is a one-man show with Santiago-Hudson playing all the roles, and his fans might expect it to have funny characters and some lively blues licks (in this production, courtesy of the on-stage guitarist Junior Mack). And so it does. But few will be prepared for the emotional undercurrent present in Santiago-Hudson's self-directed performance, which often feels like it is being interrupted by a well of feelings so strong that the actor struggles to process them in the moment.",
