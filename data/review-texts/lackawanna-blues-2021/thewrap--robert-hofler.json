  "bwwExcerpt": "What exactly does Ruben Santiago-Hudson not do in the first Broadway revival of his 2001 play 'Lackawanna Blues,' which opened Thursday at MTC's Samuel J. Friedman Theatre? He has written, directed and stars, giving himself at least two dozen characters to play in this one-person show about growing up Black in the steel town of Lackawanna, New York, in the 1950s and beyond. He sings the blues, accompanied by guitarist Junior Mack, and he plays a mean harmonica, as well as a wide range of characters - including an adorable pet raccoon that's let loose into the wild, much to the disappointment of Junior.",
