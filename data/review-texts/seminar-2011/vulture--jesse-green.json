  "fullText": "Photo: Jeremy Daniel\n \n \n \n Writer writes about writing: Now, there’s a headline that generally trips my every mental spam filter. Few subjects register higher on my Tediumeter than the struggle of scribes, the agony of creation, the precarious balance of discipline and insanity, the rare thrill of — hey, look at me, trying to make it sound interesting! See, that’s what we do. We self-justify, we self-mythologize. (We have to. We spend a lot of time by ourselves.) All writers want to write about writing, for the same reason the media wants so desperately to cover itself. At least when Stephen King spins this sort of endoscopic yarn, he has courtesy to spill a little blood, as a sop.\n\nNobody dies in Theresa Rebeck’s Seminar, and for approximately two thirds of this delightfully, effervescently empty play, we don’t even want anyone to. That’s a significant achievement, considering how intrinsically irritating all of these characters are and how vastly Rebeck’s interest in them outstrips our own, often by several orders of magnitude. We open in a one-panel New Yorker cartoon: a palatial rent-controlled apartment on the Upper West Side, packed with no-longer-young dilettantes. Poor little rich girl Kate (Lily Rabe), whose family owns the joint, is hosting a writing seminar for a klatch of friends, associates, and connected types, including her platonic longtime pal Martin (Hamish Linklater), a penniless, overeducated do-nothing with a cramped outer-borough apartment as badge and bona fide of his “authenticity.” Also aboard is Douglas (Jerry O’Connell), a poseur with a famous surname and connections aplenty, who mostly surfs between designer-label writers’ colonies, accruing cachet and pseudo-academic buzz phrases. Rounding out the quartet is the hot-to-trot climber Izzy (Hettienne Park), who’s post-feminizing her way to the top of a still mostly male publishing establishment. Into these wobbly pins crashes the instructor, Leonard (Alan Rickman), a once-celebrated, now-embittered novelist who makes a living brutalizing aspiring authors with something he calls “the truth.”",
