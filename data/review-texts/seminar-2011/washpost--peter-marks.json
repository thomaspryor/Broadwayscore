However, it also mentions the \"sometimes brutal process,\" indicating a reservation. Thus, it is a positive review with reservations. | Kimi: The phrase 'saving grace' implies the production has significant weaknesses, but the critic acknowledges it succeeds in generating humor despite depicting difficult thematic material.",
