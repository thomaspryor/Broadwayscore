    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review uses positive descriptors ('smart, funny') but this appears to be a very brief excerpt or opening line. Low confidence due to lack of fuller evaluation or clear recommendation language. | GPT-4o: The review uses positive adjectives like 'smart' and 'funny', indicating a recommendation. The tone suggests a solid endorsement with some appreciation for the play's brutal honesty. | Gemini: The review describes the play as \"smart, funny, and often brutal,\" indicating a positive overall assessment and recommendation. | Kimi: Brief excerpt offers unqualified praise ('smart, funny, brutal') indicating a positive recommendation, though truncated context limits scoring confidence.",
