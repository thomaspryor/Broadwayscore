  "bwwExcerpt": "The truth about Seminar?' Well, the young writers' banter initially crackles, as they humorously toss around words like 'reductive,' 'associative connection,' and 'interiority.' But other times their language becomes surprisingly flat, with too many seminar-discussion utterances of 'I liked it' or 'It's good.'",
