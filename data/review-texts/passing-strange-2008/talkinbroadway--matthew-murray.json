The language suggests an enthusiastic endorsement. | Gemini: The review states the show is \"engaging\" and a \"deeply personal story\", indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers unqualified praise for the show's dual success as entertainment and personal narrative, using words like 'succeeding' and 'engaging' that indicate a solid recommendation.",
