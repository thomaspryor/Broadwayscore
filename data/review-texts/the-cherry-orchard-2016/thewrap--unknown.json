  "bwwExcerpt": "The theater's most famous cherry orchard makes a return appearance in the Roundabout's new revival, which opened Sunday at the American Airlines Theatre. Those soon-to-be-chopped-down fruit trees are represented by hanging mobile-like sculptures, designed by Scott Pask, and they kept reminding me of the Serban production. In the end, they're the least of what's wrong in Simon Godwin's staging of Stephen Karam's new adaptation.",
