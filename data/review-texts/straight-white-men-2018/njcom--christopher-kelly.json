  "bwwExcerpt": "Young Jean Lee's play 'Straight White Men,' starring Armie Hammer in his Broadway debut, is a consideration of the experiences of, well, Straight White Men struggling to find their place in these 'woke' times. Or at least I think that's what the play is about, since it's impossible to tell whether Lee is lampooning her characters, who have a tendency to wield their privilege even when they're ostensibly trying to surrender it, or if she finds their plights genuinely worthy of empathy.",
