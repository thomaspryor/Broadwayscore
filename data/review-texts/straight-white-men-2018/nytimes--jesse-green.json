  "bwwExcerpt": "The casting of shiny actors like Mr. Hammer (of 'Call Me By Your Name') and Mr. Charles (of 'The Good Wife') has the perverse effect - though they are both spot on - of making the play seem mainstream. So does Ms. Shapiro's direction, which is confident and highly polished; even the boys' mortifying, half-remembered rec-room dance routines are snappily choreographed, by Faye Driscoll.",

Positive assessment but brief text limits confidence. | Gemini: The review describes the play as knowing what it's doing and being a comedy about privilege, which suggests a positive, albeit potentially challenging, experience. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the play's intelligence and craft, describing it as an effective, challenging comedy. However, the text is under 50 words, warranting low confidence as the full scope of the critic's assessment is unavailable.",
