  "bwwExcerpt": "There is no character development or plot, besides a handful of guys sitting around on a couch. As their father looks on, the three young men play games (including a retooled version of 'Monopoly' created by their mother), joke around (breaking into a parody version of the title song of 'Oklahoma!') and strut around in matching pajamas.",
