  "bwwExcerpt": "Like so many 90-minute plays these days, 'Straight White Men' is a mildly amusing extended skit. Lee gooses her fragile and very contrived story line by having the men engage in outrageous horseplay. But their dancing, singing, and physical gross-out antics are the kind of theatrics one learns from watching too many episodes of 'Two and a Half Men.'",
  "bwwScore": 6
