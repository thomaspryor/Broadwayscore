  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Under Ms. Lee’s direction at the Public, the play was shaggier and, paradoxically, more coherent; something about this knotty material, with its complex point of view and shifting tonalities, benefits from a crude attack. In the current production, I missed the brutality of the final confrontations, which now seem to pass in a haze of tough love. That said, 'Straight White Men' is still an exceedingly odd — and thus welcome — presence on Broadway. It remains undeniably powerful.\"\n\nRead more",

Because it is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic misses the coherence and brutality of the previous Public Theater production, they ultimately deem the Broadway transfer 'undeniably powerful' and a 'welcome' presence, indicating a qualified but genuine recommendation.",
