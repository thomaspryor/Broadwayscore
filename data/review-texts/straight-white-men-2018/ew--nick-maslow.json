  "bwwExcerpt": "Straight White Men might sound like a frat-tastic comedy in the vein of The Hangover, but it's actually a powerful social commentary opening Monday at the Hayes Theatre on Broadway. With the help of a star-studded male ensemble making impressive Broadway debuts - including Armie Hammer (Call Me By Your Name) and Josh Charles (The Good Wife) - the play examines toxic masculinity and white male privilege while making you disappointed that modern men still haven't harnessed their strength in a positive movement the way women have with feminism.",
