    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The text appears to be a truncated excerpt with only positive observations about production values and performances. The critic's own 60 rating indicates Mixed territory, but without the full review context including any criticisms or overall verdict, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The original rating of 60 suggests a mixed review, and the text highlights production qualities without a strong recommendation or discouragement. | Gemini: The review highlights positive aspects like the set design and performances, but doesn't offer a clear recommendation, aligning with a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 60 falls squarely in the Mixed range (55-69). While the excerpt praises the technical elements and performances, the numerical score indicates overall reservations that prevent a full recommendation.",
