    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 places the review in the Mixed bucket. The text praises the set and performances but lacks strong recommendation language, aligning with a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review highlights positive aspects like the set design and performances, but lacks a clear recommendation for or against seeing the show. Given the original rating of 60, it falls into the mixed category. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 60/100 falls squarely in the Mixed range (55-69). While the excerpt offers praise for the production design and performances, the middling numeric score indicates a lukewarm overall recommendation.",
