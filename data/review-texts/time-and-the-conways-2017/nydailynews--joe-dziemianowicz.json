  "bwwExcerpt": "Without the time-leaping construction, the play is pretty conventional. It also has an annoying habit of overexplaining itself. In this case, a character quotes William Blake, noting that 'joy and woe are woven fine.' Good and bad ebb and flow in life. Well, yeah. While ideas are underlined and highlighted, characters tend to be fairly one-dimensional. But under the sensitive direction of Rebecca Taichman (a Tony winner for 'Indecent'), a first-rate ensemble breathes vibrant life into the adult Conway children.",
