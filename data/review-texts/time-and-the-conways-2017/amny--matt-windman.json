  "bwwExcerpt": "Except for a handful of striking moments, the play comes off as a boring mishmash of Chekhov's 'The Cherry Orchard,' Sondheim's 'Merrily We Roll Along' and, of course, 'Downton Abbey.' Perhaps it would work better with an all-English cast that possesses ensemble unity. Here, the performances are uneven - and so are the accents.",
