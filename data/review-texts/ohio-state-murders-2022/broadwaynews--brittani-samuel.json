  "bwwExcerpt": "Kennedy’s script extends beyond institutional racism and delves into the depths of systemic savagery. It exposes the insidious nature of supremacy on Black and white people — neither race spared from madness. But these gargantuan concepts exhaust audiences because of Leon’s unheightened direction. To be fair, “Ohio” is more a play of reactions than action — a challenge to stage effectively. The other characters that populate Suzanne’s memory of the Midwest — roommate Iris Ann (Abigail Stephenson), eventual husband David Alexander (Mister Fitzgerald), landlord Mrs. Tyler (Lizan Mitchell) — only enter to cry, play violin or gaze into the wings. But Leon hardly has McDonald touch her silent scene mates, limiting the potential for onstage intimacy between characters. Instead, his rigid blocking of these extra characters is tiresome. In fact, McDonald’s greatest emotional connection is with two pink scarves meant to symbolize Suzanne’s twin girls.",

Uses 'poignant' positively, suggesting the critic finds value in the production's themes. However, confidence is low due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a positive aspect of the show, noting its poignant message. However, due to the lack of additional context and the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt highlights a \"poignant message about strength,\" which suggests a positive, though potentially qualified, recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt uses clearly positive evaluative language ('poignant message') praising the show's thematic strength and lasting relevance, warranting the upper end of the Positive range per guidelines for curated excerpts, though confidence is low due to limited text availability.",
