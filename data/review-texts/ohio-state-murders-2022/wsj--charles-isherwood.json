  "bwwExcerpt": "I spent a restless, almost sleepless night after seeing the play, haunted by its peculiar, unsettling power. Encountering a great work of art can be as disorienting as it is rewarding. “Ohio State Murders” leaves a lasting imprint—I picture a bloody handprint—on what for lack of a better term I’ll call the soul.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic describes the show as leaving a 'lasting imprint' on the soul, which suggests strong emotional impact and memorable theater. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong, evocative language suggesting a profound impact, indicating a highly positive evaluation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The quote suggests a powerful and memorable experience, indicating a positive, though possibly disturbing, impact. Given that it is a single excerpt, I've placed it in the middle of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs vivid, visceral imagery to praise the production's deep emotional impact and lasting resonance. While clearly indicative of strong admiration, the single-excerpt format carries risk of cherry-picking, warranting a high-positive score with reduced confidence.",
