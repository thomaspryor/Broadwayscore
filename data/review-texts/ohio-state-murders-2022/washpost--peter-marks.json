However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the production and Morrison's storytelling, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strong language suggests a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers glowing praise for Morrison's performance, describing her as a 'master storyteller' with 'towering gifts,' though as a single curated quote it may not represent the full review's assessment of the entire production.",
