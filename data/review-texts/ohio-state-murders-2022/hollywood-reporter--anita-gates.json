    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising direction and cast, but very limited text available. Sounds positive but cautious scoring due to potential cherry-picking from a longer review with unknown overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction and supporting cast, indicating a positive view. However, with only one excerpt, the full sentiment of the review is unclear, leading to a low confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the direction and supporting cast, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low, and the score is placed at the lower end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the direction ('sensitive and effective') and supporting cast ('talented,' 'authentic'), indicating a positive recommendation. However, the language is professional rather than ecstatic, and the single-excerpt limitation warrants conservative scoring and low confidence.",
