    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear criticism of the production as overcooked and portentous, suggesting problems with execution. However, with only one curated quote available, the full verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, noting the production is 'sometimes just much for its own good' and 'portentous when it needn’t be.' The lack of full context and the single excerpt warning lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the production is uneven and \"overcooked,\" indicating a mixed reaction. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production as excessive ('overcooked,' 'portentous,' 'too much'), indicating the critic found the directorial approach flawed and heavy-handed rather than restrained. While not a vicious pan, the absence of any redeeming praise in this sole excerpt suggests a negative verdict.",
