  "bwwExcerpt": "Unlike previous stagings of the play, Off Broadway and elsewhere, the Broadway production features McDonald as both the younger and older versions of Suzanne, and here the actor is a marvel, conveying a student’s excitement with a heady new world that she’ll soon learn doesn’t want her, and as an accomplished author whose success can’t outrun her grief. It’s in the portrayal of those contrasts that McDonald finds something close to perfection in a flawed production.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt criticizes the production as 'overcooked' and 'portentous,' suggesting mixed feelings about execution. However, this is only one curated excerpt which may not represent the full verdict, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the production is overly complex and could benefit from simplicity, indicating mixed feelings. The lack of a clear positive or negative recommendation places it in the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the production is uneven, with moments of being \"overcooked\" and \"portentous.\" This indicates a mixed assessment, as it is neither strongly positive nor negative. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production as 'overcooked' and 'portentous,' suggesting directorial excess that detracts from the show, indicating the reviewer does not recommend it.",
