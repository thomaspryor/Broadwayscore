And although it boasts the supreme Audra McDonald, Leon has directed such a restrained portrayal this fine actress’s performance is reminiscent of a thoroughbred held back by an incompetent jockey.\"\n\nRead more",

Despite praising McDonald as 'supreme,' the overall assessment is negative about the production choices. | GPT-4o: The excerpt questions the play's presence on Broadway and criticizes the direction of Audra McDonald's performance, suggesting a negative impression. However, with only a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review questions the play's presence on Broadway and criticizes the direction, even while acknowledging Audra McDonald's talent. The analogy of a thoroughbred held back suggests a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: Despite praising Audra McDonald as 'supreme,' the critic questions why the play is on Broadway at all and delivers a devastating assessment of the direction as 'incompetent,' suggesting the production wastes its star's talent.",
