And although it boasts the supreme Audra McDonald, Leon has directed such a restrained portrayal this fine actress’s performance is reminiscent of a thoroughbred held back by an incompetent jockey.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic questions why the show exists on Broadway and criticizes the direction for restraining McDonald's performance. While praising the lead actress, the overall assessment is negative about the production choices and its Broadway worthiness. | GPT-4o: The excerpt questions the play's presence on Broadway and criticizes the direction as restraining Audra McDonald's performance. The tone is negative, but due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review questions why the play is on Broadway and criticizes the direction, even though it acknowledges Audra McDonald's presence. The analogy of a restrained thoroughbred suggests a negative assessment of the production. | Kimi: The excerpt strongly criticizes the production's justification for being on Broadway, its brief runtime, and the director's 'incompetent' handling of Audra McDonald's performance, indicating a clear negative verdict despite acknowledging the star's talent.",
