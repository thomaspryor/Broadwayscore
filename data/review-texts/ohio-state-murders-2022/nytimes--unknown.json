This suggests a mixed response - acknowledging craft while finding the viewing experience difficult. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, highlighting the play's painful story and the effort to tell it, without clear positive or negative sentiment. The single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a play that is painful but told properly, indicating a mixed reaction. The lack of a clear recommendation places it in the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges the production tells the story 'properly' with 'immense effort' but emphasizes the painful nature without clear enthusiasm or recommendation, suggesting a balanced to lukewarm assessment.",
