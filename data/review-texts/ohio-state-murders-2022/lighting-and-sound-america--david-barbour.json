  "showScoreExcerpt": "One of the most moving things about this production is how the work of Kennedy, an Off-Broadway stalwart for six decades, has been so lovingly brought to Broadway for the first time. It may seem like counterintuitive piece of programming, especially at this time of year. But Ohio State Murders, written in 1992, couldn't be more pertinent right now; its stark subject matter, brief running time, and gut-punch power invite comparisons to the tragedies of Aeschylus and Euripides.\n\nRead more",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's emotional impact and relevance, comparing it to classic tragedies. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights the play's pertinence and power, comparing it to Greek tragedies. While the excerpt is positive, the lack of full text and the mention of it being a 'counterintuitive piece of programming' suggest some reservations, placing it in the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
