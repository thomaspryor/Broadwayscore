    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise for the writing quality ('great poetry', 'light touch'), but limited text prevents full assessment of overall recommendation strength. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the writing style, describing it as poetic and subtly impactful. The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits the confidence level. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the writing as poetic and effective, suggesting a positive experience overall. However, due to the limited text and excerpt-only warning, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong praise for the writing quality ('great poetry') and describes sophisticated emotional impact, indicating a clearly positive view of the text, though the single curated excerpt limits certainty about the overall production verdict.",
