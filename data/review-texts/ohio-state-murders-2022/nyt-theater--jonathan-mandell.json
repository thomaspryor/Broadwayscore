    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic describes the play itself as 'eerie, riveting, challenging' but explicitly states they liked this Broadway production less than a previous version. This suggests mixed feelings about the current production despite appreciation for the material. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses a preference for a previous production over the current one, indicating a mixed reaction. The excerpt suggests respect for the play and its elements but implies the current production did not meet expectations. | Gemini: The critic states they liked this Broadway version less than a previous production, suggesting a mixed reaction. The truncated text and single excerpt lower confidence. | Kimi: The critic describes the play itself as 'eerie, riveting, and challenging' with clear admiration for the material and symbolic significance of the Broadway debut, but explicitly prefers a previous production, suggesting a qualified recommendation for this specific staging.",
