  "bwwExcerpt": "If I were a producer of this play in a 1,000-seat Broadway theater charging a top ticket price of $200+, I too would surely want to focus as much attention as possible on Audra McDonald, who is an undeniable crowd-pleaser and gives her all, as usual. McDonald is an actress whose emotions emerge from her depths to play out so powerfully and transparently on the surface that we can’t help but share in them. I couldn’t help wondering though: Would a separate, numbed-out Suzanne have been more effective?",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "There is symbolic significance to Kennedy, perhaps the oldest living playwright in America and among the most respected, finally making her Broadway debut, all the more so because of [James Earl Jones, Kenny Leon], Audra McDonald, the most honored living Broadway actress\n…There is some irony, then, that I actually liked this version of “Ohio State Murders” somewhat less than a production of the same eerie, riveting, challenging play that I saw early last year\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic describes the play itself as 'eerie, riveting, challenging' but explicitly states they liked this Broadway production less than a previous version. This suggests mixed feelings about the current production despite appreciation for the material. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses a preference for a previous production over the current one, indicating a mixed reaction. The excerpt suggests respect for the play and its elements but implies the current production did not meet expectations. | Gemini: The critic states they liked this Broadway version less than a previous production, suggesting a mixed reaction. The truncated text and single excerpt lower confidence. | Kimi: The critic describes the play itself as 'eerie, riveting, and challenging' with clear admiration for the material and symbolic significance of the Broadway debut, but explicitly prefers a previous production, suggesting a qualified recommendation for this specific staging.",
