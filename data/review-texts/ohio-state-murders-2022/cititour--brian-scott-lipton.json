    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows structural criticism (suggesting the show would work better differently) while praising McDonald's magnetic performance. The 'let's be honest' phrasing suggests reservations about the material's effectiveness. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises McDonald's performance but suggests the piece might work better as a monologue, indicating mixed feelings about the production's structure. The single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the strength of McDonald's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. Given the single excerpt and the phrase 'impossible to look away', I'm placing it in the lower end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: While the excerpt includes criticism of the quasi-monologue device suggesting it would work better without other characters, the strong praise for McDonald's captivating performance ('impossible to look away') serves as the primary recommendation. Given only one excerpt is available, this appears to be a qualified positive review. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
