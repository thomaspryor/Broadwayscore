    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt is neutral, focusing on the show's genre rather than offering a clear recommendation or critique. With only one excerpt, the overall sentiment is ambiguous, leading to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The excerpt is neutral, describing the show as a murder mystery and inviting the audience to engage. Without more context, it's impossible to determine a clear recommendation, so I've classified it as mixed with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt encourages active audience engagement with the show's mystery elements, implying mild approval, though the lack of explicit quality evaluation and single-excerpt limitation warrant a lower-end Positive score.",
