  "bwwExcerpt": "In director Kenny Leon’s thoughtful production, Beowulf Boritt’s set suggests a storm of research-library shelves, some suspended in midair and some half-buried in the ground, as though Suzanne existed in both the midst of catastrophe and the ruins of one. The forces stacked against her extend to the back wall of the stage, which is gashed by a craggy ravine—the site of a winter homicide—behind which snow descends continuously. The chills that periodically shoot through this play are part of the same cold front as the steady, muffling whiteness that falls gently in its background.",

Given the original rating of 80, a score in the positive range is appropriate. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 80 confirms a solidly positive recommendation, and the text offers clear praise for the production's elegant staging and effective design, though the excerpt's extreme brevity necessitates low confidence.",
