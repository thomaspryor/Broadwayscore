The 'museum piece' metaphor suggests something to be admired from a distance rather than experienced. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the production's handsome and respectful qualities but criticizes it for lacking vitality, suggesting a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (\"handsome and respectful\") but ultimately finds the production lacking vitality, suggesting a mixed or neutral recommendation. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges handsome production values but criticizes the show for feeling like a static 'museum piece' rather than vibrant theater, suggesting respectful competence without theatrical life.",
