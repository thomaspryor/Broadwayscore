Single excerpt warning applied - using upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises McDonald's performance as a 'tour de force' and describes the play as 'chilling and revealing' and 'one you won’t soon forget,' indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review praises Audra McDonald's performance as an 'acting tour de force' and states the play is 'chilling and revealing' and 'one you won't soon forget,' indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Audra McDonald's 'tour de force' performance and calls the production 'fine' and memorable, though it acknowledges the play's challenging structure. Given this is a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
