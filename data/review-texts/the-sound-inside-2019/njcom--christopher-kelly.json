  "bwwExcerpt": "If 'The Sound Inside' has lost some of the intimacy that I previously found so arresting, it's only gained in richness and mystery. As Christopher strikes up an uneasy relationship with the professor and begins telling her the story of the novel he's trying to write, Rapp asks big questions about life, literature and the intersection between the two. How do we define honesty in fiction? Can we find salvation in art? How does one leave a mark on the world? 'The Sound Inside' offers few answers to these questions - and instead ends on note of jarring and spooky ambiguity. It's a brainy show that also pierces your heart, and it will leave you debating its meaning for days to come.",
