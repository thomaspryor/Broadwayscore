However, this appears to be a truncated excerpt focusing only on Parker's performance with no broader show assessment, warranting low confidence. | Gemini: The review highlights a strong performance by Mary-Louise Parker, suggesting a positive experience, and the original rating of 80 supports this classification. | Kimi: The critic's original rating of 80 and praise describing Parker's performance as having 'extraordinary subtlety and power' place this firmly in the Positive bucket, though the excerpt's brevity warrants low confidence.",
