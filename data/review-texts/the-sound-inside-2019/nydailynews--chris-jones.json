  "bwwExcerpt": "As played in this gorgeous piece of theater by Mary Louise Parker - and, heaven forfend, what a complete performance! - Bella is a fiftyish woman, a professor of creative writing who sacrificed her personal life to a climb up the academic tentpole to a position at Yale University. She's the maybe-unreliable narrator of her own story, self-critical and fiendishly intelligent, even if she never has been all that productive. Couple of minor things published. That's been it. Still, a life to fill the years.",
