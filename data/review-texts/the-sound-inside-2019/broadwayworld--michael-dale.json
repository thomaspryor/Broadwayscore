  "bwwExcerpt": "'Beyond her somewhat forgiving brown eyes,' the subject of Adam Rapp's quietly riveting character study, The Sound Inside says of herself, 'your narrator could be described as unremarkable. In that thorny subjective bureau of classification known as the Looks Department, if she's being brutally honest with herself, she'd say she's perhaps four or five degrees beyond mediocre, also known as 'sneakily attractive.' She is the equivalent of a collectible plate mounted to a wall.'",
