    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt describes celebrating 'in fragments' and suggests the show is more about performers than Sondheim himself, implying an incomplete or unfocused experience. However, limited text makes full assessment difficult. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a focus on the performers rather than Sondheim's work itself, indicating a mixed reception. The lack of a clear positive or negative tone and the single excerpt warning contribute to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a focus on performers rather than Sondheim, implying a mixed experience. The lack of a clear recommendation places it in the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates the show celebrates Sondheim's work but notes it feels fragmented and more focused on performers than the composer himself. The qualified praise warrants the lower end of the Positive range with low confidence due to the limited text available.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Stephen Sondheim’s Old Friends, hosted by megawatt stars Bernadette Peters and Lea Salonga, is as cozy as a longtime friend’s living room. Best of all, the honeyed orchestrations (originally by Sondheim’s longtime collaborator Jonathan Tunick) and crisp sound mixing in the Old Friends setlist help remind us why the best of composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim’s repertoire still attracts talented titans.",
