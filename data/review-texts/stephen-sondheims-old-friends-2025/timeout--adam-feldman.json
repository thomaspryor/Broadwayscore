    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as 'respectable and professional' which indicates a qualified positive recommendation, but the language is measured rather than enthusiastic. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'respectable and professional', which suggests a positive but not enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt is mildly positive, calling the show a \"respectable and professional introduction.\" Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as a barely positive review. | Kimi: The language is mildly positive but restrained ('respectable', 'professional' are faint praise), suggesting a qualified recommendation rather than enthusiasm. Confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's verdict.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Perhaps fittingly, the best reason to see Old Friends is the oldest thing in it: Bernadette Peters. At 77, she remains astonishingly youthful-looking; when she takes the stage to sing “I Know Things Now” as Little Red Riding Hood from Into the Woods, it really doesn’t seem like that big a stretch. She does a little cavorting—especially when clowning with Leavel and Riding in Gypsy’s “You Gotta Get a Gimmick”—but mainly she offers emotional ballads and ballast. Mos",
