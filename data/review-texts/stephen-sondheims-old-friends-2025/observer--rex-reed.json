    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The phrase 'evening to cherish' indicates strong positive sentiment, but this is only a single excerpt which may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a strong positive sentiment, describing the show as 'a musical evening to cherish,' indicating a solid recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is very positive, calling the show \"a musical evening to cherish.\" Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the strong positive sentiment warrants a score in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers unambiguous praise ('to cherish'), indicating a strong recommendation. Per guidelines for single curated excerpts with clearly positive language, this scores in the upper range of the Positive bucket (80-84).",
