    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Critic identifies fundamental production failure (lack of flow) with cast cohesion issues. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be one critical observation in an otherwise mixed or positive review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a lack of cohesion in the show due to the cast's differing styles and abilities, suggesting a negative assessment. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a lack of cohesion and flow due to mismatched cast members, suggesting a negative experience. Given that this is the only excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt cites a fundamental production flaw—the lack of cohesive flow due to mismatched cast styles—without offering any redeeming qualities or positive counterbalance. With only this single curated excerpt available, the sentiment appears clearly negative but confidence must remain low regarding the full review's verdict.",
