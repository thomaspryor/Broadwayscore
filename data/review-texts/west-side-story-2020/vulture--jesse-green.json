However, the lack of detailed praise or strong recommendation keeps it in the lower range of Positive. | Gemini: The review states that the production is both radically reimagined and surprisingly faithful, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers praise for the production's ability to radically reimagine the show while maintaining its emotional core, indicating a favorable view, though the brief text prevents a definitive assessment.",
