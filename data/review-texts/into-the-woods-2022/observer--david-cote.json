    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Calls it a 'gigantic gift' and predicts extension due to quality, with unqualified praise for all elements. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - the full review context is unavailable. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly positive language such as 'gigantic gift' and 'wishes do come true,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the performers, direction, design, and orchestra. The phrase \"gigantic gift of a revival\" indicates a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers unqualified praise for the casting, vocals, direction, and design, calling the production a 'gigantic gift' and declaring that 'wishes do come true'—language indicating strong endorsement. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
