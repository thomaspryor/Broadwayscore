Given excerpt limitations and cautious tone, scoring lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production for honoring the complexity of the musical and making it accessible, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the production for honoring the musical's complexity and making it accessible, indicating a positive assessment. Given the limited excerpt, confidence is medium. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the revival's artistic approach, commending its clarity and success in honoring Sondheim's work while reaching new audiences. Confidence is low due to availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
