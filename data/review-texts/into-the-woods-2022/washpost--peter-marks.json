  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"As the band strikes up and the singers open their throats in the hit Broadway revival of 'Into the Woods,' the audience realizes it is immersed in a blessed event. Saints (and sound designers) be praised: You can hear every word of the show.\"\n\nRead more",
  "bwwExcerpt": "The scintillating new revival of \"Into the Woods\" is rendered so harmoniously and meticulously, you'll swear you even hear the punctuation marks in the lyrics.
