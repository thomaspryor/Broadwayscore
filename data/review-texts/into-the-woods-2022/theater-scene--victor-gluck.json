  "showScoreExcerpt": "The current Broadway production staged by Lear deBessonet, artistic director of New York City Center Encores! and founder of The Public Theater’s Public Works program at the Delacorte, may be the most definitive of them all. While the Encores! production at City Center in May seemed a bit unfinished with its approximately one week of rehearsals, the Broadway transfer has smoothed out those issues and turned into a true ensemble. The new leads have fit themselves so well into the production that with three substitutions at the performance under review it was still a very polished performance. \n\nRead more",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and incomplete text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the current Broadway production as potentially 'the most definitive' and describes it as a 'polished performance', indicating a strong positive assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review states that the Broadway production is the \"most definitive\" and that it has smoothed out issues from a previous production. This indicates a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise calling the production 'most definitive' and 'polished,' with particular commendation for the ensemble work. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced due to limited context, but the sentiment is clearly positive.",
