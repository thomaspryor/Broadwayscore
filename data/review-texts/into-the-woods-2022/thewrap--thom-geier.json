  "fullText": "For many audiences, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine’s “Into the Woods” has become not only their entry point into the late Broadway composer‘s work but also to Broadway theater itself. Credit the universal subject matter — the fractured retelling of classic fairy tales — or Rob Marshall’s 2014 mixed bag of a film, or perhaps the countless school and community theater productions that have been mounted since the show debuted 35 years ago.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "All that talent is put to very good use in this pencil-sharp, fast-paced production - whose high points are many and often beanstalk-high. They help to disguise some of the shortcomings of the musical, from Sondheim's unfortunate and awkward attempts to re-create 1980s rap to a second act that forgets to leave breadcrumbs of relatability as it meanders into a thicket of philosophical abstractions. But even as the story turns darker, and Miller abandons her raps for some of Sondheim's best ballad",
