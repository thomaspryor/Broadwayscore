  "fullText": "For many audiences, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine’s “Into the Woods” has become not only their entry point into the late Broadway composer‘s work but also to Broadway theater itself. Credit the universal subject matter — the fractured retelling of classic fairy tales — or Rob Marshall’s 2014 mixed bag of a film, or perhaps the countless school and community theater productions that have been mounted since the show debuted 35 years ago.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "All that talent is put to very good use in this pencil-sharp, fast-paced production - whose high points are many and often beanstalk-high. They help to disguise some of the shortcomings of the musical, from Sondheim's unfortunate and awkward attempts to re-create 1980s rap to a second act that forgets to leave breadcrumbs of relatability as it meanders into a thicket of philosophical abstractions. But even as the story turns darker, and Miller abandons her raps for some of Sondheim's best ballad",

The positive assessment of the production itself outweighs the critiques of Sondheim's writing. | GPT-4o: The review praises the production's talent and high points, though it notes some shortcomings in the musical itself. The overall tone suggests a positive recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, highlighting the talent and pace of the production, while acknowledging some shortcomings in the musical itself. The overall tone suggests a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges shortcomings in Sondheim's original material (dated rap attempts, meandering second act), they praise this production as 'pencil-sharp' and 'fast-paced' with talent put to 'very good use,' clearly recommending the interpretation despite source material flaws.",
