    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic calls the show the 'pinnacle of art' and 'pinnacle of entertainment' - extremely high praise that clearly indicates a rave recommendation, despite being only a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt presents 'Into the Woods' as a pinnacle of both art and entertainment, suggesting a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt is strongly positive, suggesting a high recommendation. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise describing the show as the meeting of 'the pinnacle of art' and 'the pinnacle of entertainment,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, given only a single curated excerpt is available, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range per protocol rather than in the Rave bucket, and confidence is reduced. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
