    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive verdict with 'succeeds' and praise for finding 'new emotional depths,' but confidence is low due to single excerpt that could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive assessment of the revival, praising its ability to find new emotional depths and its polished execution. The tone suggests a strong recommendation, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, praising the revival's success and emotional depth. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strongly positive evaluative language ('succeeds,' 'gleams,' 'intimate and grand,' 'new emotional depths') indicating a clear recommendation. Per the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the 80-84 range, though confidence is low due to the limited available text.",
