  "bwwExcerpt": "There is an alternate way to do this show, which is to say in a less stylized and less comic way than deBessonet chooses. It can be played as if these characters were realistic humans and I'd like to see it done that way again someday on Broadway, for I have it seen work a different kind of spell that way. More than once. But this is a legitimate way to go and deBessonet and her supremely talented cast certainly deepen their vulnerability as the material darkens and the winds of agony and change",
