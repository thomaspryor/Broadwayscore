  "bwwExcerpt": "Originally staged at New York City Center Encores!, Lear deBessonet's magnificent, starry Into The Woods all but demanded a Broadway transfer, with sold-out crowds packing City Center and those left out wanting in.

Clearly, this Into The Woods preceded itself. To say it delivers on its promise is an understatement.",
