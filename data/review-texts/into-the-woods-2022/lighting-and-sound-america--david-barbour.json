  "showScoreExcerpt": "To understand why this Into the Woods is so enchanting, you must first understand what it is not: Do not expect elaborate designs, magical special effects, or fancy directorial concepts.

The superlatives 'funniest, most ravishingly sung, and heartbreaking' indicate high enthusiasm despite the simple staging. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as the best since the original, highlighting its humor, singing, and emotional impact. Despite the minimalist approach, it is described as enchanting and highly effective. | Gemini: Despite the limited text, the review is overwhelmingly positive, calling it the funniest, most ravishingly sung, and heartbreaking account since the original. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise, calling the production enchanting and comparing it favorably to the legendary original, despite its minimalist concert staging approach. With only one excerpt available, confidence is reduced.",
