    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it a 'masterpiece' that maintains full complexity and emotional impact. The 'lean, mean fairy-tale machine' phrasing suggests enthusiasm. Single excerpt limits confidence, but tone is clearly positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('lean, mean fairy-tale machine', 'masterpiece', 'without losing any complexity or emotional impact') indicating a highly favorable view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low as it may not represent the full review sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt is highly positive, calling the revival a 'masterpiece' and praising its emotional impact. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strong language suggests a score in the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the revival's focus and emotional impact, describing it as successfully preserving the source material's complexity. While clearly positive, the single-excerpt limitation warrants the upper range of the Positive bucket rather than a Rave classification.",
