It is a recommendation, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, thus a score in the positive range. | Kimi: The critic offers unambiguous praise with 'welcome return,' 'fresh,' and 'strong performances,' indicating a solid recommendation in the upper-positive range, though the extreme brevity limits confidence in the precise score.",
