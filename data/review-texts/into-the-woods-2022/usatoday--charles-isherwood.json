    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for the production and cast with no caveats mentioned. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation, praising the production's freshness and faithfulness, and the cast's ability to honor the material. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper range of Positive. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses strong positive sentiment, praising the production's freshness, faithfulness, and the cast's performance. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence due to the limited information. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong, unqualified praise for the production's balancing of innovation and fidelity to Sondheim's work, with particular commendation for the cast. As a single curated excerpt indicating clear positivity, it scores in the upper Positive range per instructions, though confidence remains low due to limited context.",
