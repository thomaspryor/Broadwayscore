    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as a 'tonic' that provides laughs even during dramatic moments, suggesting positive entertainment value. However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of quotes. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive experience with humor being a highlight, but the single quote limits the ability to gauge the overall tone. The score reflects a mildly positive impression. | Gemini: The phrase \"It's a tonic\" suggests a positive and refreshing experience, indicating a recommendation. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic praises the show's consistent ability to entertain and amuse, calling it 'a tonic'—a clear recommendation with warm, positive sentiment.",
