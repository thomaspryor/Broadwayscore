    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows pleasant surprise about the comedy and praises the director's work, but 'mild surprise' suggests restrained enthusiasm. With only one curated quote available, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a positive aspect of the production, noting the comedy in the book scenes and the director's effective handling of them. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses surprise at the comedy and notes that the director gets a lot out of the book scenes. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, the confidence is low, but the tone is positive. | Kimi: The critic expresses a 'mild surprise' at the show's comedy and praises the director's handling of material, but the temperate language and comparative praise ('funnier than I remembered') suggest appreciation rather than enthusiasm. The single-excerpt format warrants caution.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Let me just say it plainly: There's no weak link in the cast, all night. Bareilles has a light tinkly playfulness in the funny moments-I'm thinking of that line that Joanna Gleason reportedly gave Sondheim, \"This is ridiculous, what I am I doing here, I'm in the wrong story\"-that almost suggests that she's taking it easy up there, and then her big mezzo-soprano voice comes around the corner and knocks you back in your chair. Miller as the Witch occasionally seems a little distanced from the rest",
