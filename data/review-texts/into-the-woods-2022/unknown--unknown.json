    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises direction and choreography with rich imagery ('paints in rich and plentiful tones'), suggesting strong appreciation for the production's artistic execution. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's style and choreography, suggesting a positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the production's style and choreography, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited text available, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the direction and choreography, using phrases like 'rich and plentiful tones' and 'playful' to commend the production's aesthetic qualities, indicating a positive recommendation despite the minimalist approach.",
