    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, this shows unqualified praise with multiple superlatives ('brilliant staging', 'razzle-dazzle', 'equally hilarious and moving') indicating a strong rave recommendation. Medium confidence due to excerpt-only nature. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the production's intimacy, ingenuity, and staging, describing it as 'brilliant' and both 'hilarious and moving'. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly positive view. | Gemini: The excerpt is highly positive, praising the intimacy, ingenuity, cast, and staging. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
