    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt describes the revival as a 'celebration' and 'victory lap', which are positive terms suggesting recommendation. However, this is only one curated excerpt, so confidence is low and the score reflects the clearly positive but potentially incomplete assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive assessment, describing the revival as a 'celebration' and 'victory lap,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive sentiment, describing the revival as a \"celebration\" and a \"victory lap.\" Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive with medium confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise, describing the production as a 'celebration' and 'victory lap' for a canonical work, indicating a clear recommendation despite the valedictory tone.",
