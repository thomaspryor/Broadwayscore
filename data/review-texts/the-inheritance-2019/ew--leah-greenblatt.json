  "bwwExcerpt": "There's a sense that a story of this scope could easily have been made into some kind of limited-series television event, with its long-thread plot lines and dialogue that often swerves between wry Bravo bitchery (tossed-off references to Broad City and Truvada) and HBO issue-drama prestige (all those heavy shades of the original Gay Fantasia). In the end, The Inheritance is a play whose cup runneth over in so many often glorious ways that almost every sip yields something - even if it might have been served just as well (or that much better) in a shorter, stronger pour.",
