  "bwwExcerpt": "'The Inheritance' invites comparison to Tony Kushner's 'Angels in America,' although it does not similarly concern itself with intersectional political ideologies and crises of religious faith. 'The Inheritance' remains a fundamentally intermural look at the gay community - the only female character in the show, played by Lois Smith, is a semi-mystical figure defined entirely in terms of her surrogate sons - and its existential ambitions are less expansive. Still, it reveals a deep advocacy for community responsibility and shares a world view with one of Kushner's most central notions, that the smallest indivisible human unit is two.",
