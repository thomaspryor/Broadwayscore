  "bwwExcerpt": "Ambition and achievement are not entirely commensurate in 'The Inheritance.' Its breadth doesn't always translate into depth. As fine as the acting is throughout - and quietly brilliant when the extraordinary veteran Lois Smith takes the stage, toward the very end, as the show's sole female character - none of the characters here have the textured completeness of those created by Forster and Kushner. Ultimately, the play twists itself into ungainly pretzels as it tries to join all the thematic dots on its immense canvas. Yet even by the end of the overwrought second half of 'The Inheritance,' you're likely to feel the abiding, welcome buzz of energy that comes from an unflagging will to question, to create, to contextualize, to - oh, why not? - only connect.",
