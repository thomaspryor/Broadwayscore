    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed signals: 'vividly painted' suggests praise, but 'breadth doesn't always equal depth' implies structural criticism. With only a headline excerpt available, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, noting the play's ambition and vivid portrayal but also implying a lack of depth. The single excerpt warning and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the play has some positive qualities ('vividly painted portrait') but lacks depth, indicating a mixed reaction. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise ('vividly painted') undercut by a fundamental criticism about the show's depth relative to its length ('Breadth doesn't always equal depth'). As a single curated excerpt with no additional context, confidence must be low.",
