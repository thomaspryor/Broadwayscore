  "bwwExcerpt": "It is tempting to compare 'The Inheritance' with Tony Kushner's masterwork 'Angels in America,' which is also a two-part, six-act, roughly seven-hour drama centered on AIDS, historical connections, and politics. However, 'The Inheritance' very much stands on its own as a separate work with a very different sensibility, and I strongly suspect that it will soon join 'Angels in America' in the pantheon of great gay dramas.",
