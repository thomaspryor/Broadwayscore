  "bwwExcerpt": "The Inheritance is big, it aims to be everything and say everything. For all its faults it gives its all to tell its stories, both big and small. It is about history and also love, but not of the romantic kind. In keeping with an earlier reference to the work and beliefs of the poet and activist Edward Carpenter, the love at the end of the play-the love The Inheritance wants its characters and us to aspire to-is fraternal and honoring.",
