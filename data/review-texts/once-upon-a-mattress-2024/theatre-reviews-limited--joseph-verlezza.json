However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt is positive, referencing the Golden Age of musical theatre. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as a low positive with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers favorable comparison to Broadway's Golden Age, implying musical quality, but represents a single curated quote without broader context or enthusiasm.",
