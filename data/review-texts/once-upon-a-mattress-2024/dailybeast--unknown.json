    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt describes show as 'mostly alright' with occasional funny moments - classic mixed review language suggesting neither strong recommendation nor discouragement. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review with some positive highlights due to specific performances. The use of 'mostly alright' indicates an overall lukewarm reception, with some moments of humor elevating it. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic response, suggesting it's 'mostly alright' and 'very funny' at times. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low, but the overall sentiment leans towards a mild recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise, describing the show as 'mostly alright' with moments that are 'very funny' specifically thanks to Foster and the cast, indicating a mild recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
