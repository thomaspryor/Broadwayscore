    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the chemistry between performers, but the single quote and lack of full context limit the confidence in the overall assessment. | Gemini: The single excerpt is positive, but without more context, it's hard to give a stronger score. I'm placing it at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clearly positive evaluation of the performers' chemistry using evocative, appreciative language ('sparkle'), placing it in the upper range of Positive, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence.",
