    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the lead performer as potentially 'our greatest stage comedienne' suggests strong positive assessment, but extremely limited text makes full verdict uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Foster's performance, indicating a positive view of her role in the show. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment of the review is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performer highly, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring it as positive with a high score in that range. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers superlative praise for the lead performer's physical comedy skills, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, confidence is low as this curated excerpt may not represent the full review's verdict on the production as a whole.",
