Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt states that the show is \"pure theatrical fun,\" which is a strong positive sentiment. Given that this is the only excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the production as 'pure theatrical fun,' indicating clear enthusiasm and a strong recommendation, though the single curated excerpt warrants low confidence.",
