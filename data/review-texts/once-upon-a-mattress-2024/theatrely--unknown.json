Yet at its most joyful highpoints, even this high-class gathering of musical theater's finest feels closer to a bunch of big kids playing dress-up. To be clear - that's a compliment. Mattress is an exceedingly silly show.",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the cast and describes the show as 'exceedingly silly' in a complimentary way, suggesting a positive tone. However, the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review highlights the talented cast and describes the show as \"exceedingly silly,\" which is framed as a compliment. Given the single excerpt, a positive score with medium confidence is appropriate. | Kimi: The critic praises the 'incredible talents' and explicitly frames the show's playful silliness as a compliment, indicating an enjoyable if lightweight production.",
