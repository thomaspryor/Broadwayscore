Yet at its most joyful highpoints, even this high-class gathering of musical theater's finest feels closer to a bunch of big kids playing dress-up. To be clear - that's a compliment. Mattress is an exceedingly silly show.",

However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may be missing. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast and describes the show as 'exceedingly silly' in a complimentary way, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review highlights the talented cast and describes the show as \"exceedingly silly,\" which is presented as a compliment. Given the single excerpt, a positive score is appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the 'incredible talents' and describes the show's silly nature as a joyful 'compliment,' indicating a strong recommendation despite limited text availability.",
