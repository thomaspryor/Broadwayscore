  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "But this is Foster's show, and even more amazing than her vocal pipes, physical dexterity, and attention to emotional detail is the way all of it feels spontaneous, as if she's coming up with these bits off the cuff. If Once Upon a Mattress reminds us of the lasting appeal of fairy tales, Foster reminds us of the thrilling spectacle of seeing performers work their magic live.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with enthusiastic praise for lead performance ('amazing', 'thrilling spectacle'). However, confidence is low due to limited text - this may be cherry-picked praise from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for Sutton Foster's performance, emphasizing her spontaneity and emotional detail. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall review sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt heavily praises Sutton Foster's performance and the overall spectacle, suggesting a positive experience. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers enthusiastic praise for Sutton Foster's 'amazing' performance and the show's 'lasting appeal,' using words like 'thrilling' and 'magic' that indicate a strong recommendation.",
