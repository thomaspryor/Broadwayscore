    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows positive assessment of lead performance with specific praise for understanding the role's requirements. However, limited to one quote makes overall verdict unclear, warranting lower end of Positive bucket and low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation of the performance, noting the actress's effective mimicry and comedic timing. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of a full review, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on a single performer and praises her understanding of the role, suggesting a positive but limited assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers faint praise ('She's good') for the lead's technical competence in imitating a previous performer but lacks enthusiasm or clear recommendation. Per instructions for single excerpts with mild positivity, scoring at the lower end of the Positive range.",
