However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single quote available is highly positive, calling the production a 'perfect summertime treat'. Given the limited information, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise describing the show as a 'perfect summertime treat,' placing it in the upper Positive range (80-84), though the single curated quote limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
