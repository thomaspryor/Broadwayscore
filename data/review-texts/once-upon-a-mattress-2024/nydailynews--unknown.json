    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt suggests a polarizing performance where enjoyment depends entirely on audience connection to the star. The 'either/or' framing indicates no universal recommendation - it's for fans only, which is classic Mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed experience, highlighting enjoyment for some but not all. The lack of full context and single quote warning necessitate a cautious, low-confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt implies that if you enjoy Sutton Foster's performance, you'll enjoy the show. However, it also suggests that if you don't, you won't. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a conditional but ultimately positive recommendation, encouraging audiences to embrace Sutton Foster's performance ('jump on the Good Ship Sutton') while acknowledging the show may not work for those who don't connect with her star power. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
