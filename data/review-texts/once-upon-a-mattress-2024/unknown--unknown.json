    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clear praise calling Foster 'the princess of Broadway' and describing the material as 'fit for' her, suggesting positive assessment. However, extremely limited text available makes confidence low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a strong positive sentiment by associating the show with Sutton Foster, a highly regarded Broadway star. The tone implies a high level of praise, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The single quote available is highly positive, calling the show a tale fit for a Broadway star. Given the limited information, I am scoring it as positive with a high score in that range. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers clear praise positioning the show as worthy of its leading performer, indicating a solid recommendation, though limited context requires caution.",
