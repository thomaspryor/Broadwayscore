  "bwwExcerpt": "The production, directed in haste by Lear deBessonet, is not without its flaws. Personally, I’m tired of lazily staged, barebones Encores! concerts being lugged to Broadway like a surprisingly nice couch somebody found on the curb. Still, Foster is such a smash that you forgive most of the peripheral problems.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Foster as a rare star, indicating a positive view of her performance. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, and the lack of broader context limits confidence in a stronger score. | Gemini: The single excerpt praises the star, indicating a positive review. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive sentiment warrants a score in the upper end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performer using superlative language ('exceedingly rare'), indicating a positive assessment. However, with only one curated quote available, confidence remains low regarding the overall show verdict.",
