However, with only one negative quote available, the full review verdict is unclear - this could be from a mixed or negative review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a negative view, criticizing the humor as superficial. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a lack of depth and superficial humor, suggesting a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a clear criticism of the show's humor as shallow and lacking chemistry, indicating a negative assessment. However, with only one curated excerpt available, the overall verdict could be more mixed than this isolated quote suggests.",
