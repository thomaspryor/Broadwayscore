    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with positive language ('winner', 'in the zone') but notes minor flaws ('occasionally overdoing it'). Low confidence due to limited text from curated excerpt that may not represent full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Foster's performance as a 'winner' but notes occasional overacting. The single excerpt and text quality warning suggest a cautious, low-confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is generally positive about the lead performance, but the 'occasionally overdoing it' suggests reservations. Given the limited text, a score in the lower-middle of the positive range seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the lead performance ('winner', 'mostly in the zone') with only a mild caveat ('occasionally overdoing it'), indicating a solid recommendation despite the limited context.",
