    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the lead performer as 'a winner' with minor criticism about 'occasionally overdoing it.' Given excerpt limitations and mild qualification, scored at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Foster as a 'winner' but notes occasional overacting. The single excerpt and text warning suggest a cautious approach, leading to a low-confidence, barely positive score. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the lead performance but notes some overacting, suggesting a positive but not rave review. Confidence is low due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the lead performance using the word 'winner' and noting they are 'mostly in the zone,' though with minor reservations about occasionally overdoing it. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
