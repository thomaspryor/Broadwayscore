  "bwwExcerpt": "“Once Upon A Mattress” opened tonight for its third turn on Broadway, with Sutton Foster’s performance as Princess Winnifred the Woebegone the same goofy and intense workout that proved a draw earlier this year in a two-week run of the 1959 musical comedy as part of the Encores! concert series at New York City Center. The production, which has replaced four of the eight principal cast members, is otherwise largely unchanged now that it has transferred to the Hudson Theater. It is still tuneful, fun, well-sung. But it plays differently for me now. On Broadway, it feels like high school.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows praise for musical elements but clear disappointment with Broadway production quality. The 'but' structure and 'high school' comparison suggests significant reservations that undermine the positive elements. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's music and performances but criticizes its overall feel on Broadway, suggesting a mixed impression. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show is \"still tuneful, fun, well-sung\" but ultimately feels underwhelming on Broadway. This suggests a mixed reaction, with some positive aspects but overall falling short of expectations. | Kimi: The excerpt presents conflicting signals: the critic acknowledges positive qualities (tuneful, fun, well-sung) but fundamentally criticizes the production as feeling amateurish or under-scaled for a Broadway house.",
