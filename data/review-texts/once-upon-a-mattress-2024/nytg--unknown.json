However, the single excerpt and lack of additional context necessitate a cautious, low-confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt compares Sutton Foster's performance favorably to Carol Burnett's, suggesting a positive assessment. However, without more context, the confidence is low. | Kimi: Comparing Sutton Foster favorably to Carol Burnett's legendary original performance indicates a standout, show-carrying turn, though the single excerpt format limits certainty about the overall production assessment.",
