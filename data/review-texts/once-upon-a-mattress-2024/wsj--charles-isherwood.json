    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Despite being only an excerpt, 'genuine perfection' is the strongest possible praise a critic can give - this language clearly indicates a rave review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a highly positive evaluation, describing the performance as 'genuine perfection'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low as it may not represent the full review. | Gemini: The quote is extremely positive, using the word \"perfection\". Given that this is the only excerpt available, I am scoring it as a strong positive, but with low confidence due to the limited information. | Kimi: The excerpt uses the ultimate superlative 'genuine perfection' to describe the show, indicating the highest possible recommendation. While the single-excerpt format necessitates low confidence, the language is unambiguously ecstatic and places the review firmly in the Rave category.",
