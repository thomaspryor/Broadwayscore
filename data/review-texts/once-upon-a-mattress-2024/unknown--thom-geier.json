    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive aspect of the show, but the context is limited and does not provide a clear overall recommendation. The single excerpt warning advises caution, indicating potential cherry-picking, leading to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The single excerpt is positive, but without more context, it's hard to give a stronger recommendation. I'm scoring it at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers clear, vivid praise for lead performances' chemistry ('sparkle'). Per excerpt instructions, clearly positive isolated quotes warrant upper Positive bucket scores (80-84).",
