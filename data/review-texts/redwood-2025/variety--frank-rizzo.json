  "fullText": "There’s a powerful appeal to the idea of leaving behind the turbulence of the personal — or for that matter, the political — and escaping to a place of beauty, safety and solace.\n\nA separate peace within a natural sanctuary is just what the troubled character of Jesse, played with captivating ease and intensity by Idina Menzel, finds in the new musical \"Redwood,\" now on Broadway following its run last spring at La Jolla Playhouse. Others, too, might welcome that sense of comfort in a production of grandeur and heart, telling a story of grief, healing and wonder.",
