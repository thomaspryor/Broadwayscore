  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessIdina Menzel in “Redwood.” (Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman)Review by  Naveen KumarNEW YORK — The impulse to escape one’s problems by hiding in a tree is deeply relatable. When a troubled but determined New Yorker, played by Idina Menzel, insists on ascending into the California canopy, you can feel the audience at “Redwood” lining up to take a number. Can we come too, please?\n\nIt’s grief that chases Jesse into the wilderness, and it’s grief that she’ll have to face there, with some assistance from ancient flora and a pair of botanists conveniently placed in her path. The new musical, co-conceived by Menzel and director Tina Landau, aims to wed the great American tradition pioneered by Henry David Thoreau — seeking wisdom in nature — with the intermittently great American tradition of belting one’s face off. It’s an uneasy marriage.\n\nSo is Jesse’s. The show opens on her driving across the country, leaving her wife (De’Adre Aziza) and their shared trauma behind. City lights streak across towering video screens encircling the stage, and flashbacks alert us to the presence of a son (Zachary Noah Piser) whom Jesse can’t bear to face.\n\nHer suffering is obvious from the jump. If you’ve come to hear Menzel wail at her signature registers, you won’t have to wait long. And you’ll get your money’s worth.\n\n“Redwood” is a vehicle assembled around Menzel — composer Kate Diaz custom-fit the songs — with traces of her star-making roles all in evidence. Jesse is a queer art gallerist, like a settled-down version of Maureen, the freewheeling performance artist from “Rent.” Like Elsa from “Frozen,” Jesse flees into the wild and discovers how to harness her strength. And like the “Wicked” Elphaba, she reaches a cacophonous epiphany while suspended in midair.\n\nBut Jesse is less a distinctive character than a cipher for feelings of loss, if touchingly so. (The story is based on Landau’s own experience with grieving.) When Jesse stumbles upon the two forest scientists (Michael Park and Khaila Wilcoxon), the shtick is that she’s persistently annoying. Park plays an absent father itching to exercise a helping hand, while Wilcoxon’s climate-warrior-type would prefer to follow the rules: no clearly heartbroken amateurs climbing to dangerous heights.\n\nFor much of the show, the most immediate love story is not among Jesse and her wife and son, whom she encounters over long-distance phone calls or in her mind. It’s between woman and tree. Diaz’s score, with lyrics co-written by Landau, is propulsive and sincere but short on variation and originality. As Jesse’s affection grows, she becomes a messenger for one anthem after another of what can best be described as eco-rock — like its cousin emo but rooted in deep convictions for the planet. (The arborists join in, of course: “I’m a believer that big trees can heal ya!” goes one spirited refrain.) Only when the details of Jesse’s backstory finally become clear do the songs feel grounded in legible relationships rather than simply aimed at blowing back audience hair. The last few are knockouts.\n\nGetting there feels slow and herky-jerky, like repeated climbs up the enormous tree trunk center stage (in a set by Jason Ardizzone-West). The show’s modest momentum comes from Jesse overstepping her bounds and dropping clues about why she’s there. Otherwise it floats along a steady stream of exposition — including from supporting characters, who at least aren’t trampled underfoot — and an impressive proliferation of trees-are-just-like-us metaphors: the sturdiness at their core, the strength they glean from each other and so on.\n\nAll of that rings true enough, but with a woo-woo tenor that would benefit from an ounce of cynicism that Long Island native Jesse somehow doesn’t have. (The show was originally developed and produced in Southern California, by the La Jolla Playhouse.) Menzel plays Jesse like a literal babe in the woods, with a measure of naivete that feels childlike — a nod to how sadness forces us to embrace vulnerability.\n\nBut that earnestness is tough to sustain. Jesse’s principle conflict remains internal, and emoting into the branches can carry us only so far. Performances from the cast thrive when they’re in conversation, much as we’re told the ecosystem does. Piser is fantastic as Jesse’s loose-limbed son, and Aziza and Wilcoxon each nail rousing solo numbers imbued with more groove and soul than the rest of the score.\n\nConsidering its narrative devotion to tangible elements, the massive reliance of Landau’s production on visual technology betrays a lack of imagination (video design is by Hana S. Kim). The graphics sweeping across curved monitors — lush branches, starry vistas — are like an immersive simulation of Mac wallpaper: dazzling but synthetic and flat. How would the show fare unplugged, in the spirit of Jesse chucking her phone in the bushes?\n\nIt is at least a testament to the synergy of “Redwood” that its hypermodern staging and the moral of the story make you want to go outside and touch grass.\n\nRedwood, ongoing at the Nederlander Theatre in New York. redwoodmusical.com.",
