    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt praises Menzel's vocals but criticizes the score as 'leaden' and 'burden.' This suggests the show has problems that even strong performances can't overcome. Single excerpt warning requires caution - this could be from a larger negative assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights Menzel's strong performance but criticizes the score as 'leaden', suggesting a mixed review. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show relies heavily on Menzel's vocals to overcome a poor score, suggesting a negative overall assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for Menzel's performance ('soaring vocals') but heavily criticizes the score ('leaden,' 'burden'), suggesting the production depends on its star to compensate for fundamental weaknesses. As a single curated excerpt, the full verdict is unclear.",
