However, with only one curated quote available, scoring conservatively within negative range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests impressive design elements but implies that the story is lacking or underwhelming. This indicates a mixed review, with strong production values but a weak narrative. | Gemini: The quote indicates that the design overshadows the story, suggesting a negative assessment of the show's overall impact. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring conservatively within the negative bucket.",
