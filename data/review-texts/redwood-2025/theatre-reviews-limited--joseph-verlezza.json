    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt suggests the show touches on important themes but fails to develop them adequately, indicating mixed reception with criticism of shallow treatment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates that the show touches on significant themes but fails to explore them deeply, suggesting a lack of depth. With only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The single excerpt indicates a lack of depth in exploring key themes, suggesting a negative assessment of the show's writing or execution. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers specific criticism regarding the show's lack of thematic depth while acknowledging the presence of those elements, suggesting an uneven or underdeveloped production rather than a complete failure.",
