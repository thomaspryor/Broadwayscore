  "fullText": "Idina Menzel in 'Redwood' (Photo: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman for Murphy Made) Ten years after her star turn in the interesting but cluttered Sliding Doors-ish musical If/Then, Idina Menzel returns to Broadway in another original show, Redwood, this one which she co-conceived with director, book writer, and co-lyricist Tina Landau. Landau’s production is breathtakingly beautiful, with Hana S Kim’s striking video designs projected onto screens that circle the steeply raked stage area and extend out to the side boxes of the auditorium itself – creating a kind of widescreen Cinerama effect that’s not only immersive but vertigo-inducing as we join the characters in experiencing the thrill of rising above the canopy of a redwood forest or the sway of branches in a storm. The high-tech staging thrills, as when Menzel spins upside down from her rope while belting a ballad. But the thin, repetitive story and composer/co-lyricist Kate Diaz’s score keep bringing the show back down to earth. The songs seem tailor-made for Menzel’s magnificent voice, but there’s an exhausting sameyness to these melisma-heavy pop ballads in which virtually every phrase goes up a third during the final word, like a bird that can’t quite decide where it should land. Menzel is a natural stage star, and there are moments when Redwood truly soars, but you can only defy the gravity of real life for so long.
