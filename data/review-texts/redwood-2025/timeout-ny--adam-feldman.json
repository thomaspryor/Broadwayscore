  "fullText": "As in 2018’s unfortunate King Kong, the colossal title character of Redwood (which Jesse christens Stella) is the best thing about this musical, even though—or maybe because—it doesn’t sing. But arboreal splendor can’t compensate for the blandness that surrounds it. The show is all bark and no bite.",
