  "fullText": "Redwood, though, ultimately is just a shade too thin in its storytelling imagination, hitting the familiar dramatic beats we’ve come to expect through countless grief and recovery stories. Still, it’s not hard to focus your attention on the successful aspects — Menzel, that set, the sky dancing, and across-the-board fine performances from the rest of the cast.",
