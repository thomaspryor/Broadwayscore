  "dtliExcerpt": "The stagecraft, performances, and the visuals will last and no doubt offer a roadmap for future projection-heavy productions. It's a dazzling vehicle for Menzel, a staunch reminder of how powerful her voice is (even when she's dangling from a harness), as well as a memorable feature for the rest of its five-person cast, especially since they manage to make an impression with a powerhouse like Menzel standing inches away.",
