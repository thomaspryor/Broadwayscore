    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt describes attractive visuals but uses 'wallpaper' metaphorically, suggesting style over substance. Without full context, this could go either direction - scoring conservatively in middle of Mixed range due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a focus on visual appeal but lacks substantive praise or criticism of the overall production. Given the lack of context and the warning about potential cherry-picking, a middle-of-the-road score within the Mixed bucket is appropriate. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a focus on visual appeal, but lacks a clear recommendation or overall assessment of the show's quality. It's neither strongly positive nor negative.",
