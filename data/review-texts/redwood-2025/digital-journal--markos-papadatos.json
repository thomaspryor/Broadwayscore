  "fullText": "Tony winner Idina Menzel (“Wicked”) stars in the new Broadway musical, which she co-conceived with director, book writer, and co-lyricist Tina Landau. Tony winner Idina Menzel (“Wicked”) stars in the new Broadway musical, which she co-conceived with director, book writer, and co-lyricist Tina Landau. This marks Menzel’s long-awaited return to the Broadway stage. Menzel stars as Jesse, a woman who finds herself at a crossroads in a Northern California redwood forest after a life-altering event. Following this traumatic event in her family life, Jesse finds healing and catharsis while climbing a redwood tree. Kate Diaz wrote the music and co-wrote the lyrics. The show is being performed at the Nederlander Theatre in New York City. Aside from Menzel, the cast also includes features De’Adre Aziza as Mel, Emmy winner Michael Park (“As the World Turns”) as Finn, Zachary Noah Piser as Spencer, and Khaila Wilcoxon as Becca. The production also has scenic design by Jason Ardizzone-West, video design by Hana S. Kim, costume design by Toni-Leslie James, lighting design by Scott Zielinski, sound design by Jonathan Deans, vertical movement and choreography by Melecio Estrella with orchestrations and arrangements by Kate Diaz. Tom Kitt serves as music supervisor with Julie McBride as music director. The set was exquisite, and the lights were visually striking. Idina Menzel is sublime as Jesse, and it is evident that she is still “Wickedly talented” and a force of nature; she builds her character from within, drenches the audience in a wide spectrum of complicated emotions, and knocks it out of the ballpark. De’Adre Aziza is the voice of reason as Mel, Jesse’s wife. Zachary Noah Piser is a revelation as Spencer, and he pulls off a true breakout performance that will really tug at the heartstrings. Khaila Wilcoxon also showcases her powerhouse vocals, as well as some attitude and sass as Becca. She is truly a ball of energy and fire. Michael Park is impressive as Finn, and he proves to be an exceptional climber as well. Park works well opposite both Menzel and Wilcoxon. Overall, “Redwood” is an innovative, captivating, and immersive musical experience. Strong performances led by Idina Menzel give this musical its beating heart. This show will certainly spark conversations among viewers, and it will move them on an emotional and spiritual level. Menzel’s role itself is complex as well as psychologically, physically (as she sings from the treetops and dangles from a rope), and emotionally taxing, but she nails it, and she has the audience with her every step of the way. Everybody in this cast is diverse, gifted, and brings something unique to the show. It ought to be enjoyed for its rawness, beauty, honesty, and authenticity. “Redwood” deserves to gain accolades and recognition at the forthcoming 2025 Tony Awards; it should be up for everything (in every category it is eligible for), and it should be winning everything. “Redwood” garners 4.5 out of 5 stars. Well done. For more information on “Redwood,” check out its official homepage. Markos Papadatos is Digital Journal's Editor-at-Large for Music News.
