  "bwwExcerpt": "The new Broadway musical 'Matilda,' based on Roald Dahl's 1988 children's fantasy novel, was originally conceived by the Royal Shakespeare Company as family-friendly Christmastime entertainment, not unlike the cheesy and overly sentimental shows that flood New York each holiday season. But it turned out to be an incredibly intelligent, heartfelt and entertaining work that went on to achieve critical and popular success in London and now arrives on Broadway like a white knight sent to rescue a disappointing season for new musicals...Singer-songwriter Tim Minchin's unique and unpredictable score is as character-sensitive and penetrating as it is melodic and memorable.",
  "bwwScore": 9
