  "bwwExcerpt": "A smart, supple score by Tim Minchin swiftly propels the rather sinister tale with a variety of tunes and spirited rhythms...A jubilant 'When I Grow Up' playground number during which the kids swing out over the footlights, and Matilda's lovely, reflective 'Quiet' solo sweeten a score that more often than not sounds spooky...Even more troubling, and faithful as the musical's makers may be to the contents and tone of Dahl's original, the fanciful show possesses an oddly nasty flavor that other people might savor in recollection of their miserable childhoods...Regardless of my taste for the material, director Matthew Warchus' production of the musical certainly is impressive.",
