  "bwwExcerpt": "The wonder begins with the witty and hyper-literate score by Australian songwriter Tim Minchin, who has crafted several potential earworms...A word about Matilda: Milly Shapiro, a bright-eyed girl who conveys a fine sense of spunk and righteous indignation, played the title role admirably at the performance I attended. But I have no idea why Shapiro alternates with three other girls - Sophia Gennusa, Oona, Laurence, and Bailey Ryon - since the part seems significantly less demanding than the dance-heavy lead in Billy Elliot...Even gold-star students fall short of perfection, and the same is true of Matilda...On the other hand, even when you fail to pick up a well-turned phrase or eye-rolling pun, you will probably find yourself responding like a just-tucked-in child at bedtime.",
