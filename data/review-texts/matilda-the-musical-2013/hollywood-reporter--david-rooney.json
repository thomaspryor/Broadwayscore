  "bwwExcerpt": "Any show that arrives from London fueled by as much critical and commercial fanfare asMatilda can hardly be called a surprise. Yet the capacity for constant surprise, and an almost overwhelming sense of wonder at the magic of storytelling - and by extension, stagecraft - is central to the experience of this dazzlingly inventive musical. Capturing the unique flavor of Roald Dahl's classic 1988 children's novel, this funhouse fairy tale is by turns riotous and poignant, grotesque and menacing, its campy comic exaggeration equaled only by its transporting emotional power. I can't wait to see it again.",
