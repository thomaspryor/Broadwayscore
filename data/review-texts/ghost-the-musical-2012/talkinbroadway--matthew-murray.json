It points out a specific area where the show succeeds, but also implies that it doesn't always meet its potential. | Kimi: The review implies the show only works under specific conditions (when focusing on music and relationships), suggesting it fails or falters at other times, indicating a mixed, uneven experience rather than a clear recommendation.",
