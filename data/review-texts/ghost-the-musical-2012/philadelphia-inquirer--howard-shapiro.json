  "bwwExcerpt": "Luckily, the show recovers, delivered by four talented leads who include Philadelphian Da’Vine Joy Randolph in the part of the con-artist spiritualist. Randolph, a Temple University grad who received her bachelor’s degree in classical vocal performance and went on to a drama master’s from Yale, is giving the juicy role a great ride, belting it out when called for, playing it for all the extremes it’s worth and generally sizzling.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows recovery from earlier problems and praise for performances, particularly Randolph. However, limited text and mention of needing to 'recover' suggests qualified positivity rather than strong endorsement. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performance of Da’Vine Joy Randolph, highlighting her strong and dynamic portrayal. However, without more context or a full verdict, the overall sentiment is mildly positive, leading to a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on praising Da'Vine Joy Randolph's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. However, due to the limited text, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation strength, so confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic praises the lead performances as 'sizzling' and notes the show 'recovers' thanks to the talented cast, indicating a positive but qualified recommendation.",
