  "bwwExcerpt": "Full of moving scenery, lights, projections, film and magical illusions, but devoid of actual magic, the Broadway production of 'Ghost' is a lumbering megatuner with little to offer beyond a limitless array of dazzling effects. But while it's tempting to suggest the show hasn't a ghost of a chance, that assessment might not be warranted: The still-running London production successfully parried a dire critical reception last July, and audience response to the visuals and that familiar title might well attract enough Rialto customers to make a go of it.",
