  "bwwExcerpt": "Full confession: The 1990 movie Ghost is on my top 10 list of that decade’s more shameless pleasures. Demi Moore with the Pierrot haircut and artfully applied teardrops; poor Patrick Swayze with his single expression of intense concentration; Whoopi Goldberg at her ghetto-fabulous funniest. What’s not to love? Turns out plenty in this leaden stage musicalization of the supernatural romantic thriller, a flavorless hash that is unrelentingly loud, vulgar and stunningly tone-deaf to the ways in which the world has changed since that era of sweet young yuppie innocence.",

This indicates a mixed or neutral stance. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges isolated strengths (touching moments, ingenious staging) but delivers a clear negative verdict that the show fails to become 'compelling theater,' constituting a recommendation against seeing it.",
