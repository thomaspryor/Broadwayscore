  "bwwExcerpt": "Though a technical glitch caused an unplanned 25-minute break at the performance I attended, I’m not going to get caught up in the details. The incident only illustrates exactly what is wrong with “Ghost”: It’s trying to be something it’s not. Warchus has turned a touching silver-screen love story into an overly flashy showbiz musical that betrays the intimacy of its source.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative assessment calling the musical 'overly flashy' and saying it 'betrays' the source material. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is medium as the full review verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the adaptation for losing the intimacy of the original story, describing it as 'overly flashy.' The single excerpt suggests a negative view, but without the full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses disappointment with the production, stating that it betrays the intimacy of the source material and is overly flashy. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt constitutes a clear rejection of the production's artistic choices, arguing that the director has fundamentally misunderstood the material by sacrificing intimacy for flash. While not vitriolic, the verdict 'betrays' indicates a failed adaptation that does not warrant a recommendation.",
