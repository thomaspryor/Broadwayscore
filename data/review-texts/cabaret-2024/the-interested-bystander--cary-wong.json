    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with moderate positive language ('intriguing and immersive') but qualified with 'quite' suggests restrained enthusiasm. Low confidence due to extremely limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive impression with terms like 'intriguing' and 'immersive,' but the lack of full context and single excerpt warning necessitate a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt is positive, but very brief. Given the warning about curated excerpts, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence and a score on the lower end of the range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers mild but clear praise with 'intriguing' and 'immersive,' though the qualifier 'quite' and the limitation of a single truncated excerpt suggest restrained enthusiasm rather than unqualified acclaim.",
