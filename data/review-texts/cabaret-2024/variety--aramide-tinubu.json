However, this is only one curated excerpt, so confidence is low as the overall review verdict is unknown. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of Redmayne and Rankin with strong language, indicating a positive view of the show. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances of the leads, suggesting a positive experience, but without more context, it's difficult to gauge the overall recommendation strength. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for both lead performances using superlatives like 'magnetic force of nature,' indicating a clear recommendation, though the limited context prevents a higher confidence rating.",
