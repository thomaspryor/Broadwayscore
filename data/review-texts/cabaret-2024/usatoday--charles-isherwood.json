    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the production positively as 'transformative' and 'immersive,' but with only one curated quote available, this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. Scored at lower end of Positive bucket due to excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as an 'immersive experience,' suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the limited context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes an immersive experience, which is positive, but without more text, it's hard to gauge the overall recommendation strength. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as a barely positive review. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the production's immersive staging and atmospheric transformation, warranting a Positive classification at the upper end of the range given the strongly favorable language, though confidence is low due to limited text availability.",
