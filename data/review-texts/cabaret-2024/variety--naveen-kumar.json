  "fullText": "When Eddie Redmayne's slithering Emcee assures the audience at \"Cabaret\" that \"here, life is beautiful,\" he's telling a half-truth. The August Wilson Theater, done up like the Kit Kat Club for a bracing, high-style, Broadway revival that opened there Sunday, has indeed been transformed into a house of pleasure. Entering through an alley and into fancified, jam-packed lobby bars feels like discovering a speakeasy inside a nightclub.\n\nThe production is a hot-ticket escape from a city where police are breaking up student protests and a former head of state is on trial for porn-star bribery. Inside the theater, the denizens of Weimar Germany writhing around this storied den are likewise at least temporarily inured from the political perils pressing on its doors. But in director Rebecca Frecknall's ravishing and mercilessly introspective production of the 1966 musical by Joe Masteroff (book), John Kander (music) and Fred Ebb (lyrics), no one is safe from the turmoil rattling their psyches.",
  "bwwExcerpt": "All that stripped-down humanity onstage — from the entrails of broken lovers to the dancers’ carnal gyrations (choreography is by Julia Cheng) — make Redmayne’s Emcee a jarring exception. An otherworldly salamander of a narrator, he hunches over, Gollum-like, gnawing on every syllable as if it were his last meal. It’s a fiercely committed performance, but a mannered one, too. For the Emcee to exist as a creature apart makes narrative sense, but Redmayne’s remoteness drains some of the force from what is otherwise a grounded, gut-punching take on a disturbingly timely story.",
