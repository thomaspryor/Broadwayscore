    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong praise for lead performance ('extraordinary', 'raises to new heights') suggests positive recommendation, but limited text prevents full assessment of overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Rankin's performance as extraordinary, suggesting a positive impact on the production. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment of the review is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is overwhelmingly positive about a performance, suggesting a strong recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt uses superlatives ('extraordinary,' 'new heights') indicating strong enthusiasm for the performance, placing it in the upper range of the Positive bucket per the single-excerpt guidance, though limited context prevents a higher confidence level.",
