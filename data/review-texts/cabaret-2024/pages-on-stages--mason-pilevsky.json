    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise for the production's unique approach, but extremely limited text and 'Read more' suggests heavy truncation, making full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt shows appreciation for the production's originality, indicating a positive view. However, the single excerpt warning suggests this may not represent the full review, so a lower score within the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, but very brief. Given the limited information, I've classified it as positive with a lower score and confidence. | Kimi: The single available excerpt uses strongly positive language ('applaud') and explicitly praises the production's interpretive choices, indicating a recommendation. However, with only one curated sentence available, the confidence level is reduced per guidelines.",
