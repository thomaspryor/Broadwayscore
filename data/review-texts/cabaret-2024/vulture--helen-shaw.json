    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Uses 'triumph' which is a strong rave indicator, describes transformative theater experience with vivid, enthusiastic language. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as a 'triumph' and highlights its immersive and transformative qualities, suggesting a highly positive evaluation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the word \"triumph\" and describes the production as \"glittering\" and \"decadent,\" indicating a highly positive assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt uses the superlative 'triumph' and enthusiastic praise for the immersive staging, but as a single curated quote that may be cherry-picked, it is scored in the upper Positive range (80-84) per instructions rather than the Rave bucket.",
