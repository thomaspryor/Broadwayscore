Despite the single excerpt warning, the language used indicates a recommendation to see the show. | Gemini: The phrase \"exciting, edgy, and painstakingly-detailed production\" suggests a positive experience, but the use of \"however\" indicates potential reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, a score in the middle of the positive range is appropriate.",
