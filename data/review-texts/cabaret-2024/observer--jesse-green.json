    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises both the immersive production design and finds deeper meaning in the work, but as a single curated quote, it may not represent the full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's immersive quality and describes it as 'deeply moving,' indicating a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive experience with depth, but the lack of full text makes it hard to gauge the overall recommendation strength. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for both the production design ('transforms,' 'decadent nightclub') and emotional depth ('deeply moving meditation'), indicating a strong positive response. However, confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
