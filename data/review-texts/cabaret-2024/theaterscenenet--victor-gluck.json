However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt implies that this production is unique and worth seeing, but without more context, it's difficult to gauge the strength of the recommendation. I am scoring it as barely positive. | Kimi: The excerpt suggests this production offers a surprising or distinct take on the familiar musical, recommending it even to those who have seen previous productions.",
