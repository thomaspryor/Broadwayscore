Single excerpt warning requires conservative scoring within Mixed range. | GPT-4o: The review suggests a strong theatrical presentation but lacks emotional depth, indicating a mixed reception. The single excerpt and text quality warning suggest caution, leading to a mid-range mixed score. | Gemini: The phrase \"theatrically sizzling if emotionally tepid\" suggests a mixed reaction, with some aspects of the production being strong while others are weak. The \"if\" construction indicates a balance between positive and negative elements.",
