  "dtliExcerpt": "Near the end of “Cabaret,” Rankin sings the title song, and like so much of this production, she only plays the subtext — that life is anything but beautiful, despite what the Emcee has been telling us. Indeed, life can be hell.&nbsp; She’s a little late to that realization. Redmayne is the Devil, complete with red hair, from the moment he steps on stage.",
