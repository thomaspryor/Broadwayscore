And that’s exactly what the August Wilson Theatre has become in director Rebecca Frecknall’s visually arresting production of “Cabaret.” She, along with scenic and theater designer Tom Scutt, have rendered the August Wilson unrecognizable, beginning with a dark descent into the intestinal tract of the theater, now a velvety, swank club. Downstairs, champagne flows, cocktails glitter and a group of dancers, voguers and instrumentalists perform a live pre-show act, called the “Prologue.” When the billed show begins, audiences ascend back into the theater — which has also been reset, in the round. There are small tables and candle lamps, we have indeed been welcomed “im Cabaret, au Cabaret, to Cabaret.” The lush bacchanal of the theater’s dressing seeps into every aspect of this production, from Julia Cheng’s sensual, prurient choreography to Eddie Redmayne’s eerie performance as the Emcee.
