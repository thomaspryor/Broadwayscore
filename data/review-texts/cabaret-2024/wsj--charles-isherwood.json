  "bwwExcerpt": "Among Ms. Frecknall’s innovations is an emphasis on dance, with Julia Cheng’s choreography making inventive use of the stage space as the club performers romp, stomp and shimmy around Mr. Redmayne, engaging in ribald movement that at one point includes such unlikely sexually tinged props as a whisk and a toilet plunger. Their thickly applied makeup, skimpy costumes—a green macramé bikini?—and multicolored hair are suggestive more of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” than a seedy European club of the period,",

This balanced praise/criticism pattern suggests a mixed verdict, though confidence is low due to limited excerpt. | GPT-4o: The review describes the production as 'theatrically sizzling' but 'emotionally tepid', indicating a mix of strong theatrical elements with a lack of emotional depth. The lack of full text and flat aggregator verdicts suggest a mixed review. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the production as \"theatrically sizzling if emotionally tepid,\" indicating a mixed reaction. The aggregator verdicts also suggest a flat or mixed response. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise for the production's theatrical energy ('sizzling') while explicitly criticizing its emotional impact ('tepid'), creating a balanced mixed assessment consistent with 'Flat' aggregator ratings.",
