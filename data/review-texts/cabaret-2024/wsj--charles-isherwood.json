  "dtliExcerpt": "Even the most decadent denizens of Berlin in the Weimar era—such as a sinewy androgyne presiding as the Emcee at a nightclub where anything goes, sexually speaking—prove to be susceptible to the poisonous seductions of the ascendant Nazis in the theatrically sizzling if emotionally tepid Broadway revival of “Cabaret.”",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Among Ms. Frecknall’s innovations is an emphasis on dance, with Julia Cheng’s choreography making inventive use of the stage space as the club performers romp, stomp and shimmy around Mr. Redmayne, engaging in ribald movement that at one point includes such unlikely sexually tinged props as a whisk and a toilet plunger. Their thickly applied makeup, skimpy costumes—a green macramé bikini?—and multicolored hair are suggestive more of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” than a seedy European club of the period, ",
