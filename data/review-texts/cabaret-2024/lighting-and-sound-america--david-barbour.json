However, since only one curated quote is available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt criticizes the direction for being too obvious and predictable, suggesting a negative overall experience. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers specific criticism of the directing for being overly obvious and predictable—clear negatives regarding craft. However, as a single curated quote, it may not represent the full review's balance.",
