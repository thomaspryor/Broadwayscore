  "fullText": "Those performers—led by movie star Eddie Redmayne as the Emcee, Gayle Rankin as Sally Bowles, Ato Blankson-Wood as American fish-out-of-water Cliff, Bebe Neuwirth as Fraulein Schneider and Steven Skybell as Herr Schultz—are impressively operating on a small, raised, circular plinth, surrounded on all sides by the audience. Working within this self-imposed physical constraint, director Rebecca Frecknall produces clever and piercing thrill after thrill.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "This production wants you to have immense fun, and to never forget the well-known horrors just over its horizon—the relationship between Fraulein Schneider and Herr Schultz is imperiled by Nazism’s charge, a smashed window is stunningly conveyed by petals of falling paper. It also wants you to get, well, liquored up. Just what kind of night does Cabaret on Broadway intend you have? Glug pricey drinks and nibble on charcuterie and dwell on the effects of fascism, bigotry, and violence that Cabaret animates? The night this critic attended, an unruly person, likely inebriated, was thrown out for reaching at Redmayne.",
