  "bwwExcerpt": "And then comes the show itself, which hasn’t upped the sexuality quotient, though it has definitely underlined what’s over the top. Everything that was extreme in previous productions is now even more so. As the Emcee of the Kit Kat Club, Oscar and Tony winner Eddie Redmayne has to separate himself from two legends (Joel Grey and Alan Cumming); he does so with exaggerated hand gestures and head bobbing and with vocal tics that sometimes resemble those of Jerry Lewis. Redmayne sings the show’s signature tune, “Willkommen,” in brown leather culottes, long black gloves, and a bright-blue party hat (costumes by Tom Scutt, who also did the sets), and seems to have veered outside the normal human range, going instead for a Cirque du Soleil meets demented puppet effect that’s often weird for weird’s sake. Each time Redmayne appears, the costumes grow more outlandish, though vocally his best moment is when his Emcee is dressed conservatively as a Master Race type, standing still and smoothly singing the Nazi anthem “Tomorrow Belongs to Me” to creepy effect. A succession of miniature wooden Redmayne dolls in the same garb (puppets of the puppet, as it were) appear on the edges of the rotating stage as he sings, foreshadowing the moment later in the show when the entire cast storms the stage, suited and looking like fascists.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review critiques Redmayne's performance as overly extreme and 'weird for weird's sake' while acknowledging one effective moment. The tone suggests reservations about the production's choices rather than outright condemnation or recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the exaggerated and unconventional choices in the production, particularly in Eddie Redmayne's performance. While it acknowledges some effective moments, the overall tone suggests a production that is more peculiar and extreme than cohesive or compelling. | Gemini: The review describes Redmayne's performance as 'weird for weird's sake,' but also notes a 'creepy effect' in another scene. The overall tone is critical but not entirely negative, suggesting a mixed experience.",
