  "bwwExcerpt": "While the Emcee adores all of the Kit Kat Club’s endlessly talented ensemble, it’s easy to see why he holds a special fondness for the cabaret’s headliner, Sally Bowles. Rankin is nothing short of spectacular as the ostentatious performer, knowing when turn on her character's charming nature and when to pull back the curtain to reveal a weariness that makes it feel as if life's hardships have been weighing on her shoulders for centuries. Still, when the curtain lifts and the spotlight beams down upon her, Rankin ensures that Sally transforms into an unforgettable star with her coquettish performances of \"Don't Tell Mama\" and \"Mein Herr.\" However, it's her rendition of \"Maybe This Time,\" soft and full of hopeful surrender, that truly makes Sally's eventual arc within the musical that much more affecting.",
