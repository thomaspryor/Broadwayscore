  "bwwExcerpt": "Luckily there are two performances that do more than their share in trying to right the imbalance. Bebe Neuwirth is exquisite as Fraulein Schneider, the landlady of the boarding house where Clifford rents a room; she brings attention to songs that are not normally among the most memorable in the musical – “So What” and “What Would You Do,” — which drive home the real-life despair and high stakes then facing people in Germany. Her performance is matched by Steven Skybell, as Herr Schultz, one of her boarders. The two older characters gently fall in love, accompanied by some lovely melodies, “It Couldn’t Please Me More,” and “Married.” In the most effective scene in which the Emcee participates:, he wraps a wine glass in a napkin and steps on it – central to the traditional Jewish marriage ritual – but it’s accompanied not by hurrahs, but by a loud boom, darkness, the sound of glass shattering, and the lights up on a fluttering of what might literally be stage confetti, but hits like a preview of Kristallnacht.",

    "reasoning": "[two-model-fallback] | Both models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic identifies significant structural problems with the production's balance and concept, criticizes most lead performances, but praises Neuwirth and Skybell's work and acknowledges the ambitious transformation, resulting in a decidedly mixed assessment. | Gemini: The review highlights significant imbalances and missteps in the production, particularly in its tone and character portrayals. However, it also praises the performances of Bebe Neuwirth and Steven Skybell, suggesting that the show has redeeming qualities despite its flaws. The truncated nature of the text makes it difficult to ascertain a definitive recommendation, but the overall tone leans towards mixed.",
