    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt is purely descriptive of the production design/experience without any evaluative language or recommendation. No clear positive or negative judgment expressed. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as transforming the theater into an immersive experience, which is a positive evaluation. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the immersive environment but does not offer a clear evaluation of the show's quality, leading to a mixed classification. The confidence is low due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt employs evocative positive language ('sultry,' 'immersive') to praise the production's theatrical environment and staging design. As a single curated excerpt with clearly positive tone, it scores in the upper Positive range per scoring guidelines, though confidence is reduced due to limited available context. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Positive, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
