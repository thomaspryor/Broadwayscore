  "bwwExcerpt": "Among Ms. Frecknall’s innovations is an emphasis on dance, with Julia Cheng’s choreography making inventive use of the stage space as the club performers romp, stomp and shimmy around Mr. Redmayne, engaging in ribald movement that at one point includes such unlikely sexually tinged props as a whisk and a toilet plunger. Their thickly applied makeup, skimpy costumes—a green macramé bikini?—and multicolored hair are suggestive more of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” than a seedy European club of the period, but they undoubtedly add to the show’s arresting visual allure.",

Given truncation warning and 'Flat' aggregator context, scoring conservatively in mixed range. | GPT-4o: The review highlights innovative choreography and visual allure, suggesting some positive elements. However, the comparison to 'RuPaul’s Drag Race' and the mention of unlikely props imply a departure from the expected setting, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes striking visuals and inventive choreography, but also notes a disconnect from the intended historical setting. The overall tone is observational with both positive and negative aspects, suggesting a mixed reaction.",
