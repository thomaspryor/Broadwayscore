    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative assessment describing the show as lacking story and being inauthentic entertainment. The 'theme park' metaphor suggests shallow, commercial product rather than meaningful theater. | GPT-4o: The review is strongly negative, describing the show as lacking substance and comparing it unfavorably to a theme park. No redeeming qualities are mentioned. | Gemini: The review clearly states that the show is lacking substance and is merely a spectacle, comparing it negatively to a theme park. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the show as pure spectacle without narrative coherence, using the 'theme park' comparison as a pejorative for commercial entertainment masquerading as art. While brief, the excerpt clearly indicates a recommendation against seeing the show.",
