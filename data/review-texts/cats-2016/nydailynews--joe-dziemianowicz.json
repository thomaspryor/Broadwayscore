  "bwwExcerpt": "The whisker of a plot and lyrics are drawn from T.S. Eliot's 'Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats.' A posse of pusses gather to see which one gets a shot at a new life. Who could it be? The Rum Tum Tugger (Tyler Hanes), who struts like a rock star? Twinkled-toed Jennyanydots (Eloise Kropp)? The frisky and nimble Skimbleshanks (Jeremy Davis)? The amazing often airborne Mistoffelees (Ricky Ubeda)? Or a dozen others? It's not much of a spoiler that it's shunned and bedraggled outcast Grizabella (Leona Lewis). After all, she gets 'Memory.' Too bad she inspires so little sympathy. The show's first tagline was 'now and forever.' More fitting for 'Cats' 2.0 - now and whatever.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Watching the lively yet enervating revival staged by Trevor Nunn, who directed the original 34 years ago, you can’t help but wonder how its first run lasted 18 years. Plotless, repetitive, nonsensical, the ’80s relic quickly turns tiresome enough to make you wish for a catnap. So much energy spent, so little impact...At least the talented litter of hoofers and belters under gobs of makeup and in stretchy, body-hugging catsuits offers some saving grace...'Cats' 2.0—now and whatever.\"\n\nRead more"
