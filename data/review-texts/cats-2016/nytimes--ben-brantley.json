This reads as respectful but uncommitted. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the revival's success but questions its status as a phenomenon, indicating a mixed assessment without a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review states the revival proves the original's success wasn't a fluke, indicating a positive assessment, but the second half of the sentence shows some reservation. | Kimi: The critic validates that the show's success is deserved ('no fluke'), indicating a solid recommendation, while expressing mild reservation about its phenomenon status rather than its quality. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
