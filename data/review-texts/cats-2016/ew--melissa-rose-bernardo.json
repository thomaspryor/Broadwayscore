  "bwwExcerpt": "I have a bone to pick with Andrew Lloyd Webber about Cats. For the past few days, since I saw the first-ever Broadway revival at the Neil Simon Theatre, that's all I've had running through my head. And I'm not talking about 'Memory,' the showstopper made famous by Barbra Streisand before Cats even opened on Broadway in 1982. I mean the almost hypnotically repetitive prologue 'Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats'; the jazzy, doo-wop ode to Jennyanydots, 'The Old Gumbie Cat'; and the singsongy 'Magical Mister Mistoffelees' ('Oh! Well I never! Was there ever a cat so clever...'). Will anything - short of the 'It's a Small World' theme song - banish these insistent melodies from my brain?",
