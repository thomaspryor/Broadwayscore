The original 60 rating confirms this as mixed - neither recommendation nor discouragement. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges improvements in the production but ultimately notes that it cannot overcome the inherent issues of the material, aligning with a mixed assessment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges improvements but ultimately lands in a mixed territory due to the inherent strangeness of the show. | Kimi: The critic's own 60 rating confirms the Mixed bucket. The review acknowledges improvements ('sleeker and more focused') but ultimately finds the show cannot overcome its core problems ('fundamental weirdness'), resulting in a neither-here-nor-there assessment.",
