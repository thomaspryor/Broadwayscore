  "bwwExcerpt": "...the production's hopes of updating one of Broadway's more maligned hits - and justifying its popularity - seems to have floated up to the Heaviside Layer that these cats so desperately crave. This revival provokes but one response to the show's onetime tagline: now and whatever.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic states the production's hopes of updating and justifying the show have failed, and dismissively plays on the famous 'Now and Forever' tagline with 'now and whatever,' indicating clear disappointment and lack of recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a dismissive tone towards the revival, indicating it fails to update or justify the show's popularity. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the revival fails to update the show and doesn't justify its popularity, indicating a negative assessment. The phrase \"now and whatever\" implies indifference or dismissal. | Kimi: The excerpt dismisses the revival as failing to update the 'maligned' original or justify its popularity, with the play on Cats' famous 'Now and Forever' tagline ('now and whatever') signaling complete indifference rather than enthusiastic condemnation.",
