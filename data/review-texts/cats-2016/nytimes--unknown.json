Mr. Lloyd Webber is a musical magpie...The cast for the revival is largely excellent.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows praise for cast and production elements, but lacks clear recommendation language. Given excerpt-only nature and measured tone, scored at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the show's success, the excellent cast, and the allure of the songs, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review praises the cast, choreography, and music, but the overall tone is somewhat reserved. Given the limited excerpt, a score in the lower end of the positive range seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the cast ('largely excellent') and the music ('greatest allure'), indicating a recommendation despite noting the conservative 'don't mess with success' approach of the revival.",
