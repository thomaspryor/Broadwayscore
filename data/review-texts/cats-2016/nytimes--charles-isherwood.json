  "bwwExcerpt": "The overriding spirit of the revival appears to be the familiar motto: Don't mess with success. Once again, the production is directed by Trevor Nunn, with sets and costumes by John Napier. Once again, a Broadway theater has been transformed into a grungy London junkyard, where trash piles up against the walls and spills out into the auditorium - albeit on a somewhat smaller scale. That levitating tire, as famous a set piece as a certain falling chandelier, presides once again at the back of the stage. (Apparently the license plate on the battered car, which reads 'NAP 70,' is an in-joke indicating how many productions Mr. Napier has designed. Imagine how many leg warmers have been involved.)",
