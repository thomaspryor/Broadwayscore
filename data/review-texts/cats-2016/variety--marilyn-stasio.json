  "bwwExcerpt": "Memories could be fatal to this revival of 'Cats' - specifically, the memory of Betty Buckley as Grizabella, singing 'Memory' as it's meant to be sung, with heartbreaking beauty and exquisite pain by a great stage performer. Leona Lewis, the British pop star anointed by Andrew Lloyd Webber himself, isn't in her league. Happily, nothing as catty can be said of the rest of this fabulous revival of the 1981 musical phenom that padded its way around the world on little cats' feet.",
