  "bwwExcerpt": "Best of all is the refreshed choreography by Tony winner Andy Blankenbuehler ('Hamilton') who has replaced Gillian Lynne's compilation of stock moves with variety and invention. Except for a preponderance of butt-waving, the taffy-jointed dancers have some of the angular, sudden, inexplicable moves of catliness. Highlights include balletic Georgina Pazcoguin, all in white, who moves as if she loves being in her skin, and Ricky Ubeda as Mr. Mistoffelees, who unspools turns and leaps with soft-paw landings.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt focuses entirely on praising the choreography and specific performers with enthusiastic language ('Best of all', 'variety and invention', 'loves being in her skin'). However, confidence is low as this is one curated excerpt that may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the choreography and highlights specific performers, indicating a positive view. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on praising the refreshed choreography and specific dancers. Given the limited text, it's difficult to gauge the overall sentiment, but the positive tone suggests a recommendation, albeit with potential reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the refreshed choreography and specific dance performances, using superlatives like 'best of all' and 'balletic' to highlight the production's strengths. However, confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
