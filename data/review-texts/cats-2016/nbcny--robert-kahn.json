  "bwwExcerpt": "'Cats' is full of catchy pop tunes many of us have known for decades. Webber's songs don't have the tightest of melodies, but I'll take 'Cats' over 'School of Rock' any day. As a wistful recollection, 'Cats' is guaranteed to leave you feline groovy-it's here now, though I wouldn't bet on it lasting forever.",
