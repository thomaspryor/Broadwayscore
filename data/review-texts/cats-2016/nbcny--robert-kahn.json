  "bwwExcerpt": "'Cats' is full of catchy pop tunes many of us have known for decades. Webber's songs don't have the tightest of melodies, but I'll take 'Cats' over 'School of Rock' any day. As a wistful recollection, 'Cats' is guaranteed to leave you feline groovy-it's here now, though I wouldn't bet on it lasting forever.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Qualified positive recommendation with mixed elements - praises the familiar songs and guarantees audience satisfaction, but notes melody weaknesses and questions longevity. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt suggests a positive but not enthusiastic recommendation. The critic appreciates the nostalgic value and catchy tunes, though acknowledges limitations in melody and questions its longevity. Given the single excerpt and lack of stronger praise, it fits a lower positive score. | Gemini: The review is positive, stating that the show is guaranteed to leave you feeling groovy. However, the critic also mentions that they wouldn't bet on it lasting forever, indicating some reservations. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic offers a qualified recommendation, praising the show as enjoyable ('guaranteed to leave you feline groovy') and preferable to similar fare, while noting melodic weaknesses and expressing skepticism about its longevity. The tempered enthusiasm and single-excerpt limitation warrant a lower Positive score.",
