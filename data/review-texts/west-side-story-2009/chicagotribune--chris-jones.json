  "bwwExcerpt": "To put all that together, Van Hove has deconstructed the usual pieces of 'West Side Story' in service of better targeting the show's gooey, throbbing, omnisexual center: the truth that love is not only the fiercest human weapon against sectarian violence but the only real reason to live. No moment exemplifies that intent than a stunner of a sequence following 'The Dance at the Gym,' wherein a sensually smitten Tony (Isaac Powell) and Maria (Shereen Pimentel) strain to reach each other as they are held back by what looks and feels like two teams in a human tug of war. Anyone who has seen many a 'West Side' has experienced leads with no particular connection: In this production, their need for each other is so visceral as to overwhelm everything and everyone around them. In this production's take on 'Somewhere,' their feeling metastasizes with such force that everyone writhes around on the stage floor with a lover of their own choosing. Add in Van Hove's macabre talent for articulating pending tragic disaster (as seen so vividly in his 'A View From the Bridge') and the result is a gripping 'West Side' that you watch with both an appreciation for the power of the young and in love, and a profound sense of all-American doom.",
