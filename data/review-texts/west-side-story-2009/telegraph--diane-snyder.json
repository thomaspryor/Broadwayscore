  "bwwExcerpt": "Not many musicals get to be ground-breaking 63 years after their Broadway premiere. But the enterprising Belgian director Ivo van Hove's reimagined West Side Story is a marvelous surprise. This classic American musical inspired by Romeo and Juliet comes alive in a production bursting with frenetic energy, passion, pathos and those glorious Leonard Bernstein-Stephen Sondheim songs. It's a stunning achievement for van Hove, known for deconstructions of celebrated works such as A View From the Bridge and Network.",
