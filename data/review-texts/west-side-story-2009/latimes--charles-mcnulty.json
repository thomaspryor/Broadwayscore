  "bwwExcerpt": "Long ago, I was enthralled by Van Hove's deconstructions of Eugene O'Neill, Tennessee Williams and Henrik Ibsen at New York Theatre Workshop. But since this iconoclastic director won a Tony for his staging of 'A View From the Bridge,' he has been operating less like a daring artisan than a factory for a multinational company. But this intrepid reworking of 'West Side Story' marks more than a return to form for Van Hove. The production, which set its official opening for Thursday at the Broadway Theatre, restores the vitality to a musical that can seem ersatz and lumbering when treated like a museum piece.",
