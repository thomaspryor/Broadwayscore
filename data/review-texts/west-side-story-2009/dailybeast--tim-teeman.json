  "bwwExcerpt": "However, most shockingly, van Hove's West Side Story is not shocking; it is tame and impatiently brisk, having ejected songs like 'I Feel Pretty.' It is also a strange mélange of the good, bad, and baffling-especially in what it seeks to coherently say (or sing, when it comes to 'Gee, Officer Krupke') about the hot-button issues of 2020 it zeroes in on, like racism, immigration, and police brutality. Its engagement with those issues-more on this below-comes to feel lazy and manipulative, rather than shocking or shattering.",
