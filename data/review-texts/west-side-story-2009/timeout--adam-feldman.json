  "bwwExcerpt": "Like much of Ivo van Hove's bold, often thrilling production, this opening sequence is big and small at once. Throughout the show, live sequences coexist or alternate with filmed ones, including many that occur offstage entirely; detail is blown up into spectacle, and spectacle is subsumed into detail. Van Hove's West Side Story functions very differently from any we have seen before. If the result is sometimes murky, it is also frequently revelatory-a major accomplishment in a show whose status as a classic threatens to freeze it in time and relevance.",
