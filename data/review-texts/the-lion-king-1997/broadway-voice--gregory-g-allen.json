However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium, and the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the rave range. | Gemini: While the excerpt praises the visual aspects of the show, the lack of further context and the single excerpt warning suggest a conservative score within the positive range is appropriate. It's likely recommended, but potentially with reservations about other aspects not mentioned.",
