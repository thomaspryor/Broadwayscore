  "fullText": "It’s been over two decades since I first witnessed the magic of Disney’s The Lion King on stage, and I can confirm that the recent Atlanta production has lost none of its power. As the iconic soundtrack swelled through the Fox Theatre on opening night, I was instantly transported back to my memories of seeing this stunning musical for the first time. The sheer scale and level of detail in this production are nothing short of breathtaking, reminding fans why The Lion King has cemented its status as a true Broadway masterpiece. The performers also brought their A-Game. Mukelisiwe Goba was fantastic as Rafiki – she sang with such power and brought so many humorous moments to the stage. Darnell Abraham imbues Mufasa with an regal air that demands reverence, while Nick LaMedica’s impeccable comedic timing as Zazu has the audience in stitches. In a deliciously villainous turn, Peter Hargrave’s Scar sends chills down the spine with “Be Prepared.” And, of course, the iconic soundtrack remains the driving force, and hearing timeless anthems like “Circle of Life,” “Hakuna Matata,” and “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” performed live accompanied by such beautiful visuals… it was every bit as nostalgic as this Disney Adult was hoping for! Not to go off on a tangent here, but can I just say how much I love the song “He Lives In You.” For those fans that don’t know the history of this song, it was originally composed by Lebo M, Mark Mancina, and Jay Rifkin for the 1995 album Rhythm of the Pride Lands – a musical companion piece inspired by the 1994 animated film (which had some fantastic score pieces on it). When The Lion King debuted on Broadway in 1997, “He Lives in You” was prominently featured, first in an abbreviated form as “They Live in You” and then in its full, majestic arrangement. It was later used in the 1998 sequel film as well, The Lion King II: Simba’s Pride. It just doesn’t get enough attention among the film’s more popular songs, so I felt the need to call it out. From the animal kingdom processional flowing down the theatre’s aisles to the stunning puppetry work that animates Zazu, Timon, and Pumbaa, every staging element brought the majesty of the African Prideland to the stage. The costumes are as beautiful as ever, and the silhouettes alone of those costumes are just so cool to see against the reddish-yellow sky backdrops on stage. And while the overall set design remains rather simple in comparison to some of the other bigger shows we’ve seen come through, it allows for the performances to be the true attention grabber. What strikes me most, however, is how this show has lost none of its appeal, even after over two decades. The Lion King continues to captivate new generations of theatergoers and little fans while igniting nostalgia in those who grew up with the original animated film. It is a true testament to the timeless storytelling and the creative vision that brought this landmark musical to life. Celebrating 26 landmark years on Broadway, The Lion King has made theatrical history with three productions worldwide running 20 or more years and two others running 25 or more years, solidifying its status as one of the most popular stage musicals in the world! Be sure to check out The Lion King at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta! Performances are happening October 2 – October 20, 2024, as part of the Regions Bank Broadway in Atlanta 2024/25 season. Tickets will be available at the Fox Theatre box office at 660 Peachtree Street NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30308, by visiting foxtheatre.org or by calling 855-285-8499. Group orders of 10 or more may be placed by contacting sales@foxtheatre.org. I agree with everything the writer said except for one criticism. I was seated in row S, left middle orchestra, and had a hard time hearing some of the speech vocals and the singing vocals over the music. I hope they look into that because it took away from the excellent overall experience. I think it should be mandatory for the rules of etiquette to be read and understood before purchasing tickets. One lady was actually wearing a broad-rimmed hat a few rows up. A seemingly intelligent man behind me, with whom I chatted prior, talked too much, not to mention the noise from a plastic wrapper (both in the etiquette section). One last thing: the children talking and expressing joy was welcomed by me, but if that might bother you, don’t go to a matinee.",
