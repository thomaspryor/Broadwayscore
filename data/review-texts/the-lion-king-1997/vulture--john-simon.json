Hamilton\n\n1, 2, 3, 7, N, Q, R, S at Times Sq.-42nd St.\n\nCome to The Lion King with two pairs of eyes, one ear, and half a brain. You will be bombarded by some of the most beautiful and spectacular sights theater can offer from before and behind, so eyes in the back of the head will come in handy. You will be harangued by second-rate standard-show music and lyrics by Elton John and Tim Rice, and also by Lebo Mï's stirring African chants and ululations, to which your active ear should be cocked. Finally, you will be subjected to a well-worn, simplistic children's tale about a lion cub's hard road to adulthood and the throne of the animal kingdom, usurped by his wicked uncle in cahoots with some murderously laughing hyenas. Kiddies, of course, will delightedly swallow it whole, unless they are tiny and flappable. But this is the one such show adults will feast on, too, mostly because of the wonders wrought by Julie Taymor, who designed and directed this cornucopia of dazzlements. First, the animals, large and small, re-created with unparalleled imagination, underpropped by costumes that artfully blend realism with fantasy: The prancing giraffes and leaping antelopes, the nodding elephant and barreling warthog, keep you marveling even during the story's stodgiest galumphing. \n\n — John Simon",

The truncated text suggests a positive overall assessment. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the visual spectacle and imaginative design as major strengths, suggesting a positive experience despite criticisms of the music and story. The truncated nature of the text and mixed aggregator context suggest some reservations, leading to a medium confidence level. | Gemini: Despite some reservations about the music and story, the review praises the visual spectacle and Julie Taymor's direction, suggesting a positive overall experience, especially for adults. The truncated text makes it difficult to assess the final verdict with complete certainty, but the positive aspects are emphasized.",
