You will be harangued by second-rate standard-show music and lyrics by Elton John and Tim Rice, and also by Lebo Mï's stirring African chants and ululations, to which your active ear should be cocked. Finally, you will be subjected to a well-worn, simplistic children's tale about a lion cub's hard road to adulthood and the throne of the animal kingdom, usurped by his wicked uncle in cahoots with some murderously laughing hyenas. Kiddies, of course, will delightedly swallow it whole, unless they are tiny and flappable. But this is the one such show adults will feast on, too, mostly because of the wonders wrought by Julie Taymor, who designed and directed this cornucopia of dazzlements. First, the animals, large and small, re-created with unparalleled imagination, underpropped by costumes that artfully blend realism with fantasy: The prancing giraffes and leaping antelopes, the nodding elephant and barreling warthog, keep you marveling even during the story's stodgiest galumphing. \n\n — John Simon",

The critic acknowledges adults will 'feast on' the visual wonders but calls the music 'second-rate' and story 'simplistic.' The truncated nature makes me cautious about a lower score. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the spectacular visual elements and imaginative design by Julie Taymor, suggesting a positive experience despite criticisms of the music and story. The truncated text and mixed aggregator context suggest a cautious positive score. | Gemini: Despite the truncated text, the review highlights the spectacular visuals and imaginative animal recreations, suggesting a positive experience overall, especially for adults. The critic acknowledges the simplistic story and 'second-rate' music, but emphasizes the visual spectacle as a major draw.",
