From the moment it begins, The Lion King offers astonishing stage magic. Performers walking on giant stilts become giraffes, birds, and a pride of lionesses, dance with a solemn gracefulness that is breathtaking.\"",

Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a rave review. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses phrases like \"intelligent spectacle\" and \"astonishing stage magic,\" indicating a positive recommendation.
