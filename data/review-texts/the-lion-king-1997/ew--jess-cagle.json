  "dtliExcerpt": "Like Christmas Day and sex with supermodels, Broadway seasons are often far more exciting during the anticipation stage. Over the past two months, four new eagerly anticipated musicals have opened, and the first three — The Scarlet Pimpernel, Triumph of Love, and Side Show — made this season look like no exception to the rule. But then, on Nov. 13, The Lion King bounded onto the stage, and Broadway roared. Based on Disney's blockbuster 1994 animated feature, the musical version of The Lion King might have been mounted like the spectacular but ice-showish Beauty and the Beast, which is still charming children and making money a few blocks away. Fortunately, Disney didn't leave well enough alone. To bring The Lion King into three dimensions, Disney tapped Julie Taymor, an experimental director known for her cerebral productions meshing puppetry and poetry. The unlikely partnership has turned the most successful animated film in Disney's history into the most exciting Broadway experience since Rent routed the Great White Way into the '90s two seasons ago.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'The Lion King' was astonishing, in the jaw-dropping manner of speaking. And today, 21 years later, it still is...Taymor, the avant-garde director to whom Disney entrusted the piece, outdid herself...Everything still looks wonderful, and looks practically brand new, too. One of the stunning elements for me, this time through, was the realization of how brilliantly this show moves...The hard-working ensemble is well-drilled and exceptional.\"",

  "garbageFullText": "Like Christmas Day and sex with supermodels, Broadway seasons\nare often far more exciting during the anticipation stage. Over\nthe past two months, four new eagerly anticipated musicals have\nopened, and the first three  The Scarlet Pimpernel, Triumph of\nLove, and Side Show  made this season look like no exception to\nthe rule. But then, on Nov. 13, The Lion King bounded onto the\nstage, and Broadway roared.\n\nBased on Disney's blockbuster 1994 animated feature, the musical\nversion of The Lion King might have been mounted like the\nspectacular but ice-showish Beauty and the Beast, which is\nstill charming children and making money a few blocks away.\nFortunately, Disney didn't leave well enough alone. To bring The\nLion King into three dimensions, Disney tapped Julie Taymor, an\nexperimental director known for her cerebral productions meshing\npuppetry and poetry. The unlikely partnership has turned the\nmost successful animated film in Disney's history into the most\nexciting Broadway experience since Rent routed the Great White\nWay into the '90s two seasons ago.\n\nElton John and Tim Rice have added three songs to their original\nscore (more music, including some haunting African tribal\nnumbers, is by Taymor, Hans Zimmer, Mark Mancina, Lebo M, and\nJay Rifkin), but it's Taymor's staging that makes The Lion King such a blessed event. Her enormous creations  including a\nlife-size elephant and great, lanky giraffes  roam the theater\nin a full-throttle rendition of ''Circle of Life.'' Fusing actors,\ncostumes, and puppets, Taymor and her collaborator, Michael\nCurry, leave the faces of her largely black cast visible under\nthe regal lion masks, giving the proceedings an unexpected\nemotional wallop. There's an inspired performance by Tsidii Le\nLoka as the babbling, mystical, mischievous baboon, to whom\nTaymor has given a sex change (Robert Guillaume did the voice in\nthe film). And Max Casella (whose Doogie Howser, M.D. costar\nNeil Patrick Harris, by the way, is starring in the Los Angeles\nproduction of Rent) sings, dances, and clowns impressively while\noperating a Timon-the-meerkat puppet almost as big as he is.\n\nYes, The Lion King's pacing drags a bit in the first act, and\nthe show's venue, Disney's opulently refurbished New Amsterdam\nTheatre on 42nd Street, has a few kinks (you'll miss a lot of\nthe show if you're seated too far to the side). But Taymor's\namazing vision overrides any quibbles. The Lion King can make\nyou fall in love with theater no matter what theater it's in.\n\nSince so many people are lining up for The Lion King, here's an\nassessment of the season's easier-to-get-into new musicals.\nThere's only one good reason to see The Scarlet Pimpernel:\nDouglas Sills as Percy, the titular English aristocrat who leads\na secret brigade against radical French revolutionaries. He\nprances and swaggers with sharp comic timing and a dancer's\ngrace. He sings in a heroic baritone that could sail the English\nChannel. Too bad the show's sappy ballads by Nan Knighton and\nFrank Wildhorn sound like an unholy collaboration between Celine\nDion and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Director Peter Hunt's lavish but\nstatic adaptation of the century-old novel by Baroness Orczy is\neven more lazy. If the fighting French are your thing, Les\nMiserables is still the place to be.\n\nLikewise, Triumph of Love, directed by Michael Mayer, triumphs\nonly when Betty Buckley  right now the finest voice on\nBroadway  gets to sing. Despite the commanding presence of\ncostar F. Murray Abraham, this musical version of Marivaux's\ngender-bending 1732 comedy about the sexual awakening of a group\nof philosophers is pretty dumb.\n\nIf Marivaux sounds like an odd inspiration for a musical, you\nhaven't seen Side Show, based on Daisy and Violet Hilton, the\nSiamese twins who in real life picked themselves up from the\ncarnival circuit to become vaudeville stars. As the twins, Emily\nSkinner and Alice Ripley sing poignantly and beautifully, and\ndirector Robert Longbottom's well-meaning, straight-faced\nstorytelling works on its own loopy terms. (By the end, you\ncringe when a movie director refers to them as freaks.) Still,\nthis musical gave me church giggles a couple of times; for all\nits ambition and pretensions, it's inevitably a show starring\ntwo fine actresses with their butts stuck together. Perhaps they\nshould have used puppets.\n\nThe Lion King: A+ The Scarlet Pimpernel: C Triumph Of Love: C Side Show: B-\n\nThe rules: Keep it clean, and stay on the subject or we might delete your comment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t  If you see inappropriate language, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t  e-mail us. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t  An asterisk * indicates a required field.\n\nOne of the most pleasant surprises of the new season...\n\nCopyright © 2011 Entertainment Weekly.
