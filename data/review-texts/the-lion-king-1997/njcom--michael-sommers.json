However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language (\"stunning,\" \"graceful,\" \"fantastic,\" \"wonderment\") suggesting a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring in the middle of the positive range.",
