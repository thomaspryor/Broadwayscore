  "dtliExcerpt": "In the opening number of The Lion King, director Julie Taymor created one of the most transporting visions ever seen in a Broadway show. A procession of African beasts of all shapes and sizes—flocks of birds, leaping gazelles, and towering giraffes—moves through the aisles, all interpreted via gorgeous, minutely detailed costumes and puppetry. This long-running New York City musical is based on the 1994 Disney animated flick about a Hamletesque lion who must win back his kingdom from the clutches of his evil uncle. Featuring a catchy score by Elton John and Tim Rice, Taymor’s adaptation is infused with additional spectacle and songs inspired by African culture.",

As the company sings \"The Circle of Life,\" a procession of beasts parades through the aisles of the Minskoff Theatre: flocks of birds, leaping gazelles, towering giraffes, a lumbering elephant, all rendered thorugh eye-popping puppetry and costumes. Faithfully adapted from Disney's hugely popular 1994 animated movie, about a young lion who must reclaim his kingdom from the clutches of an evil uncle, the musical is one of the best Broadway shows for kids, and there's plenty of slapstick comedy to entertain the littles ones. But this is not just your children's Lion King. The movie's catchy score, by Elton John and Tim Rice, has been augmented with music rooted in proud African traditions, and the production is a stunning celebration of color and movement. No wonder The Lion King has been running for nearly 20 years. Taymor's audacious staging expands a simple cub into the pride of Broadway, not merely a fable of heredity but a celebration of heritage.\n\nThe Lion King is a musical adapted from the 1994 Disney animated film The Lion King. It features music by Elton John, lyrics by Tim Rice and a book by Roger Allers and Irene Mecchi. It is directed by Julie Taymor.

(From 1997 through June 4, 2006, it was at the New Amsterdam Theatre.)\n\nThe Book of Mormon plays eight times a week, on the following schedule: Tuesdays at 7pm; Wednesdays at 2pm and 7pm; Thursdays at 7pm; Fridays at 8pm; Saturdays at 2pm and 8pm; and Sundays at 3pm.\n\nTickets to The Lion King are sold online.
