  "fullText": "In the opening number of The Lion King, director Julie Taymor created one of the most transporting visions ever seen in a Broadway show. A procession of African beasts of all shapes and sizes—flocks of birds, leaping gazelles, and towering giraffes—moves through the aisles, all interpreted via gorgeous, minutely detailed costumes and puppetry. This long-running New York City musical is based on the 1994 Disney animated flick about a Hamletesque lion who must win back his kingdom from the clutches of his evil uncle. Featuring a catchy score by Elton John and Tim Rice, Taymor’s adaptation is infused with additional spectacle and songs inspired by African culture.",
