However, confidence is medium due to having only one excerpt that could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The phrase 'nothing short of miraculous' suggests a highly positive view of the staging, indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium as the full context of the review is not available. | Gemini: The single quote praises the staging as \"miraculous,\" which suggests a positive experience, but without more context, it's difficult to gauge the overall recommendation strength. I'm placing it in the positive bucket with a middling score due to the limited information.",
