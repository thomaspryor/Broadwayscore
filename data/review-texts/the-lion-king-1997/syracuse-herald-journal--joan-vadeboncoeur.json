    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The phrase 'exciting piece of theater for everyone' indicates a positive recommendation, but with only one curated excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively in the lower positive range as this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'exciting' and implies a broad appeal, which suggests a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as \"exciting,\" which indicates a positive recommendation. The caveat about being especially good for those unfamiliar with the source material suggests a slight reservation, placing it in the lower end of the positive range.",
