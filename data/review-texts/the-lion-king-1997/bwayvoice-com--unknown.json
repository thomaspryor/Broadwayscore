  "fullText": "Can you remember the first Disney film you ever saw and the way those musicals on screen made you feel? I&#8217;ve always been a huge fan and felt at one point in the 90s that these films were taking over as the new Broadway. Then Broadway itself got wise and started to move these great pieces of work from film to stage. When I saw &#8220;The Lion King&#8221; on Broadway, I took my ten-year-old niece and made it her first Broadway experience. What an experience it is. The moment the overture starts and the magic that is director Julie Taymor unfolds before our eyes, I was dumbfounded. The spectacle, the imagination, the puppetry &#8211; all of it comes together in a way that can overwhelm any jaded theatergoer. So many have spoken of the beautiful opening number (written by Sir Elton John and Tim Rice), but the show is much more than the amazing opening. There is family, love, comedy and image after image where you think, &#8220;how did they do that?&#8221;\n\nFrom a stampede on stage to flying birds, Taymor has left no stone unturned. It is clear that what she visualized in her mind has come alive on stage.  The audience feels a part of it all and can relate to the lessons taught inside this family-friendly story. Watching the faces of all the actors as they dance and sing with their puppet counterpoints make this show an enchanting evening of enjoyment for just about any age audience.\n\nThe fact that this show has been running for so long is not by chance. it is a special treasure on Broadway that should be on any tourists list coming to New York City. Broadway can open our eyes and hearts in an amazing way. That 10-year old girl that I took to see the show when it opened is now a Penn State Grad with a degree in Sound Design. Look out Broadway; you have won over another heart and mind all because of shows that roar like this reigning king.\n\nI loved the Lion King.  The music was extremely good and well performed by an excellent cast.  The sets and costumes were very imaginative and beautiful.\n\none of the all time greatest shows. music, performance, set &#8211; absolute world class.\n\nLiterally have not one negative thing to say about this epic production. It is truly all encompassing &#8211; and embodies every element in which we go to the theater for. It is the only show I have ever seen my Dad shed a tear! I believe if anyone has not seen this show yet, get there asap!\n\nBeautiful: The Carole King MusicalRated 5 stars  4\n\nMotown the MusicalRated 5 stars  2",
