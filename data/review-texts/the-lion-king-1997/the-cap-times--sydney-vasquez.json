  "bwwExcerpt": "The costume and set designs are just as important to the story as the plot itself. Each animal that roams the stage is constructed and depicted differently. The birds are vaulted into the air as high-tech kites. Those who play giraffes are almost unrecognizable as people, as they're cradled within their costumes and vaulted by stilts. Gazelles are placed on the spokes of a rigged bicycle to mimic their frolic. Kennedy Center - Washington, DC",
