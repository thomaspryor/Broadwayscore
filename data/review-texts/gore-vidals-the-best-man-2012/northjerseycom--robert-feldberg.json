  "bwwExcerpt": "The stage is filled with stars, but the one who makes the evening go is John Larroquette, playing candidate William Russell, a former secretary of state who knows he should keep his quirky, intellectual style under wraps, but can't help himself from doing things such as quoting Martin Luther. ... \"The Best Man\" provides a look back at what presidential campaigns used to be like before candidates became the straightforward, honorable individuals they are today.",
