  "bwwExcerpt": "The play's twists, which include a then-scandalous gay rumor, may seem less surprising to audiences grown jaded by Fox News, MSNBC, and the 24/7 political spin cycle. But Vidal's play remains remarkably well-constructed (and the cast will doubtless improve the pacing, which moseys occasionally, as they grow into their roles). ... And there's 86-year-old Angela Lansbury, sharp as a tack even if she needs a cane now to command the stage, as the Southern grand dame who chairs the party's women's di",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise for the play's construction and Lansbury's performance, but notes pacing issues and suggests cast needs development. Truncated text and single excerpt limit confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play's construction and suggests the cast will improve, indicating a positive outlook despite some pacing issues. The single excerpt and lack of a full verdict lower confidence. | Gemini: The review suggests the play is \"remarkably well-constructed\" but the pacing needs improvement. The presence of Angela Lansbury is also a positive. Given the limited excerpt, a score in the lower positive range seems appropriate.",
