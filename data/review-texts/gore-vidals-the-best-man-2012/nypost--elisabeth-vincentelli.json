However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the writing as \"great\" and suggests the revival is worthwhile, indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the source material ('great writing') and implies the revival successfully demonstrates its enduring power, indicating a solid recommendation despite the limited text available.",
