However, the lack of detailed evaluative content limits the confidence level. | Gemini: The review states the play is \"worth reviving\", indicating a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic explicitly calls the show 'worth reviving,' recommending it for its portrayal of adult politicians despite their flaws.",
