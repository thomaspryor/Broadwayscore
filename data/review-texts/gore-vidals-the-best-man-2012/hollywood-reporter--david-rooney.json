However, confidence is low due to having only one curated quote that may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the writing and performances, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt clearly praises the writing and performances, stating they make the material feel \"fresh and relevant.\" Given the limited text, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows clear appreciation for the writing and performances, calling the production 'fresh and relevant,' indicating a solid recommendation despite limited available text.",
