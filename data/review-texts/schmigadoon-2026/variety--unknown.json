  "fullText": "Your inclination towards \"Schmigadoon!,\" at least in its early going, will likely be determined by your reaction to its title.\n\nIf you think it's a clever, charming wink to \"Brigadoon\" — the Lerner and Loewe musical about an enchanted village, don't you know? — then you may very well be along for the ride from the first moment. If, like this critic, you think there's something ineffably cringey about it, with a bit too much effort contained within that exclamation point: Well, you may not find yourself on the wavelength of a show defined by its strenuousness.",
