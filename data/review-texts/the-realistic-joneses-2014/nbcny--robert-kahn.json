  "bwwExcerpt": "All members of the foursome give performances much in keeping with how we've experienced them before: Tomei is spacey, Letts wields defense mechanisms powerful enough to fend off an alien attack, and so on...Eno's ultimately too-indulgent comedy is a gentle reminder that none of us know what we are really facing, and some of us are more acutely aware of that 'unknown' than others. The trouble with 'The Realistic Joneses' is that it's more concerned with making the point over and over, rather than exploring anything new.",
