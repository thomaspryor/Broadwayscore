  "bwwExcerpt": "Until now, his off-Broadway 'Thom Pain (based on nothing)' and 'The Open House,' among others, have shown him to be a wildly divisive writer: Some love his deadpan riffs on language; just as many find him glib and empty. Yet Sunday night, the Massachusetts native made his Broadway debut with 'The Realistic Joneses,' a dark comedy that's fairly accessible - for Eno (we're not talking Neil Simon here) - but won't settle the debate. The show starts off strong before running in circles, leaving you wondering what the point was, exactly.",
