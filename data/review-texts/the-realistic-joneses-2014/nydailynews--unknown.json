  "bwwExcerpt": "It's funny how trying to connect with neighbors, spouses, God, whomever, can lead you nowhere. Will Eno takes that idea and runs with it in 'The Realistic Joneses,' an anxious comedy that packs rueful zingers, four first-rate starry performances and - buzzkill time, kids - diminishing returns for the entire second half...Under Sam Gold's tight direction, the cast is natural and convincing. But three-quarters of an hour into the 95-minute show, the script simply circles without deepening, darkening or clarifying...But in 'Realistic Joneses,' his Broadway debut, the engine remains stuck in second. Keeping up with these Joneses quickly loses its appeal.",
