  "bwwExcerpt": "As one might deduce from an ironically titled play whose 'realism' is open to debate, Eno is interested more in the byways of speech and silence than in actual plot. Not a lot happens during The Realistic Joneses beyond the coming together of two couples, both called Jones, who inhabit a small town where such activity as there is involves a balloon festival and local fair that pointedly don't involve them. Any friends or relations? Forget it: these four are one another's world - perhaps even the world - and that's that.",
