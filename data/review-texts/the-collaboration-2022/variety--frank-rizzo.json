Single excerpt warning suggests this could be cherry-picked, but the language is definitively positive, warranting upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the lead performances as superb, suggesting a positive view of the show. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment may not be fully represented, leading to a conservative score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses solely on the positive aspects of the lead performances, suggesting a strong positive element. Given that it's the only available text, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with a higher score, but with low confidence due to the limited context. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performances ('superb') and indicates the play succeeds, but as a single curated quote potentially cherry-picked from a larger review, it warrants cautious scoring in the upper Positive range with low confidence.",
