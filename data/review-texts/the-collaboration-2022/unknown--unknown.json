    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic finds the show conceptually promising but dramatically deficient, describing it as 'lacking a dramatic motor' and 'in search of a rationale.' However, confidence is low due to having only one excerpt that may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show lacks substance and fails to deliver on its premise, indicating a negative assessment. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt states that the show \"lacks a dramatic motor,\" indicating a negative assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers fundamental criticism of the show's construction, stating it 'lacks a dramatic motor' and is a 'high-concept pitch in search of a rationale,' indicating the concept fails to translate into compelling drama. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt and truncation warnings.",
