However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt states that the play feels \"emptily formulaic\" and doesn't provide insight, indicating a negative assessment. Given that it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic finds the production 'emptily formulaic' and lacking meaningful insight into its subjects, indicating a clear negative assessment. Low confidence due to availability of only a single excerpt.",
