    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic finds the show conceptually promising but dramatically deficient, calling it a 'pitch in search of a rationale' - clear disappointment with execution. Low confidence due to single excerpt and 'Read more' truncation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a lack of substance and direction in the show, indicating disappointment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates the show \"lacks a dramatic motor\" and is \"in search of a rationale,\" suggesting a negative assessment. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as lacking a 'dramatic motor' and calls it a 'high-concept pitch in search of a rationale,' indicating fundamental flaws in the writing and construction. Given this is a single curated excerpt with no mention of redeeming qualities, it suggests a negative verdict, though confidence is lowered due to potential truncation and lack of full context.",
