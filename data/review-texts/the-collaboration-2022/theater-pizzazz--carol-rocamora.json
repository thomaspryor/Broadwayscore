    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language about the production ('pulsates with color, vitality, and feeling') and praise for script quality and performances. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the enthusiasm suggests upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the script's economy and focus, allowing actors to shine, and describes the production as pulsating with vitality. This suggests a strong positive impression, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"shine\", \"pulsates\", \"color, vitality, and feeling\", indicating a positive recommendation. Given the limited text, I am placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong praise for the script's focus, the principal actors' performances, and the production's vitality, indicating a clear recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the single-excerpt format.",
