    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The comparison to 'a jukebox musical without the music' suggests the show lacks essential elements that make it compelling. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed verdict by comparing the show to a 'jukebox musical without the music,' implying a lack of substance or coherence. However, without more context or a clear recommendation, the sentiment is ambiguous. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is negative, comparing the show unfavorably to a jukebox musical without the music. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic's metaphor suggests the show possesses the manufactured, commercial structure of a jukebox musical but lacks even the entertaining songs that make such shows bearable, implying an empty, cynical production. With only one excerpt available, this represents a significant criticism of the show's substance, though the full context of the review is unknown.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Directed by Kwame Kwei-Armah and inspired by the real life 1984 painting collaboration of the aging (at least in terms of artistic relevance) Warhol and the soaring Basquiat – a project presented so much more convincingly and movingly in the 1996 film Basquiat, starring Jeffrey Wright and, in the definitive performance of Warhol, David Bowie, who haunts this play like a shadow – The Collaboration is an oddly lifeless endeavor, a failure in capturing even a moment of simple artistic inspiration much less the ignition of of collaborative genius.",
