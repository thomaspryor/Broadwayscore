    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic dismisses the work as 'not a play in any traditional sense' and reduces it to merely 'an extended comedy sketch,' which is clearly negative. However, this appears to be only a fragment or opening line of a longer review, so confidence is low due to the truncated nature of the text. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the show lacks the depth of a traditional play, implying it may not meet typical theatrical expectations. However, it does not explicitly discourage attendance, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review describes the show as an \"extended comedy sketch\", which suggests a lack of traditional theatrical structure. This indicates a mixed or neutral assessment rather than a positive or negative one. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the work as merely an 'extended comedy sketch' unworthy of the designation 'play,' implying it is insubstantial for the Broadway stage, though the severely truncated text prevents a fuller assessment. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
