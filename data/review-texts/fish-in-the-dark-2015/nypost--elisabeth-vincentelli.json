  "bwwExcerpt": "Larry David has no understudy in 'Fish in the Dark,' because he is the only reason you'd want to see this new comedy. If he's out, there's no show...'Fish in the Dark' gives us the Larry David we know, from the trademark blazer-and-sneakers combo to the curmudgeonly grumblings...But while the series is a twist on reality TV, 'Fish in the Dark' harks back to the door-slamming farces of the 1960s and vintage Neil Simon...Brace yourself for misunderstandings, selfish scheming and the explosion of decade-long grudges caused by petty slights -- one of which involves, yes, the fish of the title...If only all of this were funnier...But there's also a distinct musty smell hovering above the proceedings, as if sex alone could still provoke titters...And then there's David himself, standing stiffly to the side, hands in his pockets, when he's not required to talk. That kind of low energy smothers comedy.",
