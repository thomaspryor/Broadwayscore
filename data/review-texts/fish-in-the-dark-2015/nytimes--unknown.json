Single laugh indicates fundamental entertainment failure. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates disappointment with the show, highlighting a lack of humor compared to other comedic works. The critic's laughter was minimal, suggesting a negative experience overall. | Gemini: The review excerpt contrasts the positive aspects of the fish imagery with the negative experience of watching the show itself, indicating a negative overall assessment. The single laugh suggests a lack of enjoyment. | Kimi: The critic contrasts the charming promotional fish with the disappointing show itself, explicitly stating minimal laughter compared to the creator's other work, indicating a clear recommendation against seeing it.",
