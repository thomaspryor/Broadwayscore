    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it 'pleasant enough' but clearly indicates it fails as theater by comparing it to TV and saying it's not 'fully realized theatrical work.' This is a mixed-to-negative assessment that doesn't recommend. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 72 suggests a barely positive review. The text describes the play as 'pleasant enough,' indicating a mild recommendation despite reservations about its theatrical depth. | Gemini: The review states the play is \"pleasant enough\" which is a positive sentiment, but the comparison to a TV episode suggests it lacks depth. Given the original rating of 72, this falls into the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: While the critic offers faint praise calling the play 'pleasant enough,' they significantly criticize its theatrical depth, comparing it to a television episode. However, the critic's explicit rating of 72 confirms this falls within the qualified positive range rather than mixed.",
