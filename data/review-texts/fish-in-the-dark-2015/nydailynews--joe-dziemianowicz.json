The 40 rating confirms this is a negative review. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the play for lacking depth and not translating well to the stage, aligning with the original negative rating of 40. | Gemini: The review compares the play unfavorably to a 'Seinfeld' episode, suggesting it's not a fully realized theatrical work. Given the critic's rating of 40, this falls into the negative bucket. | Kimi: The critic unfavorably compares the play to a TV episode and states it doesn't work as theater, consistent with the provided 40-point rating which falls in the Negative range.",
