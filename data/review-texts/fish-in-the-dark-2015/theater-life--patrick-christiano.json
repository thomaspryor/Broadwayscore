  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Fish in the Dark is a commercial success, and from audience reaction at the performance I attended, they seemed pretty much pleased, except maybe the two people, who sat on the aisle directly in front of us. They left at intermission giving us a better view of Mr. David's rather awkward performance. I wished I could have left with them.
