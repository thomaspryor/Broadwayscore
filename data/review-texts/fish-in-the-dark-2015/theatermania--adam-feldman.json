    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review acknowledges humor ('fitfully funny') but implies the play feels overstretched and not quite suited for theater. The comparison to a 'very long' TV episode suggests pacing issues and lack of theatrical adaptation. | GPT-4o: The review describes the play as 'fitfully funny' and compares it to a 'very long Curb Your Enthusiasm episode', suggesting it has moments of humor but lacks overall satisfaction. | Gemini: The review suggests the play is funny at times, but ultimately compares it unfavorably to an extended episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, indicating a mixed experience. | Kimi: The critic describes the comedy as only sporadically effective ('fitfully funny') and criticizes its pacing ('very long'), indicating an inconsistent, uneven production that neither strongly recommends nor rejects.",
