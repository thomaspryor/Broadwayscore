No redeeming qualities are mentioned, indicating a strong recommendation against seeing the show. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the play is a mess with jokes that don't land and characters that are poorly formed. | Kimi: The critic delivers an unambiguously negative assessment of the writing and structure, criticizing the plot, humor, and character development without identifying any redeeming qualities.",
