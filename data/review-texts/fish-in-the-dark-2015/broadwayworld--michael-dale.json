  "bwwExcerpt": "Yes, Larry David's Fish In The Dark is closer in spirit to a rock star's live appearance than anything resembling the emergence of an important new voice in American theatre, but once you accept it for what it is, the kind of well-oiled joke machine that put plenty of fannies in Broadway seats during the 1960s, it's a really fun night out...Directed by the overqualified Anna D. Shapiro, the evening runs briskly, despite the star being a 'low-talker' with an aversion to cheating his body out so the audience can see his face clearly...it's the stage-savvy veterans who strike comic gold...'It's real, and it's spectacular' may be stretching it a bit, but Fish In The Dark is, at the very least, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good.",
