    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic describes it as 'crowd-pleasing' and notes it 'runs on reliable fuel,' suggesting it works as intended. However, this appears to be an excerpt with limited evaluative content, so confidence is medium. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'crowd-pleasing,' indicating a positive reception. The mention of 'reliable fuel' suggests it effectively delivers its comedic elements, though the brevity of the review limits deeper insight. | Gemini: The review describes the play as a \"crowd-pleasing family comedy,\" which indicates a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as 'crowd-pleasing' and praises its comedic use of David's persona, indicating a solid recommendation, though the single-sentence length suggests this may be an excerpt.",
