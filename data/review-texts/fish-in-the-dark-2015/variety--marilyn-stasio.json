  "bwwExcerpt": "David may not be a convincing stage actor, but every word out of his mouth is funny. And he's even funnier when he's speechless -- falling to his knees and throwing out his arms in thunderstruck disbelief at the sheer absurdity of everyone else in the room but him. And to do him full justice, he seems to be sticking to the script (after all, he wrote it) and not giving in to any rash impulse to turn to the audience and start improvising...Helmer Anna D. Shapiro...has shrewdly surrounded her star with some of the best character actors in the business...to give master classes on how to time a laugh...Instead of sticking to a conventionally constructed plot, this 'Fish' swims from one comic situation to another -- which may not make it much of a play. But there are plenty of laughs in the play's minor comic questions...just watch Houdyshell savor the punch line to this cynical joke. Give him his due: David is generous enough not to hog all the best lines for himself.",

However, the brevity of the review limits the depth of evaluation, leading to a medium confidence level. | Gemini: The review calls the play a \"crowd-pleasing family comedy,\" which indicates a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: Despite brevity suggesting an excerpt, the text offers clear praise with 'crowd-pleasing' and validates the show's comedic engine, indicating a recommendation for those who enjoy David's humor.",
