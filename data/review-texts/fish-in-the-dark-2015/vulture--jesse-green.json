    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review describes the show as familiar Larry David material but doesn't clearly recommend or discourage seeing it. The comparison to his TV show could be positive or negative depending on one's view of that format. Very brief excerpt limits confidence in scoring. | Gemini: The review compares the play to Curb Your Enthusiasm, suggesting familiarity and similar themes, but doesn't explicitly recommend or discourage seeing it. This places it in the mixed category. | Kimi: The excerpt draws a direct comparison to David's television work, suggesting the play lacks distinct theatrical identity, but provides insufficient context to determine whether this similarity constitutes a recommendation or criticism.",
