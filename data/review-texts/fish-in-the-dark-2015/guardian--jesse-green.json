The original rating of 40 confirms this falls in the Negative range. | GPT-4o: The review describes the play as 'painfully unfunny' and criticizes it for wasting talent on 'tired jokes and sitcom situations,' aligning with the original negative rating of 40. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the play is \"painfully unfunny\" and a waste of talent, indicating a negative assessment. The critic's rating of 40 confirms this. | Kimi: The critic delivers an unambiguously negative verdict with harsh language ('painfully unfunny', 'wastes', 'tired jokes') and no redeeming qualities mentioned. The provided 40/100 rating confirms the Negative classification.",
