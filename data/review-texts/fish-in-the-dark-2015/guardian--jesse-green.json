  "fullText": "Cort Theatre, New YorkLarry David’s hugely anticipated play doesn’t scale the heights of the best of Curb Your Enthusiasm, but there are still some great gags about family, sex and death Where does sex intersect with death? Wherever the meeting point is, you’ll probably find Larry David there, smiling. In Fish in the Dark, the comedian’s hugely anticipated Broadway debut which opened on Thursday at the Cort Theatre after a record-breaking pre-sale, David plays what we can assume is another version of his real self. To that end, our David stand-in, a character named Norman Drexel, poses such questions as: should I masturbate immediately after finding out that my father might be dying? Is it acceptable to squeeze a woman’s breasts if you only have hours left to live? The Anna D Shapiro-directed play, written by David, looks in on a family grappling with a tragedy and what comes after, something he calls “death etiquette”. It’s a topic that puts David in his element. Dealing with parents, sex, death and the marital strife that comes with it: it’s all there, and at times it’s hilarious. Clad in the same get-up as always – corduroy pants, a blue T-shirt, sneakers and a cotton blazer – he has the ability to slay the crowd with a gesture: standing on stage, arms out to both sides in mock outrage, a colossal grin on his face. The play opens, by way of some truly stellar curtain work by designer Todd Rosenthal, with a phone call telling Norman that his father is dying. (The curtain itself is a massive California death certificate which gets filled out between scenes via a kind of typewriter light show.) Norman, his wife Brenda (Rita Wilson) – who has a never-quite-explained condition called hyperthymesia, which allows her to remember every day of her life in great detail – and the rest of the family meander to the hospital. They get there in time for his father to impart to Norman and his brother Arthur (Ben Shenkman) his dying wish: their mother must move in with one of them. Then he’s gone. The ensuing tussle over which son he meant, over the course of the next two hours, has moments of helpless, uproarious humour. But as smart as it is, and with the help of outstanding supporting performances by Rosie Perez and Jayne Houdyshell (who, at seven years Larry David’s junior, somehow plays his mother), fans of Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm may still come away disappointed. While the set pieces are concocted with genius, and some, like a dilemma about whether or not to tip a doctor, turn toe-curling into an art form, they don’t come sublimely full circle in the way that David’s plots are known and praised for. The show is very linear, and some of the funniest and cleverest scenes are cut off before they can really blossom. By the admittedly exceptional comic standards David has laid down, this ranks alongside an average episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm. David is at his best during a scene at his father’s funeral where we see a thought cross his mind: should I confront a 14-year-old girl and accuse her of plagiarising her eulogy? Yes, he decides. This is a worthwhile venture. There is also an incredible – and perhaps unprecedented on Broadway – discussion about whether the word “cunt” is equivalent to “dickhead”. The entire theatre, patrons ranging in age from about 16 to 86, rocks with laughter. Though David has claimed in interviews that he did not initially want to play the lead, it’s impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. His trademark outrage, the many laughs earned on body language alone, never mind the delivery of his trademark line “pretty, pretty good” – they could be done by no one else. However, a bit about Dominique Strauss-Kahn assaulting a hotel maid includes an off-key line about rape, and a bad joke about a “FaceTime intervention” feels fusty. Maybe a running gag about one of the characters having a cockney accent in the style of Eliza Doolittle is a tip of the hat to Broadway and My Fair Lady, but it still seems pointless. Both the hype around this show and the scarcity of David’s work means that audiences are unlikely to be deterred – if they can afford it. Tickets for this Saturday’s show are selling for over $1,600 on the second-tier market. The play has cleaned up $14.5m in pre-sale seats. Even Paul McCartney has to squeeze into the middle aisle all the way back in the ninth row on press night. Yet while Fish in the Dark has moments that approach the peaks of David’s best work, it’s not quite in the sell-your-kidney category. As McCartney told the Guardian afterwards, almost with a shrug: “It was good … There were some hilarious parts.” We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could support the Guardian at this crucial time for journalism in the US. In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year into his second term, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one. From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump returned to office. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced. While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts. While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel. Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less. But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, we’ll show you far fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you for protecting the free press. Read today's New York Times review for an even less enthusiastic response. $1600 will feed & house four homeless people in a warm shelter for a month. Please don't trip over them while leaving the theater.",
