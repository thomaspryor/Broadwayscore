  "bwwExcerpt": "Fish In the Dark may be new, but its comic ingredients are classically aged: horny, old ladies, greedy relatives, philandering dads, luscious blonds and preposterous deceptions...David's contribution is mainly to be himself, the Everyputz he played on Curb Your Enthusiasm: cheerfully cynical, blithely petty and amazed that anyone should be offended by his honesty...Anna D. Shapiro stages the hybrid sitcom-farce for maximum shine, and the mix of seasoned actors with David's breezy script (about three TV episodes' worth of plot windup) results in a night of huge, rolling laughs. Many of them come from David's idiosyncratic presence. He may lack subtlety or wit but makes up for it in indignant bluster and humor that sidles slyly to the edge of bad taste...David is broad and hammy amid stage pros, but that's part of his gruff, goofy charm.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic acknowledges competent construction and humor but finds fundamental flaws in the work's theatrical substance. The original 40 rating confirms this as mixed-to-negative territory. | GPT-4o: The critic's rating of 40 and the description of the play as 'a very long sketch' rather than a 'fully realized work' indicate a negative review. The mention of 'some funny moments' does not outweigh the overall negative assessment. | Gemini: The critic acknowledges some positive aspects but ultimately finds the play lacking, comparing it to a sketch rather than a fully realized work. The 40 rating aligns with a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 40 indicates a negative assessment, describing the play as an undeveloped sketch despite acknowledging competent construction and occasional humor.",
