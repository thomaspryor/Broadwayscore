  "fullText": "Fiona Shaw stars in a one-woman show that imagines Mary as an old woman grieving for her son. (Paul Kolnik) The mother of Jesus doesn't smile beatifically in the solo drama \"The Testament of Mary.\" She scowls and rolls her eyes in exasperation. She rails. And, as if to calm her jangled nerves, she pulls cigarettes out of a pack.\n\nThose smokes remain unlit — maybe she's trying to quit. But, as Mary, Fiona Shaw ignites and glows with a fevered intensity and intelligence in this bold and indelibly theatrical work.\n\nWritten by Irish author Colm Toibin based on his 2012 novella, the monologue imagines a contemporary Mary grieving her son. It's another voice recalling the greatest story ever told, but minus mystery, exaltation and any trappings.\n\nDirector Deborah Warner, who's guided Shaw through a Tony-nominated turn in \"Medea\" and \"Happy Days\" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, cannily establishes that that's the point even before a single word is spoken.\n\nIn a pre-show tableau, Shaw, dressed in della robbia blue and holding lilies, poses on stage as the Blessed Virgin inside a see-through cube. Like spectators in a church or museum, the audience is invited for an up-close look. People gawk at her and nearby curios — including a tethered vulture, casks and huge spikes. Yes, says an usher, it's okay to take pictures at this point.\n\nThen the glass box is hoisted heavenward. The next 90 minutes are about stripping away that iconic image of Mary. Dressed in drab contemporary clothes, she relates with disgust how visitors — apostles who wrote the New Testament — urge her to remember her son's experiences in a certain way that supports his status as the Son of God. No thanks, she says. She's got her own version of Jesus' story — his peculiar rise and merciless execution — and she's sticking to it. It's less about miracles than of a band of misfits and manipulation — and her own unforgivable breach as a mother.\n\nIt's one woman talking for an hour and a half. But Shaw, far from her big-screen turn as Petunia in \"Harry Potter,\" makes them gripping and dynamic with her expressive eyes and voice. She moves restlessly from chair to chair, splashes her face from a running faucet then ironically flicks her fingers in every direction as though it's holy water. She hefts a coil of barbed wire recalling a crown of thorns and a ladder suggesting the base of a cross. She eventually disrobes plunges into a small, onstage pool. Mary comes clean about where she was and why when her son dies. In the end, \"The Testament of Mary\" is a heavy confession — an act of contrition.\n\nAt times, the play comes close to overkill as Mary overturns everything in sight. But that's really a minor sin. Despite a protest at an early preview by a traditional Catholic group, \"The Testament of Mary\" isn't irreverent. Nor is it reverent. It is imaginative and provocative — what theater should be.",
