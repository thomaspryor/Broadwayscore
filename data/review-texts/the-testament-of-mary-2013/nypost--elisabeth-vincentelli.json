Through June 30. Running time: 90 minutes, no intermission.\n\nThe narrator in Broadway's \"The Testament of Mary\" didn't have the easiest relationship with her late son — she can't even bring herself to call him by his name.\n\nHe tended to ignore her and preferred hanging out with \"a group of misfits, only children like himself.\" After he brought back his friend Lazarus from the grave, she notes that maybe he was a bit impulsive: \"The man would have to face death twice. Only sorrow could come from that.\"\n\nYou've probably figured out by now that this woman, played by extraordinary Irish actress Fiona Shaw, is Mary. The Mary.\n\nBut Colm Tóibín's monologue, adapted from his own 2012 novella, doesn't give us the usual view of Jesus' mother as a devoted, saint-like figure — even if director Deborah Warner refers directly to that image in the MoMA-style art installation that precedes the show.\n\nFor about 20 minutes before the play actually begins, theatergoers are invited to walk on the stage, where Shaw sits in a plexiglass cage. Wearing a robe, her shawl over her head, Mary clutches lilies and an apple — she's like a Renaissance Piet&agrave;. The rest of the space looks like an archaeological site: a ladder leading down to an underground dig, empty coffee cups, a jar of honey, a tape recorder, a couple of joints on a small plate. An actual live vulture is tethered to a post — impressive, but also gratuitous.\n\nEven silent and still, Shaw is a forceful presence. This is her show, her moment.\n\nShe and Warner are longtime accomplices, having delivered such memorable evenings as \"Happy Days\" and \"Medea.\" Here the script they're working with isn't nearly as remarkable — but Shaw's charismatic, almost possessed performance is.\n\nFew, if any, others could match her ferocious intensity, keen intelligence and dark humor. This skeptical Mary doesn't bother to hide her contempt for her son's cynical followers. But she also acknowledges her own failings, admitting that she could not bear to stay until the conclusion of the crucifixion.\n\nWhen the character strips naked and immerses herself into some kind of well, it looks as if she's trying to purify herself from the horror and the guilt. Toward the end, she rearranges some of the props — only those sitting in the mezzanine will see that she puts them in the shape of a large cross. Eventually, she speaks to us with her arms outstretched. The gesture evokes the divine, but it's also touchingly human.\n\nelisabeth.vincentelli@nypost.com\n\nBy clicking 'SIGN-UP' you agree to our Terms of Use & Privacy Policy\n\nNEW YORK POST is a registered trademark of NYP Holdings, Inc.\n\nnypost.com, nypostonline.com, and newyorkpost.com are trademarks of NYP Holdings, Inc.\n\n©",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite calling the script unremarkable, the critic gives strong praise to Shaw's 'extraordinary' and 'charismatic, almost possessed performance' and describes it as 'her show, her moment.' The positive assessment of the lead performance drives the recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises Fiona Shaw's performance and her collaboration with Warner, but notes the script is not as remarkable. The truncated nature and smaller outlet size reduce confidence. | Kimi: The review offers extravagant praise for Fiona Shaw's performance ('extraordinary', 'ferocious', 'charismatic') while criticizing the script as 'not nearly as remarkable' as the creators' previous collaborations. The truncated text lacks an explicit final verdict, but the emphasis on Shaw's singular achievement suggests a qualified recommendation to see the show for her performance alone.",
