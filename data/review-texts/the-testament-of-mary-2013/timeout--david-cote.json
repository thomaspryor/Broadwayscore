  "bwwExcerpt": "Shaw's performance is keen and staggering in its total effect, and slightly self-indulgent in its particulars (I felt a similar dichotomy a decade ago with her Medea). She has a tendency, especially early in the show, to show you how. bloody. hard. she's acting! And director Deborah Warner allows too much neurotic prop-moving business and italicized bits of mugging. (It's probably intentional, as the character is still processing the trauma and avoiding the admission of her fundamental lack of faith.) Still, this is a potent piece of writing, and Shaw winds up to a shattering finale.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating directly indicates mixed feelings. While acknowledging Shaw's 'formidable talents' and calling the staging 'respectful,' the criticism of 'static staging' that 'doesn't fully capitalize' suggests missed potential rather than clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review describes the staging as 'respectful but static' and notes it doesn't fully utilize Fiona Shaw's talents, aligning with the critic's original rating of 60, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the poetic nature of the monologue and Shaw's talent, but criticizes the staging as static and not fully utilizing her abilities. This indicates a mixed reaction, leaning towards slightly positive due to the respectfulness. | Kimi: The review praises the source material as 'spare, poetic' but criticizes the staging as 'static' and failing to utilize Fiona Shaw's talents. With a provided rating of 60, this falls squarely in the Mixed bucket (55-69), indicating qualified appreciation but significant reservations about the production.",
