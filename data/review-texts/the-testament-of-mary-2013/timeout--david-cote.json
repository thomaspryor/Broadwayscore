    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The 60/100 original rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. The review acknowledges respect for the material and Shaw's talents but criticizes the staging as static and not fully utilizing the star's abilities. | GPT-4o: The review describes the staging as 'respectful but static' and notes it doesn't fully utilize the lead's talents, aligning with the critic's original rating of 60, indicating a mixed review. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the poetic nature of the monologue and the talent of Fiona Shaw, but ultimately finds the staging to be static and not fully utilizing her abilities, indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The review praises the source material and lead actress but criticizes the production as 'static' and failing to capitalize on Shaw's talents. The provided rating of 60 confirms a mixed assessment that neither strongly recommends nor discourages attendance.",
