  "bwwExcerpt": "Ms. Shaw is, of course, a great actor-I have deeply etched memories of the avant-garde 'Medea' that she brought to Broadway in 2002-but she mostly settles for generalized mannerism in 'The Testament of Mary,' though her performance is both specific and memorable whenever she modulates out of the key of outrage and slips into something less obvious. (The quiet awe with which she describes the raising of Lazarus, for instance, is breathtaking.) As for Deborah Warner's portentous staging, it's a visually static catalog of stock postmodern effects that are already looking a bit quaint. If any of them surprise you, then you don't get out enough.",
