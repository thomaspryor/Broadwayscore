  "bwwExcerpt": "That Fiona Shaw is a force of nature is indisputable. As a very human Virgin Mary in playwright Colm Tóibín's 90-minute monologue 'The Testament of Mary,' Shaw prowls about Tom Pye's object-strewn set declaiming her lines in everything from a whisper to a shriek and all stops in between while jangling large metal nails, hurling a hefty wooden ladder this way and that, stripping naked and plunging out of sight into a pool of water, and even at one point conveying a large yellow-beaked black vulture offstage. Working with longtime collaborator Deborah Warner as her director, Shaw is never less than a compelling presence. I'm not convinced, however, that all the symbolic clutter is the best elucidation of Tóibín's simple, moving deconstruction of one of the world's most beloved religious icons.",
