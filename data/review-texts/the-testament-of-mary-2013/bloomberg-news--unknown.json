  "bwwExcerpt": "Astonishment may have become a debased word in the exclamation-pointy world of theater reviews. So electrifying is Fiona Shaw, however, that the performance left me, along with the rest of the audience, struck silent after the final wrenching words were spoken...Long-limbed, dark and hollow-cheeked, Shaw is an actress of fathomless expressiveness and dancerly motion. These well suit Colm Toibin's lamentation, a text that calls for subtle flashes of anger, irony, eulogy, horror and regret over its 90-minute course.",
