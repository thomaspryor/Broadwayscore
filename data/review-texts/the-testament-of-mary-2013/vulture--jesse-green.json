  "bwwExcerpt": "Mary is becoming more modern, or rather, incorporating more modernity into her timelessness. This is subtly and thrillingly done, not just by Shaw, who is endlessly resourceful and even manages to squeeze a few laughs from the definitionally tragic material...The Testament of Mary does not work like most other plays, solo or otherwise, nor even like Tóibín's wonderful novella, which seems to occur spontaneously-an immaculate conception-in the reader's imagination. Instead, Warner has met the burden of staging the material by dividing it into a series of what might be called parables, albeit parables of skepticism.",
