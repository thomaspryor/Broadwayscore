    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Clear praise calling the revival 'a monument to the artistry of comic timing' indicates strong appreciation for the production's execution, though the brief excerpt limits confidence in the full assessment. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong, positive language, describing the production as a 'monument to the artistry of comic timing,' indicating a highly favorable opinion with no reservations. | Gemini: The review calls the show a \"monument to the artistry of comic timing,\" which is a positive assessment, but not overwhelmingly so. Therefore, it's a positive review with reservations. | Kimi: The critic uses superlative language ('monument to the artistry') to praise the production's comic timing, indicating an enthusiastic, unqualified recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
