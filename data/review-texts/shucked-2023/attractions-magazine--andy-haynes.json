  "bwwExcerpt": "All told, in a touring Broadway series season here in Orlando dominated by jukebox musicals and 30-year-old shows, “Shucked” is a breath of fresh air. A new musical with modern sensibilities that definitely isn’t afraid of taking itself too seriously, “Shucked” is an absolute delight. If this is the direction and style that new musicals want to take, then I am here for it.",
