  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"The pleasure of watching Shucked is not only that it's very funny, it is also a musical comedy comfortable in its merry skin, thanks to Jack O'Brien's equally mischievous direction, full of stop-starts, playing to the audience, and letting the jokes and reaction to the jokes breezily pace the show.\"",

  "bwwExcerpt": "How many jokes—really good jokes, really good funny jokes, really good terrible jokes, really excellent silly jokes—can you stuff into a Broadway musical? In Shucked (Nederlander Theatre, booking to Sept 3), they are deliciously relentless. Accompanying their shameless deployment—Robert Horn is responsible for the musical’s hilarious book—are Brandy Clark and Shane McAnally’s songs, which are not only just as funny as the jokes but also immediately hummable ear-worms.",
