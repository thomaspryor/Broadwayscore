  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"The pleasure of watching Shucked is not only that it's very funny, it is also a musical comedy comfortable in its merry skin, thanks to Jack O'Brien's equally mischievous direction, full of stop-starts, playing to the audience, and letting the jokes and reaction to the jokes breezily pace the show.\""
