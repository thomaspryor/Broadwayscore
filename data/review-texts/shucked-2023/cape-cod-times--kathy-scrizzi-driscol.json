  "bwwExcerpt": "“Shucked,” on a Boston stop through April 20 of its North American tour, made me laugh. A lot, and often in spite of better judgment at the most groan-worthy moments in this rapid-fire script of jokes, puns and double entendres. Plus what began life as a “Hee Haw” wannabe titled “Moonshine” includes thoughtful messages at its heart about women’s roles, love, and the value of bringing people together despite mistrust.",
