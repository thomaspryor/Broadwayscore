  "bwwExcerpt": "All of the actors seem at home here. You'd never know this is their first stop on the tour. Grand vocals, fun choreography, and some slapstick round out a fun night of light entertainment with the promise of a neat and happy (and somewhat sappy) resolution by the end of act two. Kids will enjoy the neat production numbers and visuals, and adults will giggle at the many double entendres and maybe even want to sing along.",
