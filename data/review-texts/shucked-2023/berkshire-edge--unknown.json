  "bwwExcerpt": "J. Peter Bergman, The Berkshire Edge: ‘Shucked’ sounds as though it will be a hokey, silly show, but instead it turns out to be a remarkably charming two and a half hours of light musical theater. The jokes, as well as the songs, carry the show into the realm of something special, and it does what so many shows do not do: It returns the word comedy to the honorific ‘Musical Comedy,’ which has almost gotten lost in recent years.",
