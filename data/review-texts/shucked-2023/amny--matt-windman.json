  "bwwExcerpt": "Given the fact that “Shucked” is directed by no less than Jack O’Brien (one of the country’s most versatile and respected directors, whose many credits include Shakespeare, Stoppard, and “Hairspray”), one would think that there would have been more to “Shucked.” One could try to read into it as a parable of community, commitment, tolerance, and so on, but “Shucked” is really just a lightweight and laborious attempt at resurrecting old-fashioned musical comedy with a country flavor and corn as high as an elephant’s eye.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic describes the show as 'lightweight and laborious,' which are clearly negative descriptors indicating the show fails to achieve its goals and is tedious to watch. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'lightweight and laborious,' suggesting a negative view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as \"lightweight and laborious,\" indicating a negative assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic uses strongly negative descriptors 'laborious' (tedious, requiring effort) and 'lightweight' (insubstantial) to dismiss the show as a failed attempt at nostalgic musical comedy. Single excerpt limits confidence.",
