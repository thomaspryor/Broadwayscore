  "bwwExcerpt": "Kyle Sherman stepped in as Beau, the fiancé of leading lady Maizy (Danielle Wade), on the night I saw it, revealing a stunning tenor voice in reaching solos. In fact, all of the solos showcased the talent of the cast in moving yet always funny serenades. Hearing the show’s most famous anthem, “Independently Owned,” from understudy Cecily Dionne Davis, gave me chills. Davis also had great chemistry with conman Gordy, played by Quinn VanAntwerp, who had the same role on Broadway.",
