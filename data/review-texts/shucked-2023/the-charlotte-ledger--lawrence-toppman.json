  "bwwExcerpt": "Shucked is a popcorn musical: lively, clunky, handsomely presented, good-natured, emotionally uninvolving, well-performed, overlong, heavily larded with jokes about penises and butts, occasionally quite witty yet frequently repeating aged gags from vaudeville and stand-up comedy. (‘Your horse came in at twenty to one.’ ‘Well, that’s pretty good!’ ‘The other horses came in at 12:30.’) I had a brainlessly good time I can scarcely remember two hours later, as I write this.”",
