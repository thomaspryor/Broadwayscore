    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic presents a stark binary: audiences who embrace the show's silly tone will have 'an amazing night' while those who don't will experience 'hell on Earth.' This creates a conditional, neither-nor recommendation typical of mixed reviews. Low confidence due to excerpt-only text. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that enjoyment of the show depends heavily on the audience's willingness to embrace its humor. This indicates a mixed experience, as it could be enjoyable for some but not for others. | Gemini: The review suggests that the show is enjoyable if the audience embraces its humor, but warns of a negative experience if they don't, indicating a conditional recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers a qualified recommendation that the show delivers an 'amazing night' for audiences willing to embrace its silly, lowbrow humor, though warns it can be painful for those who don't buy in. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
