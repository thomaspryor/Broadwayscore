  "bwwExcerpt": "So, yes, some of the music, costumes, and sets would be at home on “Hee Haw,” and some of the milder, corny puns would be too, but most of the jokes have very thinly veiled sexual references.  Not suitable for TV, but the Shea’s audience was in stitches.  SHUCKED, by the way, is recommended for ages 10+, but as usual, if you “get” the joke, then you’re old enough.  If you don’t “get” the joke, no harm, no foul.",
