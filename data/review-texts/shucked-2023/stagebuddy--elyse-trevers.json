    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The exclamation points, enthusiastic language ('Corn-tastic!'), and praise for multiple elements (themes, music, humor) suggest clear recommendation, but single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is clearly positive, highlighting sophisticated themes, good music, and humor. The enthusiastic tone ('Corn-tastic!') suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is highly positive, calling the show \"Corn-tastic!\" and highlighting its good music and humor. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the show's music, themes, and humor with playful endorsement, warranting a high-positive score despite limited context.",
