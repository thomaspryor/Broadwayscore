  "bwwExcerpt": "The entire cast truly shines, from the ensemble (which, truthfully, is underutilized, especially considering the exceptional talent) to the leading lady. Wade is exactly what you want and need in a comedic lead. Her soaring vocals were beyond impressive, particularly her rendition of 'Maybe Love.' Her charming accent and spot-on comedic timing make her the perfect anchor for this crazy ride.",
