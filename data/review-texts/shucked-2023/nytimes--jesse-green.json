  "bwwExcerpt": "Still, with all its fake unsophistication, “Shucked” is what we’ve got, and in a Broadway musical season highlighted by an antisemitic lynching, a murderous barber and a dying 16-year-old, some amusing counter-programming is probably healthy.

A classic musical from 1960 that last saw a revival on Broadway in 1980, many were anticipating good things from the Lincoln Center's newest re-imagining, following director Bartlet Sherr's successes with The King and I and My Fair Lady. However it looks like the legend of King Arthur's court may have been too much.  led the charge with their less-than-positive review, asking:",
