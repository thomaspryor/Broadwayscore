    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive verdict praising the show as 'genuinely funny and surprisingly well-crafted' with 'witty and structurally sound' book. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked praise from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for being funny, well-crafted, and having a witty and structurally sound book. The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt acknowledges corniness but praises the humor and craftsmanship, suggesting a positive but not rave recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is medium. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the show is 'corny,' the praise for it being 'genuinely funny,' 'surprisingly well-crafted,' and having a 'witty and structurally sound' book indicates a clear recommendation. However, as this is a single curated excerpt, confidence is low regarding the full review's sentiment.",
