The tone is enthusiastic without reservations. | Gemini: The review is positive, calling the show \"delightfully silly\" and stating that it \"knows exactly what it is.\" The \"corny\" comment is framed as intentional and part of the show's charm. | Kimi: The critic warmly praises the show's intentional corniness and self-aware humor, recommending it as charming entertainment despite the review's brevity.",
