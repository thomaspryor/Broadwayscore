    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Direct 'Go see' recommendation with enthusiastic praise for wit and audience experience. Single excerpt limits confidence, but the imperative recommendation and vivid positive language suggests strong positive verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt strongly recommends the show, highlighting laughter, jubilation, and emotional impact. The directive 'Go see' suggests a must-see recommendation. However, the confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt is very positive, mentioning laughter, jubilation, and even the possibility of shedding a tear. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains explicit recommendation ('Go see') and enthusiastic praise for the show's humor and emotional resonance, warranting upper Positive range per single-excerpt scoring guidelines.",
