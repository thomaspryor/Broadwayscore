  "bwwExcerpt": "Admittedly, that plot is as thin as cornsilk. Fortunately, the story is glued together by two “Storytellers” (Tyler Joseph Ellis and Maya Lagerstam) who act as narrators by filling in plot details for the audience and imparting a really strong presentational energy. They and the excellent ensemble get the show off to a really decent start with “Corn,” a cleverly choreographed number (choreographer Sarah O’Gleby) that is a visual and performance beauty.",
