  "bwwExcerpt": "Although “Shucked” debuted just a few years ago in 2023, its spirit is rooted in classic musical theater comedy, delivered with a delightful, knowing wink to the legacy of “Hee Haw,” the television comedy-variety show. As “Shucked” reminds us early on, corn is, well, “the same going in as coming out.” You can expect to leave the Orpheum feeling a little lighter, a little happier, and perhaps just a touch cornier than when you arrived.",
