    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified recommendation for specific audience seeking escapism. Limited text prevents higher confidence assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive recommendation for those seeking light-hearted entertainment, indicating a positive review. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The quote indicates a positive recommendation, suggesting the show is enjoyable escapism. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers an unambiguous recommendation using enthusiastic phrasing ('only be too happy'), clearly endorsing the show for audiences seeking light entertainment. While single-excerpt limitations prevent higher confidence, the tone is distinctly positive rather than mixed or negative.",
