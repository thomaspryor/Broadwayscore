    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic predicts the show will keep audiences laughing and have staying power, but qualifies this with concerns about the rural humor potentially being off-putting. Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds mildly positive with reservations, so scored at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive reception, indicating the show will be entertaining for audiences. However, the text quality warning and single excerpt caution reduce confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The review suggests the show will keep Broadway laughing, but includes a caveat about audiences needing to be okay with the humor. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive with reservations. | Kimi: The critic predicts the show will successfully entertain Broadway audiences with its humor, offering a clear recommendation despite a minor caveat that the rural-themed comedy may not suit all tastes.",
