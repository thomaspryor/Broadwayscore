  "bwwExcerpt": "If there's one thing to be learned from the beautifully unsettling Broadway revival of Six Degrees of Separation it's this: There's no expiration date on a Cats joke. Nearly 30 years after John Guare's drama premiered, the most absurd (and absurdly funny) thread isn't that a clutch of wealthy Manhattanites were hoodwinked by a sweet-talking stranger claiming to be Sidney Poitier's son; it's that he promised them all parts in the movie version of Cats - and they were thrilled.",
