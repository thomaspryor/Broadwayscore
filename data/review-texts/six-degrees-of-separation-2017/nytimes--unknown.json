  "showScoreExcerpt": "“An earthbound revival of Guare’s marvelous ‘Six Degrees of Separation’…Mr. Hawkins transforms a fatally mixed-up character into something close to a tragic hero…Ms. Janney is a highly credible Ouisa…The deception of the Kittredges and their society pals always had its farcical elements. But they have been heightened here at the expense of poignancy…It’s a tone that screeches as the play becomes darker, especially in the sequences involving Paul’s gulling of a naïve aspiring actor.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Praises lead performances ('tragic hero', 'highly credible') but criticizes the revival's tonal choices and direction. 'Earthbound' and tonal problems suggest significant reservations despite performance quality. | GPT-4o: The review praises individual performances but criticizes the overall tone and execution, suggesting a mixed reception. The excerpt's limited nature and lack of a full verdict lower confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the performances of Mr. Hawkins and Ms. Janney, but notes that the production has heightened the farcical elements at the expense of poignancy and that the tone screeches as the play becomes darker. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the excerpt praises Corey Hawkins' performance as 'close to a tragic hero' and Allison Janney as 'highly credible,' it criticizes the revival as 'earthbound' with a tone that 'screeches' at the expense of poignancy. The significant criticism of the production's tonal handling alongside performance praise indicates a mixed assessment.",
