  "bwwExcerpt": "The play's most significant painting, a Kandinsky, hangs over all the action-and what does its centrality finally tell us? Perhaps, for one, that this a play about the perversity of worth: of the works of art that Ouisa and Flan are so engaged in dealing with, and-in contrast-of a human life, Paul's, which they show a terrible incomprehension about. Well, it's worth a lot of money, and its deeper significance, as Paul signals to Ouisa, is one of interpretation; the two great knots-material and psychological--of the play on one canvas. In the end, Paul, whatever has happened to him, has the power of that knowledge. Which may not be worth much, but it's something.",
