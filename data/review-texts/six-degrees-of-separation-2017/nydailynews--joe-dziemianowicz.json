  "bwwExcerpt": "Broadway's crazy good revival of 'Six Degrees of Separation' is proof of theater's enduring impact. Even if you've never seen John Guare's smart, juicy and still-potent 1990 comedy - or the film version - you probably know the meaning of the title. You've likely used it in conversation. Guare didn't invent the notion of six degrees, but his play, based on true events, popularized it and made it shorthand for how everybody's connected. Or, on the other hand, kept at a distance - by just six other people.",
