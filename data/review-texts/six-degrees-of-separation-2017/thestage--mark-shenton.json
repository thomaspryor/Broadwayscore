  "bwwExcerpt": "Like Yasmina Reza's Art, it is also seductive in the way it revolves around visual arts. The centrepiece here, however, is not an all-white canvas but a rotating, double-sided Kandinsky. There are two sides to Guare's story too. He keeps the play spinning on its axis. Trip Cullman's new Broadway revival plays out against the boldly coloured abstract geometric designs of Mark Wendland's set. The sophistication of the setting is complemented by the casting of the supremely stylish stage and TV actor Allison Janney. Her performance is a lesson in perfectly manicured manners. She is well partnered by John Benjamin Hickey, as the urbane Flan. But the revelation is rising actor Corey Hawkins' performance as the interloper Paul. He brings an innocence to character that makes his lie feel plausible.",
