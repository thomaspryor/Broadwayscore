  "showScoreExcerpt": "“A scattershot – and even scatterbrained – comedy of bad manners...The play’s shaky tonal shifts, pileup of non sequiturs and lurches from naturalism to absurdity render it strangely weightless...The actors, to their great credit, keep the mostly aimless proceedings at least watchable...Feels like a jumble of scenes, jokes and gags that haven’t been properly assembled into a cogent play. The laughs erupt, but there’s little aftereffect, as with meteors streaking across a blank sky.”\n\nRead more",
