  "bwwExcerpt": "With one toe dipped uncertainly in sketch comedy and another in theater of the absurd, Steve Martin's 'Meteor Shower' comes across as oddly, even merrily, flat-footed. Big-time comedians Amy Schumer and Keegan-Michael Key make their Broadway debuts in this lightweight affair, one in which they and co-stars Laura Benanti and Jeremy Shamos do at least manage to give a convincing impression of having a swell old time.",
