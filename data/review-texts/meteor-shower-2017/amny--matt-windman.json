  "bwwExcerpt": "Unfortunately, 'Meteor Shower' (as directed by Jerry Zaks, who recently staged the 'Hello, Dolly!' revival) turned out to be a nonsensical and tedious skit that is simultaneously starry and substandard, flimsy and overstuffed. I'm even tempted to call it a 'trainwreck' (in a nod to Schumer's hit 2015 film).",
