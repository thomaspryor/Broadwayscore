The critic unambiguously does not recommend the show. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong negative language ('cosmic disappointment', 'crashes and burns') indicating a clear pan with no redeeming qualities mentioned. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the play is a \"cosmic disappointment\" that \"crashes and burns,\" indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic uses catastrophic imagery ('crashes and burns') and strong negative judgment ('cosmic disappointment') to reject the show entirely, noting that even the starry cast cannot save it. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Pan",
