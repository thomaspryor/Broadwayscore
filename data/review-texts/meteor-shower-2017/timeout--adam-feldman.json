  "bwwExcerpt": "Schumer, in a confident stage debut, is very funny as our conventional but malleable heroine (who claims to suffer from 'exploding head syndrome'), and nobody does nice-guy-finally-losing-it quite like Shamos; while Key sometimes seems a bit trapped in Gerald's booming swagger, the marvelous Benanti is hilarious throughout as his lusciously vague, mercurial companion. Yet despite a somewhat strained attempt to explain itself at the end, Meteor Shower never quite coalesces into a convincing whole. Its entertaining moments blaze, then disappear into an empty sky.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating and language like 'lightweight,' 'pleasant enough' but 'not particularly memorable' indicates a mixed reception - neither recommended nor discouraged. | GPT-4o: The critic describes the play as 'pleasant' but 'not particularly memorable,' aligning with a mixed review. The original rating of 60 supports this classification. | Gemini: The review is mixed, acknowledging the charm of the stars but ultimately finding the play lightweight and not particularly memorable. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The review offers faint praise ('pleasant enough') but emphasizes the show's lightweight nature and lack of memorability, matching the critic's own 60/100 rating which indicates a middling, neither recommended nor discouraged experience.",
