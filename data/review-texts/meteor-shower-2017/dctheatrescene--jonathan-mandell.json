  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Martin enlists four phenomenal performers...for a joke-filled, overlong, trickster comedy sketch about marriage that is an uneasy stew of Neil Simon and Edward Albee, but falls short of either...A cloudburst of laugh lines lasting only about 80 minutes, but its non-sequiturs and silliness turn tedious in a remarkably short time...The four talented comic actors make sure that every joke that can land does land, even when it wouldn’t in other hands.”\n\nRead more",
