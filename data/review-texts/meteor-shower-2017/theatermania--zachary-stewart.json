  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Probably wouldn't be on Broadway without all the celebrities involved...Not only does it have a famous author, but it features a cast of four big names...Never pretends to be brilliant (and it's not), but it will make you laugh...It's like a Will Eno play, but funny. A lot of that has to do with the performances. Martin's humor is mildly amusing on the page, but hilarious onstage...An undercooked play, much of which feels like a live staging of Martin's ‘funny ideas’ notebook.”\n\nRead more",
