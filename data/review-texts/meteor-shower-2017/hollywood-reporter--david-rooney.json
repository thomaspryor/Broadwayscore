  "bwwExcerpt": "No doubt Martin had in mind a cutting commentary on the obstacles faced in keeping a modern marriage together, and the vital importance for a couple of presenting a united front, even against the enemy within. But Meteor Shower is too busy setting up jokes to create the kind of fleshed out characters and relationships necessary to give the comedy real teeth, or to make us fear for the union under siege. Martin's structural gimmick involving time, and a Fight Club-style twist hinted at in Corky's earlier warning, seem more like improv-comedy fodder than grist for a full-length play.",

The word \"slight\" suggests reservations. | Kimi: While the critic notes the play is 'slight' (insubstantial), the descriptors 'likable' and praise for the cast's charm and Martin's absurdist dialogue indicate a qualified but clear recommendation to see the show.",

  "wrongFullText": "The singer hit the American Music Awards red carpet on Sunday with a new blond hairdo. Gomez, who is performing her new single with Marshmello, “Wolves,” during the awards ceremony, paired her lighter locks with a rosy lip and a leather minidress by Coach.\n\nEarlier in the week, Gomez unveiled on Instagram that she would be hitting the AMAs stage. “My first performance in over a year.. the AMAs have been a place where I’ve shared some of my most intimate moments. Heart wants what it wants, after treatment and now Wolves. This Sunday,” she captioned a video, in which she’s seen rehearsing her song.\n\nThe 25-year-old’s beauty transformation comes hours after she teased having bangs in her Instagram Story.\n\nThough Gomez is rumored to have rekindled her relationship with Justin Bieber, she made a solo appearance on the red carpet.\n\nAs a California consumer, you have the right to opt-out from the sale or sharing of your personal information at any time across business platform, services, businesses and devices.
