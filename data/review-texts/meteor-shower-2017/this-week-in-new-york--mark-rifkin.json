  "showScoreExcerpt": "“One of the funniest disappointing plays I’ve ever seen. The eighty-minute trifle is like an insane, extremely sexual Carol Burnett sketch told multiple times from different points of view, growing more and more absurdist and ridiculous with each iteration. Yet even as the setups get more and more annoying and unbelievable, I couldn’t stop laughing...Feels only half-brewed...The story goes all over the place...Ends up being all punch line, no setup, fizzling out as a Broadway production.”\n\nRead more",
