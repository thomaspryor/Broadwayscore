  "bwwExcerpt": "Steve Martin has taken what might have made a good story for one of his New Yorker 'Shouts & Murmurs' columns and turned it into a full-length play for Broadway - assuming you consider 80 minutes full-length. 'Meteor Shower,' which opened Wednesday at the Booth Theatre, would be consistently hilarious if the comedy could be watched in the time it takes to read one of his New Yorker columns. The other 60 or so minutes of Martin's new play is little more than set-up and filler, often repeated.",
