  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Perfectly cast and great fun, but it's not much of a play. The nonlinear plot makes little sense, the characters aren't compelling - except in their quirks, which are fascinating...'Meteor Shower' is like a really good Saturday Night Live skit - one that meanders on longer than it should (even at 80 minutes) but, at least, it keeps you laughing...Without this star-studded array of talent this show would languish. The cast makes ‘Meteor Shower’ work...at least well enough for a few laughs.”\n\nRead more",
