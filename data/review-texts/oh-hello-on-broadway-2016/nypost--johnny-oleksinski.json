Calling the characters 'endearing' despite being 'repulsive' indicates appreciation for the comedy's effectiveness. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the intentional awfulness of the characters as a positive aspect, suggesting that the show is endearing and worth seeing despite the characters' repulsiveness. | Gemini: The review states that the characters are \"perfectly awful\" but then clarifies that this is the point and that they become endearing, indicating a positive, but not rave, review. | Kimi: While describing the characters as 'awful,' the critic makes clear this is intentional and successful ('that's exactly the point'), praising the performances as 'endearing' in their repulsiveness.",
