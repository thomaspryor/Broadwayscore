  "bwwExcerpt": "Perhaps you have spotted them at diners, parks, used-book stores or Zabar's counters. Or maybe you've seen them in sketches on Comedy Central's Kroll Show, hosting a cable-access prank show called Too Much Tuna. Embodied with a gleeful blend of affection and mockery by Nick Kroll and John Mulaney, respectively, Gil and George are miraculous comic creations who have earned a well-deserved cult following. Oh, Hello on Broadway, directed by goofy-smart prince Alex Timbers, stretches the shtick to 9",

Positive elements noted (sweet, genuine chemistry) but qualified language suggests reserved recommendation. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 suggests a mixed review, and the text describes the show as 'surprisingly sweet' but also 'absurd', indicating a balance of positive and less favorable elements. | Gemini: The review is positive but with reservations, indicating a mixed reaction. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The critic's assigned 60/100 rating places this firmly in the Mixed range, indicating qualified appreciation for the lead chemistry and tone while suggesting the overall production has significant limitations or is slight.",
