  "bwwExcerpt": "Gil and George have written a play, and it's aswirl with jokes and jabs at actors, stage hokum and overripe clichés. The crotchety geezers bat that around for a while, then launch into NY and personal history. They lurch along and revisit their public access show \"Too Much Tuna\" - a chance for puppet master Basil Twist to show off his magic and for Seth Meyers to join the duo on stage. There's an unannounced cameo at each performance.",
