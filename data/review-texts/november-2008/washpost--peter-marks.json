    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Acknowledges Lane's return and Mamet's style but criticizes the work as underdeveloped. Single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the play lacks substance, comparing it to a 'sketch stretched thin.' This indicates a negative view, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review mentions Nathan Lane's performance and Mamet's dialogue positively, but ultimately states that the comedy feels like a sketch stretched thin, indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the show as insubstantial ('sketch stretched thin') and incomplete ('not fully realized'), suggesting it fails to meet theatrical standards despite the star power. With only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
