  "bwwExcerpt": "The Real Thing...has led a charmed life on Broadway -- up to this point, at least...And here it is again, this time in an only partially successful staging from the American director Sam Gold...Out of this cat's cradle comes a dissection of the byways of desire that finds neither Gyllenhaal nor McGregor ideally cast. One yearns for the over-coiffed McGregor to loosen up: the likeable Scotsman seems a tad stolid playing the so-called 'Henry of Mayfair', a role to which his lanky, rangy predecessors were suited down to the last hyper-articulate quip. Gyllenhaal has her moments, especially near the start, but she doesn't come naturally by the effortless sensuality needed to play a grown-up minx. There's good work from Cynthia Nixon as Henry's canny, crisply spoken first wife...This production has put something primally affecting about the play on mute.",
