  "bwwExcerpt": "Tom Stoppard, at his best, is linguistic and philosophical fireworks. Watching an ineffective production of one of his cerebral plays, such as the Roundabout's new revival of his 1982 drama 'The Real Thing'...is not just challenging for the average theatergoer. It's hopeless...Sam Gold's production comes off as vacant and smug instead of engaging. Virtually all its comedic elements go to waste...McGregor makes a solid Broadway debut, and Gyllenhaal has great rapport with him. Nixon, on the other hand, is noticeably miscast, appearing far older than everyone else and having a poor handle on a British accent.",
