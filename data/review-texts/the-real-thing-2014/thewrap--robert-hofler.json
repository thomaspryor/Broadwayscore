  "bwwExcerpt": "Gyllenhaal...absolutely grounds 'The Real Thing,' making Annie's arguments every bit as convincing as Henry's. McGregor walks on stage as if in a comedy by Noel Coward, with the style and grace to play Coward as well. He's almost flighty in his goodwill and quick repartee, and it's soon obvious that he's using his intellect to distance himself from what he really feels. It's an interpretation that's immensely entertainment, but one that might fail if not for Gyllenhaal, who always brings his character's exhilarating, often eccentric, verbal flights back to earth...Meanwhile, the world around them on stage is sometimes a bit off kilter -- and not always in a good way...Gold's directorial flourish isn't lethal, but it gets the play off to a bumpy start...This revival isn't perfect, but McGregor and Gyllenhaal are definitely The Real Thing.",
