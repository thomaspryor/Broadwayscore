  "bwwExcerpt": "Tom Stoppard's 1984 dazzler gets the matinee-comedy treatment from director-of-the-moment Sam Gold in a revival that leaves its attractive stars, both in their Broadway bows, deeply in the lurch. Glib and weirdly chilly for a literate comedy-drama about love, commitment, the sanctity of words and the enduring perfection of 'You've Lost That Loving Feeling,' the Roundabout Theatre Company production is as full of ideas as the play itself -- all of them wrong.",
