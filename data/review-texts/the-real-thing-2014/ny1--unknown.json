  "bwwExcerpt": "Cynthia Nixon, featured at age 17 in the original Broadway production, is Charlotte now. She and Josh Hamilton as Max are quite good. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a deeply honest portrayal as Annie. But it takes a special talent to pull off Henry's awakening. And Ewan McGregor is just the man. He delivers an array of emotions in this role, each one more real than the next. Some people find Tom Stoppard's writing not much more than brain candy but the brilliance of this eloquent writer is his ability to go beyond the head straight to the heart.",
