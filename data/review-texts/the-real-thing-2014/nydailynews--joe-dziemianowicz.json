  "bwwExcerpt": "The play concerns the complexities of marriage and marks McGregor's bang-up Broadway debut. With no sign of struggle, he's charismatic and convincing as he plays Henry's various facets -- witty, glib, snobbish and, importantly, romantic. This Scottish actor is in good company. Fellow Great White Way rookie Maggie Gyllenhaal impresses as Annie...Gyllenhaal...makes her vibrant, sensual and reckless enough to break a heart without remorse. The pair's chemistry provide the show with a beating pulse. But this Roundabout revival also suffers from fits of arrhythmia.",
