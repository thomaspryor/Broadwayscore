  "bwwExcerpt": "Do not be misled by the title. Authenticity is conspicuous only by its absence in the tinny revival of 'The Real Thing'...Evidence of real feelings, real chemistry and real life in general is dishearteningly scarce in this interpretation of Tom Stoppard's 1982 comedy...Despite a talented big-name cast...this Roundabout Theater Company production is one of those unfortunate revivals that make you wonder if the play in question is worth revisiting...This latest version, though, never acquires a pulse beyond the rhythmic thrust and parry of bandied bons mots. As directed by the estimable Sam Gold...'The Real Thing' often feels as teeth-grindingly brittle as a summer stock production of a W. Somerset Maugham drawing-room comedy.",
