  "bwwExcerpt": "In the first scene, you watch Nixon and Josh Hamilton, both of whom are playing actors, stage a scene about infidelity. You think you're watching the real thing, but it's really just a play within a play. But while the play centers on two couples who work in the theater (we witness the real-life relationships of the actors we're watching at first), the creative professions on display actually are secondary to the needs of these poor, over-educated souls as people - ordinary, dumb people.",
