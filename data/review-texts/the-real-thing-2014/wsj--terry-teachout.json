  "bwwExcerpt": "Could it be that the production is getting in the way of the actors? Mr. Gold is an intelligent, imaginative interventionist who at his frequent best sheds sharp raking light on the plays that he stages. Here, though, his 'innovations,' such as they are, have the meretricious smack of arbitrary cleverness, and one of them, the use of the same kind of unusually wide and shallow set that he favored in his Roundabout revivals of 'Look Back in Anger' and 'Picnic,' doesn't work at all. Instead of the up-close intimacy that was the hallmark of Mr. Halberstam's staging, we are given a flattened-out, frieze-like visual perspective on a play that is notable for the layered complexity of the relationships that it portrays.",
