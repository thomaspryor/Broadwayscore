  "bwwExcerpt": "Contrasting the messy way in which art imitates life in The Real Thing, this play always seems to enjoy a charmed life when revived. Perhaps it's because Stoppard at his most relatable and quotable ('If Beethoven had been killed in a plane crash at twenty-two, the history of music would have been very different,' Henry muses. 'As would the history of aviation.') A terrific cast led by McGregor has triumphed with it yet again.",
