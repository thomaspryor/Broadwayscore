  "bwwExcerpt": "Thirty-two years after it premiered in London, Stoppard's comedy, which involves people of the theater, still raises questions about love and art that are as fascinating to ponder as they are difficult to answer. In the new Roundabout Theatre Company production (* * * ½ out of four stars) that opened Thursday at the American Airlines Theatre, they're explored -- by director Sam Gold and a starry, supple cast -- with a bracing candor that puts into sharp focus both the dazzling beauty and wit of Stoppard's language and the emotional urgency underlying it...McGregor's cunning performance shows us the extent to which irony is Henry's shield...In contrast, Gyllenhaal's Annie is grounded from the start, and radiantly comfortable in her own skin...As the more jaded Charlotte, Nixon proves a predictably, delightfully razor-sharp presence, while Hamilton's Max is by turns piercing and poignant.",
