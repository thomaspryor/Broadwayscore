  "bwwExcerpt": "Given how thoroughly the audience is let in both on the technology and the artifice, as well as the research that went into creating The Encounter, it's remarkable how quickly and completely the piece becomes an immersive narrative. Throughout, McBurney shifts between his own voice - either as onstage narrator or back in his London home studio with frequent interruptions from his 5-year-old daughter, heard in recordings - and the deeper, American-accented voice of McIntyre. Yet despite the constant reminders that this is an act of storytelling, the lines separating our experience in the theater from McIntyre's in the rainforest and from McBurney's own thoughts all but vanish.",
