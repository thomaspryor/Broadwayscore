  "bwwExcerpt": "In this primal, lysergic movie for the brain, McBurney covers a dazzling array of topics: the nature of time, technology's deadening of mental powers, and the spiritual cost of civilized life. Part mystic thriller, part tricksy aural illusion, The Encounter offers a meeting of ear, mind and soul you will never forget.",
