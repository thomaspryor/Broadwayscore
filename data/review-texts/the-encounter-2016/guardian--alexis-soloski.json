  "bwwExcerpt": "McIntyre's story is fascinating, but it serves here a placeholder, an opportunity for McBurney to explore his deeper thematic concerns: why do we surrender ourselves to narrative? How do we distinguish between reality and fiction? When should we trust the evidence of our senses and when should we allow for the extrasensory? (There's also lots of less helpful material about being and time.) McBurney intercuts the narrative with recordings of his sleepless daughter's desire to be told just one more story. The binaural audio, he says, is his way of reading a bedtime story to each of us, using proximity to encourage mimesis and summon our empathy.",
