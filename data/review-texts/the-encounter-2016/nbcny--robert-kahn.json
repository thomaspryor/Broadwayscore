  "bwwExcerpt": "There are readily apparent and relatable themes in 'The Encounter.' Among them: we're natural creatures, but our material possessions hold us hostage. As well, there's a well-intentioned message about how it's wrong to interfere with the lives of any indigenous people, particularly these, who-in the telegraphed words of a campaigner for Survival International-view 'the oil underneath the ground as the blood of the earth.'",
