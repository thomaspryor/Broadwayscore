But by the end of this nonpareil show’s two intermissionless hours, you are as lightheaded, exhausted, baffled and invigorated as if it had been you.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Superlative language ('astonishing', 'nonpareil', 'no production...has ever') with vivid praise for sustained momentum and transformative audience experience. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this may be cherry-picked positive content. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlative language ('astonishing', 'nonpareil') and describes a unique, immersive experience, indicating a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution in over-interpreting the sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"astonishing\", \"tensely and enjoyably\", and \"nonpareil\". Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it as positive with a higher score. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
