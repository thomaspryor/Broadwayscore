But by the end of this nonpareil show’s two intermissionless hours, you are as lightheaded, exhausted, baffled and invigorated as if it had been you.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Exceptional superlatives ('astonishing', 'nonpareil', 'never...as widely') and visceral praise for the experience. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong superlatives like 'astonishing' and 'nonpareil,' indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"astonishing\", \"tensely and enjoyably\", and \"nonpareil\". Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains superlative praise ('astonishing,' 'nonpareil') describing a transformative, invigorating experience. Following single-excerpt guidance, scored at upper end of Positive bucket (80-84) rather than Rave due to limited context. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
