  "bwwExcerpt": "But the awe-struck descriptions of nature in ascendance are always secondary to what we're feeling, physically as well as emotionally. And 'The Encounter,' which has only sharpened its production values since I saw it in London in February, summons those sensations not just through sound but also through lighting (by Paul Anderson) and projections (by Will Duke) that transform a sterile stage into a phosphorescent jungle where shadow trumps substance or an American suburb illuminated by a bonfire of discarded worldly goods.",
