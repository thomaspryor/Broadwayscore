    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The museum metaphor and sledgehammer comparison clearly criticize the direction as lifeless and heavy-handed. However, this appears to be a truncated excerpt, so confidence is reduced. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the staging as overly heavy-handed and lacking subtlety, suggesting a negative experience overall. However, without further context, the score is placed in the middle of the Negative range. | Gemini: The review uses negative imagery to describe the staging, suggesting a lack of subtlety and an overly forceful approach. This indicates a negative assessment of the production. | Kimi: The excerpt contains vivid negative criticism of the staging as museum-like and heavy-handed. However, with only one sentence provided and the overall verdict appearing truncated, the final recommendation remains unclear.",
