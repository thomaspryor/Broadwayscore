  "fullText": "A comedy of the dysfunctional-family variety, \"Stick Fly\" offers a fair share of laughter and some enjoyable performances but not much in the way of distinction.\n\nA comedy of the dysfunctional-family variety, “Stick Fly” offers a fair share of laughter and some enjoyable performances but not much in the way of distinction. While playwright Lydia R. Diamond mixes in intrigue, sex and sociology, the proceedings are rarely surprising and never compelling; the result suggests a second cousin of August Wilson married to Jean Kerr’s stepchild. There is an audience for this piece, as at least five other productions across the country have made clear, but without ticket-selling stars, it’s unclear whether they’ll be able to attract a crowd to the Cort Theater.\n\nThe author sets out a typical template. An upper-class family arrives for a long weekend at their country house in Martha’s Vineyard, the grown sons bringing along new girlfriends. The family is black; the girl one of the sons brings home is white. There are two key characters present solely via telephone, and the family’s foundations are exploded by one of those second-act secrets that are telegraphed midway through the first.\n\nWith “Stick Fly,” Diamond has attempted a commercial comedy with soapy overtones, but despite the abundance of laugh lines, the first act bogs down with cultural anthropology talk while the second meanders through five scenes. Director Kenny Leon (“Fences”), who successfully staged “Stick Fly” at the Arena Stage in Washington last year, has recast all but one of the roles, but what this play cries out for is a rewrite.\n\nDavid Gallo’s Vineyard cottage is the sort of place we’d like to move into immediately, with partial walls defining three distinct playing areas that can be used simultaneously. Pop music powerhouse Alicia Keys — the second-billed producer — has composed scene-change music that unfortunately slows down the proceedings.\n\nRuben Santiago-Hudson (“Seven Guitars”), the one stage veteran in the group, dominates the action with a comical turn as the controlling patriarch of the clan. Tracie Thoms and Rosie Benton contribute detailed portraits of the very different girlfriends; the sons, top-billed Dule Hill and Mekhi Phifer, are given less to work with. Stealing attention is Condola Rashad, who gave a memorable performance as an abused victim in Lynn Nottage’s “Ruined,” and who proves a strong comedienne here.\n\nThe title comes from the play’s resident entomologist; in order to study the wing movements of houseflies, you glue them to Popsicle sticks and watch them squirm. That’s what the playwright does to her characters in “Stick Fly.”",

  "wrongFullText": "Tedious and tonally inept, this Katherine Heigl starrer looks to be a nonstarter at the B.O.\n\nBased on the first novel in Janet Evanovich‘s bestselling mystery-comedy series featuring spunky bounty hunter Stephanie Plum, “One for the Money” has been in development for nearly two decades, during which Evanovich has published more than a dozen follow-up novels. With that sort of time invested and franchise potential awaiting, one would assume that someone with a degree of passion for the material would have eventually found their way to the project. The end result strongly suggests otherwise. Tedious and tonally inept, this Katherine Heigl starrer looks to be a nonstarter at the B.O.\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n ‘Chicago Fire,’ ‘Med’ and ‘P.D.’ Set Crossover Episodes on NBC in March \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n 'Chicago P.D.' Stars Jesse Lee Soffer and Tracy Spiridakos Set to Return for Crossover\n\nUnfortunately, much of the blame can be laid at the feet of Heigl (who also exec produced). That this mildly outspoken star has developed such a devoted cadre of detractors is a strange phenomenon indeed, and one not without strong sexist undercurrents, but she does herself no favors by displaying nearly all her actorly shortcomings here. Shrill, unfocused and irregularly attempting a deep New Jersey accent that seems destined for lasting infamy, she plays heroine Stephanie with an almost standoffish lack of conviction.\n\nAs the film opens, Stephanie has been unemployed for several months after losing her job as a lingerie buyer, and her bank account is mired in the single digits. After watching through the window as her car is repossessed, she agrees to take a filing position with her bail bondsman cousin, only to have his secretary offer her a freelance role collecting bail jumpers instead. Her interest is piqued when she notices that former flame Joe Morelli (Jason O’Mara) is among the most wanted; he broke her heart in high school and his bounty is huge, so she agrees to bring him in.\n\nStephanie’s obvious unsuitability for this particular job is essentially the basis for the entire film, yet within two or three minutes of being offered the gig, she’s tailing perps and breaking into vacant buildings with no one batting an eye. This type of head-scratching flippancy will emerge again and again throughout.\n\nIn any case, missing details never derail the pic’s romantic-comedy-esque trajectory: Stephanie pursues Joe while firing off forced bouts of flirtation; an ultra-studly fellow bounty-hunter (Daniel Sunjata) teaches her some of the ropes; and her wacky family (including a forcefully schticky Debbie Reynolds) tries to set her up with the neighborhood nebbish.\n\nAlso, she’s threatened and stalked by a serial rapist (Gavin-Keith Umeh); her ineptitude as a bounty-hunter causes several innocent people to be killed; and a friendly prostitute (Sherri Shepherd) is brutally beaten. A director with a feel for black comedy might have managed to marry these wildly incompatible tones, but in the hands of Julie Anne Robinson, the entire enterprise merely leaves a sour aftertaste. As Stephanie continually charges headlong into dangerous situations with unsavory men with nary a thought for her personal safety, only to be inevitably bailed out by a passing male savior, her behavior begins to seem less quirky than clinically insane. She’s far more Timothy Treadwell than Miss Marple.\n\nTech values are functional, and the aesthetic is thoroughly smallscreen. Like the book, “One for the Money” is prominently set in Trenton, N.J., though it was largely lensed in Pittsburgh; this location choice does the film no great detriment, it just doesn’t really make any sense.",
