  "bwwExcerpt": "Something is very wrong when the transitional music played between scenes is treated as the most important part of a play...In spite of a few sincere performances, 'Stick Fly' is utterly derivative of better-known family dramas and dependent on shock value. It also doesn't help that the scene changes are painfully slowed down in order to showcase Keys' original music.",
