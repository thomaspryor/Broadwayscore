  "bwwExcerpt": "In the end, Stick Fly sometimes seems as insecure as some of its characters about its place in the world. It hints at a family drama worthy of August Wilson or Lorraine Hansberry, with flashes of insight into the contemporary African American experience. But too often it settles for raised voices and shocking twists — and the gasps and clucks that they'll elicit from the audience. There's a skill to crafting such entertainments, to be sure, but Diamond has the potential to write plays that do much, much more.",
