  "fullText": "The Sun is committed to bring you the stories, columns, and editorials that matter most.\n\nFor almost 200 years the Sun has championed enduring American values; constitutional government, sound money, free enterprise, good citizenship, and equality before the law. We have fought Populism, Socialism, Communism, government extravagance, the encroachments of bureaucracy and that form of governmental paternalism which eats into the marrow of private initiative and industry.\n\nWe’re confident that you’ll find our principles-based journalism an indispensable addition to your day.\n\nAt a recent ‘Funny Girl’ preview, there was a sense of the crowd rooting for both the character and the star that was nothing short of thrilling.\n\nBeanie Feldstein and Ramin Karimloo in ‘Funny Girl.’ Matthew Murphy, 2022\n\nMs. Gardner has written about theater and music for The New York Times, The Village Voice, Town & Country, Time Out New York, Entertainment Weekly and other publications. She is a board member of the Drama Desk and has served on the jury for the Pulitzer Prize for drama twice, most recently as chair.\n\nCommenting is available to Sun Readers , Sun Members and Sun Founders only.

There is a brief mention of 'Funny Girl' but no actual review content.; kimi: The text consists primarily of website boilerplate, navigation menus, login prompts ('Remember meForgot your password?Sign in'), copyright notices, and publication mission statements. Only one fragment of potential review content is present ('At a recent 'Funny Girl' preview...'), making this non-article content unsuitable for scoring.",
