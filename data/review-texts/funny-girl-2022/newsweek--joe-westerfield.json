  "bwwExcerpt": "People who go in with strict, preconceived notions of what Funny Girl or who Fanny should be will probably be disappointed. They usually are. But as someone wiser than me once said, \"You curate the experience you want.\" Certainly the now-familiar songs by Bob Merrill and Jule Styne are there, topped by two certified hits: \"People\" and \"Don't Rain on My Parade,\" but this is no carbon copy of the original. This is a funny Funny Girl, and Beanie Feldstein is a truly funny, funny girl.",
