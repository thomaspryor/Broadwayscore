  "bwwExcerpt": "When Feldstein opened the show, she could not handle the songs, and as Helen Shaw pointed out, the 'songs are the whole caboodle.' In Michele's case, this works to her advantage. The way that the show's written, Fanny's voice is the metonym for her stardom, so as long as you really believe she's got the magic, you don't necessarily need to buy her comedic skills, or really any other aspect of her character. It's like in Shakespeare, where the weather clears up when the right king is on the throne. Michele is not a natural comedian, but she finds a way to be charming with Fanny's jokes, which are as broad as the East River, just by trying so very hard to sell every one. It's like she's hoping her Sketch Comedy 101 teacher will give her a gold star.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic acknowledges Michele's vocal strengths work for the role and finds her charming despite comedic limitations. However, this is only one excerpt and may not reflect the full review's verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of Michele's performance, highlighting her ability to charm despite not being a natural comedian. However, the single excerpt limits confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges Michele's shortcomings as a comedian but praises her ability to charm the audience. The comparison to Sketch Comedy 101 suggests a qualified endorsement, placing it in the Mixed category. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates Michele's vocal performance carries the show despite her comedic limitations, suggesting she succeeds where her predecessor failed. However, the praise is qualified by noting her lack of natural comic timing, and the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
