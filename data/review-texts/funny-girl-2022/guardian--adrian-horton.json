The praise is genuine but qualified by a major reservation about her not meeting the vocal requirements. | Gemini: The review praises Feldstein's performance as warm and winsome with impeccable comic timing, but notes she isn't a powerhouse vocalist. This suggests a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Feldstein's acting and comedic skills ('impeccable', 'naturalistic') while noting she lacks the vocal power traditionally required for the role, indicating a favorable but qualified assessment of her performance.",
