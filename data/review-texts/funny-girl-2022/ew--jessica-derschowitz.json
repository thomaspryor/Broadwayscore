  "bwwExcerpt": "Those who come to the August Wilson expecting Michele to blow the roof off the place won't be disappointed. The surrounding buildings on 52nd Street should brace for impact, too. Michele uses her voice like a stealth missile, belting easily through marquee songs like 'People' and 'Don't Rain on My Parade' and earning all the enthusiastic applause she gets for them. She also has an easy chemistry with Ramin Karimloo's Nick Arnstein, the charming gambler Fanny falls for as she rises from young ambitions to prime placement in Ziegfeld's Follies. (Her rapport also sparkles with fellow show newcomer Tovah Feldshuh, who plays a deliciously spiky and deadpan Mrs. Brice.)",

The language used suggests a highly positive experience, warranting a Rave classification. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising Michele's performance and her chemistry with other cast members. The phrase \"enthusiastic applause\" suggests a strong positive reaction. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for Lea Michele's vocal performance and chemistry with co-stars, indicating strong recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
