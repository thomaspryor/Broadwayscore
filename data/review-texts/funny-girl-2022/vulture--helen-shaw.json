  "bwwExcerpt": "Some of Feldstein's assets do make the trip over from film: She's winningly fresh; she gives great \"bumble;\" she has beautiful eyes the size of hubcaps, which roll and twinkle and flirt. In the first act, when Brice is an inexperienced gal blustering her way into the big time, Feldstein exudes a nice mix of hard-charging ambition and surprised giddiness when she succeeds. But in song after song, Feldstein's voice lets her down. Piercing and unpleasant when it gets any higher than her chest, fadi",

This suggests neither recommendation nor strong discouragement. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the lead's vocal and acting abilities, suggesting a lack of impact and presence necessary for the role, leading to a negative assessment. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that Feldstein lacks the vocal power and her acting choices are weak, leading to a negative assessment of her performance. | Kimi: While acknowledging the lead is 'eager and likable,' the critic fundamentally critiques her vocal inadequacy for the Broadway house and weak acting choices, suggesting a miscast or underwhelming central performance.",
