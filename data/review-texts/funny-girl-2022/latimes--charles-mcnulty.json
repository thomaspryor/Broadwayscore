  "bwwExcerpt": "With its laughter shot through with loneliness, 'Funny Girl' seems less a vehicle for a star on the rise (or a diva in need of rescue) than a well-wrought musical comedy with a dramatic through line that's unusually psychologically acute. Streisand showed us this already, but Michele clarifies that it's the show that provides the material. Proving herself a trouper, she makes Michael Mayer's production seem less frivolous than when it first opened. I wasn't particularly excited by the prospect of sitting through this revival again. But I left understanding why tickets are going for a king's ransom. Lea Michele is delivering a tour de force for the ages.",
