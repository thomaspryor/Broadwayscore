The tone is strongly negative, suggesting a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the performance lacks charisma and vocal power, and the revival feels like karaoke, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic unfavorably compares Beanie Feldstein's performance to Barbra Streisand's iconic original and dismisses the production as 'karaoke' rather than 'Broadway magic,' indicating a clear negative assessment.",
