  "bwwExcerpt": "On the other hand, Michele's performances of 'I'm the Greatest Star' and 'Don't Rain On My Parade' are absolutely exhilarating, prompting frenzied excitement and mid-show standing ovations. Michele also throws herself into her character's comedy bits, even though her efforts are more hard-working than inspired or genuinely funny.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows strong praise for Michele's musical performances but criticizes her comedy as 'hard-working' rather than 'inspired or genuinely funny.' Without full review context, this suggests mixed assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights exhilarating performances that prompt excitement and standing ovations, indicating a positive reception. However, the note about comedy bits being more hard-working than inspired suggests some reservations. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights exhilarating performances and audience excitement, but also mentions that some comedic efforts are \"more hard-working than inspired.\" Given the strong positive language and standing ovations, I'm placing it in the positive bucket, but with a slightly lower confidence due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: While the excerpt contains strong praise for Michele's musical numbers ('absolutely exhilarating,' 'standing ovations'), the criticism of her comedy as 'more hard-working than inspired' tempers the recommendation. As a single curated excerpt with mixed signals, this falls in the mildly positive range.",
