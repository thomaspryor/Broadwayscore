  "fullText": "Despite being a musical-opera aficionado, I had seen “Funny Girl” performed on stage only once. The experience was half-memorable, half-forgettable. On Sept. 23, 2002, the Actors’ Fund of America presented a benefit performance of the 1964 musical that had made Barbra Streisand a star. At the one-night-only benefit, Peter Gallagher played Nick Arnstein and Kaye Ballard, a performer who lobbied hard to be the original Fanny Brice, played Mrs.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Michele's version of Fanny Brice instead recalls 'Funny Lady.' And anyone who knows the career of La Streisand knows that to bring up the 1975 big-screen sequel to the 1968 classic 'Funny Girl' is not exactly a compliment.

'She was under contract!' he apologizes to the bride he has just jilted at the altar when he belatedly comes out of the closet on their wedding day.",
