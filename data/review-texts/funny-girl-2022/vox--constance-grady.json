  "bwwExcerpt": "Michele proved she had the vocal chops to pull off a convincing Streisand dupe way back in her Glee days, where she covered a series of Funny Girl songs in performances that tended to ape Streisand's distinctive phrasing and pronunciations. ('The sun's a ball of buttah,' anyone?) Now, at 36, she still has the pure, supple tone that made her a TV star, but she's acquired the gravitas and confidence it takes to move past mimicry. She can interpret stone-cold classics like 'People' and 'I'm the Greatest Star' with a technique that nods to Streisand without copying her beat for beat, and her belt on 'Don't Rain on My Parade' fills the theater.",
