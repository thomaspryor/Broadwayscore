    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Unqualified superlatives throughout: 'enormously entertaining,' 'continuous all around excellence,' and declaring it 'the most satisfyingly grand theatrical outing currently on any New York stage.' Despite being a single excerpt, the language is definitively rave-level with no reservations expressed. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is highly positive, praising the stagecraft, performances, and storytelling. The language used ('enormously entertaining', 'continuous all around excellence') suggests a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt contains overwhelmingly positive language such as \"enormously entertaining\", \"all around excellence\", and \"satisfyingly grand\", indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: Single available excerpt contains unambiguous superlatives ('enormously entertaining', 'all around excellence', 'most satisfyingly grand theatrical outing'), warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket per guidance for clearly positive isolated quotes. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
