While it was impossible for me not to compare the production with the original, this one holds its own due in very large part to an excellent cast...One of the many enduring strengths of 'Angels'...is that the characters in it are all so personable and approachable and flawed and real. The play takes frequent flights from reality, but its characters keep it firmly grounded.\"\n\nRead more",

The lack of full context and single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious approach, but the language used indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong praise such as \"lasting artwork\" and \"excellent cast,\" indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt describes the production as 'lasting artwork' with an 'excellent cast' that 'holds its own,' indicating a clear positive recommendation despite limited context.",
