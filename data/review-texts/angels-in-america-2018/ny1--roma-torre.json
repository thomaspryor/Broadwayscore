  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A bravura production...It's striking how relevant the play remains. Kushner's indictment of our moral failings extends to matters of race, mental illness, religion...What stood out to me is the startling depiction of the Angel. Far from a herald angel, this time it's a hauntingly evocative creature portending tragedy filled with humor, fantasy, surrealism, and in the end a glimmer of hope...Intellectually and emotionally rewarding...There is no doubt the work is great on that Broadway stage.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, the language is consistently superlative ('bravura production', 'intellectually and emotionally rewarding', 'no doubt the work is great'). The critic praises both the production and the play's enduring relevance with unqualified enthusiasm. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, describing the production as 'bravura' and 'intellectually and emotionally rewarding'. The critic emphasizes the play's relevance and the impactful depiction of the Angel, suggesting a highly positive assessment. | Gemini: The review uses phrases like \"bravura production\", \"startling depiction\", and \"intellectually and emotionally rewarding\", indicating a strong positive assessment. Given the single excerpt warning, I am placing the score at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains enthusiastic praise including 'bravura production,' 'intellectually and emotionally rewarding,' and definitive statements that the work is 'great,' indicating a strong recommendation. Confidence is low due to availability of only a single curated excerpt. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
