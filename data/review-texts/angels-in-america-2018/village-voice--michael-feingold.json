    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows critic finding significant problems with the production - 'frenetic' acting, 'barren patches' in script, 'distressing' enlargement of flaws. While acknowledging the play's achievement, the focus is on production problems. Single excerpt warning means this could be cherry-picked negative section from a more positive overall review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights both positive and negative aspects, noting a tendency toward abstraction and freneticism, and acknowledging flaws in the script. The tone suggests a mixed review with some appreciation for the production's achievements. | Gemini: The review points out flaws in the script and suggests the production struggles with abstraction, but also acknowledges the play's achievement. The overall tone is mixed, with both positive and negative aspects highlighted. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production as frenetic and distressingly revealing of script flaws, though the final caveat about not underrating the play's achievement prevents it from being fully negative. As a single curated excerpt, the overall verdict remains unclear.",
