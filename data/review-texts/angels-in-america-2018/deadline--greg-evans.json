Single excerpt warning applies - scoring in upper-positive range due to clear praise language. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the revival as a 'rich theatrical experience' and compares it favorably to its original, Pulitzer-winning run. The tone suggests a strong recommendation, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt is highly positive, calling the show a \"winged masterwork\" and \"rich a theatrical experience.\" Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive with high confidence within that bucket.",
