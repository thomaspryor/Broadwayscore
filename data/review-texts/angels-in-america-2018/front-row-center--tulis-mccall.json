    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for writing, performances, and direction with vivid language ('roiling, churning entity'). However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the writing and performances, indicating a highly positive assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the writing, acting, and direction, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I've placed it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single curated excerpt contains strong praise ('masterful' writing, performances 'more than up to the task') suggesting enthusiastic recommendation, though limited context requires conservative scoring in the upper Positive range.",
