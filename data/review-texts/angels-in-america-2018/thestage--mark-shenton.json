    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt with mixed signals - the 'coals to Newcastle' comparison suggests redundancy/questioning the need, but acknowledges 'Broadway-style scale and ambition.' With only one curated quote available, the overall verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the production's scale and ambition, but the single excerpt limits confidence. The tone is mildly positive, warranting a score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt is descriptive and doesn't offer a clear recommendation. It notes the production's scale and ambition but lacks a definitive positive or negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic employs the idiom 'coals to Newcastle' to suggest the production may be redundant or unnecessary, but counters that it possesses 'Broadway-style scale and ambition'. Given only a single excerpt is available, the overall recommendation remains ambiguous, landing in mixed territory.",
