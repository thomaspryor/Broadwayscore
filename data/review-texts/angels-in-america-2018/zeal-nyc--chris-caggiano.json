  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The ambition and scope of 'Angels in America' would be laughable if Kushner weren’t so deft a playwright. Kushner weaves his grand themes about democracy, progress, and the limitations therein into the intimate lives of his characters, and therein lies the true emotional power of the piece...Nothing about Kushner’s dialogue feels dated, and the themes of power and its exercise — or rather its misuse — have a grim resonance...The cast is universally outstanding.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Excerpt praises Kushner's writing as 'deft' and calls the cast 'universally outstanding' with themes having 'resonance', but single excerpt warning requires caution about incomplete verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play's ambition, themes, and cast, indicating a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is set at the lower end of the Rave range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the playwright, dialogue, themes, and cast, indicating a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for Kushner's writing, the relevance of the themes, and the 'universally outstanding' cast. As a single curated excerpt, it represents clearly positive sentiment, warranting the upper range of the Positive bucket.",
