However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"stunning achievement\" and calls the play \"one of the greatest American dramas ever written\", indicating a Rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives including 'masterpiece' and 'stunning achievement,' indicating the highest level of critical enthusiasm, though confidence is reduced due to limited available text.",
