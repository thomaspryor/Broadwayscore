  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Outstanding...'Angels' is both specific and monumental. Characters are sympathetic, politics so sharp, the author draws blood, religion knowledgeably manifest, bigotry excoriated. Shockingly, the playwright's arch sense of humor has us laughing through an obstacle course of tragedy. The accomplishment is masterful...Elliott helms an inspired production...Andrew Garfield should get the Tony Award. He’s astonishing. Never before has the actor shown such range and fearlessness.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Superlative praise throughout: 'Outstanding', 'masterful', 'inspired production', 'astonishing' performance worthy of Tony Award. Despite being an excerpt, the language is unambiguously rapturous. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives like 'masterful', 'astonishing', and 'inspired', indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a rave review. | Gemini: The review uses superlatives like \"outstanding\" and \"masterful\", and praises the production and performances, particularly Andrew Garfield's. The phrase \"should get the Tony Award\" indicates a very high level of praise. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains unambiguous enthusiasm with superlatives like 'masterful,' 'astonishing,' and 'outstanding,' but scored at the high end of Positive (84) with low confidence due to the risk of cherry-picking with only one available excerpt.",
