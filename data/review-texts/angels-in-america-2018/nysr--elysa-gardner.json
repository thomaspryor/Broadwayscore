  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The stunning new Broadway revival of 'Angels' is haunted by everything that’s happened since...Elliott mines the daunting structural and supernatural elements of Kushner’s play without a trace of empty spectacle...However pointed and relevant many of 'Angels’' political insights remain, the play ultimately celebrates progress in a non-partisan sense, as something that is difficult but necessary and ultimately inevitable. It’s a timeless and universal message.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Opens with 'stunning' and praises director Elliott's handling of complex material, calling the message 'timeless and universal.' However, this is a single curated excerpt which may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('stunning', 'haunted'), suggesting a highly favorable view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language such as \"stunning\", and indicates that the play \"celebrates progress\", suggesting a positive overall experience. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strong praise ('stunning,' 'timeless') for the revival's direction and thematic depth, warranting a high Positive score. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence remains low regarding the full review's verdict.",
