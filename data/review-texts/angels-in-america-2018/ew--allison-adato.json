The lack of the full review text reduces confidence, but the available excerpts suggest a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses phrases like \"as relevant as ever\" and \"still towers over almost any stage event\", indicating a strong positive recommendation. The truncated text and lack of a specific rating reduce confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives describing the production as a towering achievement that realizes modern theater's greatest ambitions, indicating strong recommendation despite limited context.",
