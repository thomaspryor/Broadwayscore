  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Impressive performances under the equally impressive and inventive direction by Marianne Elliott...Amazingly, while dealing with situations of the utmost seriousness, Kushner injects massive humor along the way, and the combination works splendidly, making the work often very funny as well as penetrating and upsetting. The play offers a bonanza for actors, and this cast comes through admirably...A revival to be cherished, and missing it would certainly leave a gap in one’s theatergoing.\"\n\nRead more",

The phrase 'a revival to be cherished' and the warning about missing it indicate a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"impressive performances\", \"impressive and inventive direction\", \"works splendidly\", \"bonanza for actors\", and \"revival to be cherished\", indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: Strongly enthusiastic excerpt uses superlatives ('cherished', 'splendidly') and explicitly warns against missing the show, indicating a rave recommendation despite limited context.",
