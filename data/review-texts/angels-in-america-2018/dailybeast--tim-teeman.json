  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The emotional and political weave of Kushner’s writing is immaculately provocative of both head and heart...For all its ranginess, this production is a masterclass in storytelling clarity and profundity...This is seven and a half hours of luxurious dramatic immersion, and in no way arid or plodding. You will laugh a lot, which may surprise you. But this play is as streaked with humor as it is intellectual and emotional weightiness...This is theater at its most whole and embracing.\"\n\nRead more",
