Single excerpt warning requires caution, but tone is clearly enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the precise performances and describes the experience as 'luxurious dramatic immersion,' indicating a strong positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is highly positive, describing the show as a \"luxurious dramatic immersion\" with precisely played characters. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's pacing and richness ('luxurious dramatic immersion'), explicitly defending its length against potential criticism. As a single curated quote, the confidence is low, but the language clearly supports a strong positive recommendation.",
