    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong superlative language ('nothing short of a revelation') indicates Rave bucket. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('nothing short of a revelation') indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"revelation\" and \"honors\" suggesting a very positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the language warrants a high positive score. | Kimi: The excerpt uses superlative language ('revelation,' 'new depths') indicating strong enthusiasm, but per the single-excerpt guidance, the score is capped in the Positive bucket (80-84) rather than Rave due to the risk of cherry-picking. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
