  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Returning to Broadway for the first time in 25 years, the plays are as bristling, dynamic and relevant as when they first appeared. If you are willing to give yourself over to its characters' desperate search for inner truth, you will be rewarded with a theatrical experience that will both devastate and exhilarate you…A testament to where we stand today: at the precipice of self-destruction and a soaring re-invention of one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Powerful superlatives ('bristling, dynamic and relevant', 'devastate and exhilarate') with promise of profound impact. Single excerpt warning noted, but language is unambiguously enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong language ('devastate and exhilarate', 'testament') suggesting a highly positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"bristling, dynamic and relevant\" and promises a rewarding theatrical experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of positive, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong unqualified praise ('bristling, dynamic', 'devastate and exhilarate') placing it in the upper range of Positive, but confidence is low given only a single curated excerpt is available. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
