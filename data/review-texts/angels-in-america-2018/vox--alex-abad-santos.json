Instead of something holy and untouchable, this rendition of 'Angels' feels more human...The most timeless feature of Elliott's interpretation is how it handles Kushner's howling sense of grief...Every character made me realize how honest and brutal Kushner can be on the feeling of abandonment...'Angels' provokes anger right out of your bones, and that anger charges it with urgency.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Opens with 'rapturous success' and describes the production as charged with urgency and emotional power. Despite being a single excerpt, the language is clearly enthusiastic praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as a 'rapturous success' and highlights its emotional impact and urgency. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language used suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language like \"rapturous success\" and describes the production as \"more human,\" suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt and warning, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt employs superlatives like 'rapturous success' and 'timeless' to praise the production's emotional urgency and human-scale approach to Kushner's grief-stricken text. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced per instructions. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
