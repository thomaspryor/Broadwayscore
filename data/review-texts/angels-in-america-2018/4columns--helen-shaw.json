  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Kushner's masterpiece is a joy to watch, but it's also, admittedly, a labor...Kushner's brilliance...still wavers in the never-perfected 'Perestroika'...Elliott's swift-moving production sometimes sways toward sentimentalism...The play cringes whenever Kushner's poor-theater aesthetic is punched aside by something so blatantly Hollywood...Garfield delivers a performance of absolute clarion rightness...These little quibbles don’t stain the glory one jot. This Visitation is unmissable.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Despite acknowledging various flaws throughout, the critic concludes definitively that 'This Visitation is unmissable' and calls it Kushner's 'masterpiece' and 'glory.' The explicit 'unmissable' recommendation overrides all earlier reservations. | GPT-4o: Despite acknowledging some flaws, the review concludes with strong praise, calling the production 'unmissable'. The excerpt's positive tone suggests a high score within the Rave bucket, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review uses the word \"unmissable\" and calls the play a masterpiece. Despite some minor criticisms, the overall tone is overwhelmingly positive, indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges flaws including sentimental direction and Hollywood aesthetic choices but dismisses them as minor, ultimately declaring the production 'unmissable' and praising Garfield's performance as being of 'absolute clarion rightness.'",
