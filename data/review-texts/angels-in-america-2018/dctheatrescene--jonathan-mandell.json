  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'Angels' remains compelling. It is very funny and moving and smart. It is also overwhelming and sprawling...and at times inaccessibly esoteric...Whatever flaws exist in the play and in the production, they are like so many speed bumps in a glorious road trip driven by Kushner’s rage, passion, compassion, intelligence, energy, and ear...May not be a hugely more significant production, as all the attention could make you believe. But this 'Angels' is just as spectacular–and just as can’t-miss.\"\n\nRead more",

The critic finds it 'compelling', 'funny and moving and smart' and describes it as a 'glorious road trip'. Confidence medium due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'compelling,' 'funny,' 'moving,' and 'smart,' despite acknowledging some flaws. The overall tone suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: Despite acknowledging flaws, the review uses strong positive language like \"compelling\", \"very funny and moving and smart\", and \"can't-miss\", indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers a strong recommendation ('can't-miss', 'spectacular', 'glorious') that outweighs acknowledged flaws ('speed bumps'), but confidence is reduced due to availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
