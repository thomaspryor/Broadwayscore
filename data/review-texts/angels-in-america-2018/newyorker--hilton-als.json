    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise calling the production 'a marvel' with 'powerful performances,' but low confidence due to single excerpt that may not represent full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as a 'marvel' and highlights powerful performances, indicating a strong positive sentiment. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"marvel\" and \"powerful performances,\" suggesting a positive review. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong praise ('marvel', 'particularly powerful performances'), indicating an enthusiastic recommendation, though limited context reduces confidence.",
