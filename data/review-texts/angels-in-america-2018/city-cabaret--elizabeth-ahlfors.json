  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The epic revival ignites the same emotions as the earlier versions, eliciting more humor than I remember...Much of the humor comes from the cast, many actors playing several roles. Outstanding is Nathan Lane in surely his finest performance...Equally magnetic is Andrew Garfield...'Angels of America' is exceptional and as essential today as it was in the days that inspired it. It is a stirring production that every theater-lover should see.\"\n\nRead more",

Clear must-see recommendation despite being an excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the revival as 'exceptional' and 'essential,' with standout performances by Nathan Lane and Andrew Garfield, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"exceptional\", \"essential\", and \"stirring production\" and recommends that \"every theater-lover should see\" it. The praise for the cast, especially Nathan Lane, further supports a Rave score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('exceptional', 'essential', 'outstanding') and an explicit universal recommendation, warranting the upper Positive range. Confidence is low due to reliance on a single curated excerpt that may not reflect the full review.",
