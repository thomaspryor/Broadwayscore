In particular, the character of Roy Cohn, incarnated by Nathan Lane with insolent glee, seemed to channel the voice of the current political zeitgeist...Elliott's production earns the optimism that has troubled me in the past...No play can repair the world, but 'Angels' offers us a timeless road map.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'Kushner's masterwork' with the critic being 'blown away' by its relevance. Praises Elliott's production and Lane's performance. Single excerpt warning suggests this is likely cherry-picked positive content, so scoring in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses strong praise for the production and its relevance, with Nathan Lane's performance highlighted. The critic is 'blown away' and finds the production 'timeless,' indicating a highly positive view. | Gemini: The critic was \"blown away\" by the production and states that it \"offers us a timeless road map\", indicating a strong positive recommendation. The single excerpt and aggregator context suggest a positive review, so I'm scoring it as a strong positive. | Kimi: The excerpt demonstrates strong enthusiasm with terms like 'masterwork' and 'blown away,' clearly endorsing the production, though the single-excerpt limitation requires low confidence.",
