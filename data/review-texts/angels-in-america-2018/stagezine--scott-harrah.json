The cast is superb and many of the performances are among the best in the past decade...Elliott certainly puts a new spin on 'Angels in America,' but her directorial choices may not please purists...As the adage goes 'less is more,' and that is certainly the case here in an epic saga that is already so complicated, but there is no doubt this revival is a memorable one.\"\n\nRead more",

Despite concerns about directorial choices, concludes it's 'a memorable' revival. Strong praise outweighs reservations. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as a 'masterpiece' with a 'superb' cast, indicating a strong positive sentiment. However, it notes that directorial choices may not please purists, suggesting some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the first part as a masterpiece and the cast as superb, but notes directorial choices may not please purists. Given the limited text and the 'masterpiece' comment, I'm scoring it as a strong positive with reservations. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong praise ('superb', 'best in the past decade', 'memorable revival') but notes directorial choices may not please purists. Given the single-excerpt warning, score is in the upper Positive range but confidence is reduced.",
