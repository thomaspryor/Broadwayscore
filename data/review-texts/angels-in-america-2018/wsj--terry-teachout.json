  "bwwExcerpt": "I've written more than once in this space about the flaws of \"Angels.\" It's too long, too sentimental, too inclined to demonize at the expense of comprehension, too rigid in its Marx-flavored politics (\"Angels\" would be a richer play if Mr. Kushner had had the wit, not to mention the honesty, to portray Ethel Rosenberg as shamelessly guilty). Yet all these things notwithstanding, it remains a fixed star in the firmament of American drama, a testament to Mr. Kushner's willingness to take huge cha",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic extensively details flaws ('too long, too sentimental') but concludes the play 'remains a fixed star in the firmament of American drama.' The 'yet' signals the positive verdict overrides the criticisms. Single excerpt with truncated ending requires low confidence and conservative positive scoring. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges significant flaws but ultimately describes the play as a 'fixed star' in American drama, indicating a positive overall assessment despite reservations. | Gemini: Despite acknowledging flaws, the critic ultimately calls it a \"fixed star\" which indicates a positive, albeit reserved, recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: Following the 'verdict over setup' rule, the critic's final assessment overrides the opening litany of flaws (length, sentimentality, politics). Calling the play a 'fixed star in the firmament of American drama' constitutes strong praise placing it in the upper Positive range, though the extensive caveats prevent Rave classification. Low confidence due to single excerpt availability and truncated text.",
