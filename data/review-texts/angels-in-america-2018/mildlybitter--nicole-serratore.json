    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review acknowledges both strengths (stronger production, buoyant text, hopeful message) and flaws (heavy-handed elements, self-seriousness) but the overall assessment is positive. Single excerpt warning applies, so using lower end of Positive range due to mixed elements mentioned. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a generally positive view with some reservations about the direction and design elements. The mention of the production becoming 'stronger and increasingly potent' suggests improvement and a positive trajectory, but the text warns of potential cherry-picking, leading to a lower confidence score. | Gemini: The review notes some flaws but ultimately concludes that the production is \"stronger and increasingly potent\" and \"delivers a message of hope with open arms.\" The phrase \"don't sink the show\" suggests a positive, but not rave, assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, noting the production has grown stronger and delivers a hopeful message, though it acknowledges some heavy-handed design elements and occasional self-seriousness. Given only a single curated excerpt is available, the score reflects mildly positive sentiment at the lower end of the Positive range.",
