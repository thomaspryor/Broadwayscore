  "bwwExcerpt": "At nearly eight hours, unfolding over two parts, the Broadway revival of Tony Kushner's \"Angels in America\" is a significant commitment, temporal and financial. But one of the countless wonders of this instant-classic production is the way it energizes, instead of enervates, as it goes along, expanding in scale and scope, spinning out one surprise after another.

However, text appears cut off mid-sentence, limiting full assessment of the verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as an 'instant-classic' and highlights its ability to energize the audience, suggesting a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using phrases like \"countless wonders\" and describing the production as energizing and expanding. Given the single excerpt and truncated nature, confidence is low, but the language suggests a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic hails this as an 'instant-classic production' full of 'wonders' that energizes rather than exhausts, despite acknowledging the significant time commitment. However, confidence is low given only one curated excerpt is available and the text appears truncated.",
