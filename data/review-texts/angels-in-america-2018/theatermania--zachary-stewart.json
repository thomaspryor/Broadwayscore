  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"It is no exaggeration to call 'Angels' a genuine American masterpiece...Elliott's inventive physical staging proves an ideal match for Kushner's sprawling, cinematic, and magic-laden text. Elliott doesn't treat Kushner's penchant for overlapping scenes as an obstacle, but an opportunity for counterpoint...'Angels' has only grown...This is a play that reveals new secrets with each viewing, so you should never pass up a chance to see it — especially in a production this tremendous.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt reduces confidence slightly. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong, enthusiastic language, calling the play a 'genuine American masterpiece' and the production 'tremendous.' It emphasizes the must-see nature of the show. | Gemini: The review uses the term 'masterpiece' and states that you should never pass up a chance to see it, especially in a production this tremendous, indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives ('masterpiece', 'tremendous') and explicit encouragement to see the show ('never pass up a chance'), placing it firmly in the Rave bucket, though confidence is reduced due to reliance on a single curated excerpt.",
