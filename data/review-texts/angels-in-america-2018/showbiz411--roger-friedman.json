He’s outrageous, serious, broad, and intense– what a roller coaster...Every other member of the cast is perfection.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Unqualified superlatives throughout - 'grandeur', 'astonishing', 'perfection', plus strong praise for lead performance and writing. Despite being a single excerpt, the language is consistently rapturous with no caveats. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the production's grandeur and the performances, particularly Garfield's. The language used ('marvel', 'astonishing', 'perfection') suggests a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong praise for the show's grandeur, characters, and Garfield's performance, suggesting a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers effusive praise using superlatives like 'grandeur,' 'astonishing,' and 'perfection' for the performances and writing, warranting a high Positive score, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence that this represents the complete verdict. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
