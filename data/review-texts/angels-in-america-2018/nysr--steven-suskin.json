  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"It remains unblinkingly bold and politically provocative in Elliott’s astounding production...What was and is so remarkable is how the man spins words...You hang on every word, and after seven hours Kushner manages to tie each and every element into a grand fantasia that is astonishing, unimaginable perfection...The cast is exceptional—although one of the most exceptional moments might come when you realize that there are only eight actors up there.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Uses superlatives like 'astonishing, unimaginable perfection' and 'exceptional' throughout. Despite being a single excerpt, the language is unqualifiedly ecstatic with no reservations expressed. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives like 'astonishing, unimaginable perfection' and 'astounding production', indicating a highly enthusiastic and unqualified recommendation. However, given the single excerpt warning, confidence is set to low. | Gemini: The review uses superlatives like \"astounding,\" \"remarkable,\" \"astonishing, unimaginable perfection,\" and \"exceptional,\" indicating a rave review. The critic is clearly impressed with the production. | Kimi: The single excerpt contains effusive praise including 'unimaginable perfection' and 'astounding production,' but per instructions for single curated quotes, the score is capped in the upper Positive range with low confidence.",
