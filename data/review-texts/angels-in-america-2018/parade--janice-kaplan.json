  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Lane and Garfield are the center of an extraordinary Broadway revival...It has never been more powerful, potent and of the moment...Its deeper themes ring even stronger now, and it lands timelessly as a play about the many kinds of love in the world, of the complications of loss and loneliness, of the power of loyalty. Kushner's writing is so extraordinary that you cling to every word.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Uses superlative language ('extraordinary', 'never been more powerful') with unqualified praise for the revival and Kushner's writing. Single excerpt warning noted, but the enthusiastic tone and superlatives indicate strong rave territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives like 'extraordinary', 'powerful', and 'potent', suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses superlatives like \"extraordinary,\" \"powerful,\" and \"potent,\" indicating a strong positive recommendation. The phrase \"you cling to every word\" further emphasizes the high praise for the writing. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong superlatives ('extraordinary,' 'never been more powerful') suggesting high praise, but cherry-picking risk limits confidence and keeps score at upper end of Positive range per single-excerpt guidelines. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
