Single excerpt warning applies - this balanced view suggests mixed reception. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the production's ambition and excellence but highlights significant issues such as excessive length and obstacles to full appreciation, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges ambition and excellence but also notes excessive length and other obstacles, suggesting a qualified recommendation. Due to the excerpted nature of the review, confidence is low. | Kimi: While praising the show's 'epochal' ambition and 'excellent' production, the critic finds it 'less than the sum of its parts' with 'excessive length' and 'obstacles to full appreciation,' indicating significant reservations that prevent a clear recommendation.",
