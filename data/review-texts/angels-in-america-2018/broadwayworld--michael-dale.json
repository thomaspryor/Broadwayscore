However, confidence is low due to truncated excerpt format. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language such as 'thrilling,' 'heart-gripping,' and 'invigorating,' indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. The focus on Kushner's storytelling and the actors' performances suggests a powerful and engaging production. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses very positive language, such as \"thrilling\", \"heart-gripping\", and \"invigorating\", suggesting a strong recommendation. The focus on Kushner's words and the praise for the actors also contribute to this assessment. | Kimi: The excerpts express enthusiastic praise for the production's emotional impact and performances, describing it as 'thrilling,' 'heart-gripping,' and 'invigorating,' indicating a strong recommendation despite the limited available text.",
