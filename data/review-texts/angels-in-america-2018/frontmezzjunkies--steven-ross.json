The emotional intensity ('shattering your senses,' 'tearing your heart to pieces') combined with unqualified praise indicates the highest level of recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives and highly enthusiastic language, indicating a rave review. Despite the single excerpt warning, the intensity of praise suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses extremely positive language such as \"once in a lifetime,\" \"shattering your senses,\" \"majestic,\" \"complete,\" and \"words can barely describe its wonder,\" indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives ('once in a lifetime', 'solidly majestic', 'magnificent') and ecstatic praise indicating a strong recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full review's tone.",
