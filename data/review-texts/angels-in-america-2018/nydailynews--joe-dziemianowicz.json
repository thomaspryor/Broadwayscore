    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive assessment calling the revival 'impressive as ever' with praise for 'scope and richness,' though only one excerpt limits full verdict clarity. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's scope and richness, noting it remains impressive. Despite the lack of a full review, the positive language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the scope and richness of the play, suggesting it's worth seeing. However, the mention of 'somewhat messier' introduces a reservation. Given the single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation, confidence is low, and a score in the lower-middle of the positive range is appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise ('impressive as ever,' 'taut') for this revival, though the caveat that Perestroika is 'somewhat messier' prevents it from being an unqualified rave. Given the single-excerpt limitation, this clearly positive assessment warrants an upper-range Positive score.",
