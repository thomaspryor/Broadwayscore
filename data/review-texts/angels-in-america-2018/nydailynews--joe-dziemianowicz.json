  "bwwExcerpt": "Twenty-five years after its Tony- and Pulitzer-winning first Broadway run, the scope and richness of the seven-hour, two-part saga - the taut \"Millennium Approaches,\" followed by the somewhat messier \"Perestroika\" - remain as impressive as ever.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The most electrifying production you’re apt to ever see of the author’s masterwork...The scope and richness of the two-part saga remain as impressive as ever...Direction by Elliott amplifies the play’s powers and wrings out every drop of emotion. Slashes of neon, rotating set pieces, and a seamless restlessness give the staging its own striking distinction...The cast is uniformly very effective...The desire for 'more life' remains constant. Just like the power of this sprawling play.\"\n\nRead more",
