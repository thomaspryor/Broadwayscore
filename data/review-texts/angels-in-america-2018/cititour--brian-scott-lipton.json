  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Far from a period piece, it feels sadly all too timely in the Age of Trump...In its structure, the play remains the theatrical equivalent of a 24-course tasting menu, with items that are alternately bitter, sweet, salty, and sour...Elliott and her mostly splendid cast bring out the humor in Kushner’s text more fully than I recall in any prior production...The laughter occasionally dulls the pain we’re supposed to feel...but it also helps the play’s length feel less than arduous.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Excerpt shows appreciation for the cast and direction, noting the production brings out humor better than previous versions, but acknowledges structural issues and that laughter sometimes undermines emotional impact. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mildly positive but incomplete. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the humor brought out by the cast and director, suggesting a positive experience. However, the mention of the play's length and the mixed metaphor of a '24-course tasting menu' implies some reservations. The single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review highlights the humor and the splendid cast, but also mentions the play's length and the occasional dulling of the pain. It's a positive review with some reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the director and cast ('mostly splendid') and favors this production over previous ones, though it notes minor tonal issues regarding the balance of humor and pain.",
