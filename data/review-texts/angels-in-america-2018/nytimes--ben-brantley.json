The phrase \"enchanted realm of the theater, where skeptics can be converted into believers\" suggests a transformative and highly positive experience. | Kimi: The critic uses ecstatic, quasi-religious language ('enchanted realm,' 'converted into believers') to describe a transformative theatrical achievement with no reservations noted. Confidence is low due to the extreme brevity of the provided text.",
