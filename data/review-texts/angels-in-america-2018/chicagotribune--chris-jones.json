  "bwwExcerpt": "Andrew Garfield, the other excellent American star in a mostly British cast, takes theatrical command of Prior in a way that initially jars, but ultimately elevates the character, away from bitterness and immediate disappointment, more toward narrative omnipotence. By \"Perestroika,\" it actually feels like Prior has stepped away from his own body and time. Lane may have the most dominant performance, but Garfield's revisionist and ennobling work is perhaps the most conceptually successful element",

Truncated text limits confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review praises individual performances, particularly Lane and Garfield, but also notes issues with the staging. The text suggests a mix of strong performances with some conceptual challenges, indicating a mixed overall impression. | Gemini: The review praises Lane's performance as extraordinary and Garfield's work as conceptually successful, but also mentions the staging wanting to pull the text in a theatrically quixotic direction, indicating a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: While the excerpt criticizes the staging as overly quixotic, it offers unreserved praise for the central performances, calling Lane 'extraordinary' and Garfield's work 'ennobling' and 'conceptually successful,' indicating a recommendation based on the acting.",
