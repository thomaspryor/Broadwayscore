  "bwwExcerpt": "Andrew Garfield, the other excellent American star in a mostly British cast, takes theatrical command of Prior in a way that initially jars, but ultimately elevates the character, away from bitterness and immediate disappointment, more toward narrative omnipotence. By \"Perestroika,\" it actually feels like Prior has stepped away from his own body and time. Lane may have the most dominant performance, but Garfield's revisionist and ennobling work is perhaps the most conceptually successful element",

However, with only a single excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Garfield's performance as \"conceptually successful\" and notes that he \"elevates the character\". Given the limited text, I am placing it in the positive bucket with a high score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Andrew Garfield's performance, calling it 'excellent' and 'ennobling' and identifying it as the production's 'most conceptually successful element,' indicating a clear positive assessment despite limited context.",
