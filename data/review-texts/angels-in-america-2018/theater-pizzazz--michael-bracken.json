  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Kushner’s opus seems as timely and relevant as it did twenty-five years ago...It’s a tribute to Kushner’s writing that all these unlikely pairings seem completely natural. Elliott also gets credit for the uneasy yet unobtrusive marriage of the mundane and the phenomenal...Elliott has certainly managed to get extraordinary performances from her fine cast...What’s so striking about 'Angels in America' is the richness of its story and the depth of its characters.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Multiple positive elements praised: writing quality, direction, performances, and story depth. However, this is only a curated excerpt, so confidence is low despite clearly positive language. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the writing, direction, and performances, indicating a strong positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the relevance of the play, the direction, and the performances, indicating a positive assessment. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt consistently praises Kushner's timely writing, Elliott's seamless direction, and the cast's extraordinary performances, describing the production as rich and deep despite being a curated selection.",
