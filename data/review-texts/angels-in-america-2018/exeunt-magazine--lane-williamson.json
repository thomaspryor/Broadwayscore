However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives like 'complete masterpiece' and 'nothing else like what is happening,' indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning reduces confidence. | Gemini: The review uses superlative language such as \"complete masterpiece\", \"unparalleled cast\", and \"thrilling performances\", indicating a rave review. The critic also emphasizes the play's relevance and impact. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
