It is a strong choice, but it skirts the edge of silliness.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with 'soars so high', 'timeless', making 8-hour runtime 'glide by', and more laughs than comedies indicates enthusiastic recommendation. Single minor critique about Angel design keeps it from Rave territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('soars so high', 'glide by') and praises the production's mix of elements. Despite the warning about a single excerpt, the language suggests a highly favorable view. | Gemini: The excerpt contains mostly positive language, but the mention of skirting the edge of silliness suggests a reservation. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring on the higher end of positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the revival's pacing, tone, and direction ('timely and timeless,' 'glide by'), warranting a high Positive score despite being a single curated excerpt.",
