Even acknowledging one minor criticism ('coolly clinical at times'), the overall assessment is clearly a rave. | GPT-4o: The excerpt includes strong praise with superlatives like 'transcendent', 'timely', and 'one of the greatest plays ever written'. Despite the warning about single excerpt bias, the language indicates a highly enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using terms like \"superb ensemble cast\", \"brilliantly funny\", \"masterful\", and \"transcendent\". Despite a minor reservation about being \"coolly clinical\", the overall sentiment is a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt overflows with superlatives ('transcendent,' 'masterful,' 'brilliantly funny') and declares the work one of the greatest plays ever written, indicating enthusiastic recommendation despite the single-excerpt limitation.",
