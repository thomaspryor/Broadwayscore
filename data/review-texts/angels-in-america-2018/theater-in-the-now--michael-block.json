Her staging is swift and smart, which allows the focus to remain solely on the text...Elliott does not care about consistency.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt with mixed signals suggests qualified positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'triumphant' while noting 'curious choices' and inconsistency. This suggests an overall positive view with some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, a score at the lower end of Positive is appropriate. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the production as \"triumphant\" and highlights the director's care and smart staging, but also notes some \"curious choices.\" Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strong praise ('triumphant', 'swift and smart') but includes significant reservations ('curious choices', 'does not care about consistency'), indicating a positive but qualified recommendation.",
