Every one of Elliott’s cast is up to the task, and although it sometimes seems the director has some very ill people shouting more than they should be able, they all succeed greatly in a tech-slick production...The one-on-one confrontations that emerge throughout 'Angels' contain some of Kushner’s most trenchant lines...Such stunning poetry.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Calls it 'the best American play of the 1990s' and 'a heavenly piece' with praise for Lane's performance as 'one of his greatest' and 'stunning poetry.' Despite being an excerpt, the superlatives clearly indicate a rave review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, calling it 'the best American play of the 1990s' and highlighting exceptional performances and writing. The use of superlatives and the overall positive tone suggest a rave review. However, the single excerpt warning reduces confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong praise for the play, playwright, Lane's performance, and the cast, despite a minor reservation about shouting. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive with high confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise including 'best American play of the 1990s' and 'heavenly piece,' indicating a strong recommendation, though the single-excerpt limitation necessitates a high-positive score with reduced confidence. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
