    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with 'stunning achievement' and 'breathtaking' performance description indicates clear recommendation. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but language is unambiguously positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('stunning achievement', 'breathtaking vulnerability and power') indicating a rave review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"stunning achievement\" and \"breathtaking vulnerability and power,\" indicating a highly favorable impression. Given the single excerpt warning, I've placed the score at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs rave-level superlatives ('stunning achievement', 'breathtaking'), but as a single curated quote that may be cherry-picked, the score is capped at the high end of Positive with low confidence.",
