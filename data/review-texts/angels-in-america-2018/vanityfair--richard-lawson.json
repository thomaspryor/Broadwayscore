  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Elliott’s production arrives with towering anticipation, and expectation, which it could probably never entirely fulfill. There are moments when it almost does...With the right actors, the writing sings and enlightens. The wrong ones get tangled up in it, rendering it flat and heavy. This production’s cast about half succeeds...Still, by the close of 'Perestroika,' the production’s problems were largely chased from my mind. Those final 20 or so minutes are just so astonishingly good.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review acknowledges towering expectations that aren't entirely fulfilled, notes the cast 'about half succeeds,' but ends with high praise for the finale being 'astonishingly good.' This suggests a genuinely mixed experience with significant flaws balanced by exceptional moments. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes mixed success with the cast but ends on a positive note about the final moments being 'astonishingly good.' Given the single excerpt and potential cherry-picking, a lower positive score is appropriate. | Gemini: The review acknowledges problems with the production and casting, but ends on a positive note, stating that the final 20 minutes are \"astonishingly good.\" Given the excerpted nature and mixed signals, a lower positive score is appropriate. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges significant flaws including an uneven cast and unfulfilled expectations, but the 'astonishingly good' final act redeems the production, resulting in a qualified recommendation to see the show.",
