  "bwwExcerpt": "Lane brings yet another kind of volatility to Roy's spiky scenes with Belize (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett), a nurse at St. Vincent's Hospital and Prior's former drag sister. Stewart-Jarrett nails every laugh with his imperious attitude, bouncing Cohn's abuse right back at him. But his swishy attitude doesn't hide his wounded indignation over the disease that's ravaging the gay community, finding a worthy target in defensive Louis in one particularly memorable encounter.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows consistent praise for performances ('nails every laugh', 'particularly memorable encounter') with no negative qualifiers, but confidence is low due to limited text from curated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances, particularly Stewart-Jarrett's comedic timing and emotional depth. However, the single excerpt and lack of a clear overall verdict necessitate a cautious, lower-end positive score. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on strong performances, particularly Stewart-Jarrett's. While positive, the limited text and lack of overall verdict necessitate a lower confidence and a score in the middle of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the performances of Nathan Stewart-Jarrett and Nathan Lane, citing specific comic timing and emotional depth. While clearly positive about the acting, the single-excerpt format provides limited visibility into the critic's overall assessment of the production.",
