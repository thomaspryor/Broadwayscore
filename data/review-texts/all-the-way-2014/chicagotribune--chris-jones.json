    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. 'Sprawling but ultimately compelling' suggests reservations balanced by positive elements. | GPT-4o: The review praises Cranston's performance and finds the drama compelling, but describes it as sprawling, aligning with the original rating of 60, indicating a mixed review. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, highlighting Cranston's performance and calling the drama 'compelling.' However, the inclusion of 'sprawling but ultimately' suggests some reservations, placing it in the mixed category. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 60 places the review in the Mixed bucket (55-69). While the text praises Cranston's 'towering' performance and calls the drama 'compelling,' the description 'sprawling' indicates significant reservations about the production's scope or pacing.",
