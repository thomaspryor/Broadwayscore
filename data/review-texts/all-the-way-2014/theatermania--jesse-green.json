    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for Cranston's performance with superlatives like 'towering' and 'tour-de-force.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked praise from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for Bryan Cranston's performance, describing it as 'towering' and 'tour-de-force,' suggesting a highly positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses solely on Bryan Cranston's performance, describing it as \"towering\" and a \"tour-de-force.\" Given the limited text, it's difficult to gauge the overall recommendation, but the strong praise suggests a positive leaning, so I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers unqualified praise for the lead performance using superlatives like 'tour-de-force' and 'towering,' warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket despite limited context.",
