    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: While calling the play itself 'otherwise ordinary,' the critic emphasizes that Cranston's 'towering, Tony Award-caliber performance' transforms it into 'something close to greatness.' This suggests a strong positive recommendation driven by the lead performance. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights Cranston's performance as transformative, elevating the play significantly. The strong praise for Cranston suggests a positive recommendation, though the overall play is described as 'ordinary'. | Gemini: The review praises Cranston's performance highly, stating it elevates the play to \"something close to greatness.\" While acknowledging the play itself is \"otherwise ordinary,\" the strength of the performance warrants a positive score. Confidence is low due to the excerpt-only nature of the review. | Kimi: The critic offers superlative praise for Cranston's performance ('towering,' 'Tony Award-caliber') and states it elevates the material to 'close to greatness,' though the play itself is deemed 'ordinary.' Single excerpt limits confidence.",
