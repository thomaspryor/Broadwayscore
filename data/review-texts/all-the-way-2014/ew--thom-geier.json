The language is highly positive with 'marvel' and 'astonishing authenticity' indicating strong enthusiasm for the performance. | Gemini: The review praises Cranston's performance as a 'marvel' and 'astonishing,' indicating a strong positive sentiment and recommendation. Given the critic's rating of 87, this falls within the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise ('marvel', 'astonishing authenticity') for the lead performance, and the critic's original rating of 87 falls within the Rave range (85-100). Confidence is low due to the brevity of the excerpt.",
