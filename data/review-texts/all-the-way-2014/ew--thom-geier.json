    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: The critic's own 87 rating places this firmly in Rave territory (85-100). Language like 'marvel' and 'astonishing authenticity' indicates strong enthusiasm for Cranston's performance. | GPT-4o: The review text praises Cranston's performance with superlatives like 'marvel' and 'astonishing authenticity', aligning with the original high rating of 87, indicating a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises Cranston's performance as a 'marvel' and 'astonishing,' indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given the original rating of 87, a score in the high positive range is appropriate. | Kimi: The critic's original rating of 87 falls within the Rave range, supported by superlatives like 'marvel' and 'astonishing authenticity.' However, the provided text appears to be a brief excerpt, warranting low confidence.",
