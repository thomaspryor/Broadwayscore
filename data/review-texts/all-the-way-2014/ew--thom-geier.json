  "fullText": "Bryan Cranston doesn’t look or sound much like Lyndon B. Johnson, a broad-shouldered, doughy-faced Texan with a distinctively mumble-mouthed drawl. But in Robert Schenkkan’s impressive historical pageant All the Way, the reedy star effectively evokes the late president’s shrewdness, his delight in folksy yarns and dirty jokes, his insecurity, and his almost innate sense of how to exploit his opponents’ weaknesses. The play traces the first year of LBJ’s presidency, crosscutting cinematically between Johnson and his inner circle, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover (a slightly miscast Michael McKean), Martin Luther King Jr. (Brandon J. Dirden, who has the orator’s cadences down), congressional leaders on both sides of the civil rights issue, and rivals in the 1964 campaign. Perhaps because there’s so much ground to cover in three hours, All the Way can feel like a particularly rushed History channel miniseries, with scenes that are either perfunctory?especially those with female characters such as Lady Bird Johnson (Betsy Aidem) and Coretta Scott King (Roslyn Ruff)?or extraneous. (The play has been revised only slightly since its run last fall at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., with much the same cast.) Still, Schenkkan teases out telling parallels to modern political gridlock, and director Bill Rauch achieves some purely theatrical tableaux. At one point, LBJ’s Oval Office desk sinks into the stage to create a grave to punctuate both military escalation in Vietnam and the deaths of Freedom Riders in Mississippi. And while Cranston may never pass for LBJ’s doppelgänger, he embraces the role’s showmanship and physicality with gusto, close-talking and buttonholing and tie-grabbing to make his case. Even Walter White would be intimidated. B+",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with highly enthusiastic praise for lead performance ('marvel', 'astonishing authenticity'). Given the 87 original rating and strongly positive language, this falls in upper Positive range, though confidence is medium due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for Cranston's performance, describing it as a 'marvel' with 'astonishing authenticity.' Given the original rating of 87 and the positive tone of the excerpt, a score at the upper end of the Positive range is appropriate. However, the confidence is low due to the single excerpt limitation. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Cranston's performance as a \"marvel\" and \"astonishingly authentic.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm assuming a positive review and scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong praise for the lead performance using superlatives like 'marvel' and 'astonishing authenticity,' indicating clear enthusiasm. However, as only one curated excerpt is available, the score is conservatively placed in the upper Positive range per the single-excerpt guidelines, despite the critic's original rating of 87 suggesting a Rave.",
