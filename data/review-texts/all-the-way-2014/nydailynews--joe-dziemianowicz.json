The original rating of 80 aligns with a solid positive assessment. | Gemini: The review explicitly praises Bryan Cranston's performance as masterful and calls the drama gripping, indicating a positive recommendation. The original rating of 80 aligns with this assessment. | Kimi: The critic provides unqualified praise using superlatives like 'masterful' and 'gripping', and the explicit 80/100 rating confirms a strong positive recommendation in the upper-mid range of the Positive bucket.",
