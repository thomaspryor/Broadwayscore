However, confidence is low due to very limited excerpt text. | GPT-4o: The review praises Cranston's performance and describes the drama as compelling, though it notes the play is somewhat sprawling. The excerpt suggests a positive recommendation with some reservations, but due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Cranston's performance and calls the drama \"compelling\" but also \"somewhat sprawling,\" suggesting a positive but not rave review. The limited text makes confidence low. | Kimi: The critic offers high praise for Cranston's lead performance ('towering') while offering a qualified positive assessment of the play itself ('compelling if somewhat sprawling'), indicating a solid but not unreserved recommendation.",
