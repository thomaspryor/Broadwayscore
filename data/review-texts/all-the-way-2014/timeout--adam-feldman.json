    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance using 'triumph' and highlighting 'remarkable authenticity'. Aligns with original 80 rating. However, this appears to be a truncated excerpt focusing only on one element, so confidence is medium. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 80 aligns with a strong positive review. The key quote praises Cranston's performance as a 'triumph', indicating a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses the word \"triumph\" to describe Cranston's performance, indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given the original rating of 80, a score slightly above that within the Positive bucket is appropriate. | Kimi: The critic hails Cranston's performance as a 'triumph' with 'remarkable authenticity,' aligning with the provided 4/5 (80) rating that falls squarely in the Positive bucket.",
