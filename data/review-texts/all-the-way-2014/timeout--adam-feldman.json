Limited text focuses only on one element, hence medium confidence. | Gemini: The review praises Cranston's performance as a 'triumph' and highlights its 'remarkable authenticity,' indicating a positive assessment. The original rating of 80 aligns with this classification. | Kimi: The critic assigns an 80/100 rating and uses superlatives like 'triumph' and 'remarkable authenticity' to praise the lead performance, indicating a strong recommendation despite the truncated text.",
