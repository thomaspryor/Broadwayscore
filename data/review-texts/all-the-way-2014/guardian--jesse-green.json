However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, and the score is on the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Cranston's performance as a \"towering achievement,\" indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the strength of the praise warrants a high score within the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the central performance using superlatives like 'towering achievement,' indicating a clear recommendation. However, as a single curated quote focusing on one element, confidence is low regarding the full review's comprehensive verdict.",
