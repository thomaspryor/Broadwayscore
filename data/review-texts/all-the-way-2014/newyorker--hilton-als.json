    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with unqualified praise ('magnificent') for the lead performance. However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of positive quotes. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Cranston's performance as 'magnificent,' suggesting a positive view of his portrayal. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of broader context, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses solely on praising Cranston's performance as Johnson, using the word \"magnificent.\" Given the limited text, it's difficult to gauge the overall sentiment, but the strong praise suggests a positive recommendation, so I've placed it in the positive bucket with a higher score. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains unambiguously positive language ('magnificent') regarding the lead performance. Following single-excerpt guidelines for clearly positive quotes, scored in upper Positive range (80-84). Low confidence due to limited context about overall production quality.",
