  "bwwExcerpt": "'All the Way' replays the battles of the Freedom Summer, many neatly drawn between North and South or black and white. But there's so much procedural material rehashed in the cluttered drama it can feel as if you were being smacked upside the head with a Robert Caro volume...Director Bill Rauch, of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival...energizes the material when he can, often with unexpected juxtapositions...'All the Way' probably isn't a play that would make it to Broadway without an enormous draw as the lead--the real threat to LBJ's campaign here is the proselytizing. It's a story for diehard politicos, students of the civil rights movement or those who enjoy the social capital of saying they've seen one of the top TV actors of our generation in a drama that lets him flex serious muscle.",

The appeal seems limited to specific audiences, suggesting a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the play's draw due to the lead actor and its appeal to specific audiences, but also points out its cluttered nature and procedural material, suggesting a mixed experience. | Kimi: The review criticizes the cluttered, preachy script but acknowledges the lead actor's star power and director's intermittent energy, ultimately recommending the show only for niche audiences interested in civil rights history or seeing the star perform.",
