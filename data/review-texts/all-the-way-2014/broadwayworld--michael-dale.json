  "bwwExcerpt": "A little bit U.S. Senate and a little bit New York Philharmonic, designer Christopher Acebo's spacious set, given location specificity through a parade of scenes byShawn Sagady's projections, help the free-flowing pageantry of Robert Schenkkan's exciting and energetic drama, All The Way, gallop full speed in director Bill Rauch's pulse-racing production. At the center of a top-notch ensemble isBryan Cranston, portraying our 36th president with that memorable thick Texas drawl, a commanding presence, a quick mind and a ferocious temper. He is indeed a skilled conductor; ruthlessly political, bullying, foul-mouthed and often insensitive to those who show him the most loyalty, all for the cause of promoting the sweet harmony of civil rights with a minimal amount of rioting.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for multiple elements: 'exciting and energetic drama,' 'pulse-racing production,' 'top-notch ensemble,' and detailed appreciation of Cranston's performance. However, single excerpt limits full context assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the production's energy and excitement, highlighting the set design and Bryan Cranston's commanding performance. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly positive view. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"exciting and energetic drama\", \"pulse-racing production\", and \"top-notch ensemble\", indicating a positive recommendation. The description of Cranston's performance is also highly complimentary. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's design, direction, and lead performance using words like 'exciting,' 'pulse-racing,' and 'top-notch.' However, as a single curated quote, it may not represent the full review sentiment.",
