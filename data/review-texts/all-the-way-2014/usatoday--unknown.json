  "bwwExcerpt": "ohnson has similar concerns about both King and Hoover, and most of the men he deals with, and expresses them even more colorfully when not on guard. Schenkkan embraces LBJ's well-documented penchant for raw language, and other traits, without reserve - and Cranston plays them with relish. Strutting gut-first and affecting a gruff Southern drawl, the leading man delivers the emphatic, crowd-pleasing performance that the play, and Bill Rauch's vigorous direction, require, while also making Johnson affecting as a flesh-and-blood human being.",

Single excerpt limits confidence, but tone suggests strong recommendation for the performances. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Cranston's performance as 'emphatic' and 'crowd-pleasing,' suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the positive aspects of the performance and direction, suggesting a recommendation. The phrase \"crowd-pleasing performance\" indicates a positive experience. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for Cranston's 'crowd-pleasing' and 'affecting' lead performance and Bill Rauch's 'vigorous' direction, indicating a definite recommendation. Confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation.",
