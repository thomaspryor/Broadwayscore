  "bwwExcerpt": "Bartlett Sher, who staged Odets' riveting family drama 'Awake and Sing!' in 2006, directs with an emphasis on period style. Nowadays, most play revivals are headlined by a single, well-known film star. 'Golden Boy,' on the other hand, has been cast with an abundance of excellent stage actors, including not just Shalhoub and Numrich but also Danny Burstein, Jonathan Hadary, Anthony Crivello and Danny Mastrogiorgio. Numrich, who most recently appeared in 'War Horse,' makes a convincing transition from cockeyed youth to restless and reckless champ while exposing Bonaparte's insecurities. Shalhoub, who is best known for his comedic work, is genuinely touching in the father role. Yvonne Strahovski, one of very few females in the cast, more than satisfies as the seemingly hard-as-nails dame who engages in an affair with Joe on top of her other affair with Joe's manager.",
