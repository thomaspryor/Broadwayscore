  "bwwExcerpt": "What are the odds of a commercial producer being able to finance the revival of a three-act straight play calling for some 20 thesps decked out in pricey period costumes and performing on a multi-unit set? That sort of reclamation work is generally left to nonprofit theaters, which operate with publicly assisted funding. A half-dozen years after honoring that mandate with his muscular Lincoln Center revival of Clifford Odets' 'Awake and Sing,' Bartlett Sher returns to the helm with a dynamite version of 'Golden Boy.' It's no act of charity, either, because the show is killer good.",
