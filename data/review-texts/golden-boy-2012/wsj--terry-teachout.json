  "bwwExcerpt": "I can't praise Lincoln Center Theater too strongly for daring to revive a near-forgotten, expensive-to-mount play like 'Golden Boy,' then giving it a production so unostentatiously true to the script that you'll scarcely spend any time at all being impressed by the excellence of its staging. All you'll see is the play, and you'll go home wondering why nobody ever told you how great 'Golden Boy' is.",
