  "bwwExcerpt": "Between Boy Willie and Berniece, their uncle Doaker plays peacemaker. It's something of a shock here to see Samuel L. Jackson (husband of LaTanya) put aside his alpha-male persona, honed not only in the movies but in that original 1987 production of 'The Piano Lesson,' in which he played Boy Willie. Our memories of those past, very different performances go a long way toward making this Doaker a most effective referee, even though he consistently agrees with his niece. More visceral is the slow onstage collapse delivered by Michael Potts in the role of the dissolute uncle, Wining Boy. By nearly matching the size and intensity of Washington's performance, Potts shows that his character's inebriated present is more likely to be Boy Willie's future than anything represented by the level-headed Doaker.",
