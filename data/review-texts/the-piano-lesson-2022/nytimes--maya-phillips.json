  "bwwExcerpt": "And yet even among Wilson's outstanding and occasionally surreal plays, 'The Piano Lesson,' both a family drama and a ghost story, stands out as one of the odder works. It's a mix of themes and tones, both concrete and ethereal, ghoulish and comedic, but the imbalanced direction here, by LaTanya Richardson Jackson, overemphasizes the horror too literally; it works best on a metaphorical level.",
