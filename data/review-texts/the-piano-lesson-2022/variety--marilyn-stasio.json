  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The play’s characters are so individually well-formed and collectively solid that their voices have a way of lingering in the mind, and Wilson’s language is dramatic lyricism of a very high order.\"\n\nRead more",
  "bwwExcerpt": "Wilson clearly loves his characters and gives each one a big solo moment in the spotlight. Even the ghosts of the dead make themselves heard - chiefly Sutter, who manages to spook everyone by chasing bad-boy Willie Boy all the way north to Pittsburgh to plague him. Designers Beowulf Boritt (set), Japhy Weideman (lighting), and Scott Lehrer (sound) have given the dead man a good welcome, and he seems to get along with all the other haunts in the house.",
