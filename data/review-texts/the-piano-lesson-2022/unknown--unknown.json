    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt acknowledges Wilson's writing quality but criticizes the production's pacing and length as dragging, with repetitive dialogue creating déjà vu. However, with only one excerpt available, the full review's verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the pacing and repetitive dialogue, suggesting the show is tedious. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low as the full context is missing. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the play \"drags on\" and has \"repetitive dialogue\", suggesting a negative experience. Given that this is the only excerpt available, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified criticism: while acknowledging the source material's quality ('eloquent writing'), it emphasizes significant flaws including excessive length ('drags on'), repetitive dialogue, and a 'nagging sensation of déjà vu' that detract from the experience. With only one excerpt available, confidence is low, but the tone suggests the critic does not recommend this production.",
