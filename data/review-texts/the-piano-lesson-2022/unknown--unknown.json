    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt acknowledges Wilson's writing quality but criticizes the production as dragging and repetitive. However, with only one cherry-picked excerpt available, the full review verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights significant criticism of the show's pacing and dialogue, suggesting a negative view. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the play drags on despite the eloquent writing, suggesting a negative experience due to pacing issues. Given that this is the only excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges the source material's quality ('eloquent writing') but delivers substantial criticism regarding the production's pacing ('drags on') and repetitive nature, suggesting significant reservations without being a total dismissal.",
