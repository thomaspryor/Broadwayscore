    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Critic suggests the show would be better in a completely different format without its book, implying the current theatrical presentation is fundamentally flawed. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a significant flaw in the production, implying that the new book detracts from the show. However, without more context, the overall tone is unclear, leading to a low confidence negative classification. | Gemini: The critic suggests a different format would have been better, implying dissatisfaction with the current production. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt criticizes the book as a flawed element that should have been eliminated, while implying the underlying musical material is strong enough to sustain a concert format. Without the full review context, this reads as a mixed assessment—acknowledging the content's appeal but rejecting the current Broadway production structure.",
