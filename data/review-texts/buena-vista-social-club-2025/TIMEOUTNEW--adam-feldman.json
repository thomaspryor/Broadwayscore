  "fullText": "Posted in Broadway , Theater Reviews Buena Vista Social Club Broadway Review Author: New York Theater Published Date: March 19, 2025 Leave a Comment on Buena Vista Social Club Broadway Review As a band and a brand, “Buena Vista Social Club” has been gold from the get-go: It was a hit Grammy-winning album that in 1996 had brought together an impromptu group of old-time Cuban musicians into a vintage 1950s recording studio in Havana. The album’s popularity turned some long-forgotten musicians into stars, which led to international tours, an acclaimed 1999 documentary, and then another film 18 years later. In 2023, it became an exciting Off-Broadway musical. “Buena Vista Social Club” is now an even better Broadway musical, opening tonight at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater. With many of the same multitalented singers, dancers and musicians who performed Off-Broadway, the show gets a far larger stage and more elaborate sound system for its electrifying concert of addictive rhythmic Cuban music. It again overlays a plot that alternates between two timelines &#8212; the making of the album in 1996, and the lives of the musicians involved forty years earlier, both eras still centering around singer Omara Portuondo, who is portrayed In the 1990s by Natalie Venetia Belcon and in the 1950s by newcomer Isa Antonetti. In the transfer to Broadway, the plot is sharper, and the musical numbers even more engaging. In my review two years ago, I wrote that I would have loved a program note that told us more about the music. They listened! The playbill now features a separate illustrated nine-page booklet that explains the story behind fifteen of the songs in the show – bolero, mambo, Afro-son, lullaby, descarga -style Cuban jazz – including snippets of the Spanish lyrics translated into English. Justin Cunningham as Juan de Marcos , Marco Paguia (seated at piano), Renecito Avich as Eliades, Natalie Venetia Belcon as Omara Portuondo, percussionist Román Diaz The page about “De Camino a la Vereda” (Off the Road, Onto the Trail) describes it as “straight talk for a friend who keeps leaving his woman for the next young thing. The song was originally written by Ibrahim Ferrer in the 1950s when he toured Cuba as a backup singer, but it was not recorded until four decades later at Egrem Studios as part of the original Buena Vista Social Club album.” The page about “Silencio” (Silence) composed in 1932 by Rafael Hernandez Marin, “a jibarito (country boy) with the soul of a poet,” includes a quote from Omara Portuondo: “Ibrahim Ferrer asked me to sing Silencio with him, and for me that was a highlight of my life…..We had worked together in the past, but to find ourselves together again after so many years was a big thing. It was impossible for me to keep back the tears…” I excerpt the info about these particular songs, because Ibrahim Ferrer and Omara Portuondo were two of the album’s perfomers who became superstars, and because their relationship is a focus of the plot, and something of the beating heart of the musical. We are warned near the beginning of the show by Juan de Marcos (portrayed by Justin Cunningham), a driving force behind the album, that “some of what follows is true. Some of it only feels true.” Both statements seem to apply to the story of Ibrahim and Omara. I sa Antonetti as Young Omari In 1956, 19-year-old Omara and her sister Haydee (Ashley De La Rosa) are singing as the Portuondo Sisters at the famed Tropicana, a swanky nightclub that caters to high-rolling tourists. Haydee hopes the gig will lead to an American recording contract that will get them out of Cuba, which is at the precipice of revolution, and enable them to tour the world. Omara is already less eager to leave, and more drawn to old Cuban music, when they meet their substitute accompanists for the gig (their regular backups unable to attend), guitarist Compay Segundo (Da’Von Moody) and pianist Ruben Gonzalez (Leonardo Reyna). After the gig, the two idly play “Veinte Anos” (composed in 1935 by Maria Teresa Vera and by the eventually unmasked lyricist Guillermina Aramburu, a song about a secret heartbreak.) Omara sings along. Impressed with her rendition – “You sing with so much feeling.” – they invite her to “this place in Marianao” where they are playing later that night “Marianao? Isn’t that dangerous?” “It’s a black establishment, so people make certain assumptions, But I promise you, it’s safe, and most importantly, no one tells us what to play.” The place is called the Buena Vista Social Club. Natalie Venetia Belcon as Omara, Mel Semé (foreground) as Ibrahim and Wesley Wray as Young Ibrahim This is where she meets young Ibrahim (Wesley Wray), who sings Bruca Manigua (composed in 1937 by Aresenio Rodriguez, “a slave’s cry for humanity” its lyrics woven with African words, a song that was “a bolt of lightning and a complete turning point in Cuban music.” Sparks fly. Their relationship – an interracial one – is now much more clearly romantic. Off-Br...",
