Single excerpt warning requires conservative scoring within positive range. | GPT-4o: The review highlights strong positive elements like the music and dance, suggesting a recommendation, but notes a significant flaw in the book. This indicates a positive review with reservations. | Gemini: The review indicates that the music and dance are strong enough to overcome the weak book, suggesting a positive but not rave recommendation.
