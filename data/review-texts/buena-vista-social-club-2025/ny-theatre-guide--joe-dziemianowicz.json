  "fullText": "'Buena Vista Social Club' Broadway review — musical brings the vibrant sounds of Cuba to BroadwayRead our review of Buena Vista Social Club on Broadway, a new musical inspired by the band, Grammy-winning album, and Oscar-nominated film of the same name.Joe DziemianowiczMarch 19, 2025, 00:00It’s easy to like a show that knows itself. Between the first words of the script — a stage direction, “We begin with music” — to the final bow — by the onstage band — the infectiously exuberant and joyous Buena Vista Social Club tells and shows exactly what it’s about. The subject here is the singular sound of old-school Cuban music and artists who made it, a sonic sensation that was captured on a milestone 1990s album recorded in Havana that shares its name with the musical. Songs — they’re all sung in Spanish — from the Grammy-winning record including “Candela,” “Dos Gardenias,” and “El Cuarto de Tula” thread through the show, constantly making audience members’ heads bob and bodies wriggle to the beat. “A sound like this,” a character teases early on, “it tends to travel.” And how. The album went on to become a global hit and inspired a documentary and the musical, which premiered off Broadway in 2023. Traveling to Broadway's Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, Marco Ramirez's script that mixes fact and imagination is slimmer. A gun-running subplot? Gone. A critique of colorism? Essentially reduced to a line. The musical covers two time frames. In the ’50s, singers Omara Portuondo and her sister Haydee face divergent futures and careers. In the ’90s, an older Omara eventually finds her way back to the “old songs” and BVSC band members with whom she shares history: guitarist Compay Segundo, vocalist Ibrahim Ferrer, and pianist Rubén González. Unapologetically sentimental, the slender story gets the job done. Choreography by Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck is explosive. Director Saheem Ali’s production mambos across time, all while showcasing the BVSC music. Buena Vista Social Club summary Based on the acclaimed 1997 album and documentary of the same name, the Buena Vista Social Club musical transports audiences to Havana, celebrating the rich cultural heritage of Cuba while highlighting the journey of legendary BVSC musicians who were rediscovered in their later years. The show has arrived on Broadway following its world premiere in 2023 with Atlantic Theater Company. What to expect at Buena Vista Social Club Since the musical takes place in Revolution-era Cuba as well as 40 years later, principal characters are played by two actors to depict when they are young and, as Ramirez’s script amusingly puts it, “less young.” Omara, a featured singer on the album who here anchors the time-leaping plot of the musical, has the most intriguing arc. Isa Antonetti, a powerhouse vocalist, plays her as a hopeful young woman finding her own voice and path in Cuba. Natalie Venetia Belcon, who played Gary Coleman in Avenue Q, impresses as she shoulders the older Omara, who’s haunted by past decisions tied to the BVSC and has turned away from performing. She finds a way to finally make peace with her past and herself. Her source of healing, of course, is the music. What audiences are saying about Buena Vista Social Club Buena Vista Social Club has an 81% audience approval rating on the review aggregator Show-Score, with theatregoers hailing its vibrancy and singularity. “Feels more like a Cuban concert than an actual show. If you know that going in or you speak Spanish fluently, it’ll definitely be a better time than if you didn’t know that.” Show-Score user George R 3147 “This was such a unique night on Broadway. It’s unlike any other show running right now. A real vibrant and sensual experience that is incredibly heartfelt and rousing.” Show-Score user Eric8620 “This show is a must-see. BVSC was spectacular!
