  "fullText": "They masterfully deliver variously swinging or sorrowful or sensual arrangements of vintage heartbreakers like “Dos Gardenias” that illustrate and/or decorate a nostalgic, at times dramatic, storyline set mostly in mid-1950s Havana as the coming Cuban Revolution smolders. I am no authority on Afro-Cuban anything, but it is wonderfully easy to drown in the dreamy music lovingly being made by the artists who light up the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre.",
