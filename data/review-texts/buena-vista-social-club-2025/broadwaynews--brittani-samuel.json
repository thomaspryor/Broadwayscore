With only one cherry-picked excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively in the mixed range. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges issues with the acting but highlights the 'sonic brilliance,' suggesting a balance of positive and negative elements. The single excerpt and aggregator context suggest a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws in acting but praises the music. This suggests a mixed experience where the strengths outweigh the weaknesses but not enough for a positive recommendation.",
