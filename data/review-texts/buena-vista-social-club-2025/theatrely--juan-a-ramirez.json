  "bwwExcerpt": "On a recent Saturday matinee, the roars of the crowd following every song were akin to a [insert any popstar] at MSG. The music won the world over in the late nineties for a reason. Its delicious blend of Cuban rhythm and Afro-Cuban percussion harkens back to the heyday and Golden era of Havana, yet feels timeless and perfect for today. It’s a sound we don’t get all that often on Broadway, and boy, do I hope it stays a while.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the music and audience response with enthusiastic recommendation for the show to stay, but limited to single excerpt so confidence is medium. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a highly positive evaluation of the music, describing it as timeless and perfect for today. The enthusiastic tone and hope for the show's longevity suggest a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower the confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt is very positive, praising the music and expressing hope that it stays on Broadway. Given the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, but the enthusiasm suggests a strong positive score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the show's music and electric crowd atmosphere, with the critic explicitly endorsing its continued Broadway run. As a single curated excerpt, the full context of the review is unknown.",
