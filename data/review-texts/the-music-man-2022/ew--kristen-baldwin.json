The critic's 87 rating confirms positive territory. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 87 aligns with a strong positive recommendation. The review highlights Jackman's performance as a key reason to see the revival, despite some reservations about recapturing the original's magic. | Gemini: The review states the revival is \"worthwhile\" due to Jackman's performance, but acknowledges it doesn't reach the level of the original production, indicating a positive but not rave recommendation. | Kimi: The critic explicitly calls the show 'worthwhile' due to the star's performance, indicating a clear recommendation, but the caveat about failing to match the original production's magic keeps it from being an unqualified rave.",
