The text praises Jackman's performance as making the revival worthwhile, despite some reservations about recapturing the original's magic. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the revival is \"worthwhile\" due to Jackman's performance, but acknowledges it doesn't fully recapture the original's magic, indicating a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: The critic's explicit 87/100 rating places this in the Rave range, and while noting the production doesn't match the original, clearly recommends it as worthwhile.",
