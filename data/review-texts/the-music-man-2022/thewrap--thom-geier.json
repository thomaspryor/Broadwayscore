  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Jerry Zaks' production is a throwback in just about every sense, for good and for bad. There are elaborate sets (by Santo Loquasto, who also did the costumes) with backdrops that suggest the work of Grant Wood - at one point, two chorus members even re-create 'American Gothic.' There's an orchestra of two dozen musicians and a cast of 40 that sometimes seems as crowded upstage as one of those high school productions that accepts everybody who auditions. Disconcertingly, there are also six principals - Tony winners all - who reinforce the glaring lack of diversity in 21st-century Broadway revivals as much as in 1912 Iowa.",
