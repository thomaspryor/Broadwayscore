  "bwwExcerpt": "Jackman runs the show, it's his show as Harold Hill. He's deflated physically from playing Wolverine, probably from all the dancing, and the non stop action. He is what you look for in a Broadway leading man, full of charisma and optimism. He beams light from the stage. For me, though, it's all about Sutton Foster. They've even created a big tap dance number at the end of the show just for her (Jackman joins her but it's spotlight). When Sutton Foster grins you can see it from all over the theater. I was at the back of the orchestra but it was clear to see how much she was enjoying the show.",
