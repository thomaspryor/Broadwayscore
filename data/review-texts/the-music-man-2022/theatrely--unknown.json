  "bwwExcerpt": "Unlike, say, the daringly iconoclastic revival of Oklahoma! that played Broadway a few years back, this production of Meredith Willson's classic musical proudly revels in its old-fashionedness. Why mess with something that isn't broken, it seems to be asking, especially since we've got our stars as our ace in the hole. From his first surprise entrance (at least to those who have never seen the musical before) to his showstopping numbers 'Ya Got Trouble' and 'Seventy-Six Trombones' to his climactic moment, when he stares directly at the audience with a smile that seems to contain more gleaming teeth than there are stars in heaven, Jackman has the audience in the palm of his hand. And when Sutton finally gets to shed her character's decorousness and let loose her tremendous dancing chops, there's definitely no more trouble in River City.",
