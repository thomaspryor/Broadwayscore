  "bwwExcerpt": "Marian's 'My White Knight' has been expanded by restoring a long and busy introduction that was cut from the original production. Foster speeds through the latter song so fast you'd hardly recognize it as one of The Music Man's oases of dreamy lyricism. What you get is comedy; what you lose, here and elsewhere, is the contrast of opposites-and attendant sexual chemistry-between Marian and Hill. Foster and Jackman seem to have fun together in the curtain call, tap dancing in matching white bandleader outfits, but their romance is otherwise half-hearted.",
