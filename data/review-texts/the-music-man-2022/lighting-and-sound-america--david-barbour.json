  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It's always good to see The Music Man, one of the greatest musicals of Broadway's golden age. An affectionately satirical portrait of turn-of-the-last-century Midwest, its humor is worthy of James Thurber. Meredith Willson's distinctive, highly original score is a grand parade of patter songs, marches, ballads, and barbershop quartets. And Jerry Zaks' starry, splashy production fills every inch of the stage. A good time is all but guaranteed -- if you don't mind a pair of questionably cast stars and some unwanted textural tampering.”\n\nRead more",
