  "bwwExcerpt": "It is rare for a musical to have a stronger second act than first, with most outings' ambitions meeting their limits by the time the stakes are set. Kushner's story, which might fare better as a tight one-acter, has somewhat of a bumbling start as it muddles through its introduction of characters, plot, and artistic flights of fancy. Longhurst's direction valiantly makes its way through these flaws, and ends with a masterstroke of lighting (by Jack Knowles) and stagin",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The text appears truncated mid-sentence. The excerpt describes a 'bumbling start' and muddled first act, but notes the second act is stronger and praises the direction and staging. Without the full conclusion, this seems like a qualified, uneven assessment. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges flaws in the first act and suggests the story might work better as a one-acter, but also highlights a strong second act and commendable direction. The single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes a flawed start but hints at a stronger second act and praises the direction and staging. This suggests a mixed experience overall, but with potential. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the book's bumbling first act but praises the direction as valiant and the ending as a masterstroke, suggesting the production overcomes script weaknesses. Single excerpt and truncation warrant low confidence.",
