  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Too much of the insistently rhythmic music lacks variety, the best moments coming in the klezmer sequence and in Clarke’s tear-down-the-house, eleven o’clock number, “Lot’s Wife”… Still, this isn’t a show with takeaway songs. Caroline, or Change’s two hours and 15 minutes are overlong, but by the time it ends, you’ll understand why it’s here and why now couldn’t be a better time to have it around.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic acknowledges significant flaws (music lacks variety, overlong, no takeaway songs) but concludes with clear endorsement of the show's relevance and timing. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges issues with the music's variety and the show's length, but ultimately suggests a positive relevance and timing for the production. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's length as a drawback, but ultimately suggests that the show is worthwhile and timely. Given the single excerpt and the mixed tone, a score in the lower-middle of the positive range seems appropriate. | Kimi: While the excerpt contains significant criticisms regarding the music's lack of variety and the show's length, it ultimately delivers a positive verdict emphasizing the production's timely relevance and necessity.",
