However, the review is brief, leading to medium confidence. | Gemini: The review highlights a 'towering performance' and 'devastating emotional depth,' indicating a positive experience, though brief, it is a clear recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance ('towering', 'devastating emotional depth'), indicating a solid recommendation, though the brevity of the text limits certainty about the overall production verdict.",
