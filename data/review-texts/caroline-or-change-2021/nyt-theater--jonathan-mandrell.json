However, confidence is low due to truncated text cutting off mid-sentence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a standout performance and describes the audience as thrilled, suggesting a positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes a breathtaking performance and a thrilled audience, suggesting a positive experience. The phrase \"my enthusiasm...comes not jus\" suggests more praise is coming. | Kimi: The excerpt expresses strong enthusiasm for the revival, praising the lead performance as 'breathtaking' and the creative collaboration as 'inventive, thoughtful and affecting.'
