  "bwwExcerpt": "Some of director Michael Longhurst's ideas pay off (displaying the town's statute of a Confederate soldier both before and after it is vandalized, emphasizing the swampy physical environment, a post-climactic rainfall special effect) and others are awkwardly inserted and strained (having many scenes performed on a narrow balcony level, incorporating a turntable). \"Caroline, or Change\" ought to be better appreciated today. Not only have people had more time to absorb its score",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt describes mixed directorial choices - some successful, others problematic. Text cuts off mid-sentence about appreciation, suggesting incomplete assessment. Mixed bucket with low confidence due to limited, potentially cherry-picked excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a balanced view, noting both successful and awkward elements of the production. The lack of a clear positive or negative verdict suggests a mixed review. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents both positive and negative aspects of the direction, suggesting a mixed overall impression. The lack of a clear recommendation and the limited text contribute to the low confidence. | Kimi: While acknowledging uneven directorial choices—praising some staging effects but finding others awkwardly inserted—the excerpt concludes that the show deserves greater appreciation, suggesting a qualified but genuine recommendation.",
