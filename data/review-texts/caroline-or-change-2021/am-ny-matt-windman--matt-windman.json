  "bwwExcerpt": "Some of director Michael Longhurst's ideas pay off (displaying the town's statute of a Confederate soldier both before and after it is vandalized, emphasizing the swampy physical environment, a post-climactic rainfall special effect) and others are awkwardly inserted and strained (having many scenes performed on a narrow balcony level, incorporating a turntable). \"Caroline, or Change\" ought to be better appreciated today. Not only have people had more time to absorb its score",
