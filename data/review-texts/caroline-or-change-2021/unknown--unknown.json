This being a musical, the music is part of that; Tesori’s wondrous score is like the search function on a car radio, picking up snippets of every genre on the dial...Clarke, who won an Olivier award for her performance in the British production, adds hers. She makes of the maid an almost Shakespearean figure; even at the depths of the character’s despair.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: NY Times Critics' Pick with superlative language ('never less than thrilling', 'wondrous score', 'Shakespearean figure'). Single excerpt warning noted - clearly enthusiastic tone places this in upper Rave range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'never less than thrilling' and highlights the 'wondrous score' and a standout performance, indicating a highly positive evaluation. The 'NYTimes Critic's Pick' further supports a rave verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the phrase \"never less than thrilling\" and praises the score and the performance of the lead actress. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('thrilling', 'wondrous', 'Critic's Pick') for both Tesori's score and Clarke's performance, indicating a strong recommendation, though as a single curated excerpt, the overall verdict may not be fully represented. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
