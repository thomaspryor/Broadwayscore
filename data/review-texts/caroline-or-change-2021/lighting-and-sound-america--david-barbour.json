See it for Clarke; who knows when she will come our way again?\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic clearly recommends seeing the show ('See it for Clarke') but frames it as a qualified recommendation for a 'singular, indeed eccentric, piece that is not for all tastes.' Single excerpt warning applies - this appears to be a conditional positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the central characterization and score but notes the show is 'not for all tastes.' The recommendation to 'see it for Clarke' suggests a positive verdict with some reservations about the show's broader appeal. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's acclaim but also its eccentric nature, suggesting it's not for everyone. The recommendation is primarily driven by the lead performance, indicating a qualified positive. | Kimi: The critic explicitly commands readers to attend ('See it') while praising the powerful score and central characterization, though noting the show's singular, eccentric nature makes it not for all tastes.",
