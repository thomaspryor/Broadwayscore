  "bwwExcerpt": "The collision of musical styles and Kushner's clever, witty lyricism makes Caroline, Or Change a haunting, unforgettable musical. This critic loved its ambition, even if it was occasionally perplexing and opaque. Like Angels in America, the material fleshes out detail and the personal-trousers, musical instruments, comic books, lost coins, and bank notes-while also being proudly political, and showing how centrally politics exerts itself as a force on people's lives.",

Despite noting it's occasionally perplexing, the overall tone is enthusiastic recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the musical's ambition, clever lyricism, and its haunting nature, indicating a positive review. However, it also notes it can be perplexing and opaque, suggesting some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review calls the musical \"haunting, unforgettable\" and states the critic \"loved its ambition.\" Despite the caveat that it was \"occasionally perplexing and opaque,\" the overall tone is positive. | Kimi: The critic uses strong positive language ('loved', 'unforgettable', 'haunting', 'clever') and explicitly states admiration for the show's ambition, placing this in the upper range of Positive despite a minor caveat about opacity.",
