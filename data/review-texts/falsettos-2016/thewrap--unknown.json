  "bwwExcerpt": "t's very unlikely that William Finn will ever get a better production of his groundbreaking musical 'Falsettos' than the revival that opened Monday at the Walter Kerr Theatre. Top among its assets are leading men Christian Borle and Andrew Rannells, who play the not-always-well-matched lovers Marvin and Whizzer.",
