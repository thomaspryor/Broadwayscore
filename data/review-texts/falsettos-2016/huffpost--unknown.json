  "bwwExcerpt": "How does Falsettos look nearly 25 years on? Just great--with only the merest reservations that certainly don't have anything to do with the several brilliant Finn songs. They begin with the outrageous (particularly in Jennifer Caprio's Biblical costumes) opening number, 'Four Jews in a Room Bitching' and include Trina's 'I'm Breaking Down,' Marvin's 'What More Can I Say?' and Whizzer's 'The Games I Play.'",
