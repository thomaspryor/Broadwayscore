  "bwwExcerpt": "'It's about time, don't you think?' sings Marvin (Christian Borle) at the outset of the second act of Falsettos, and yes: It is. It's about time that William Finn and James Lapine's intimate, obstinate, heart-shattering 1992 musical has returned to Broadway, to poke us and amuse us and reduce us again to helpless tears. Few musicals have the range, idiosyncrasy and emotional punch of this profoundly unconventional and personal work. Directed by Lapine, the show's revival is very much about a specific Jewish family in the early 1980s, and while its story of a man who leaves his wife and child for a male lover may be less novel today, its larger truths continue to resonate. Seeing Falsettos now is like opening a time capsule and finding a mirror.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic's 80/100 rating clearly indicates a positive recommendation, and describing the revival as having both nostalgic value and urgent contemporary relevance suggests approval. However, confidence is low due to the extremely brief excerpt providing minimal evaluative content. | Gemini: The review is positive, stating the revival feels both nostalgic and contemporary. Given the original rating of 80, a score of 75 seems appropriate. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 80 places this firmly in the Positive bucket, and the text praises the revival as 'urgently contemporary,' indicating a worthwhile production despite the brevity of the excerpt.",
