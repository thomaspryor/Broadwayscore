  "bwwExcerpt": "Notwithstanding Mr. Finn's inability to write once-heard-never-forgotten tunes, the musical numbers are cleverly crafted and the overall tone is appropriately tart, this being a show in which no one is very likable. (The title of the first song, 'Four Jews in a Room Bitching,' sums up 'March of the Falsettos' pretty comprehensively.) In 'Falsettoland,' by contrast, a hideously painful situation is portrayed with a sincere but cloying sentimentality that occasionally curdles into kitsch. If you're old enough to have witnessed the AIDS epidemic at first hand, the second act of 'Falsettos' might just make you cry in spite of yourself. If not...well, it probably won't.",
