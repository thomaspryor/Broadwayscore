  "bwwExcerpt": "There are a handful of take-your-breath-away numbers in the new revival of the musical 'Falsettos,' now playing at the Walter Kerr Theatre on Broadway, but none quite so impressive as 'I'm Breaking Down,' a comic wail of despair sung by Stephanie J. Block. Playing Trina, whose husband Marvin (Christian Borle) has just left her for a man with the curious name of Whizzer (Andrew Rannells), Block manages to draw out both the comedy and anguish of this woman's unusual plight - sung all the while she's ostensibly making dinner. ('Let me turn on the gas / I saw them in the den / with Marvin grabbing Whizzer's ass.') Block sends the show to such dizzying heights that it takes the audience a few minutes to recover.",
