  "bwwExcerpt": "The sniffles you hear in the audience are prompted not just by what's happening to the characters, but by two of Finn's loveliest, most soul-stirring songs, 'Unlikely Lovers' and 'What Would I Do?' Directed with great empathy by James Lapine, who co-wrote the show's book with Finn, 'Falsettos' achieves the same power it had a quarter-century ago.",
