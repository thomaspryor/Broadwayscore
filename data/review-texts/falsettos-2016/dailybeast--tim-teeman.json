  "bwwExcerpt": "This is a true and unflinching study of relationships and humanity in all their shades. Its scale may be small-just seven characters, no fancy sets-but its emotion and power are epic, and that is written without exaggeration. When the lights come up all too quickly at the intermission and then at the end, you will-at least those without hearts of stone-be wiping away tears.",
