  "bwwExcerpt": "A family oriented musical about one kid and a half-dozen adults becoming fully realized humans, 'Falsettos' is grounded in ideas that came before gay liberation or AIDS. Is there a theme more universal than the mystery of why some people fall in love? This eloquent take bridges age and cultural boundaries and is as timeless as they come.",
