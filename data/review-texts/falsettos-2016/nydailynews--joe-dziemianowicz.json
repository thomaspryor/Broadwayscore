  "bwwExcerpt": "Finn's alternately lighthearted and poignant score in this mostly sung-through show is another major asset. While things get a bit heavy-handed as one man's life ends while another begins at a bar mitzvah, it's hard to grouse when you're being moved to tears. There are plenty of those - laughs, too - thanks to the uniformly wonderful cast. Borle, a two-time Tony winner, is very affecting as Marvin comes out and, finally, comes of age. Rannells, of 'Girls,' brings swagger and sweetness to the pragmatic Whizzer. Block is blessed with a couple of the show's best songs - 'I'm Breaking Down' and 'Holding to the Ground' - and does them proud. Both are stuck in my head. Even the scenery is eloquent in its own way. A huge gray Rubik's Cube-like set piece underscores the idea that the world is puzzling. Fitting since Trina sings: 'Life is never what you planned.' Plan on being deeply touched and richly satisfied at this show.",
