  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The production is lively and pointed without a whiff of tired...If the plot verges on predictable, the characters are another story...They are simple—as in clear, and accessible, and engaging...All the maneuvering for that love is informed by funny and complicated lyrics and ironically compatible harmonies. Direction is superb...I’m glad I saw 'Falsettos' in its current iteration and find it a period piece with enormous vitality.\" \n\nRead more",
