  "bwwExcerpt": "Although it's hard to separate these characters from the original actors, the cast is terrific. Borle brings out more of Marvin's 'want it all' selfishness and Rannells is more of a hunk. Lapine's direction is finely calibrated to be showy without being show-bizzy and, though David Rockwell's modular foam set pieces and silhouetted Manhattan skyline can get a bit monotonous, they support the passion by getting out of the play's powerful way.",
