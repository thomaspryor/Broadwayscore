  "bwwExcerpt": "There's no shortage of laughs, from tuneful one-liners (Jason: 'My father's a homo, my mother's not thrilled at all') to entire numbers (a knife-wielding Trina cracks up with a cutting board in 'I'm Breaking Down'). And act two's 'The Baseball Game' - 'We're watching Jewish boys who cannot play baseball play baseball,' the company sings as Jason haplessly swings - is a work of lyrical comic genius. Bonus points for the Sandy Koufax and Hank Greenberg references.",
