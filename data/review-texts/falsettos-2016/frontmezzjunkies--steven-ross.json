  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The music in 'Falsettos' is gorgeous and fun, complex and surprising...I wanted to cheer this whole show on from beginning to end. It’s fun and connecting. Beautiful, emotional, and engaging. Painful and sweet. But, there are also moments that feel dated and confusing...This could be one problem with keeping the same director (Lapine) as when it first played on Broadway...A new eye and different vision would have elevated this beautiful show to a higher level.\"\n\nRead more",
