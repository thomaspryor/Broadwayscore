Its fundamental subject is that mysterious, maddening, uplifting, life-complicating emotion we refer to as love, which hasn’t changed in 25 years.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Opens with near-perfection claim, uses superlatives like 'exhilarating' and 'devastating', praises direction as 'sharp' and lead performance as career-best. However, single excerpt warning requires medium confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides unqualified praise with superlatives ('exhilarating', 'devastating', 'perfection'). Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"exhilarating\", \"devastating\", and \"perfection\", indicating a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, I've scored it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains superlative praise ('perfection,' 'exhilarating') suggesting a rave, but following the single-excerpt guidance to score in the upper Positive range (80-84) due to limited context. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
