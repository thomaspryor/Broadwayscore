No redeeming qualities mentioned. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong negative language, comparing the musical unfavorably to another show and describing it as 'bloated' and 'benumbed'. | Gemini: The review uses strong negative language, comparing the show unfavorably to 'Man of La Mancha' to emphasize its lack of humor and overall poor quality, indicating a pan. | Kimi: The critic employs harsh descriptors ('bloated,' 'benumbed') and sarcastic comparison to condemn the show as excessively long and drearily serious, with no redeeming qualities mentioned.",
