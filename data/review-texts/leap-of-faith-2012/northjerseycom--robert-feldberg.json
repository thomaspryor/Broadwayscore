  "bwwExcerpt": "Esparza is a dynamic musical-theater performer, but the allegedly charismatic Jonas remains unappealing from beginning to end. And by bringing in, and trivializing, the question of the power of faith, the show feels particularly smarmy. 'Leap of Faith' attempts entertainment by manipulation, but you can see the wires all the way.",
