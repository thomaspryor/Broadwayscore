  "bwwExcerpt": "'Here's the beauty part,' brays charismatic evangelist Jonas Nightingale in 'Leap of Faith.' 'If they don't get their miracle, it's their fault; they didn't believe enough.' That sentiment handily describes the long-in-gestation musical -- first produced at the Ahmanson in 2010 -- that a motley clutch of producers has ushered into the St. James with a new director, book-writer, choreographer and leading lady in tow. Raul Esparza sizzles like a firecracker in this musicalization of the 1992 Steve Martin pic, but his wick is continually dampened by the pesky book, songs and staging.",
