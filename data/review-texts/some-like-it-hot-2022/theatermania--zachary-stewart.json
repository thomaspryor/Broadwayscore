However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('sizzling', 'not to be missed'), indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"sizzling example\" and \"not to be missed\", indicating a rave review. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('sizzling', 'everything Broadway does best') and explicit must-see recommendation, but confidence is low given limited context.",
