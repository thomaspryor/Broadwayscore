  "bwwExcerpt": "There are references throughout to the unfairness of society’s role for women in the 1930s (“No men?” asks one bandmember sarcastically. “But who’s gonna talk over us?”) One curious weapon the book writers have come up with to even the score and get men to listen to them is, well, scatting. Sometimes musical theater has its own magic, I guess. To steal a key line from the film that makes it to the musical, “nobody’s perfect.” Yet this show is very nearly that.",

This indicates a strong positive sentiment, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive assessment, highlighting the show's ability to capture a specific spirit and humor. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic praises the show for capturing an 'anarchic spirit and humor' that previous 'men-in-dress' shows were unable or unwilling to achieve, indicating a clear recommendation for this production.",
