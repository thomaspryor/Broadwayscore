    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Describes the musical as having 'wobbly quality' and unfavorably compares it to its source material, suggesting disappointment. However, this is only one excerpt and may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a 'wobbly quality' in comparison to the 'greatness' of the source material, suggesting mixed feelings. However, with only one excerpt, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a negative comparison to the source material, suggesting the musical falls short. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the negative sentiment is clear. | Kimi: The single excerpt describes the production as having 'wobbly quality' that suffers by comparison to the classic film, indicating an uneven, disappointing show. With only one curated quote available and the text truncated, the full verdict is unclear. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",
