    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear appreciation for the production's comedic focus and execution, with the vivid 'Jell-O on springs' metaphor suggesting energetic, effective staging. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive tone by highlighting the production's understanding of its comedic elements, which implies a successful execution. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context necessitate a cautious approach, leading to a low confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt emphasizes the show's successful comedic elements and the understanding of the cast and crew, suggesting a positive experience. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the production's comedic priorities and lively pacing, indicating a positive recommendation, though the single-quote limitation necessitates low confidence.",
