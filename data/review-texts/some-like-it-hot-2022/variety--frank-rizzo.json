    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('swell performances', 'dandy', 'razzmatazz', 'whole lotta energy') with only minor caveat about songs. The 'Nobody's perfect' ending suggests overall endorsement despite flaws. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances, engaging twists, and energetic dancing, suggesting a positive recommendation. The mild critique of the songs is outweighed by the overall enthusiasm. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the performances, twists, dancing, and energy, but notes that the songs don't always score high marks. This suggests a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's performances, choreography, and energy using upbeat language ('swell,' 'dandy,' 'razzmatazz'), while dismissing concerns about the songs with a playful 'Nobody's perfect.' Single excerpt limits confidence.",
