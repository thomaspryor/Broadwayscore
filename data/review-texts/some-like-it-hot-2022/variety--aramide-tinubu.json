    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('succeeds', 'stellar performances', 'depth and nuance') but single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. Upper positive range given unqualified praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances as 'stellar' and notes the success of the musical, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. However, with only a single excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates the musical \"succeeds\" due to stellar performances, suggesting a positive recommendation. With only one excerpt available, I'm placing it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise with words like 'succeeds' and 'stellar,' clearly recommending the show based on its performances. However, confidence is reduced to 'low' due to the single-excerpt warning, which means the full review context may differ.",
