    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic acknowledges initial skepticism about the premise but concludes the show successfully transforms a problematic concept into something praiseworthy ('pure lemonade'). However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive transformation of a potentially outdated concept into something enjoyable, indicating a recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates that the show successfully transformed a potentially outdated concept into something enjoyable, suggesting a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive sentiment warrants a score on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Despite initial skepticism about the dated cross-dressing comedy premise, the critic praises the production's intelligent execution using the strong metaphor of turning a 'lemon' into 'pure lemonade,' indicating a clear recommendation.",
