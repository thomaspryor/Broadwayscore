  "bwwExcerpt": "As directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw (“The Book of Mormon,” “Something Rotten!”), “Some Like It Hot” is a fresh, splashy and fast-paced delight. The book, by Matthew Lopez (“The Inheritance”) and comedian Amber Ruffin, carefully reconceives the original characters and make cross-dressing into something more than just a joke.",

Single excerpt warning applies - this appears to be a qualified positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges some flaws in the score but ultimately recommends the show as 'more than worth celebrating'. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show is \"more than worth celebrating\" despite some reservations about the score. Given the single excerpt, the confidence is medium. | Kimi: While the critic criticizes the score as 'derivative and serviceable at best,' the concluding verdict enthusiastically recommends the show ('more than worth celebrating'), placing it firmly in the Positive bucket.",
