The mention of 'occasional lapses into preachiness' suggests minor reservations, but the overall tone is positive. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive experience, describing the show as \"joyfully ridiculous\" and a \"really Hot time,\" but acknowledges some \"lapses into preachiness,\" suggesting a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production's atmosphere and tone ('perfect atmosphere', 'joyfully ridiculous', 'really Hot time'), with only a minor reservation about occasional preachiness, indicating a clear positive recommendation.",
