    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language with 'fizzy delight' and praise for capturing the original's spirit while finding theatrical voice. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the enthusiasm suggests upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'fizzy delight' and praises its ability to capture the spirit of the original while establishing its own voice, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"fizzy delight\" and \"captures the spirit,\" indicating a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring towards the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The single excerpt uses enthusiastic language ('fizzy delight') and praises the adaptation for capturing the original's spirit while finding its own voice, indicating a clear recommendation. Scored at the upper end of the Positive bucket per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts.",
