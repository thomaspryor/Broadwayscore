With only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a mixed assessment, praising the lyrics but criticizing the music as \"merely peppy, repetitive and, yes, loud.\" Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers conflicting assessments—praising the lyrics while criticizing the music as repetitive and journeyman-like—with insufficient context to determine overall recommendation strength.",
