The 'but' structure signals mixed verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's style and a strong performance by Christian Borle, but also notes significant problems that the production's glitz cannot solve, indicating a mixed review. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like style, polish, and a strong performance by Christian Borle, but also mentions problems that the glitz can't overcome, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the critic praises the production values ('style and polish to burn') and gives strong commendation to Christian Borle's star performance, the significant caveats about the 'corniest material' and unsolvable problems place this in the qualified positive range rather than a rave.",
