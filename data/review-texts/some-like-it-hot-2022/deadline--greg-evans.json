However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review sentiment. | Gemini: The single excerpt is extremely positive, indicating a strong recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the strength of the quote suggests a score in the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified enthusiastic praise ('delight from start to finish'), indicating a strong positive recommendation, though the single-excerpt limitation necessitates low confidence.",
