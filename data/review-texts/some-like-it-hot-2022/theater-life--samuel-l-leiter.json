However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive, albeit potentially qualified, recommendation. Due to the limited text, confidence is medium. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers an enthusiastic, playful recommendation suggesting broad audience appeal regardless of preference, though limited context requires caution.",
