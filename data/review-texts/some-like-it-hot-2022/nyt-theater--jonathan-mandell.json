The obvious question is: Why? Why create a new musical, if you find the source material so problematic or overused or out of date that you feel compelled to change it?\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review acknowledges positive elements (talented cast, jazzy score) but questions the show's fundamental purpose and suggests the experience could go either way depending on audience expectations. The 'depends on' language is classic mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes both positive elements (talented cast, funny, jazzy score) and potential negatives (excessive, frenetic, questioning the need for the musical). The mixed tone and the single excerpt warning suggest a balanced view. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"glitzy, excessive, frenetic and funny\" but questions the reason for its creation. The verdict depends on audience preference, suggesting a mixed reception. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production's energy, cast, and score while acknowledging it entertains those seeking fun, but ends with a fundamental criticism questioning why the musical was adapted if the source material was so problematic, indicating mixed feelings about the show's conception.",
