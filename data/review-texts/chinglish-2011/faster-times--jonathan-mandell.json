  "bwwExcerpt": "What traveler does not have a favorite anecdote about something he heard — or that he said — that was in hysterical error. “Chinglish” captures this comic confusion with considerable clarity, hilarity and élan. “Chinglish” ambushes the audience, delightfully, with a series of little surprises about each character, which I am loath to give away, except to say: Nobody is exactly as they initially appear.",
