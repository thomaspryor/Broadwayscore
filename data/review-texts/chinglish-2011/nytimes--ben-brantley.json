  "bwwExcerpt": "Non-Chinese speakers should have no difficulty interpreting Chinglish...That’s not just because of the helpful supertitles — largely translations of mistranslations, in which English is merrily mutilated, and the principal source of this production’s mirth. Mr. Hwang’s comedy, about a bewildered American businessman hoping to make his fortune in capitalist China, is laid out with the frame-by-frame exactness of a comic strip...Chinglish only rarely achieves the sort of momentum that sends audiences into the ether.",
