  "bwwExcerpt": "If the whole show were simply about getting a laugh out of bad Chinese-to-English signs, it would get really old really quickly. (Of course, one must devote a certain amount of attention to a placard that reads 'F--- the Certain Price of Goods.' That sign should actually read 'Dry Goods Pricing Department' and the convoluted explanation - concerning Communism, Chairman Mao, and the simplification of writing 'beautiful, arcane, devilishly complicated' Chinese characters - is priceless.) And the mistranslations would be silly if they weren't, in fact, true: The play is inspired by the Asian-American playwright's own business trips to China, where he saw a handicapped restroom labeled 'Deformed Man's Toilet.'",
