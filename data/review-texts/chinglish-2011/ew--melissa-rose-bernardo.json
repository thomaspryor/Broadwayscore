  "bwwExcerpt": "If the whole show were simply about getting a laugh out of bad Chinese-to-English signs, it would get really old really quickly. (Of course, one must devote a certain amount of attention to a placard that reads 'F--- the Certain Price of Goods.' That sign should actually read 'Dry Goods Pricing Department' and the convoluted explanation - concerning Communism, Chairman Mao, and the simplification of writing 'beautiful, arcane, devilishly complicated' Chinese characters - is priceless.) And the mistranslations would be silly if they weren't, in fact, true: The play is inspired by the Asian-American playwright's own business trips to China, where he saw a handicapped restroom labeled 'Deformed Man's Toilet.'",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed assessment - finds some elements 'priceless' but warns the concept would 'get really old really quickly.' Without full review context, this suggests qualified appreciation with concerns about sustainability. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a potentially amusing aspect of the show but also suggests it could become tiresome. The lack of a clear positive or negative verdict and the single excerpt warning lead to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the inspiration and humor derived from mistranslations, but doesn't offer a clear recommendation. The tone is observational and descriptive, suggesting a mixed or neutral stance. | Kimi: While acknowledging the premise risks becoming one-note, the critic clearly appreciates the show's authentic humor, describing specific comedic explanations as 'priceless.' The qualified tone and single-excerpt limitation warrant a lower Positive score.",
