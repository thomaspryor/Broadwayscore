  "bwwExcerpt": "The actors, all excellent, sink their teeth into some nicely nuanced roles. Jennifer Lim as the multi-faceted Madame Xi is riveting and bravo to Gary Wilmes whose expressive face alone is worth a million words. The play, intricately plotted and over-written in spots, could use a healthy trimming. But for the most part Chinglish serves as a highly entertaining lesson that no matter how foreign we seem to each other, when it comes to making money, we're really pretty much alike.",
