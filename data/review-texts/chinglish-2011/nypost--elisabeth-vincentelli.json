This suggests a negative assessment overall. | Gemini: The review states that the play is \"dramatically inert,\" which is a negative assessment, placing it in the negative bucket. | Kimi: While the reviewer acknowledges the play's good intentions regarding its subject matter, the verdict 'dramatically inert' is a clear condemnation of its theatrical effectiveness, indicating a lifeless production that fails to engage.",
