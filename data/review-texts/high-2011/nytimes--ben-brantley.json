This indicates a negative assessment. | Gemini: The critic directly compares the show unfavorably to a support group meeting, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the theatrical experience by unfavorably comparing it to a clinical support-group setting rather than entertainment, indicating a clear lack of recommendation despite the brief excerpt.",
