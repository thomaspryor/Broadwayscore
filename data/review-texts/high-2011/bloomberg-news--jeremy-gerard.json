  "bwwExcerpt": "Lombardo, a recovering addict, has written an imitation of a play, and not a very good one. Kunken is petulant as Father Delpapp. Jonigkeit plays Cody with such incoherent gruffness suggesting he never gave up dope long enough even to get into the center. Under Rob Ruggiero's overwrought direction, 'High' plays more like an early workshop than a polished Broadway production.",
