  "bwwExcerpt": "It's too bad Kathleen Turner never got a chance to play Sister Aloysius in 'Doubt.' It might have spared her the embarrassment of now playing a nun in Matthew Lombardo's disappointing psychological melodrama 'High'...Jonigkeit overplays his role physically - especially the twitching and shaking - to the point of absolute ridiculousness. Meanwhile, Kunken, whose character is ill-defined, seems lost amid all the sparring.",
