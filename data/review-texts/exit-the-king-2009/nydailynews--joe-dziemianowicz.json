  "bwwExcerpt": "This revival comes to Broadway via a production done in Melbourne, Australia, and directed by Neil Armfield, who demonstrates skill and originality in orchestrating this human circus. But there are issues. The adaptation by Armfield and Rush is a lot like the trains adorning the royal robes (by Dale Ferguson, who also did the tapestry-filled set). It swirls playfully and lickety-split in the first half, but it drags repeatedly and gets tangled after intermission",
