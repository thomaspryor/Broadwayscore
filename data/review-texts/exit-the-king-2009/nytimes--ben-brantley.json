The details of the play, which was first produced in 1962, are eccentric, and its tone is mostly whimsical, but the plot is easy to follow.\n\nWithin the play’s opening minutes, Queen Marguerite — the elder of King Berenger’s two consorts — coolly informs the monarch, “You’re going to die at the end of the show.”\n\nIt is scarcely a spoiler to confirm that Berenger gradually declines and at last dies some 90 minutes later. That is because the ultimate value of the play is mined from the thoughts and questions regarding life and death raised during that time.\n\nDeath is never easy for mortals to contemplate, and so the playwright considers its significance through an exaggerated lens that slyly incorporates humor as the king reluctantly journeys toward his final exit.\n\nBerenger, who is more than 400 years old, resists believing what Marguerite and his doctor tell him. Queen Marie, the king’s younger, second wife, is a wishful thinker who supports Berenger’s refusal to face the inevitable even as his powers fail. Once, the king could command the weather itself, but all too quickly he experiences trouble in standing up and walking. Soon his hair goes white and he is in a wheelchair.\n\nUnderlining his situation, Berenger’s once-magnificent kingdom is depicted as swiftly receding: Its borders shrink, its population dwindles and even the throne room threatens to crumble around him. One by one, the people who are closest to Berenger, including a faithful guardsman and Juliette, an untidy maidservant, disappear as Marguerite guides him toward oblivion.\n\nThe Broadway revival of “Exit the King” in 2009 (for which Geoffrey Rush received a Tony Award as the king) rendered the play as a screwy comedy extravaganza with a somber conclusion. Bonnie J. Monte, the artistic director of the Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey, stages matters here in a relatively restrained manner that allows the audience to hear the quiet beauty of the play’s language and to appreciate the eternal questions that the text thoughtfully raises. Ms. Monte’s approach gives a natural flow to the story as it eventually passes from a jocular mood into seriousness.\n\nWhile Hugh Hanson’s costumes are subdued in color, the decaying throne room designed by Brittany Vasta is effectively shabby, and Tony Galaska’s lighting at times looks poisonous, Ms. Monte does not neglect droll atmospheric touches. For instance, the guard operates a boom box to produce the sour-sounding fanfare that heralds the king’s entrances, and Juliette wields both a lint roller and a battered vacuum cleaner to try to keep up appearances. Meanwhile, the tearful Queen Marie soaks up scads of tissues as she laments the king’s approaching demise.\n\nThe actors ably depict their characters. If Greg Watanabe could be grander in manner as the king’s officious doctor, Jon Barker is forthright as a none-too-bright guard. Looking as if she stepped out of a painting by Vermeer, Kristie Dale Sanders amusingly portrays Juliette with a casual nature. Jesmille Darbouze gives Queen Marie a damp air of helplessness that undercuts her optimistic assertions.\n\nBrent Harris wears his crown confidently as the spry and glib King Berenger — at least until the man begins to break up physically, and believably staggers into infirmity and infantilism. Perhaps the most challenging role is that of Queen Marguerite, who needs to be firm and yet tender to the king as she helps him leave this world. Marion Adler plays Marguerite beautifully with a sour face, perfect diction and, in the play’s final seconds, a touching sense of empathy, as if she understands how hard it is for him to say goodbye.\n\n“Exit the King” continues at the F. M. Kirby Shakespeare Theater, Drew University, 36 Madison Avenue, Madison, through Aug. 28. Information: 973-408-5600; shakespearenj.org.",
