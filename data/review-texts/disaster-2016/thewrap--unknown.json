  "fullText": "A boat capsizes on Broadway and Irwin Allen turns over in his Hollywood grave. “Disaster” is too dynamic a word to describe the new jukebox musical “Disaster!,” which opened Tuesday at the Nederlander Theatre. Better words would be “lukewarm mess.”\n\nSeth Rudetsky and Jack Plotnick wrote the show, which has had previous incarnations in small theaters around Manhattan.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Pan/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The critic explicitly rejects calling it a 'disaster' because that would be too flattering, instead calling it a 'lukewarm mess.' This is clearly a pan with no redeeming qualities mentioned. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong negative language, describing the show as a 'lukewarm mess' and suggesting 'Disaster' is too dynamic a word, indicating a strongly negative verdict. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"lukewarm mess\" to describe the show, indicating a negative recommendation. | Kimi: The critic explicitly describes the show as a 'lukewarm mess,' suggesting it lacks the dynamism even to be called a disaster, which constitutes a clear negative verdict. Confidence is low due to the brief excerpt length. | Buckets: claude=Pan, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Negative",
