    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Pan) - using median score | Claude: Clear negative verdict calling it a 'sinking ship' and 'catastrophic.' Even praise for songs is immediately negated by 'can't save' qualifier. Single excerpt limits confidence but language is unambiguous. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the musical as a 'sinking ship' and 'catastrophic,' indicating a strongly negative view. While the songs are praised, the overall tone suggests a deep pan, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the songs, while good, cannot save the musical, which is described as a \"sinking ship\" and \"catastrophic.\" This indicates a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: The reviewer uses disaster metaphors ('sinking ship,' 'catastrophic') to strongly condemn the show as irredeemable, even while acknowledging the songs are good. As a single excerpt, the confidence is low, but the language indicates a deep pan. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Pan",
