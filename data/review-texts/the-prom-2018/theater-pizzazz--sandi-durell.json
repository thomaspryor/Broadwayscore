This zany, cleverly written musical addresses social issues with great emotional ups and downs while you laugh your socks off...Lessons are learned all around by everyone as thoughts, feelings and preconceived ideas about rules, right or wrong, religion and the Bible, begin to change...There’s terrific hi-energy ensemble dance in hot sequin sneakers...Definitely a fun night out at the theater going to a prom unlike one you’ve ever attended!\"\n\nRead more",
