  "showScoreExcerpt": "“This delightful, cannily-crafted show that puts the comedy back in musical comedy...Totally original. It is hilarious, generous and touching...There is a terrific song for each character, the dance numbers are wonderfully energetic and the ending is touching. The sturdy book...includes a slew of insider Broadway musical jokes to make the audience feel smart. The music is catchy and the lyrics are often clever...Brilliantly cast.”\n\nRead more",
