  "showScoreExcerpt": "“A tuneful original score, a book about characters across the age spectrum who deliver a positive message along with the laughs, and lots of eye-catching visuals and peppy dance numbers...Two and a half hours of enjoyable musical entertainment...Nicholaw's fast-paced direction and generous serving of lively dance routines...overcomes the occasional stumbles into over-sentimental and somewhat ham-fisted humor. The entire cast is terrific.”\n\nRead more",
