  "bwwExcerpt": "As the full-of-themselves hoofers and belters, Beth Leavel, Brooks Ashmanskas, Christopher Sieber and Angie Schworer, along with their more spirited than effective publicist, played by Josh Lamon, chew the scenery to great delight, descending on small town America like bedazzled locusts. Their big numbers - 'Changing Lives,' 'It's Not About Me,' 'The Lady's Improving' - show just the hoped-for levels of All About Eve level self-satisfaction anyone could want.",
