With its kinetic dancing, broad mugging and belty anthems, it makes you believe in musical comedy again...As in many of the greatest Golden Age musicals, they latch onto a subject of topical importance, using its gravity to anchor their satire and their satire to leaven its earnestness...The ensemble’s big numbers, set to Glen Kelly’s dance arrangements, are a blast...It consistently delivers on its entertainment promises as well as its Golden Age premise.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language throughout ('joyful hoot', 'makes you believe', 'a blast', 'consistently delivers') with comparison to 'greatest Golden Age musicals'. Single excerpt warning noted, but tone is clearly enthusiastic recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is highly positive, using enthusiastic language like 'joyful hoot' and 'makes you believe in musical comedy again'. Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using phrases like \"joyful hoot\", \"makes you believe in musical comedy again\", and \"a blast\". Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified enthusiasm, praising the show as a 'joyful hoot' that restores faith in the musical comedy genre, though as a single curated quote it may not reflect the complete critical assessment.",
