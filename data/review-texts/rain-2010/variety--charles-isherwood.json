  "wrongFullText": "Short film to be included in 2010 photo exhibit\n\n“Despair,” a short film produced by bi-coastal digital effects house Look Effects in collaboration with California photographer Alex Prager, is being included in New York’s Museum of Modern Art 2010 photography exhibit.\n\nCalled New Photography 2010: Roe Ethridge, Elad Lassry, Alex Prager, Amanda Ross-Ho, the exhibit is running from September 29 through January 11. Look co-produced and created all the visual effects for Prager’s four-and-a-half-minute film,\n\n“What a great compliment, having something we’ve put so much into exhibited at a museum of such stature,” says Look prexy Mark Driscoll. “Our goal is to be at the table with the filmmakers as producers, to decide how a film gets done. Alex opened that door for us.”\n\nIn making her live-action short, Prager sought to capture the emotional turmoil of her female lead, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique, whose upcoming film “Black Swan” features visual effects by Look, served as the d,p. on “Despair.”\n\nLook co-founder Henrik Fett served as vfx supervisor on the film.\n\nPrager takes her cues from pulp fiction and the fashion images of Guy Bourdin to create narratives featuring women distinguished by wigs, makeup and retro attire.",
