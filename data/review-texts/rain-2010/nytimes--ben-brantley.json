    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The language is clearly critical - 'shriekingly loud' and 'numbingly faithful' are negative descriptors, suggesting the show is overly loud and boringly predictable. However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict may not be represented here. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'slick, shriekingly loud and numbingly faithful,' suggesting a negative tone. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as a 'reproduction,' which suggests accuracy but lacks enthusiasm. The terms 'slick' and 'shriekingly loud' are neutral, indicating a mixed assessment. Given the limited text, a 'Mixed' score is appropriate. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the production is 'slick' and technically faithful to the source material, the descriptors 'shriekingly loud' and 'numbingly' suggest the experience is sensory-overloading and dull rather than entertaining, indicating a recommendation against seeing the show.",
