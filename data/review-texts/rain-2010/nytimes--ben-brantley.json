    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The language is clearly negative - 'shriekingly loud' and 'numbingly faithful' are critical descriptions, with 'numbingly' being particularly damning. However, with only one excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively in the negative range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'slick' and 'numbingly faithful,' indicating a lack of originality or excitement. The tone suggests a mixed reception, with neither strong praise nor outright criticism. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as a \"reproduction,\" which suggests accuracy but lacks enthusiasm or a clear recommendation. Given the limited text, a mixed score seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers faint praise ('slick') but emphasizes negative sensory experience ('shriekingly loud') and boredom ('numbingly faithful'), suggesting a technically proficient but tedious production. With only one excerpt available, the full verdict remains unclear.",
