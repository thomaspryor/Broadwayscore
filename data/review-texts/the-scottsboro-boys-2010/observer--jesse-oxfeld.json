  "bwwExcerpt": "But the real star of the show is the director and choreographer Susan Stroman, who here creates some of her best work. There are exaggerated, athletic shuck-n-jive movements for the minstrel numbers, an upbeat tap dance around an electric chair and a brilliant pas de deux between a boy and a projected shadow as he recalls a lynching. It's the classic Kander and Ebb twist: horrible things, presented spectacularly.",
