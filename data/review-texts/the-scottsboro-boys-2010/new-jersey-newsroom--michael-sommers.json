  "bwwExcerpt": "The unerring expertise in writing, staging, design and performance that makes this show so exciting is a striking reminder how musicals crafted well in the classic Broadway style remain more satisfying than the newer rocky horror likes of 'Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson' and 'American Idiot' put together. 'The Scottsboro Boys' proves once again that the old school still rules.",
