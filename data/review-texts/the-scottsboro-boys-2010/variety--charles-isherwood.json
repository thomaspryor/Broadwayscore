The use of 'effective' suggests the production successfully conveys its themes. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"moving\" and \"musically accomplished\" and states that it makes its serious points \"all the more effective\", indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers clear praise for the show's emotional impact and musical craft, calling it 'moving and musically accomplished' with an effective storytelling approach, indicating a solid recommendation.",
