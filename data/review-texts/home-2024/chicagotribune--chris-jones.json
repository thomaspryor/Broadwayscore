  "dtliExcerpt": "No doubt some will call “Home” sentimental or romantic or overly inclined to see America through a soft gauze. All fair criticisms, I guess. But I see this show as a celebration of the Black farmer, the rural life, the pull of the land, the notion that you should always keep hold of your beginnings. What Cephus gets at the end is not afforded to most of us but as you watch him get it in this production, you sit forward in your seat and think, well, what dramatic character of your acquaintance ever was more deserving?",
