    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt suggests the show has merit ('rollicking rhythms') but acknowledges accessibility issues for audiences. However, with only one curated quote available, the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The single excerpt suggests a mixed reception, indicating that the play's appeal may not be immediate for audiences. Without more context, it's unclear if the critic ultimately recommends the show. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a potentially engaging experience, but with a caveat about needing time to adjust. This indicates a mixed reception, as it's neither outright positive nor negative. | Kimi: The excerpt uses the enthusiastic descriptor 'rollicking' to describe the play's rhythms, suggesting an ultimately enjoyable experience, but qualifies this with a warning that it takes time to 'tune in,' indicating a qualified recommendation in the lower Positive range.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "It may take a while for audiences to tune in to the play’s rollicking rhythms. Mr. Williams’s language is a dense, clipped, sometimes incantatory vernacular that can be hard to parse, particularly when flung at dizzying velocity in the early going. Trying to appreciate the language’s richness and lyricism is challenging enough; teasing out the thread of the narrative from the onrushing tides of words seems at times nearly impossible, especially as the chronology jumps back and forth. While one can appreciate the desire to bring heated life to Mr. Williams’s vigorous language, which almost seems to prefigure rap, Mr. Leon would have been wise to allow a few pauses for everyone to breathe.",
