    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt suggests structural problems with the play's effectiveness. With only one curated quote available and no clear recommendation either way, this falls into mixed territory with low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a limitation in the play's effectiveness, indicating a mixed review. The lack of full context and the single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious approach with a low confidence level. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests that the play has some issues that prevent it from being fully effective, indicating a mixed or lukewarm reception. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers a measured but clear criticism that the production's method undermines its own dramatic potential, suggesting the show falls short of being fully effective without offering any compensatory praise.",
