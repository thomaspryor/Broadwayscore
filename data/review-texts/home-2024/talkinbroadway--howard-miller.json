    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The superlative language 'most uplifting...in a very long time' indicates strong enthusiasm and clear recommendation, placing this in Rave territory despite being only an excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language, calling the play 'the most uplifting' in a long time, which suggests a very strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt is extremely positive, indicating a strong recommendation. Given it's the only excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the quote suggests a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise ('most uplifting... in a very long time') indicating strong enthusiasm, but as only a single curated excerpt is available, the score is placed at the high end of the Positive range per scoring guidelines. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
