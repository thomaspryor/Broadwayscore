  "bwwExcerpt": "Williams’ language is contagiously rhythmic, softer in the South and cynical up North, and the actors deliver dynamic performances, though they breathlessly barrel through the first few scenes. Leon, though always a casting dynamo, typically directs towards the finish line, and the play’s meandering molasses of a dramatic structure coagulates a bit. The production’s tone – especially as seen through Arnulfo Maldonado’s down-home set and Dede Ayite’s nostalgic costumes – is likewise consistent, if to a fault. No part of Cephus’ life is portrayed as having any real danger, no matter how bleak Williams’ observations about incarceration and the prospects available to Black men in this country can be.",
