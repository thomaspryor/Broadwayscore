With that, there are inevitable moments when Williams’ play seems a bit lulling or dated. However, if the mission is to simply revive something that’s been lost — an action we, sadly, can’t do with human beings but can do with art — then “Home” is more than successful.",

Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges some dated elements but ultimately describes the show as successful in its revival mission. The positive tone suggests a recommendation, though the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges dated aspects but ultimately concludes the show is \"more than successful\" in its mission, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
