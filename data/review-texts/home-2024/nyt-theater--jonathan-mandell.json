  "dtliExcerpt": "If the timing of the production is unfortunate in one way, it’s eye-opening in another. Real-world events have turned what I might have dismissed as a dated fable into what feels like a prescient reappraisal. And the three versatile actors on stage, two of whom portray dozens of characters, make the most of Williams’ evocative language, homespun humor, and a plot that comes close to a morality tale about the Evils of Big City Life versus the righteous simplicity of small-town Southern living.",
