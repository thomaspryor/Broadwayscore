Given the single excerpt and potential cherry-picking, a lower score in the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the show is now relevant and insightful, implying a positive, but potentially qualified, recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as having transformed from 'dated' to 'prescient,' indicating a positive reassessment of its relevance and merit. However, as a single curated excerpt with truncated text, confidence must remain low.",
