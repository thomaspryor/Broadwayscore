    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive reinterpretation of the show due to current events, but lacks strong evaluative language. Given the single excerpt and potential cherry-picking, a lower score in the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the show is now relevant and insightful, implying a positive, but potentially qualified, recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as having transformed from 'dated' to 'prescient,' indicating a positive reassessment of its relevance and merit. However, as a single curated excerpt with truncated text, confidence must remain low.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Samm-Art Williams was born in Burgaw, North Carolina seventy-eight years ago, and died in that same small rural town last month; he liked to tell people he was “just a country boy.” Actually, though, in between his birth and his death, Williams lived large in the big city – an actor in Hollywood movies, executive producer of the hit TV series “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” and a playwright who was best-known for “Home,” which was nominated for a Tony Award as Best Play after it transferred from The Negro Ensemble Company to Broadway in 1980. “Home,” a story about a son of the South who not-so-briefly loses his way, is opening tonight on Broadway in a revival directed by Kenny Leon; Williams died four days before its first preview.",
