Single excerpt warning noted - using upper end of Positive range due to unqualified praise, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'top-notch' and a 'fitting and heartfelt tribute,' indicating strong praise. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"top-notch\" and \"fitting and heartfelt tribute,\" indicating a positive review. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt uses unambiguous praise ('top-notch', 'heartfelt tribute'), indicating a strong recommendation for the production despite the limited available text.",
