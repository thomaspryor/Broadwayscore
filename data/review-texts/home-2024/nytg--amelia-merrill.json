    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as a 'thrill', which is clearly positive language suggesting excitement and entertainment value. However, confidence is low due to limited text availability. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'fast-talking thrill,' which suggests a positive and enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt is very positive, describing the show as a \"fast-talking thrill.\" Given the lack of additional context, I'm placing it in the upper range of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The sole available excerpt uses enthusiastic language ('thrill') to praise the show's pacing and entertainment value, indicating a clear positive recommendation in the upper Positive range per single-excerpt guidance.",
