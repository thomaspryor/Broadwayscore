  "fullText": "Samm-Art Williams passed away last month at age 78, and one of the sad ironies of his death is that he didn’t live to see Tory Kittles’ powerful performance in “Home.”\n\nWilliams’ 1979 play received its first Broadway revival on Wednesday at Roundabout’s Todd Haimes Theatre; it last appeared on the Big Boards back in 1980 after its world premiere the previous year at the Negro Ensemble Company.",
