  "bwwExcerpt": "But do not fear. This is not the kind of play to abandon you in a dark alley, even if Cephus’s distaste for city life is the most compelling and counterintuitive part of the story. Plot machinations that you will see coming at quite some distance deliver a happy ending and may even elicit a few nonconsensual tears. No matter: They cleanse the soul just the same. Williams, who died a few days before this revival’s first preview, seems to have been willing to go anywhere to free his hero from despair as a way of freeing the rest of us, too.",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the show as a \"moving meditation\" with \"lived-in and true\" performances, indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clearly positive evaluations ('moving', 'lived-in and true') without reservations, warranting an upper-range Positive score despite the limited text available.",
