    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising 'rare tour-de-force performances' indicates strong positive verdict for the acting, but with only one curated quote available, full review sentiment is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances as 'rare tour-de-force', indicating strong approval. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the direction and performances as \"rare tour-de-force\", indicating a positive assessment. Given that this is the only excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers strong praise ('tour-de-force') for the cast's performances, indicating a positive recommendation. Following guidance for clearly positive single excerpts, scoring at the upper end of the Positive bucket (80-84) with low confidence due to limited context.",
