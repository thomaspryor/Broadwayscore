  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Written in the 80s, when the AIDS crisis was at its peak, playwright Wilson’s exploration into this genre surely had more impact when it opened on Broadway...Mayer skillfully and cleverly plays it all to the hilt allowing for the silliness of Larry’s character to bloom large against the combustible and eventual surprisingly tender side of Pale. There are many spellbinding moments and some lulls. But you will leave the Hudson Theatre emotionally drained after two and a half hours.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt acknowledges both highs ('spellbinding moments') and lows ('some lulls'), with no clear recommendation. The emotional impact is noted but presented neutrally. Single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked from a longer mixed assessment. | GPT-4o: The review highlights skillful direction and emotional impact, suggesting a positive experience despite some lulls. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive (\"spellbinding moments\") and negative (\"some lulls\") aspects, but ultimately suggests a worthwhile, emotionally impactful experience. The phrase \"emotionally drained\" indicates a positive impact, suggesting a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the lead performance as 'skillful' and 'cleverly' executed with 'spellbinding moments,' while noting 'some lulls' and diminished contemporary impact, indicating a qualified but clear recommendation.",
