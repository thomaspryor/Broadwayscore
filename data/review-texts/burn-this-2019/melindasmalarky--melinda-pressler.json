  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A disappointingly dull and uneven production...The draw of Driver & Russell drew me to the play but their pas de deus didn't flare...The overall acting was arid. The only real sparks of energy in the play came from the funny, inextinguishable roommate Larry...Uranowitz added hilarity into a triangle love story that didn't muster romance from any angle...Uranowitz was the only reason to see this soddened, dated play.”\n\nRead more",

While praising Uranowitz's performance, the overall recommendation is against seeing this 'dated play.' | GPT-4o: The review describes the production as 'dull and uneven' with 'arid' acting, suggesting a negative impression. While Uranowitz's performance is praised, the overall sentiment is that the play is not worth seeing, except for his role. | Gemini: The review is largely negative, describing the production as \"dull and uneven\" and the acting as \"arid.\" While praising Uranowitz's performance, the overall recommendation is negative. | Kimi: Single excerpt reveals harsh criticism calling the production 'dull,' 'uneven,' and 'arid' with 'soddened, dated' material, reserving praise solely for Uranowitz's supporting performance. The verdict clearly discourages attendance despite one bright spot.",
