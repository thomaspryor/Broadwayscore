    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear praise for the lead performances and calls it an 'excellent all-around production' that is 'delightful.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of Driver and Russell and describes the production as 'excellent' and 'delightful', indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review praises the actors' performances and the production overall, calling it \"delightful\" and \"excellent.\" Given the single excerpt, I am scoring it as positive with a high score within the bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production as 'excellent' and 'delightful' with a 'formidable cast,' indicating a clear recommendation, though as a single curated excerpt the confidence is reduced.",
