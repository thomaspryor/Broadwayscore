  "fullText": "Lanford Wilson’s “Burn This” is one of those rare two-act, two-and-a-half-hour plays that needs a long third act. We need to know what happens to the talented young choreographer Anna after she dumps her very civilized boyfriend, Burton, to take up with the Neanderthal named Pale. Does she end up on drugs or in the hospital or dead?\n\nThe Anna-Pale relationship brings to mind what might happen to Blanche du Bois if, after rejecting a marriage proposal from Mitch, she has an affair with her sister’s husband, Stanley Kowalski, post-rape.",
