    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic praises the 'expertly calibrated revival' and finds it 'gratifying,' but qualifies praise by noting the play is 'not always convincing.' Single excerpt limits confidence in capturing full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of Driver and Russell, highlighting their ability to bring life to the play. The use of 'wonderfully' and 'gratifying experience' suggests a strong positive sentiment, despite some reservations about the play's writing. | Gemini: The review praises the performances of Driver and Russell and calls the revival \"expertly calibrated.\" However, it also notes that the play is \"not always convincing,\" indicating a reservation, so I scored it as positive with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the revival as 'expertly calibrated' and the lead performances as 'wonderful' and 'gratifying,' while offering only mild criticism of the source material ('not always convincing'), indicating a clear recommendation focused on the acting.",
