    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite praising Driver's performance ('eye-popping abandon'), the review criticizes the production overall as problematic with directorial issues and calls it 'frustratingly unfulfilling.' Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the conclusion is clearly negative. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights significant issues with the production, including a lack of character development and ineffective direction, resulting in an unfulfilling experience. Despite praise for Driver's performance, the overall tone is negative. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"failure\", \"problematic\", \"too-light\", and \"frustratingly unfulfilling evening\", indicating a negative assessment of the play. | Kimi: While the excerpt praises Adam Driver's 'eye-popping' performance, it strongly criticizes the play's writing, direction, and overall execution, concluding with 'a frustratingly unfulfilling evening.' The single-excerpt format limits confidence, but the available text clearly signals a negative recommendation.",
