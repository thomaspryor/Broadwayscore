  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Plenty of sparks...Unfortunately, the fire is largely confined to the unglued coke-addled character at the play's center, enacted with eye-popping abandon by Driver, while the rest of the production appears to be wrapped in asbestos...Wilson's failure to provide anything but the skimpiest details about the characters is made all the more problematic by Mayer's too-light directorial hand...Overall, this is a play that is filled with unanswered questions...A frustratingly unfulfilling evening.”\n\nRead more",
