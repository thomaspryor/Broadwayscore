  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The story is paper thin. How do these two mismatched people get to come together when the forces act against them...Wilson sets up the premise but...you have to stretch the imagination...Mayer has opted to infuse a comedic spin to the proceedings, and it is fine in some places, but it dilutes the more profound moments. There is enough solid acting and substance here to make this revival worth seeing, but the real burning comes from Adam Driver. He makes the stage come alive.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite criticisms of thin story and directorial choices, the critic explicitly states the revival is 'worth seeing' and praises Driver's performance as making 'the stage come alive.' Single excerpt warning noted - this is barely positive with significant reservations. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges issues with the story and comedic elements but ultimately recommends the show for its acting, particularly Adam Driver's performance. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws in the story and direction but ultimately states the revival is \"worth seeing\" due to the acting, particularly Adam Driver's performance. Given the single excerpt and mixed tone, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic explicitly recommends the show as 'worth seeing' due to strong performances, particularly Adam Driver, despite significant criticisms of the thin story and diluted direction. As a single curated excerpt with mixed signals, confidence is low.",
