  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The story is paper thin. How do these two mismatched people get to come together when the forces act against them...Wilson sets up the premise but...you have to stretch the imagination...Mayer has opted to infuse a comedic spin to the proceedings, and it is fine in some places, but it dilutes the more profound moments. There is enough solid acting and substance here to make this revival worth seeing, but the real burning comes from Adam Driver. He makes the stage come alive.”\n\nRead more",
