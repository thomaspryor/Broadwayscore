    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Review criticizes the storyline as predictable and shallow, praises Driver's explosive performance but notes it overshadows other actors and hurts chemistry. Single excerpt warning applies - mixed elements with no clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review praises Driver's performance but criticizes the predictable storyline and lack of chemistry between characters. The excerpt suggests a mixed opinion with notable highlights. | Gemini: The review praises Driver's performance but criticizes the storyline and chemistry between characters, resulting in a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: While the critic praises Adam Driver's performance as explosive and powerful, they criticize the predictable storyline as lacking depth and note that the lead's dominance comes at the expense of other characters and chemistry, creating an imbalanced viewing experience.",
