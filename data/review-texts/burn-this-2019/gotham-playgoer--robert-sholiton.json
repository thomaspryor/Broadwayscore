As Anna, Russell is the one who is pale. In her defense, I think her part is underwritten...If there are hidden depths in the script, director Michael Mayer did not find them.\"\n\nRead more",

The overall assessment is clearly negative despite praising certain actors. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights significant criticisms, including clichéd characters, underwritten parts, and a lack of depth in the script. While there is some praise for individual performances, the overall tone is negative. | Gemini: The review expresses disappointment with the script, direction, and some performances, indicating a negative overall assessment despite acknowledging some positive aspects. | Kimi: While acknowledging Driver's impressive presence and excellent supporting performances, the critic heavily criticizes the underwritten script, clichéd characters, and direction that fails to find hidden depths, resulting in a clear thumbs-down.",
