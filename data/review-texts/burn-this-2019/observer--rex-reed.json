However, the review is brief, so the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review praises the performances of the two leads, suggesting a positive experience overall. The phrase \"volcanic intensity\" indicates a strong and compelling performance. | Kimi: Brief excerpt with strong praise for lead performances ('volcanic intensity') and positive framing of the play itself ('passionate'), but limited text prevents full assessment of overall verdict.",
