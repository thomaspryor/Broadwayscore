    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Unqualified superlatives throughout: 'flawless direction', 'superb performances', 'fantastic set', 'on fire', 'brilliant tribute'. Despite being a single excerpt, the language is consistently effusive with no reservations expressed. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is filled with superlatives like 'flawless', 'superb', and 'fantastic', indicating a highly positive review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"flawless\", \"superb\", \"fantastic\", and \"brilliant tribute\", indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives ('flawless', 'superb', 'brilliant') and enthusiastic praise for all production elements, indicating a rave review, though limited to a single curated quote.",
