  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Lanford Wilson’s 1988 headscratcher of a play, has seemingly no reason to exist other than to give Adam Driver, its marquee star, an opportunity to flash his considerable talent on a Broadway stage. Unfortunately, nearly every note of this dated, slow burn rings false...Whatever appeal this play must have once had has long since extinguished, no doubt existing only in flickers of nostalgia. Skip this one.\"\n\nRead more",

Clear negative verdict with 'skip this one' directive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is strongly negative, suggesting the play is outdated and lacks appeal, with a clear recommendation to skip it. The single excerpt warning indicates potential cherry-picking, so the score is on the lower end of the Pan range. | Gemini: The review strongly discourages seeing the play, calling it a \"headscratcher\" with \"no reason to exist\" and advising to \"skip this one.\" | Kimi: The critic explicitly commands readers to 'Skip this one,' describing the production as 'dated' and saying it 'rings false,' while dismissing its artistic justification beyond showcasing the star's talent.",
