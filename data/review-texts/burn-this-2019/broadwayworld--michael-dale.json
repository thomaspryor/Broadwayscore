  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Michael Mayer's generally well-acted production begins with an impressive visual, set designer Derek McLane's striking depiction of a downtown Manhattan loft apartment in what was once an industrial building, featuring square footage for days, tall windows offering a sweet view of the city and warmth provided by a parade of steam radiators lining a wall. Kerri Russell gives a fine, thoughtful performance as Anna, a dancer and aspiring choreographer who has just lost her best friend and artistic collaborator, Robbie, when he and his boyfriend perished in a boating accident. Anna and Robbie shared the loft with former dancer turned Madison Avenue wonk Larry. The funeral made it clear to them that most of Robbie's family was unaware of his sexual orientation, treating Anna as his girlfriend.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The phrase ‘toxic masculinity’ wasn't exactly in the vernacular in 1987...So perhaps coked-up, homophobic, violently aggressive, possessive bullies were considered sexier than they are now...Generally well-acted production...Russell gives a fine, thoughtful performance as Anna...As played by Driver, Pale’s a thuggish bulldozer...There is little texture and why the mature, introspective Anna is lured to him is never quite apparent.”\n\nRead more"
