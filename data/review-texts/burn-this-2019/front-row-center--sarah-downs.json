  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Once onstage, Pale is the only character you see, Driver the only actor you watch. He roars, he whispers, he prowls, plumbing the depths of grief, finding nuance and humor in an unpredictable and unsettling character. Just when you think you know Pale; Driver unpeels yet another layer...It is absolutely thrilling...While Uranowitz and Furr manage admirably, I'm sorry to say Russell falls short....Ultimately, this play, this performance is all about Driver.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt limits confidence but clear enthusiasm for the central performance suggests solid positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Driver's performance as 'absolutely thrilling' and highlights his ability to captivate the audience. Despite some reservations about other cast members, the focus on Driver's compelling portrayal suggests a positive recommendation, albeit with limited context. | Gemini: The excerpt heavily praises Adam Driver's performance and calls it \"absolutely thrilling,\" suggesting a strong positive recommendation despite mentioning other actors falling short. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Adam Driver's performance ('absolutely thrilling') while acknowledging shortcomings in the supporting cast, indicating a strong recommendation based primarily on the lead.",
