  "showScoreExcerpt": "“There's no getting around the fact that Wilson's 1987 play is one of his minor works. And, in this production, it's looking rather long in the tooth. In fact, it's something of a puzzlement...It is built around a romance of opposites so forced as to beggar belief. It also feels wildly out of sync with the #MeToo moment...Overall, Mayer's direction emphasizes the script's comic side, which keeps the audience entertained while never quite addressing the prickly problem of its central romance.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Mixed assessment acknowledging entertainment value but significant problems with the source material and central romance. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review describes the play as a 'minor work' and 'long in the tooth,' with a central romance that 'beggars belief' and is 'out of sync with the #MeToo moment.' The direction is noted for keeping the audience entertained but not addressing core issues, indicating a negative assessment overall. | Gemini: The review acknowledges entertainment value but also points out significant flaws and a disconnect with contemporary sensibilities, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging the production keeps audiences entertained through comedic direction, the critic heavily criticizes the source material as a 'minor work' that is 'long in the tooth,' with a 'forced' romance that feels 'out of sync' with contemporary sensibilities.",
