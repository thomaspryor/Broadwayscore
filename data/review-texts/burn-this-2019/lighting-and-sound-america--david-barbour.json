  "showScoreExcerpt": "“There's no getting around the fact that Wilson's 1987 play is one of his minor works. And, in this production, it's looking rather long in the tooth. In fact, it's something of a puzzlement...It is built around a romance of opposites so forced as to beggar belief. It also feels wildly out of sync with the #MeToo moment...Overall, Mayer's direction emphasizes the script's comic side, which keeps the audience entertained while never quite addressing the prickly problem of its central romance.”\n\nRead more",
