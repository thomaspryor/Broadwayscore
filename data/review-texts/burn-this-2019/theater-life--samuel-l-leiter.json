    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed signals - praises Driver's performance ('perfect Beast') but criticizes the script's logic and character development. Limited text prevents clear verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights both positive and negative aspects, praising Driver's performance but criticizing the script and character dynamics. The mixed signals and the single excerpt lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review praises Driver's performance but criticizes the script and the plausibility of the relationship. The overall sentiment is mixed, with some positive aspects but significant reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Adam Driver's performance ('perfect Beast', 'flares up with a whoosh') but criticizes the script as having 'only a wisp of a plot,' finds the romantic pairing unconvincing, and notes the female lead is 'stymied' by the writing. Given this is a single curated excerpt, confidence is low.",
