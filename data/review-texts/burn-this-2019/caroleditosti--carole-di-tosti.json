    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, this contains clear rave language: 'revelatory', 'resounding success', and explicit 'do not want to miss' recommendation. The enthusiastic tone with multiple superlatives places it in upper Rave range, though single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language, describing the production as 'revelatory', 'a resounding success', and something 'you do not want to miss'. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"revelatory,\" \"resounding success,\" and \"you do not want to miss,\" indicating a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified enthusiasm ('revelatory,' 'resounding success,' 'do not want to miss'), warranting a high Positive score. However, confidence is low given this is a single curated excerpt that may not reflect the full review's balance or any reservations. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
