    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review praises individual performances ('sizzle', 'subtle grace', 'stage snaps alive') but criticizes the play itself ('fizzles', 'stumbles unevenly'). Single excerpt with mixed signals warrants low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances but criticizes the play's unevenness. The positive elements are countered by the play's shortcomings, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review praises the lead performers but states that the play itself \"fizzles\" and \"stumbles unevenly.\" This indicates a mixed reaction, with strong performances but a weaker overall play. Given the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers high praise for the lead performances ('sizzle,' 'sparkplugs,' 'snaps alive') but delivers a clear negative verdict on the play itself ('fizzles,' 'stumbles unevenly'). With strong assets and significant flaws presented in equal measure, the assessment is genuinely mixed.",
