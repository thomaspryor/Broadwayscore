The essential fiery chemistry allied to in the title is missing...Driver has the right imposing physique and physicality for the role, but he comes across as a comically clumsy oaf...To compound the production’s problems, Russell barely registers as the vacillating Anna...Fortunately...director Michael Mayer wisely emphasizes Wilson’s wit.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt heavily criticizes the two lead performances and their lack of chemistry, calling Driver 'a comically clumsy oaf' and saying Russell 'barely registers.' Only positive note is about the director emphasizing wit. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears negative but full review context unknown. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights significant issues with the chemistry between leads and character portrayal, suggesting a negative impression. The mention of the director's emphasis on wit is a minor positive note, but overall the tone is critical. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a lack of chemistry between the leads and criticizes the performances, suggesting a negative overall assessment. The truncated nature of the text lowers the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt heavily criticizes the lead performances and their chemistry—essential to this production—while offering praise for the director's emphasis on the script's wit, suggesting a mixed assessment with substantial reservations about the acting.",
