  "showScoreExcerpt": "“There are entertaining moments in ‘Burn This’, especially when Driver takes Lanford’s vivid, wily language and goes to town with it...Russell can’t help but be upstaged by Driver – and by Uranowitz...’Burn This’ might have worked better if the focus were more sharply on the emotional duet, without scenes that now feel extraneous or dated. Perhaps it would have felt breathless at 90 minutes, instead of 150.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed signals - praises Driver's performance and acknowledges entertaining moments, but criticizes pacing, length (150 vs ideal 90 minutes), and dated material. No clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges entertaining moments, particularly due to Driver's performance, but also notes issues with pacing and focus, suggesting a mixed experience overall. | Gemini: The review mentions entertaining moments but also points out issues with focus and pacing. The excerpt suggests a mixed experience, leaning slightly positive due to Driver's performance. | Kimi: While the excerpt praises Driver's performance and Wilson's language as 'vivid,' it significantly qualifies this by noting the play feels overlong (150 minutes vs. a suggested 90), contains 'extraneous or dated' scenes, and suffers from casting imbalances. The single excerpt limitation prevents definitive classification, but the tone suggests qualified interest rather than a clear recommendation.",
