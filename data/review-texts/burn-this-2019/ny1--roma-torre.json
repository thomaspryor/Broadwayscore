  "showScoreExcerpt": "“While the performance overshadows the play itself, there's no denying Driver and Russell together are smokin' hot...Wilson clearly had a lot more on his mind than penning a romantic drama...But the ideas are never fully developed and Wilson falls back on contrivances that bring Anna and Pale back together. The performances are all excellent...Mayer does the best he can with the imperfect play, and though over-long, the production catches fire every time Driver enters the room.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Praises performances highly but criticizes the play itself as 'imperfect' with underdeveloped ideas and contrivances. Single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review praises the performances, particularly Driver, but criticizes the play's structure and development. The excerpt suggests a mixed verdict with strong performances but significant issues with the play itself. | Gemini: The review praises the performances, especially Driver's, but notes the play itself is imperfect and Wilson's ideas are not fully developed. This suggests a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The critic praises the performances as 'excellent' and 'smokin' hot' and notes the production 'catches fire,' but levels significant criticism at the play itself as 'imperfect' and 'over-long,' resulting in a qualified recommendation based largely on the cast. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
