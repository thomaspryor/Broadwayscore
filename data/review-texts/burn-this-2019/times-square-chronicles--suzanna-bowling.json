  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Driver and Russell are like a slow blazing fire. Though they do not combust, there is heat. In their first round, the two smolder and are sexy as hell, but in the second round somehow the chemistry embers are just too lazy to ignite...Russell is beautiful and dancer like. Driver is larger than life, wonderfully quirky and very DeNiro like. Furr has more chemistry with Uranowitz who almost steals the show...Mayer keeps this two hour and twenty minute show on its toes.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt praises individual performances (Driver 'larger than life', Uranowitz 'almost steals the show') but notes chemistry issues between leads ('chemistry embers are just too lazy to ignite'). Mixed positive and negative elements with single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The review highlights chemistry and performances but notes a lack of full ignition and mixed chemistry. The excerpt suggests a balance of positive and negative elements, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review praises the actors and direction but notes a lack of chemistry in the second round, suggesting a qualified recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for individual performances and direction, but includes significant reservations about the lead chemistry fizzling in the second act, suggesting a qualified rather than enthusiastic recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
