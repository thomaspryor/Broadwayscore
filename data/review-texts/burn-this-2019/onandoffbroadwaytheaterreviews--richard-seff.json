  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Russell, Uranowitz, and Furr are resourceful actors who bring dimension...and we find ourselves...interested in following these three whose problems we hope to find resolved...Pale is a large character, and Wilson has written him brilliantly. He is aided by actor Driver...The conclusion is somewhat abrupt...What matter is the chemistry between Anna and Pale is hot; and though I’d feel that heat uncomfortably if I stayed too close to it, I had a fine time watching it build and grow.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the actors and writing with some reservations about the conclusion. The critic explicitly states they 'had a fine time' despite concerns. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation and truncated text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the actors and their chemistry, with a positive personal reaction from the critic. Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone suggests a strong positive impression. | Gemini: The review praises the actors and the chemistry between the characters, and states the reviewer had a \"fine time\" watching it. The conclusion being \"somewhat abrupt\" suggests a reservation, but overall the tone is positive. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows clear enthusiasm for the writing ('brilliantly'), performances ('resourceful actors'), and central chemistry ('hot'), culminating in the critic having a 'fine time.' Minor reservation about abrupt conclusion keeps it from Rave territory.",
