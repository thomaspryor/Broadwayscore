  "fullText": "Adam Driver and Keri Russell star in \"Burn/This\" on Broadway. (Matthew Murphy) When Lanford Wilson’s “Burn/This” was first performed at Steppenwolf in Chicago at 1987, it famously starred John Malkovich and Joan Allen as, respectively, Pale and Anna — the coked-up, gangsterish manager of a mediocre restaurant in Montclair, N.J., and the arty, grieving downtown dancer he seduces after showing up uninvited at her loft.\n\nPale makes a famously manic entrance in the kind of wild, frantic, theatrical rage that now would likely get a guy arrested, not greeted with, “I’m sorry, do I know you?”\n\nMalkovich — who literally bounced off the walls of the set like the ball in Pong, spewing profanities as his sinewy body flung itself through space — played Pale in a stringy, shoulder-length black wig.\n\nAdam Driver, the main reason most people are willing to pay the big bucks to revisit the urban perils of the late 1980s at the Hudson Theatre, needs no such assistance when it comes to really great hair.\n\nHis thatched mane, falling in waves across his chiseled face, is a living, breathing justification for why Anna, now played by Kerri Russell, falls at least in lust with this troubled visitor who is the homophobic brother of Anna’s just-dead roommate, a gay dancer who was both her friend and muse.\n\nAnna already has a regular lover, boring Burton (David Furr), a sci-fi screenwriter, and she has another quippy gay roommate in Larry (Brandon Uranowitz). But she immediately gravitates to the badly behaving Pale for two reasons.\n\nHe's hot. And he shares her grief.\n\n“Burn/This,” which opened on Broadway Tuesday night under the direction of Michael Mayer, is fundamentally a play about the eroticism of mourning, a phenomenon that explains people hooking up at funerals. When surrounded by the death of the young, as so many of us were in the late 1980s, sex — even with ill-advised partners — could become a kind of grasping for life.\n\nThat’s what Anna is doing, even though more than one critic back in the day saw Pale as only a slightly less crude version of Stanley Kowalski. He is not the character most playwrights today would depict with such sympathy.\n\nThere is very much to like about Driver’s performance. What Malkovich did in 1987 would be untenable now, and Driver finds enough vulnerability in Pale, and sufficient unctuous humor and erotic charge, that we empathize with his concealed pain. Wilson well knew that a lot of straight male siblings, circa 1990, couldn’t process the death of gay brothers they loved, and thus found themselves lurching between toxic masculine rage and lost puppydom, always craving an open pair of arms, even if they had no idea what to do there when they arrived.\n\nDriver has both of those sides in place. Plus, his guy is just more interesting than Anna’s alternative, even if Furr creates an honest fellow, a kinder heart who couldn’t be like Pale if Anna was threatening to leave him at the altar. Some of us know the feeling.\n\nThe changed times, of course, have not made bad decisions about lovers, or maybe good decisions in the moment, any less common. That said, the problem with this production is that it doesn't spend enough time at either end of the dial.\n\nAnd despite the fun 1980s playlist, you never feel like it's sufficiently contextualizing love and sex in this now-foreign era. It resides in its period, certainly, and Derek Mclane's overly romantic set is a reminder of when lofts had at least the remnants of being a lifestyle kind of statement, but it needed to be bolder.\n\nLike Uranowitz, whose Larry gets all the funniest lines, Russell is a very appealing performer. But her choices surrounding Pale need to feel more momentous, more amplified, more defined, more threatening to her comfort zone.\n\nLove and sex are ever complex and while I don't doubt some will rail against \"Burn/This\" and its tropes as a dated piece of Broadway theater, Wilson was so compassionate and haunting a writer that his play was, and is, filled with comfort, and some challenge, for everyone.\n\nAs its title implies, “Burn/This” is complex and dangerous; it is worth more risk.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic praises Driver's performance and Wilson's writing, but finds the production lacks boldness and doesn't fully utilize its potential. Mixed signals with qualified appreciation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges strong performances, especially by Adam Driver, but criticizes the production for not fully capturing the era's context and lacking boldness. It suggests the play has complexity and danger but falls short in execution. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, highlighting Driver's performance and Wilson's writing. However, it also notes that the production doesn't fully contextualize the era and that Russell's choices need to be more amplified, indicating reservations. | Kimi: While the critic finds the production insufficiently bold and lacking contextualization of the 1980s setting, they deliver strong praise for Adam Driver's lead performance ('vulnerability,' 'erotic charge') and find Lanford Wilson's play 'compassionate and haunting.' The recommendation is qualified by production flaws but ultimately positive due to the lead performances and source material. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
