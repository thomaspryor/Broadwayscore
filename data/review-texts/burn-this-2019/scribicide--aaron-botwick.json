The script indicates an animalistic attraction, one that is equal parts alluring and frightening. But their relationship appears out of nowhere, without much warning or conviction, and moves at an unconvincing speed.\"\n\nRead more",

However, single excerpt warning requires caution - this may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the play as 'nothing special' and highlights a significant flaw in the lack of chemistry between the lead actors, suggesting a negative overall impression. However, the single excerpt warning indicates potential cherry-picking, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses disappointment with the lack of chemistry between the leads and criticizes the play itself, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the play as 'nothing special' and highlights a fatal flaw in the central performances, finding the relationship unconvincing and lacking the required conviction.",
