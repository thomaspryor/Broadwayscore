  "bwwExcerpt": "If you've ever had an elderly relative and been faced with the decision of whether to begin elder care, then you may find yourself connecting with 'The Velocity of Autumn,' the funny, touching new play by Eric Coble now open at the Booth Theatre. Directed by Molly Smith, the dark comedy explores the question of independence, familial obligation and the emotions one experiences when entering life's final chapter...It's a haunting reality, and one Parsons guides us through in a nuanced, skillful performance. She lets Alexandra be brash and ballsy, while still giving her moments of internal doubt and fear. Alexandra's mind might be foggy, but her tongue never numbs, and Parsons leads that attack with alacrity. You'll find yourself rooting for Alexandra, sympathizing with her even if the logical part of your brain knows her future is unavoidable.",
