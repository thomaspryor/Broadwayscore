  "fullText": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/theater/estelle-parsons-with-explosives-in-velocity-of-autumn.htmlShare full articleAdvertisement\n\nEstelle Parsons, the great actor who stars as an embattled but indomitable Brooklyn painter in “The Velocity of Autumn,” a new play by Eric Coble, seems to be living an eternal springtime. Now 86, Ms. Parsons has lost little, if any, of her energy, and absolutely none of her ability to bring sustained, animated life to a well-drawn character. She never leaves the stage during this 90-minute, two-character play, which opened on Monday night at the Booth Theater, and yet she seems daisy-fresh at the curtain call, as if ready to run a half-marathon as an encore.\n\nIn her determination to continue living her life on her own terms, Ms. Parsons has much in common with Alexandra, the woman she portrays in Mr. Coble’s wispy but amiable comedy-drama about the ravages of getting older, directed by Molly Smith, the artistic director of the Arena Stage in Washington, where this production was first seen. As the curtain rises on a large, lived-in-looking room in Alexandra’s Brooklyn home, it’s hard not to notice one oddity about the décor: Scattered around the floor in clusters are dozens of liquid-filled bottles from which white rags sprout like flowers.\n\nAlexandra, it seems, has decided that if she’s going to be forced by her pesky son and daughter to vacate the premises, she’s going to take the premises with her, after a fashion, by blowing herself up and spreading chunks of brownstone all over Park Slope. Recruited by said son and daughter to foil this desperate act is Alexandra’s other son, Chris (Stephen Spinella), who clambers in through the window as the play opens, while his mother calmly looks on, offering no assistance.\n\nIf you set aside the artificial whimsy of the play’s conceit — the notion that homemade Molotov cocktails would bring down a building, let alone a chunk of the neighborhood, as it is suggested, is a little absurd — it’s possible to enjoy the testy give-and-take between Alexandra and Chris, who have much history to hash over, because he’s been out of touch for the past 20 years.\n\nWhile the conversation occasionally strays into unprofitable byways, the play passes by breezily because Ms. Parsons is such fun to watch, the birdlike squawk in her distinctive voice rising and falling as Alexandra jousts with her son, showing few signs of the mental and physical fragility that have supposedly been of such concern.\n\nYes, she admits to a certain incident at a bridge game, when Alexandra believed players were cheating, and she grew a little violent. And there was something upsetting at the grocery store that Alexandra can’t actually recall. Alexandra also admits that since food doesn’t have much taste anymore, she sometimes goes a day without eating.\n\nBut are these sufficient reasons to pry a woman from her home of 45 years and send her off to a retirement center? Alexandra thinks not and is prepared to immolate herself at any moment rather than give in to the “Mongol hordes,” as she refers to her dear children.\n\nAs she and Chris open negotiations, it’s clear that Alexandra has never been an easy woman — or, perhaps, the most nurturing of mothers, either. Gradually, of course, they lay down their verbal arms, recognizing that the tension between them has perhaps always derived from their similar temperaments: independent-minded, artistically inclined and more than a little fond of solitude. (“Free at last, thank God almighty!” Alexandra remembers exulting, in an unmaternal way, when her children were finally of school age.)\n\nBoth mother and son are painters, but as Chris gradually admits, the end of a relationship and the general unhappy drift of his life — he’s been living in New Mexico, working a dead-end job — are among the reasons he’s kept himself hidden away. Chris isn’t drawn with the natural felicity of Alexandra — his longer monologues, one about the allure of suicide, another about witnessing a fatal accident, can seem too sculptured — but Mr. Spinella infuses the character with a life-worn gentleness that makes his disappointment in himself touching. (A pity about the ponytail, however: never a good look on a middle-aged man.)\n\nIn the hands of a lesser actress, Alexandra might come across as a generically feisty old lady, a more bohemian version of, say, Estelle Getty’s Sophia on “The Golden Girls.” But Ms. Parsons’s starchy, sentiment-free performance never allows us to get too comfortable in her presence. The play’s (strained) title refers to the speed with which the frailties of old age can descend. Alexandra can be tartly funny on the subject: Reaching for a word, she grouses, “Proper nouns are the first thing to leave the body.” Ms. Parsons delivers these and other jokes with a lightness of touch that gently peels away any sense of the sitcomic.\n\nAn actress with long experience as a teacher at the Actors Studio, she has an unerring way of focusing on the humanity in her character and connecting it to every word she speaks and every movement she makes. With small physical gestures — leaning gently against a bookcase for support, slowly edging herself forward in her chair to ease the process of rising — Ms. Parsons indicates the frailty that Alexandra eventually admits to feeling.\n\nAnd without descending anywhere close to bathos, she brings a moving, rueful sense of grievance to the play’s finest passages, in which Alexandra describes the frustrations of realizing that her body and her mind are gradually losing their resilience, and that the greatest loss is the sense of individuality in which she has always taken pride.\n\n“What the world is taking away from me, what time is taking away from me, what God is taking away from me — is me!” she says with a wail of despair at one point. In these moments, and in Ms. Parsons’s more than capable hands, Mr. Coble’s play rises above its slightly formulaic structure to become a dry-eyed, moving rumination on the hard fact that the progress of human life being what it is, truly happy endings are rare indeed.",
