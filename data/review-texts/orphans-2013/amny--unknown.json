  "bwwExcerpt": "Kessler's play attempts to combine traditional family drama with raw, kitchen-sink realism and absurdist logic. Although the unusual scenario that it explores is engaging at first, it eventually runs out of steam and inspiration. Nevertheless, under Sullivan's direction, all three cast members deliver tremendous performances with ensemble unity. It also can't be denied that Baldwin's Harold is reminiscent of the outsized persona of Jack Donaghy on '30 Rock.' 2.5 stars.",
