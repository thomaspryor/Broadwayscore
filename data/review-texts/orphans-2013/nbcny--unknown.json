  "bwwExcerpt": "The comic timing we've come to associate with the Tony-nominated Baldwin is on grand display...Foster's shady Treat vacillates between menacing and childlike; at any point, you fear he may knife Harold, or hug him...Sturridge is phenomenal as Phillip, the type of fellow we'd think of today as falling somewhere on the autistic spectrum, though such classifications likely weren't part of Kessler's vernacular back in the day. His Phillip inhabits the tiny confines of the row house like a cat, leaping lithely from sofa to stairs to windowsill (the appropriately glum set is by John Lee Beatty).",
