  "bwwExcerpt": "On Broadway in 2013, Orphans is not so much menacing as meagre. A larger, Broadway stage has robbed the two-act work of its claustrophobic thrills...The actors provide us with most of the production's scattered pleasures. Tom Sturridge wrings laughs from Phillip's every dazed discovery...Ben Foster...gives Treat tremendous swagger...The role of Harold exposes Baldwin's limitations as an actor. The character does allow him to show off his gift for fast-talking Irish blarney...But too much of Baldwin's charm relies on our acknowledging that he's the smartest guy in the room.",
