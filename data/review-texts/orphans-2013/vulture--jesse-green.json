  "bwwExcerpt": "You can see why actors are attracted to it: The roles, with their various stylistic references and physical demands, are almost like five-finger exercises for drama students. And audiences enjoy watching them flex. I did too: It's undeniably a pleasure to hand yourself over to Baldwin for two hours. And under Daniel Sullivan's typically impeccable direction, Ben Foster and Tom Sturridge are also excellent as Teach and Phillip, the former giving a more naturalist performance and the latter pulling out all the expressionistic stops...But roles, even as well filled as they are in this production, don't make theater, and the question that lingers after the swift little dream of Orphans passes is: What just happened?",
