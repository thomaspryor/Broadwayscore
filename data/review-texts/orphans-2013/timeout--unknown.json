  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Daniel Sullivan makes the fatal mistake of trusting a play that is just an excuse for actors to fling themselves around a squalid set and out-emote each other. The airy, far-too-clean space only shows up Orphans' contrivances. Foster and Sturridge are both commendable-physically robust, emotionally raw yet assured-but in the service of what? Baldwin coasts on his natural charisma and comic timing, assuming a weirdly stilted delivery, a mix of Edward G. Robinson and Clark Gable. It's a dull, mechanical night.",
