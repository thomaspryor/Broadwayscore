Not only is its premise self-evidently derived from Harold Pinter's 'The Caretaker,' but Mr. Kessler has pinched other elements of the play from sources as diverse as 'The Glass Menagerie,' 'Our Town' and Sam Shepard's 'True West.' But it's still an exceptionally effective vehicle for three strong actors, and Mr. Baldwin is both strong and moving, playing Harold as if he were",

The tone indicates a negative assessment without any redeeming qualities mentioned. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the play is not working on a Broadway scale, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The text appears to be truncated or an excerpt, but the available sentence delivers a clear negative verdict criticizing the production's unsuitability for Broadway scale.",
