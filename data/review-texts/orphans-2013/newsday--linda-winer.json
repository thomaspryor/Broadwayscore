  "bwwExcerpt": "How terrific to have Baldwin back onstage and in such sly command of every nuance. Though he is hardly the steamy beauty who captured theatergoers with offbeat romances and scary Joe Ortonplays in the mid-'80s, there is no hint of the sluggish actor who dragged himself through 'Macbeth' in 1998.",
