  "bwwExcerpt": "When I saw the original Off-Broadway production of Lyle Kessler's 'Orphans' back in 1985, I found the play to be a tiresome mix of pilfered Pinter and stolen Shepard...Nearly 30 years later the play is getting its Broadway debut, but time hasn't altered my assessment. 'Orphans' remains as synthetic as ever, only now Tom Sturridge, Ben Foster, and Alec Baldwin do the bravura thesping...In a fearlessly physical turn, Sturridge gives Phillip sweetness and vulnerability, emphasizing his all-but-smothered intelligence and wide-eyed desire to learn. Foster's Treat is at first a boiling cauldron of rage, his lid ready to blow at the slightest provocation...Broadway veteran Baldwin snaps with paternal authority as Harold and is amusingly sentimental in the man's desire to help these two boys...The actor misses, however, the edgy sense of menace that Mahoney brought to the role.",
