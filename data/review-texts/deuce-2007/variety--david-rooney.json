  "rejectionReasoning": "openai: The review mentions Angela Lansbury and Marian Seldes, indicating it is about a previous production, not the current Broadway run.; kimi: This review references Angela Lansbury and Marian Seldes in a Terrence McNally play about tennis partners ('Deuce'), which played Broadway in 2007. Both actresses are deceased (Seldes 2014, Lansbury 2022), so this cannot be a review of a current Broadway production.",
