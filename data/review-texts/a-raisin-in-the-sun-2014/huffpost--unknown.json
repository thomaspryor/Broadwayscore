  "bwwExcerpt": "For this version, Walter Lee describes himself as 40, and therein lies the problem. Washington is 59, and can get away (almost) with appearing as a man almost 20 years younger than he is, but something is still wrong. Hansberry intends Walter Lee's playing fast and loose with the much needed incoming funds to be attributed to a young man's impetuosity. His behavior in those circumstances is understandable if not excusable. Washington, on the other hand, looks too much like a man who long should have known better...Having established all that, I should add that the manner in which Washington skews Hansberry's purpose probably won't bother the actor's fans. They'll be thrilled again to see him up close and personal. And it isn't as if--aside from the way he's miscast himself (the revival is, of course, his choice)--he doesn't give a committed performance.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic identifies a fundamental casting problem that undermines the character's purpose, but acknowledges Washington's committed performance and suggests fans will still be thrilled. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears to be from a longer mixed review. | GPT-4o: The review highlights a significant casting issue with Washington's age affecting the character's believability, but acknowledges his committed performance and appeal to fans. The single excerpt suggests a mixed reception, with both criticism and some appreciation. | Gemini: The review focuses on Denzel Washington's miscasting but acknowledges his committed performance, suggesting it might appeal to his fans despite the issues. The overall tone is mixed, not outright negative. | Kimi: The critic argues Washington's age fundamentally miscasts him for the role's dramatic requirements, undermining Hansberry's intent. While acknowledging the performance is committed and will thrill fans, the review suggests the production is flawed for general audiences.",
