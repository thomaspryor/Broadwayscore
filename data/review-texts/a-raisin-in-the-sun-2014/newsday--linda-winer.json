    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic explicitly tells readers to 'forget all reservations' and describes it as a 'shattering revival,' indicating overwhelming enthusiasm that overcomes any initial doubts. | GPT-4o: The excerpt dismisses any reservations and highlights the difficulty of getting reservations, indicating a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a strong positive recommendation, dismissing any reservations. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the language suggests the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic urges readers to dismiss prior casting concerns and praises Kenny Leon's revival as 'shattering,' indicating strong endorsement despite the excerpt's truncation. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
