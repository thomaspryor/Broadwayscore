  "bwwExcerpt": "Would Washington bring the energy and intensity required to play the dreamy, often feckless Chicago chauffeur? The answer, for the most part, is yes. So much so that early on you cease to worry about the age gap of only five years between Washington and the formidable LaTanya Richardson Jackson (wife to Samuel L), who plays Walter Lee's God-fearing mother, Lena. 'That's acting,' Washington said in a recent interview, speaking of the challenges posed by the casting. And if the double Oscar-winner is no longer quite the 'lean' presence indicated in the text, he fully inhabits the self-described 'volcano' that is Walter Lee, waiting to erupt.",
