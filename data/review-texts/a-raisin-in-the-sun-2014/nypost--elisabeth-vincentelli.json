  "bwwExcerpt": "'A Raisin in the Sun' endures for good reason. Lorraine Hansberry's 1959 play - the first by a black woman on Broadway - features several meaty roles and enough dramatic momentum to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. No wonder stars are drawn to this classic, even when they aren't necessarily right for it. Ten years ago, Sean Combs (a?k?a Puff Daddy) picked 'Raisin' for his Broadway debut.",
