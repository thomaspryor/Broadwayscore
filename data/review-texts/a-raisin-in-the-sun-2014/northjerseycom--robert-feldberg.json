  "bwwExcerpt": "And Washington, despite his fine work, doesn't reach down to reveal the shattering impact on Walter of his dream's destruction. The one performer who allows us inside is Okonedo, a British actress making a superb New York stage debut. Using all the details of the actor's art - small gestures, slight changes in expression - she somehow reveals Ruth's soul. And that makes her longing to establish the family in its own home the most affecting dream of all.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed assessment - criticizes lead performance while praising supporting actress. Limited text prevents clear overall verdict determination. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Okonedo's performance but criticizes Washington for not fully conveying the impact of his character's dream. The overall tone suggests a mixed review with standout moments. | Gemini: The review praises Okonedo's performance as superb and affecting, while noting Washington's performance doesn't fully reach the emotional depth. Given the single excerpt, it's a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows qualified praise for Washington ('fine work' but lacking 'shattering impact') alongside rave reviews for Okonedo's 'superb' debut, suggesting a mildly positive reception centered on standout performances. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
