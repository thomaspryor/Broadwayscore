  "bwwExcerpt": "Every rare while, a great play is given the production it deserves. That's how it is with this revival of 'A Raisin In The Sun'. Director Kenny Leon tackled the drama 10 years ago with Sean Combs in the lead, but what a difference a star makes. And because the 55-year-old work remains astonishingly relevant today, I can happily say Denzel and company are 'da bomb.'",
