  "bwwExcerpt": "Ah, what a difference 10 years and a worthy leading man can make. The new Raisin (* * * * out of four) that opened Thursday at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre is also helmed by Leon, but it stars a riveting Denzel Washington, leading a flawless cast with his best work to date on the Main Stem. The result is a production that, considered alongside its predecessor, is nothing short of revelatory. Where Leon's last Raisin felt stiff and curiously dated, this time he and his company have reclaimed Lorraine Hansberry's 1959 play as an American classic, one that both captures a distinct time in our history and carries an enduring relevance and resonance.",

However, without additional context, the strength of the recommendation is not clear, leading to a medium confidence level. | Gemini: The review states that the production \"succeeds\", indicating a positive recommendation, but it is not overly enthusiastic, suggesting a score in the lower-middle of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states the production 'succeeds' in balancing respect for the source material with naturalistic character development, indicating a clear positive recommendation. However, the excerpt is extremely brief (single sentence), warranting low confidence in the precise strength of the verdict.",
