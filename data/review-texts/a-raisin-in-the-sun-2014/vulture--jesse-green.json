However, this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full verdict, and the text is clearly truncated mid-sentence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Denzel Washington's performance, suggesting a strong portrayal that defies criticism about his age.

Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Washington's physicality and energy, dismissively refuting age concerns, though limited context prevents full assessment.",
