  "bwwExcerpt": "Playwright McDonagh is known for his black humor, in such works as 'The Beauty Queen of Leenane' and 'The Lieutenant of Inishmore.' And there are certainly lots of dark jokes in 'Cripple.' But McDonagh blends them with an unusual sympathy, a compassion that's rare in his plays. It's his most broadly appealing work, and audiences that come for Daniel Radcliffe will get to enjoy much, much more.",
