Photograph: Greg Allen/Greg Allen/Invision/AP This article is more than 11 years oldDaniel Radcliffe on Broadway – The Cripple of Inishmaan reviewsThis article is more than 11 years oldAfter a lukewarm response to his last Broadway appearance, the Harry Potter star has US critics in raptures with his portrayal of Billy Claven in Martin McDonagh's dark comedyIn Martin McDonagh's black comedy The Cripple of Inishmaan, a Hollywood director visits a remote Irish isle to make a movie and sets the locals gossiping and dreaming. In this first Broadway outing for the play, the Hollywood star Daniel Radcliffe has done much the same in New York. The production has captured the imagination of American critics, who – in contrast with the lukewarm response to his 2011 appearance in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying – are buzzing about the star's third outing on the Great White Way.\n\nThe US reviews for The Cripple of Inishmaan, a transfer of Michael Grandage's acclaimed 2013 West End production, mirror the raves it received in the UK. Much as the critics love Radcliffe's \"warm, sympathetic performance\", they're also full of praise for the play itself (\"aches with a subliminal sadness\", \"outrageously funny\"). Judging by the reviews, designer Christopher Oram and composer Alex Baranowski could well feature alongside Grandage and Radcliffe when the Tony nominations are announced next week.\n\nMr Radcliffe's Billy embodies the essence of this beautifully ambivalent play without dominating it, which would throw the production off balance. Despite Billy's gnarled form, which makes even walking an agonising process, he often registers as just one of many vivid portraits in a gallery of oddballs. But then he turns his sea-blue stare outward, and the loss and loneliness in his eyes lance right through you.\"\n\nWorking with the meanest of materials – raw wood, rough stone, and dirty old rags – set and costume designer Christopher Oram creates vivid images of human life as it's lived on this limestone rock in the middle of the sea. Hearing the crashing waves and the eerie cries of seabirds and the mournful folk music supplied by composer and sound designer Alex Baranowski, it's easy to understand how the intolerable loneliness of the place has worked its way into Billy's bones.\"\n\nThe triptych portrait of Daniel Radcliffe on the Playbill cover makes no mistake about the marquee draw, and the Harry Potter star has never been better, more than measuring up in this flawless ensemble. But to quote Hamlet, \"the play's the thing\" in Michael Grandage's cracking production, which makes an entertainingly boozy brew of humor both sweet and savage, melancholy sentimentality, lacerating sorrow and wicked cruelty.\"\n\nOf the three Radcliffe performances I've seen on Broadway (the others were in Equus and How to Succeed), this by far is the best. It really breathes as it hobbles along, and yet it's never showy nor overly optimistic. Radcliffe, who reveals chops here I've never seen on stage nor screen, is surrounded by superb character work throughout, including the killer likes of June Watson and Gary Lilburn. I wish Greene's bruising charmer of a Helen showed just a touch more longing for remove, but these performances are otherwise fulsome emotional creations indeed. You can see tears behind the eyes of the most seemingly impervious characters, with their funny, faux-period banter filtered through McDonagh's caustic, love-hate relationship with the cloistered world that still was around, albeit changing fast, in his youth. These days, it's nearly gone altogether: a shame for the romantics, but not for the Billys of Ireland.\"\n\nAt any point, you can opt out of the sale of all of your personal information by pressing",
