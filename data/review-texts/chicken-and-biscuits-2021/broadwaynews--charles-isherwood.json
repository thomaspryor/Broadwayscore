Conservative positive score given excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises performances, highlighting warmth and vivid presence. However, with only one curated quote, the overall sentiment is uncertain, suggesting a mildly positive review. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on praising specific performances, indicating a positive but possibly qualified recommendation.

Following instructions for clearly positive curated excerpts, scoring at upper end of Positive bucket with low confidence due to excerpt-only availability.",
