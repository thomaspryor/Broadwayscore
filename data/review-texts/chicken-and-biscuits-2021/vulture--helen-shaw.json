  "bwwExcerpt": "Going to Chicken & Biscuits does feel like being fed by loving but overweening relatives. There's a bit too much of it - the published running time notwithstanding, this show lasts more than two hours with no intermission - but it's a meal full of comfort dishes, difficulties resolved, and love requited. It turns the nearly in-the-round space at Circle in the Square into a church with stained-glass windows behind the audience and the great Norm Lewis in the pulpit.",

This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic balances genuine praise for the show's emotional core ('huge heart,' 'warm spirit') against significant criticism of its technical execution ('serious problems,' failure to 'land its punches'), resulting in a neither-recommend-nor-discourage assessment.",
