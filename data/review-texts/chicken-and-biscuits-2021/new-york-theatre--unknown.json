    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise ('entertainingly') but acknowledges imperfections ('All is not perfect'). The positive tone is tempered by reservations, placing it in lower Positive range. Low confidence due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the play is entertaining and has a relevant message, indicating a positive view. However, the lack of full context and only one excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the play is entertaining, but the truncated nature and single excerpt lowers confidence. The phrase \"all is not perfect\" indicates some reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly praises the show as 'entertaining' and describes its message as 'perfect,' indicating a clear recommendation despite minor imperfections noted. Per the single excerpt warning, the clearly positive language warrants the upper end of the Positive bucket, though confidence remains low given only curated excerpts are available.",
