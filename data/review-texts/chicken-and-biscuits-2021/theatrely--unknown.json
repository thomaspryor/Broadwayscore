  "bwwExcerpt": "Lyons' play is nothing new, but it feels joyful and pure. I do wonder if the familiar bit about a relative's latent homophobia being framed as a pesky character trait and not a damnable offense has any place in 2021, but it skirts the offensive here by quickly reframing it as more of a race than a sexuality issue, in the case of Kenny and Logan. Still, with the cast having this much fun onstage, it's hard not to feel like part of the family, and Chicken & Biscuits is comfort food worth reheating",
