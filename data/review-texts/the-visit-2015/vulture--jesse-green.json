    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show's visual beauty but finds it fundamentally lacking in vitality. The 'amber' metaphor suggests something preserved but dead, which is a significant criticism despite aesthetic praise. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'beautiful to look at but oddly lifeless,' indicating a negative impression despite visual appeal. The tone suggests a lack of engagement or vitality, leading to a negative recommendation. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"beautiful to look at but oddly lifeless,\" indicating a mixed reaction. It acknowledges positive aspects (beautiful) but also points out a significant flaw (lifeless). | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the production's visual beauty ('beautiful to look at'), the verdict 'oddly lifeless' constitutes a clear recommendation against seeing the show, as theatrical vitality is essential to the medium. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
