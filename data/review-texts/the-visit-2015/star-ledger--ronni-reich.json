  "bwwExcerpt": "The work is both recognizable Kander and Ebb style and a departure and is the last they created together...it comes across as something of a morality play or fable. Its book by Terrence McNally relies on symbolism and ideas more than multifaceted characters. Director John Doyle's staging and the music both call to mind a contemporary oratorio, with the company facing front for much of the staging and a score that pulls in dissonance, percussive noise and intricate textures. The form is fascinating, as are the central issues and the strangeness of the piece...But the book and lyrics can be blunt and redundant...As Claire...Rivera...savors her dry punch lines. Still, at this stage in her venerable career, she's mostly speak-singing, even when there's an appealingly eerie chorus of her countertenor eunuchs to back her. Roger Rees telegraphs excitement in his scenes with her, and we feel the weight on him as he considers his possibilities.",
