  "bwwExcerpt": "'The Visit' is a haunting, haunted knot of Expressionist storytelling, a masterly 100-minute powerhouse with liltingly gruesome songs that create their own macabre world unlike anything onstage in recent memory. This will not be everyone's idea of a night on the town. But Rivera, an astonishing 82, is riveting as the mysterious, vengeful grand dame...Roger Rees is shattering, brimming with hapless vanity, as the pathetic shopkeeper who broke her heart so many years ago. Under John Doyle's taut, unflinching and strangely enchanting direction...the chamber work has the feel of a dark European fable -- albeit one with timeless theatricality. The music is woozy with disturbing dance rhythms, dripping with music-box sarcasm...Then there is Rivera, with her steely, gravelly voice and the resolve of a character who says, 'I am unkillable.' We dare you to take your eyes off her.",
