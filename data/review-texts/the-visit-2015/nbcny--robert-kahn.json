  "bwwExcerpt": "Never trust a woman who travels with her own coffin. That's one big takeaway from 'The Visit,' the thought-provoking and -- there's no other word for the experience -- bizarre musical...Rivera is provocative as Claire. The venerable actress is on stage for most of the production, and gets in a few chorus line kicks here and there...The two-time Tony winner has an entrance, in billowy white fur coat and hat, that's as thrilling as you'd want it to be...Rivera is solid, but it's the melancholy and soulfulness in Rees's performance that holds back 'The Visit' from any risk of sliding into a parody of itself...Do everything in your powers to avoid having the ending spoiled.",
