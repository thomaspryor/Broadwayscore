  "bwwExcerpt": "Trust a John Kander-Fred Ebb musical to make the sunny color of vitality and youth positively menacing...[Kander's] music is wonderfully complicated; some are fully fleshed out numbers and others seductive sketches that pull you in...Hould-Ward...has a surreal retinue of three men in tuxes and black hats who wear sunglasses, caked-on makeup and extravagant yellow shoes. They sing in falsettos and are utterly chilling...Rivera is as elegantly regal, funny and sly as always. Her billionaire is haughty and irritable but there's simply no denying her...'The Visit' is sophisticated and beautiful and yet has that typical glorious chilling view of man that you expect from a Kander and Ebb show.",
