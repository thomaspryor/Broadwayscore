  "bwwExcerpt": "Claire is Durrenmatt's vengeful god, out to make life a living hell for the townspeople who done her wrong long ago...The billionaire Claire is anything but a dame or a broad and she's certainly no Broadway gypsy. Which is what gives Rivera's performance such resonance and power: She's cast way against type, and at age 82 she exposes a facet of her stage persona never seen before. Amazing! Rivera is well matched by Rees...Rees's Anton gets it coming and going. Rees doesn't possess a good singing voice...His acting, though, carries the performance.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"This brilliant musical is a James Ensor painting drained of most colors, and the mix of John Kander’s riffs and plaintive ballads suit that dark vision to perfection...The gift of Kander and Ebb’s score is that it never sentimentalizes the material, but rather deepens our understanding of Claire’s motive and her shared tragedy with Anton...Fans of the American musical have much to be thankful for this season.\"\n\nRead more"
