  "bwwExcerpt": "...The Visit offers [Rivera] the best role of her illustrious career, and she plays it like the great star she has become. It's difficult material, but Terrence McNally's book and the Kander and Ebb score have turned what could have been murky and painful to watch, into a melodic and adult story of true love gone wrong and it is mesmerizing. Slowly, as the townspeople turn from outrage to greed, we follow with interest because never do the writers or director allow it to become less than layered",
