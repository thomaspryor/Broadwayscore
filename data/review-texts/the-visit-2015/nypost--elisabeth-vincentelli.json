  "bwwExcerpt": "It's Chita Rivera's world: We just live in it. This works out very well for the Kander and Ebb musical 'The Visit,' in which the charismatic star plays a billionairess who buys her hometown...It being by John Kander and the late Fred Ebb...delights in uncovering greed, hypocrisy and the perversion of justice. Admittedly, this isn't their strongest score...The ensemble is impeccable, save for Rees, who looked visibly uncomfortable at a recent performance and whose singing is serviceable at best. But 'The Visit' is Claire, and Rivera...'I'm unkillable,' Claire says. And you may find yourself wishing Rivera could also go on forever.",
