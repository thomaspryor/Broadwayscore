Given the single excerpt warning, the score is at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the play and the performances of the actors. Due to the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise, calling the play 'compelling as ever' and highlighting strong performances, indicating a clear recommendation despite limited context.",
