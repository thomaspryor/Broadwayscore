  "bwwExcerpt": "What does emerge is a wonderful character study. Patrick Stewart is a marvel in dumbing down his God-given talents. This Brit playing a mediocre American actor, even manages to mangle Robert's British accent. There’s a poignancy as well when Stewart, through the laughs, reveals the emptiness in Robert’s life. T.R. Knight's role is basically one of second banana but he certainly holds his own especially when the two are botching a scene together.",
