  "bwwExcerpt": "It's a good thing, then, that in this well-executed revival, Patrick Stewart and T.R. Knight — playing the lead pair of theater actors at opposite ends of their careers — have the chemistry of offbeat pals who like to jabber. Stewart and Knight, both at the top of their game here, embrace the strange spirit of the show and imbue Mamet's 26 madcap vignettes with a feeling of buoyant, urgent comedy that elicits lots of laughs — and only the occasional grimace.",

  "fullText": "David Mamet's 1977 gem of a play, A Life in the Theatre, turns on nimble repartee and precise casting. The show moves along at a rabbit's pace through scene after scene, all of which are laced with sharp, quick dialogue that ranges in subject matter from the virtues of cold cream to audition woes.

The B+ grade and consistent praise place this in solid Positive territory. | Gemini: The critic gives the show a D rating, which indicates a negative review. While they praise the actors' chemistry, the overall assessment is not positive. | Kimi: Despite the metadata note suggesting a 'D' rating, the review text explicitly awards the production a 'B+' and delivers consistent praise for the lead performances and comic timing, calling it a 'well-executed revival' that generates buoyant comedy and frequent laughter.",
