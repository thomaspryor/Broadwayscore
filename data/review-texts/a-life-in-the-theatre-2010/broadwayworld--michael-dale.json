  "bwwExcerpt": "Stewart doesn't hide the large degree of ego-massaging motivating Robert's tutorials, as though he takes special delight in having mastered the role of the wise, old mentor. But his hammyness is cured with a seasoned charm. Knight plays it straight for most of the piece, but succeeds in the subtler job communicating how John's gratitude for veteran's attention gradually dissolves as he recognizes the man behind his off-stage character and grows more distant as his confidence builds and others recognize his own talent.",
