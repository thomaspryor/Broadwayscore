    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performances as a 'master class in acting' suggests a positive recommendation, but with only one curated excerpt available, the overall verdict remains uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances as a 'master class in acting', indicating a strong positive impression of the actors' handling of the dialogue. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the acting as a \"master class,\" which suggests a positive recommendation. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong specific praise for the lead performances ('master class'), indicating clear enthusiasm for the acting. Per the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the upper Positive range (80-84), though confidence is low given the limited context.",
