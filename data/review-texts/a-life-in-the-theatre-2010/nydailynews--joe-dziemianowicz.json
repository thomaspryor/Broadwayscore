  "fullText": "'A Life in Theatre' review: T.R. Knight and Patrick Stewart play needs emergency jump-start\n\nWednesday, October 13th 2010, 4:00 AM\n\nThough it's called \"A Life in the Theatre,\" it can be difficult to detect any vital signs in the sluggish Broadway revival of David Mamet's 1977 comedy.\n\nAs light on nastiness (just six F-bombs in 80 minutes) as it is on narrative, the two-hander's wispiness is amplified by director Neil Pepe's overblown and pokey production.\n\nTold in 26 scenes -- some consisting of just a couple lines of dialogue or a sight gag -- it follows two actors at an unnamed repertory company for a season of plays.\n\nRobert (Patrick Stewart) is a career stage thesp getting on in years, a peacocky preener whose feathers get ruffled at even a perceived slight. John (T.R. Knight) is a newbie with promise and the bouncy energy of youth.\n\nThey're seen performing scenes from shows in which they play World War I doughboys, stuffy lawyers and doctors in an operating theater (a moment that reads like a Marx Brothers movie, not a stage play).\n\nBetween these scenes, they talk (mostly about work) in their dressing room, at the gym or in the wings. Gradually there's a shift in power between the men.\n\n\"Life\" wants to be a fast-flowing montage, but this one lags due to scenery and costume changes that should have been tightened -- or, better, simplified -- to keep things racing.\n\nStewart, a seasoned stage vet before his stint on the Starship Enterprise, skillfully plays an actor in the twilight of his glory. It's a role he did in London in 2005.\n\nKnight, who leapt from Broadway to \"Grey's Anatomy,\" goes from cute (his signature) to callow as John grows less receptive to his older mentor's viewpoints. Both stars do nice work, which isn't the same as setting off bright, colorful sparks.\n\nBlame the play, in part. Despite easy laughs that arise from watching actors deal with missed cues, misfiring props and the discomfort of sharing a dressing room, the early-career Mamet's scenes and characters are shallow and shapeless. The elder actor's decline makes little impact as a result.\n\nThe cleverest moment belongs to Robert when he equates \"superior theater\" to a walnut -- \"meaty on the inside and tight all around.\" Very actorspeak. Too bad this \"A Life in the Theatre\" comes off as pure peanuts.\n\nKristin Chenoweth is not the first celeb to hit the Great White Way. Several stars have traded in the big screen for the stage.\n\nTea Party hothead says he will batter Andrew Cuomo as hypocrite on gay rights.\n\nA-Rod, Bombers bash Rangers for five runs in 8th to cap amazing comeback.\n\nPHOTOS: Meet the Bronx Bombshells! Minka Kelly named \"Sexiest Woman Alive\".\n\nCareer criminal dubbed 'Johnny Shades' has been a free man for 82 days in 30 years.\n\nJoe Picurro volunteered to cut steel at Ground Zero, a choice that cost him his life.\n\nIt's the perfect match! A singer who loves to flaunt her body, and body-revealing lingerie.\n\nSgt. Scott Wallace couldn't afford plane ticket to friend's wedding, then Gary Iliano stepped in.\n\nWATCH: Joel Burns delivers tearful speech during city council meeting on growing up gay.\n\nSign showed President as a suicide bomber, gangster, Mexican bandit and a gay man.\n\nA Manhattan woman wants to have sperm extracted from her dead husband so she can raise the family he always wanted.\n\nPHOTOS: Teen Taylor Momsen proves age is nothing but a number - in a bad way.\n\nWe are all for Breast Cancer Awareness, but fried food & guns?!\n\nIt appears the prime cut in Halloween costumes in Lady Gaga's meat dress.\n\nUse of this website signifies your agreement to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. ©",

While praising individual performances, the overall recommendation is against. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the production for being sluggish and shallow, despite praising the actors' performances. The overall tone suggests disappointment and a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges nice work from the actors but ultimately finds the production sluggish, the scenes shallow, and the characters shapeless, leading to a negative assessment. The final line, \"Too bad this 'A Life in the Theatre' comes off as pure peanuts,\" seals the negative verdict. | Kimi: The critic describes the revival as sluggish and overblown, criticizing Mamet's play as shallow and shapeless despite acknowledging that both stars do 'nice work.' The dismissive conclusion that the show comes off as 'pure peanuts' confirms the negative verdict.",
