  "bwwExcerpt": "Regrettably, Neil Pepe's production fuses no such feelings into the backstage fun. His actors, both accomplished individually, make no emotional connection; Santo Loquasto's settings make the rep theater they work in seem as vast and anonymous as the Met.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt is clearly negative, criticizing the director's inability to create emotional connection and describing the setting as 'vast and anonymous.' However, with only one excerpt available, this could be cherry-picked from a larger mixed or even positive review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the production for lacking emotional connection and describes the setting as vast and anonymous. The tone is negative, indicating disappointment with the production. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses disappointment with the production, citing a lack of emotional connection between the actors and an uninspired set design. Given the negative tone, I placed it in the negative bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt expresses clear disappointment, noting that despite accomplished actors, the production achieves no emotional connection and the design feels anonymous. As a single curated excerpt, the confidence is reduced, but the language ('regrettably,' 'no emotional connection') indicates a recommendation against seeing the show.",
