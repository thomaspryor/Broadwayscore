  "bwwExcerpt": "Wonderfully assured in manner — until later in the story when Robert begins to falter — the craggy-faced Stewart suggests a rather florid artiste of the old school, complete with rich, plummy, vocal accents. Bouncing with youthful energy as John, Knight displays a puppy-dog eagerness that turns more reserved as he matures. The actors' personal interplay backstage might be expressed more intimately than it is here, but apparently director Neil Pepe intends to keep this production on the lighter, brighter side.",
