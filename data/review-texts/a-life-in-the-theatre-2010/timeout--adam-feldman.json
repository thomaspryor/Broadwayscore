  "bwwExcerpt": "Gentleness is not the first quality that leaps to mind when it comes to the work of David Mamet. But the bile master's 1977 two-hander, A Life in the Theatre-now making its Broadway debut in a slight but entertaining production starring Patrick Stewart and T.R. Knight-has little of the rat-a-tat dramatic firepower of Mamet's later and more famous works. It is a knowing, affectionate, faintly nostalgic portrait of actors and the roles they play onstage and off, and Mamet tends to illuminate them not with the glare of a follow spot but rather by the soft glow of a ghost light.",
