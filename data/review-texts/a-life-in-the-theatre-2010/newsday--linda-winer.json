However, the single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"exhilarating showcase\" and \"thrilling joyride,\" indicating a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the language suggests a score towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the performances and production, describing it as an exhilarating and thrilling theatrical experience. Confidence is reduced due to limited text availability.",
