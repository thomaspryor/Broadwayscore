  "bwwExcerpt": "Neil Pepe's directorial concept is pretty grand, and he's gotten Santo Loquasto to provide more set changes and Laura Bauer more costume pieces that your average Metropolitan Opera production. This has the twin effects of slowing the show down constantly (so that a new thingamajig can be rolled onto the stage and Stewart and Knight can change into yet another witty set of outfits) and enlivening the proceedings enormously. Loquasto's reverse-perspective on-stage scenes, offering a view of the audience from the actor's point of view, are especially captivating.",
