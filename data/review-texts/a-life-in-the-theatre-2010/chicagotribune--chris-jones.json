  "bwwExcerpt": "That Mamet wrote this script when he was still, really, a kid, is both indicative of his prescient understanding of the daily grind to come and his astonishingly early powers of observation. Like 'Glengarry Glen Ross,' 'A Life in the Theatre' is a play about work. It just happens to be toil that takes place in the theater. It has the same deadening effect on the soul.",
