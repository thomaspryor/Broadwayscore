  "fullText": "Last Updated:\n 5:16 AM, October 14, 2010\n\nPosted:\n 11:21 PM, October 12, 2010\n\nA LIFE IN THE THEATRE Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, 236 W. 45th St.; 212-239-6200. Through Jan. 2.\n\nHardships, petty humiliations, financial strain, crushed hopes: That's what you can expect as an actor. At least that's how it is in David Mamet's \"A Life in the Theatre\" -- and it's a comedy.\n\nThe 1977 piece -- now being revived on Broadway under Neil Pepe's direction -- looks at two thespians' daily grind through a series of fast-paced vignettes.\n\nIt's a trifle, but one that's dished out by Patrick Stewart and T.R. Knight (the puppyish George on \"Grey's Anatomy\"), two skilled, likable stars with a mellow chemistry and spot-on timing.\n\nThey're completely believable as Robert and John, respectively, the kind of journeymen who never graduate from supporting parts. The more experienced Robert lords it over his younger colleague in their shared dressing room, imparting hard-earned wisdom and delivering lofty speeches about the theatah. (Has there ever been a profession more prone to self-aggrandizement?)\n\nRobert sounds so imperious that you half-expect him to be the second coming of Laurence Olivier.\n\n\"Could you . . . perhaps . . . do less?\" Robert asks his self-effacing, modest co-star. Nobody should even attempt to steal the spotlight from this well-cured ham. At least he isn't salty -- except for a few pungent expletives, Mamet dispenses with his trademark profanity.\n\n\"A Life in the Theatre\" is at its funniest when introducing excerpts from the (made-up) shows Robert and John perform. The two seem to work for a middling repertory company with a penchant for boilerplate period dramas, and Mamet has a blast spoofing the genre.\n\nTo make matters worse, the plays-within-the-play are plagued with missed cues, broken props and faulty costumes.\n\nStewart and Knight clearly enjoy themselves, and make a very efficient tag team. It's a hoot to watch Robert try to hold onto the last shreds of his dignity in the face of theatrical adversity -- a task made harder by a slew of preposterous wigs and hats he's saddled with.\n\nMeanwhile, the Buster Keaton-like Knight portrays John as eager to learn and ever-stoic in the face of Robert's antics, with mournful, hangdog eyes that only occasionally betray a hint of irritation.\n\nMamet injects a certain wistfulness toward the end, which his leads play up without succumbing to sentimentality. Robert and John's life may look like a series of indignities, but you also understand why there's nothing else they'd rather do.\n\nelisabeth.vincentelli\n@nypost.com\n\nNEW YORK POST is a registered trademark of NYP Holdings, Inc.\n\nnypost.com, nypostonline.com, and newyorkpost.com are trademarks of NYP Holdings, Inc.",
