  "bwwExcerpt": "Pepe, a longtime Mamet collaborator, described Life in a recent Playbill interview with the playwright as '(not only) a love letter to the theater, but also to actors.' Mind you, lovable isn't the first word you'd apply to either of the two thespians who are the sole characters here. Robert, played by Stewart, is a gentleman of a certain age facing the twilight of his career, if not his vanity; John, Knight's role, is an up-and-comer who may not be as ingenuous as he seems.",
