  "bwwExcerpt": "In 90 minutes of short vignettes, two actors run through every backstage story you've ever heard-missed cues, wardrobe malfunctions, dropped lines, broken props-all staged with comic dexterity by Mamet's frequent collaborator Neil Pepe in this fast-paced and fun revival, the show's first production on Broadway.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('comic dexterity', 'fast-paced and fun') with no caveats. Single excerpt warning suggests this represents positive verdict, scored in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'fast-paced and fun' with 'comic dexterity,' indicating a positive reception. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper range of Positive. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"comic dexterity\", \"fast-paced\", and \"fun revival\", suggesting a positive experience. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the staging with 'comic dexterity' and explicitly calls the show 'fast-paced and fun,' indicating a clear recommendation to see this revival despite the limited text available.",
