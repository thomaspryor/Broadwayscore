  "bwwExcerpt": "Despite getting off on the wrong emotional foot, the production recovers once these hard-working thesps begin to throw themselves into their roles for the execrable shows in the company repertory. Mamet displays malicious glee in trotting out all the old chestnuts, from the World War I battlefield play ('Those dirty bastards, they stuck him on the wire and left him there for target practice!') and the Chekhovian social drama ('If we could leave this afternoon ... if we could just call, bring the carriage round, just leave this afternoon ...') to a definitive spoof of an English shipwreck drama, performed in thick lower-class accents ('Kid, we haven't got a chance in hell. But you shouldn't let it get you down, 'cause that's what life on the sea is about').",
