    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic explicitly calls this 'the New York show to see' - a strong endorsement that outweighs the reservation about Stewart's scene partner. This is clear positive recommendation language despite one noted flaw. | GPT-4o: The excerpt strongly recommends the show as 'the New York show to see' despite noting a weaker partner for Mr. Stewart. The praise for Stewart's performance suggests a positive overall impression. | Gemini: The critic recommends the show as the 'show to see' but notes a weakness in Stewart's partner, indicating a reservation. Given the single excerpt, a mid-range positive score seems appropriate. | Kimi: The critic declares this the essential New York production to see and praises Stewart's performance as rich enough to carry the play alone, though with a reservation about his co-star.",
