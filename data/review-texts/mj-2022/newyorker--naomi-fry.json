Low confidence due to limited text and single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'missed opportunity' with a 'sanitized, surface-level treatment,' indicating a negative view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt explicitly states that the show \"feels like a missed opportunity,\" indicating a negative assessment. Given that this is the only excerpt available, confidence is medium. | Kimi: The excerpt clearly pans the production as a 'missed opportunity' with 'sanitized, surface-level' treatment, indicating the show fails to capture the complexity of its subject. Single excerpt limits confidence.",
