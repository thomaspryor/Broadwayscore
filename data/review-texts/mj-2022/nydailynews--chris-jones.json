The King of Pop had said he wanted to push himself for his kids, who’d never been able to see him blow the globe away, live. He didn’t live long enough for them to have that experience. That fateful summer, Jackson had at least two different camera crews at his rehearsals: one shooting a backstage documentary for a planned film and one crew archiving everything for Jackson himself. After his death from an overdose of the drug Propofol, Kenny Ortega’s post-facto movie of the rehearsals was all his fans, and his kids, had left. The brilliantly choreographed new Broadway show at the Neil Simon Theatre in New York, “MJ,” is set during the creative process for a Michael Jackson world tour. “MJ: The Musical,” the brilliantly choreographed new Broadway show at the Neil Simon Theatre, is set during the creative process for a different Michael Jackson world tour. “Dangerous” was an international epic (I was there and it was unforgettable) that ran between June 1992 and November 1993, played to 3.5 million people in 70 stadiums and grossed $100 million, eating most of it in production costs. The cable rights were sold to HBO for $20 million. function dfm_stn_player_script_id_kisMaIjZ( getS2NApiForPlayer ) { if( typeof window.MNGAuthentication !== 'undefined' ){ const s2nApi = getS2NApiForPlayer( document.querySelector('.k-kisMaIjZ') ); s2nApi.float = ! window.MNGAuthentication.isUserSubscriber(); } } But in many ways, this new show, which features a book by Lynn Nottage, choreography by Christopher Wheeldon and a plethora of Jackson’s greatest hits, feels deeply influenced by Ortega’s later film. The narrative here is entirely the Jackson estate’s preferred view of the King of Pop: a perfectionist, pushed to the brink by a combination of a nasty father, his own shyness, a relentlessly invasive media and pill-pushing enablers. In the show, he is a brilliant, child-like innocent adrift on a cruel planet. The brilliantly choreographed new Broadway show at the Neil Simon Theatre in New York, “MJ,” is set during the creative process for a Michael Jackson world tour. Is that a fair picture of Jackson? Those who have accused him of abusing children would not say so. This show makes no meaningful mention of any of that. Given that Broadway ruthlessly has canceled other artists for far less, this is a level of hypocrisy that must be noted. But the show’s omission hardly is a surprise — jukebox shows about megastars always are controlled either by the artist or an estate. The legacy-conscious Jackson family always has maintained Michael’s innocence. That won’t change. “MJ” lands in crowded waters. I’ve seen many Michael Jackson shows: a London long-runner (rudimentary), two different Cirque du Soleil takes (the touring one was bad; the Las Vegas one is surrealistically cool) and countless Jackson tributes. Many have learned to impersonate royalty. The show, like Jackson’s own concerts, offers a great rush of adrenaline and excitement, pivotal qualities as Broadway plots its pandemic comeback. “MJ” is by far the most visually impressive of any of these other Jackson experiences, none of which had either the choreographer Wheeldon or the superb star, Myles Frost. Neither of these two gifted men fall into the trap of impersonation: Wheeldon’s movement will read as authentically Jacksonian to any superfan, but it also elevates the subject’s work within the realm of modern dance. Wheeldon reminds us of his utter mastery of transition, exciting the audience constantly with razor-sharp snaps into fantastical Jackson realms, such as “Thriller,” always with brilliant dramatic dexterity. The show, like Jackson’s own concerts, offers a great rush of adrenaline and excitement, pivotal qualities as Broadway plots its pandemic comeback. Frost is a dynamic singer. But he’s first and foremost an actor who not only captures his character’s vulnerability but his restless energy and paranoia. The best parts of Wheeldon’s work includes a knockout dance treatment of “They Don’t Care About Us,” along with a treatment of “Human Nature” that recalls “Somewhere” in West Side Story. The dance ensemble does work that constantly amazes. And the stunning close of Jackson alone in every s...",

The dance ensemble does work that constantly amazes.

But he’s first and foremost an actor who not only captures his character’s vulnerability but his restless energy and paranoia. It’s a star-making turn and it’s nicely supported by Tavon Olds-Sample as his younger self. Other powerful work flows from Quentin Earl Darrington and Ayana George as the Jackson parents.\n\nThe eye- and ear-popping, brilliantly choreographed new Broadway show at the Neil Simon Theatre in New York, “MJ,” is set during the creative process for a Michael Jackson world tour. (Matthew Murphy)\n\nNottage came up with the device of Darrington playing not just the patriarch of the clan but the director of the “Dangerous” tour, allowing her to explore Jackson’s interaction with figures powerful and judgmental. That works much better than the hoary device of an MTV crew pushing dramatic tension by scheming to reveal Jackson’s addictions. These characters talk like media people always do in juke shows, which is to say artificially. None of these scenes ring true; the show would be better off without them, especially given Jackson’s obsessive real-life insistence on documentation.\n\nCOVID means a lack of tourists, short-term. But the show has all kinds of artistic beauties to offer the artist’s global fans. Thanks in no small part to the gorgeous palate created by Derek McLane, Natasha Katz, Paul Tazewell and Peter Nigrini, the show is genuinely beautiful to experience throughout, which one almost never can say about jukebox musicals. Aside from a few clanging scenes, it’s a gorgeously executed celebration of a pained subject’s artistry.\n\nNo less. No more. No apologies.",
