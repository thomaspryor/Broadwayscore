  "fullText": "The sharp, talented cast sold me on music Jackson himself often couldn’t, and the story not only addresses the allegations, however sideways, but raises a defiant middle finger to anyone who dares bring up concerns about the late performer’s conduct when discussing his legacy. Of course, as the words “child sexual assault” would make for kind of a musical theatre bummer, the “allegations” leveled against him only amount to whether he sleeps in an oxygen chamber or got a nose job.",
  "isFullReview": false,
  "dtliExcerpt": "So we're made to side with Jackson - frustrating, but understandable enough. What do we learn about him? We hear of his being demanding during rehearsals, that he's \"going through a lot,\" that he had a tough life, but none of this is explored or even explained in any meaningful way. We've seen troubled backstories before, heard how exacting and uncompromising A-listers can be, so if MJ: The Musical is going to wash away the sins and focus on the person, at least bring something new to the table that matches the brilliance of his artistry.",
