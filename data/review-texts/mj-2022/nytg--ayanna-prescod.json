  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Paul Tazewellâs magnificent costume design carries the cast through the MJ timeline seamlessly. A killer set by Derek McLane, amplified by gorgeous lighting by Natasha Katz, gives the show a visual beauty that makes it hard to look away.\n\nWhile Jackson's story is flawed, itâs too complicated for anyone who hasnât danced in his shoes. MJ The Musical, however, is the perfect salutation to the life of an imperfect but gifted icon.\"",
