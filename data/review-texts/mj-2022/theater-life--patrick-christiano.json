    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: 5/5 stars with superlative language ('electrifying explosion', 'exhilarating', 'does not disappoint'). Despite single excerpt warning, the 5-star rating and unqualified praise clearly indicate a rave. | GPT-4o: The review gives 5/5 stars and describes the show as an 'electrifying explosion' and 'exhilarating', indicating a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is on the lower end of the Rave range. | Gemini: The review excerpt awards 5/5 stars and describes the show as an \"electrifying explosion\" and \"exhilarating evening,\" indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt awards 5/5 stars and uses superlatives like 'electrifying' and 'exhilarating' to describe the production, indicating strong endorsement. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced per the provided warning. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
