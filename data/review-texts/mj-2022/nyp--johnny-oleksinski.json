  "bwwExcerpt": ": It&#39;s not a smooth musical. The troubles over at &quot;MJ: The Musical,&quot; the new show about Michael Jackson that opened Tuesday night on Broadway, are much bigger than the controversy surrounding its subject - although the two are closely connected. While the lifeless script is written by Pulitzer Prize winner Lynn Nottage of &quot;Ruined,&quot; the pat dialogue feels as if it was co-authored by a lawyer for the Jackson estate - one of the producers - with Wite-Out and a Sharpie.",
