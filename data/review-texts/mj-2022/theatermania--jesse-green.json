    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear positive verdict ('succeeds') with balanced approach to difficult subject matter. High-positive score due to unqualified 'succeeds' but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a successful celebration and acknowledges its honest handling of controversies, indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set towards the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive assessment, highlighting the show's success in celebrating Jackson's artistry while also addressing controversies. Given that it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the content suggests a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the production's success in celebrating Jackson's work while honestly addressing controversies, indicating a solid recommendation. Single-excerpt format limits confidence.",
