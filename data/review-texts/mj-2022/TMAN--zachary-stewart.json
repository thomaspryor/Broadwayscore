  "fullText": "Myles Frost plays Michael Jackson in a Tony-worthy performance.\n\nMichael Jackson is a human Rorschach test: Where some see the greatest pop artist of all time, others see an entertainer raised in captivity and completely divorced from reality. Still others might obsess about his cosmetic surgery, a triumph of art over nature undoubtedly rooted in insecurity and made possible by nearly limitless resources. Some might even see him as the Cassandra of our present condition: The press once laughed at his surgical masks, but now we all wear them (at least, inside a Broadway theater). And then there are the\n\nWith so many wildly divergent angles from which to approach the story of the late King of Pop, it should shock no one that playwright Lynn Nottage, director Christopher Wheeldon, and the rest of the team behind\n\nThe tone of the show is set before the first note is ever played: Dancers wander onto the stage and warm-up as the audience enters. A stage manager warns that we have &quot;five minutes to Michael&quot; as the excitement builds. When MJ (Myles Frost) finally does enter, he is greeted by the audience as if he really is Michael Jackson reincarnated (which, after witnessing his spot-on performance, he just might be). The cast quickly launches into a supercharged performance of &quot;Beat It&quot; and the crowd goes nuts.\n\nRather than attempting to present a chronological staging of Jackson&#39;s biography (a fool&#39;s errand when it comes to the jukebox musical),\n\nLittle Michael (the extraordinary Christian Wilson at the performance I attended) emerges with his brothers from the shadows of time to perform a nifty medley of Jackson 5 songs. This montage propels the exposition, taking Michael from Indiana to California and the tutelage of Berry Gordy (Antoine L. Smith). An older Michael (Tavon Olds-Sample) breaks from the family band to produce solo albums like\n\nBut the price of fame is steep as Michael contends with his demanding family and a ravenous press hungry for the next outrageous story about &quot;Wacko Jacko&quot; (this is the\n\nDancers in the rehearsal room seamlessly transition into figures from Michael&#39;s life: The imposing Quentin Earl Darrington doubles as Rob (a manager) and Joseph Jackson, Michael&#39;s demanding and occasionally abusive father. Ayana George pulls our heartstrings in the dual roles of a backup singer in need of reliable childcare and Michael&#39;s mother, Katherine (her powerful rendition of &quot;I&#39;ll Be There&quot; is one of the highlights of the show). The story seems to spring naturally from the imagination of its subject, making\n\nWheeldon uses Nottage&#39;s script as a springboard for fast-paced and dynamic staging. His production numbers evoke Jackson&#39;s iconic music videos (how could they not?) while also bringing original choreography to the table. The result is the most impressive dancing on any Broadway stage right now.\n\nDerek McLane&#39;s scenic design is as versatile as Wheeldon&#39;s staging, while Paul Tazewell&#39;s detailed costumes facilitate some remarkable quick changes (as do Charles LaPointe&#39;s menagerie of period-specific wigs). Natasha Katz&#39;s lighting enhances the liquid feeling of the staging, delivering both intimate moments and explosive concert lighting. Peter Nigrini&#39;s projections work in tandem with the set and breathtakingly serve as a force multiplier for the dancers. During some of the most exciting production numbers, like &quot;Thriller&quot; and &quot;Smooth Criminal,&quot; we can feel the music in our chests thanks to Gareth Owen&#39;s muscular sound design. This is as close as you can get to a Michael Jackson concert in a Broadway house.\n\nThe most important factor supporting that is the lead actor: Like\n\nOf course, there will always be people who find nothing enjoyable about Michael Jackson. They don&#39;t think such a\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.
