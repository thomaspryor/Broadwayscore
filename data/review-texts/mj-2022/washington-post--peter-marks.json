  "fullText": "Filled with exhilarating versions of the songs Jackson made into music videos and took on world tours, “MJ” is a dance musical of the first rank. If you look back at the choreography in those videos of the late 1980s and early 1990s — “Billie Jean,” “Beat It,” “Smooth Criminal” and, of course, “Thriller” — you’ll see that by comparison Wheeldon and the exquisite dancers of “MJ” have boosted the muscularity and grace of the pop star’s signature movements. It’s now a veritable Corps de Moonwalking.",

  "dtliExcerpt": "That sordid history would not seem to have foretold a jukebox musical devoted to the upside of Jackson's genius - and certainly not by artists of the caliber of two-time Pulitzer winner Nottage (\"Ruined,\" \"Sweat\") and the celebrated ballet world fixture Wheeldon. The show's decidedly selective memory may be off-putting to theatergoers appalled by the stories of Jackson's alleged misdeeds. Nevertheless, the creative team's painstaking work has resulted in a riveting, adrenaline rush of a show, propelled by remarkable dancing and a mesmerizing central performance by Myles Frost as the sleek, soft-spoken pop megastar.",
