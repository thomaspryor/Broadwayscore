  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The dancers and singers of the ensemble, who double as secondary characters, are first-rate, and Wheeldon gives them a lot to do. Most of the songs are performed as rehearsals or flashbacks, which is to say as full-on production numbers. (Tracks from Jacksonâs 1995 album HIStory are cannily placed by Nottage as character moments.) Like Summer and The Cher Show before it, MJ uses three actors to play its central character at different ages. As the 1992 incarnation, Frost carries the bulk of the role, and not only nails Jacksonâs signature sound and movesâyes, of course thereâs a moonwalkâbut also his otherworldly affect: his diffident grandiosity, his mixture of grievance and mischief, his high and breathy way of talking (at once floaty and determined, like Diana Rossâs spoken-word section of âAinât No Mountain High Enoughâ).\"",
