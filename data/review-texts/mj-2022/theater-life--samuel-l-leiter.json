    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt criticizes the show's structure as cramming too much biographical content that becomes 'boring distractions,' making the already long show 'seem even longer.' However, with only one excerpt available and a 'Read more' truncation, the full verdict may be missing. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show for being overly packed with biodata, making it feel longer and the production numbers seem like distractions. This suggests a negative view, but the single excerpt warning indicates potential cherry-picking, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates the show is too long and the production numbers are distracting, suggesting a negative experience. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the show's pacing, noting that excessive biodata creates boring distractions between production numbers, making the runtime feel longer; however, as a single curated excerpt, the overall verdict may differ.",
