  "dtliExcerpt": "Songs from his extensive catalog appear throughout the show haphazardly. When they take place during rehearsal scenes, such as when Michael is tinkering with a new idea, they leave the audience buzzing with nostalgia and wonder. But when they are forced into awkward dramatic moments that they were never meant to fulfill―for instance, Michael sitting off in the corner singing snippets of a sad song because he is a perpetually morose sap―the effect left me hyperventilating with queasiness.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt shows the critic finding both effective moments (nostalgia and wonder) and serious problems (queasiness from forced dramatic moments). Given this is a single curated excerpt and the aggregator indicates 'Down', I'm scoring conservatively in the mixed range. | GPT-4o: The review highlights significant issues with the integration of songs into the show, describing them as haphazard and awkward, leading to a negative physical reaction. The overall tone suggests disappointment, aligning with the aggregator's 'Down' verdict. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive and negative aspects of the show, indicating a mixed reaction. The reviewer describes moments of 'nostalgia and wonder' but also expresses strong negative feelings about other parts, suggesting an uneven experience.",
