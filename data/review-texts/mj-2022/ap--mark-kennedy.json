  "bwwExcerpt": "Nottage and director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon have one of the greatest music catalogues in the world and yet don't seem to know how to handle it. Some pivotal songs - like \"For the Love of Money\" by The O'Jays - aren't by Jackson at all. And a large bulk of Jackson's songs used - including \"Earth Song,\" \"Stranger in Moscow,\" \"Price of Fame\" and \"They Don't Care About Us\" - were released after 1992. You can't have it both ways.",

The phrase 'logic has little to do with “MJ.”' implies a critique of the show's coherence or narrative choices, aligning with a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a critical perspective on the show's narrative choices, implying a lack of coherence or logical storytelling.

But logic has little to do with “MJ.”",
