And a large bulk of Jackson's songs used - including \"Earth Song,\" \"Stranger in Moscow,\" \"Price of Fame\" and \"They Don't Care About Us\" - were released after 1992. You can't have it both ways.",

He’s facing financial ruin, swirling rumors and an addiction to pain pills. You’d think it was 2009, just weeks before his death. That’s the logical place to start.
