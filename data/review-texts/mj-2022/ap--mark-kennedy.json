  "bwwExcerpt": "Nottage and director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon have one of the greatest music catalogues in the world and yet don't seem to know how to handle it. Some pivotal songs - like \"For the Love of Money\" by The O'Jays - aren't by Jackson at all. And a large bulk of Jackson's songs used - including \"Earth Song,\" \"Stranger in Moscow,\" \"Price of Fame\" and \"They Don't Care About Us\" - were released after 1992. You can't have it both ways.",

  "dtliExcerpt": "The new, splashy Broadway musical about Michael Jackson begins with the King of Pop plotting an ambitious tour to reclaim his throne. He’s facing financial ruin, swirling rumors and an addiction to pain pills. You’d think it was 2009, just weeks before his death. That’s the logical place to start. But logic has little to do with “MJ.”",
