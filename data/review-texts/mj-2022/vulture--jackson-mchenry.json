    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - acknowledges the show 'works' in spectacle moments but implies limitations elsewhere. Given single excerpt warning and conditional language, scored at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the show's spectacle and choreography, but the single quote and lack of full context limits confidence. The positive tone is mild, indicating a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive experience when the show focuses on spectacle and choreography, but it's a single excerpt, so confidence is low. The phrase \"works best\" implies that other parts of the show may not be as strong. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the production's spectacle and choreography, suggesting entertainment value despite implying other elements are less successful. As a single curated excerpt, the sentiment appears mildly positive rather than enthusiastically so.",
