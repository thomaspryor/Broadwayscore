    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - critic finds value in the spectacle and performances but the phrase 'works best when' implies limitations. With only one curated quote available, confidence is low and score reflects cautious positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the show's strengths in spectacle and choreography, suggesting a positive experience. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive experience focused on spectacle and choreography, but it's a single excerpt, so confidence is low. The phrase \"works best\" implies some limitations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise ('works best when') for the visual and choreographic elements, implying limitations elsewhere but still identifying genuine entertainment value. Single excerpt limitation requires low confidence.",
