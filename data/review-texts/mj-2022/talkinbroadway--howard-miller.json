  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Lynn Nottage has curated Jackson's story as much as she has written it for stage. MJ, which is being presented \"by special arrangements with the estate of Michael Jackson,\" is \"all about the music,\" as the character states on more than one occasion. Nottage has provided a frame of sorts, a reporter, Rachel (Whitney Bashor), and a cameraman, Alejandro (Gabriel Ruiz), follow Jackson around as they are working on a documentary about the preparations leading up to the Dangerous tour. \"You've grown up in the public eye, you're the subject of a lot of speculation, is it really possible to separate your life from your music?\" asks Rachel. And, except for the occasional sideswipe at such \"speculation,\" the answer is \"yes.\" Does it matter? Up to you to decide, of course, but taken on its own merits, MJ is spectacularly entertaining, and in that realm, it comes damn close to being perfect.\"\n\nRead more",
