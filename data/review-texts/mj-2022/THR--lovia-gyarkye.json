He could channel regret with the mournful sorrow of an old man or playfully disclose his romantic desires with the youthfulness of first love. He experimented with vocal intonations, body movements and facial expressions to become the heartthrob of fantasies and the ghoulish figure of nightmares. Jackson relinquished himself to the narrative. He was a wizard, and every song, video and live performance was an opportunity to transform. Such ease with shape-shifting comes at a cost. The King of Pop transported his devotees to fantastical places, but he remained relatively inscrutable. The real Michael Jackson was shrouded in mystery. For a while it didn't matter — the message was in the music. But then his facial features changed, his skin lightened and investigations accusing him of sexual abuse were opened. Contradictions began to pile up. Who was Michael Jackson? That question was difficult to answer when he was alive and is even more so now after his death. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-article-mid-article-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\",\"mid-article\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[300,250],[2,2],[300,251],[620,350],[2,4],[4,2],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Related Stories Business Broadway Box Office: &#039;Harry Potter&#039; Brings In $2.65 Million As Industry Heads Into Slow Winter Months Lifestyle Channing Tatum&#039;s &#039;Magic Mike Live&#039; Comes to New York MJ , a remarkable Broadway musical written by Lynn Nottage and directed and choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon, deftly probes this weighty topic. The show was produced by arrangement with the musician's estate, and uses Jackson's archives and place within the public's imagination to conduct a Freudian analysis of the artist's life. How do you tell a story of a person who dissolved into the roles he created for himself and the roles the public created for him? Well, it depends on where and when you start. Nottage sets MJ in 1992, two days before the start of Jackson's Dangerous World Tour. America was in the middle of a recession. The first allegation of child abuse hadn't been lodged against Jackson (those would come in 1993). And the singer had not yet appeared on Oprah Winfrey's show, where he revealed he had vitiligo. In 1992, Michael Jackson, played with incredible verve here by Myles Frost, was mostly concerned with staging an unforgettable tour for his fans and raising money for charity. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article2-uid1' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid\",\"mid-article2\",\"mid-articleX\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article2\") .addSize([[300,250],[300,251],[620,350],[2,4],[4,2],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); However, unbeknownst to the musician, his tour manager, Rob (Quentin Earl Darington), has given two reporters from MTV permission to film the crew's rehearsals and interview the singer for a story. Before Michael, or MJ as Rob calls him, even meets Rachel (Whitney Bashor) and her camera guy Alejandro (Gabriel Ruiz), he's perturbed. But the enterprising duo promise to stay out of his way. They insist they will be flies on the wall. It's clever of Nottage to frame MJ as a fictional behind-the-scenes reportage, which sets up the singer's tense relationship to journalists and highlights how much of our understanding of Jackson was mediated through the press. Michael's memories guide MJ , and Nottage speeds through the early years of Jackson's life. The pace initially seems breathless but it mirrors the associative nature of recollection and the exponential rate of the singer's fame. It was Berry Gordy (Antoine L. Smith), the founder of Motown records, who realized that the youngest member of the Jackson 5, with his charming presence and hypnotic voice, could be a star. (Christian Wilson played the young Michael at the performance reviewed; he alternates in the role with Walter Russell III.) Nottage highlights young Michael's relationship with his brothers, his devotion to his mother Katherine (Ayana George) and the growing tension with his father Joe (also played by Darrington). The brilliant set, designed by Derek McLane, coupled with striking lighting by Natasha Katz, bolsters these elegantly staged flashbacks. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid2' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"btf\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/...",
