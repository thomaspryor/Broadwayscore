    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - 'succeeds' and 'phenomenal performances' are positive, but 'sidesteps troubling aspects' indicates reservations. With only one excerpt available, confidence is low and score reflects cautious positive assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a celebration of Jackson's artistry and highlights phenomenal performances, indicating a positive view. However, it notes the avoidance of troubling aspects, suggesting some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of Positive. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's strengths (celebration of artistry, phenomenal performances) but also points out a significant flaw (sidestepping troubling aspects). This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('phenomenal performances', 'succeeds') placing it in the Positive bucket, though the single-excerpt guidance suggests using the upper range (80-84) given the clearly positive language.",
