  "fullText": "In answer to the question of whether it's possible to separate the art from the artist, \"MJ\" performs a slick, crotch-grabbing sidestep. Packed with nearly 40 hits from Michael Jackson's irresistible catalogue, the Broadway production from director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon is not so much a biomusical as a high-shine and surface-skimming rehabilitation tour for its late subject, flattening rather than reckoning with his complex legacy.\n\n\"With respect, I wanna keep this about my music,\" insists Jackson early on, played in the story's present day by Myles Frost, impressive in perhaps an impossible role. Jackson is speaking to an MTV documentary crew, a journalist (Whitney Bashor) and cameraman (Gabriel Ruiz), observing rehearsals for the 1992 Dangerous World Tour. Flashbacks ensue, dissolving, somewhat claustrophobically, back into the rehearsal room each time. The narrative premise from book writer Lynn Nottage (Pulitzer winner for \"Ruined\" and \"Sweat\") creates a suggestion of scrutiny, though the results are less than revelatory.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "The demons that Jackson battles in \"MJ,\" his father and the media, are figured as monstrous. But if there was darkness behind the angelic falsetto, a mix of light and shadow that made Michael Jackson a singular artist, \"MJ\" enacts a sleight of hand, insisting it didn't belong to him. It's a renouncement worthy enough of a smooth criminal.",

The language is consistently critical of the production's substance. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the impressive musical numbers and Myles Frost's performance but criticizes the production for avoiding deeper engagement with Jackson's complex legacy. The tone is mixed, highlighting both strengths and significant shortcomings. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the impressive musical catalogue and performance but criticizes the show's handling of Jackson's legacy, suggesting a superficial and rehabilitative approach. This indicates a mixed assessment, neither strongly recommending nor discouraging.",
