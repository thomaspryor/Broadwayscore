  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"If there is a scientific experiment to discover whether or not a jukebox musical ruins even our greatest playwrights, this is it. Perhaps it would have been better just to let her go free. MJ wants to be a concert so much â freed from narrative, it could just be bop after banger after blockbuster, the Beatlemania of our time, animated by Myles Frostâs uncanny portrait. Every moment when people are speaking instead of singing feels wrong. As a concert, it could simply elide all those inconvenient and tragic elements of the Michael Jackson legacy. So why isnât it one?\"",
