  "fullText": "Due to overwhelming demand for tickets, front row seats can now be snapped up for the upcoming “MJ the Musical” Sydney season. Variety AU/NZ can confirm that front row seats to the upcoming previews from February 26th for the Tony Award-winning musical at the Sydney Lyric Theatre are now available to purchase due to almost all preview performances being sold out. The demand for tickets has been so high, that the season has been extended through to May 2025 “We’ve been amazed by Australia’s overwhelming enthusiasm for this show,” Australian producer Michael Cassel told Variety AU/NZ. “People simply can’t wait to celebrate the music, the artistry, the inspiration and the extraordinary creativity of Michael Jackson.” “We are delighted to be able to give the biggest fans access to the best seats in the house, and the chance to be among the first people in the country to see this phenomenal production from the genius minds of Tony award-winning director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon and Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Lynn Nottage.” Roman Banks, who made history as the first African American performer to star in “Dear Evan Hansen” on Broadway, will make his Australian debut with “MJ.” Since then, he’s appeared in Disney+’s “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” and led the US national tour of “MJ,” earning rave reviews. “MJ the Musical” takes audiences back to 1992, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of The King of Pop’s “Dangerous” World Tour. It explores the collaborative process that shaped the tour and delves into Jackson’s creative vision and personal challenges. Featuring over 25 of Jackson’s greatest hits, including “Beat It,” “Smooth Criminal,” “Man in the Mirror” and “Thriller,” the musical has wowed audiences worldwide. Since opening on Broadway in February 2022, it’s been seen by over a million people and won four Tony Awards, including Best Choreography for Christopher Wheeldon and Best Actor in a Musical for Myles Frost. Queensland Performing Arts Centre and Woodward Productions have premiered a revival production of “Little Shop of Horrors,” the classic Broadway and Hollywood musical sci-fi comedy. Premiering in 1982, the musical, not to be confused with the 1986 feature film adaptation, featured music by Alan Menken and lyrics by Howard Ashman, telling a story of a nerdy florist named Seymour Krelborn, who stumbles upon a new breed of plant at Mushnik’s flailing flower shop on Skid Row. Naming it ‘Audrey II’ after his co-worker crush, Seymour soon discovers the foul-mouthed, R&B-singing carnivore plant has sinister intentions. The revival production is directed by Alister Smith, who has previously directed productions of “Bring It On,” “Cruel Intentions” and “The Wedding Singer”. He’s joined in the creative team by Music Supervisor David Young (“Frozen”) and Musical Director Heidi Loveland (“Carrie: The Musical”), leading a six-piece band through the musical’s blend of 60s pop, doo-wop and R&B and now-classic songs like ‘Suddenly Seymour’, ‘Feed Me (Git It)’ and ‘Dentist!’. In the cast, Maxwell Simon leads as Seymour Krelborn, joined by Kirby Burgess as Audrey, while Matthew Mackenzie and Charles Ball provide the voice and puppeteering of Audrey II, respectively. Rounding out the creative crew are Designer Penny Challen, Lighting Designer Declan O’Neil, and Choreographer Dan Venz, who have recreated the gleeful allure of the 1960s American Dream in New York, laced with the B-Movie kitsch and meaningful silliness that makes “Little Shop of Horrors” an endearing classic of the era. Woodward Productions Founder and Producer Alex Woodward said, “When I saw ‘Little Shop of Horrors’ at QPAC, it was one of the first shows I’d seen that had me completely rapt, so expect to see everything audiences have known and loved about this show for more than 40 years – think elaborate plant puppetry and a deranged dentist”. Get your daily dose of everything happening in music, film and TV in Australia and abroad. “Audiences are in for a potent nostalgia hit that is very camp, ridiculously fun and slightly gory.” QPAC Chief Executive Rachel Healy added that the Off-Broadway favourite was well overdue for a return to the QPAC stage. “It’s rare to see a full-scale musical in an intimate venue like the Cremorne, but this setting is ideal for an international hit that had humble beginnings in a small, downtown theatre”. “Following the runaway success of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) in the Cremorne earlier in the year, we are thrilled to once again unite with Woodward Productions to create a new production that is both captivating and accessible, and I can’t wait to see a whole new generation fall in love with Little Shop of Horrors. “Its quirky, playful theatrical madness makes it perfect summer holiday fare.” “Little Shop of Horrors” is on now at QPAC Cremorne Theatre until Sunday, February 15. Final tickets are available now on the website.",
