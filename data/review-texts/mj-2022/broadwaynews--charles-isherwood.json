  "garbageFullText": "“Is it really possible to separate your life from your music?” asks the pesky documentary filmmaker in “MJ,” the Michael Jackson musical at Broadway’s Neil Simon Theatre. The question hangs like a fog of stage smoke over this slickly produced show, as it attempts to weave together both the life and the music — but without quite delving into the more disturbing aspects of the former. (This comes as little surprise, since the musical was produced “by special arrangement with the estate of Michael Jackson.”) This post is for paying subscribers only Subscribe now Already have an account?
