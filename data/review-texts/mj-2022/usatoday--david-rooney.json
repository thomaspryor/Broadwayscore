  "fullText": "NEWSWomenAdd TopicPop culture says life ends at 50. These New Jersey women would beg to differ | Mary Chao Mary ChaoNorthJersey.comUpdated Feb. 3, 2022, 11:40 a.m. ETI rarely watch television, but recently caught \"And Just Like That ...\" fever, anxiously waiting each week to find out what Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte are up to on the HBO Max show.\n\nThe cast from the 1990s series \"Sex and the City\" are now in their mid-50s and still ever so chic in Jimmy Choo stilettos and white tulle skirts.\n\nYes, the characters have aged, dealing with concerns such as teenage kids and menopause. But they're very much not boxed into into the old media stereotype of the over-50 woman, a matron who's past her prime at the office and on the dating scene.\n\nThe show resonates. I'm 55 years old and spent my early 20s in New York City. Like many women my age, I didn't fade into the sunset, instead finding a way to balance career and home.\n\nThe actresses on \"And Just Like That ... \" are among a trend of high-profile stars recently putting 50-plus life in a different light for women. Supermodels Paulina Porizkova and Christie Brinkley and actress Brooke Shields are also speaking out publicly about the hardships they've faced due to the conventional wisdom about aging.\n\nConsider that three decades ago, \"The Golden Girls\" was Hollywood's depiction of ladies over 50. Now, a whole legion of women in the public light have rejected the double standard over aging.\n\nEven our most successful women have had to slog through it.\n\nLoretta Weinberg recently retired after almost 30 years in elected office, starting as a Teaneck councilwoman and graduating to the state Legislature, where she became Senate majority leader and one of the most powerful women in state politics.\n\nYet the Democrat said she routinely faced expectations and abuse that none of her male colleagues had to deal with. Weinberg, now 86. remembers the vitriol related to her age. \"Retire, you old bat,\" she was told by an online troll. The nastiness on social media toward women in the public eye is one reason many shy away from elective office, Weinberg said.\n\nThere's an expectation of how women her age are supposed to look and dress, one that she was always cognizant of in a way male lawmakers didn't have to be.\n\nMany women start anew later in life, after their children are grown and flown. Weinberg was 55 years old when she ran for office the first time in 1990, defying age and gender stereotypes.\n\nStudies in which researchers ask employers to judge job applicants based on resumes find solid evidence for age discrimination against older women, said Tara Well, an associate professor of psychology at Barnard College of Columbia University.\n\nIn an AARP survey last year, 78% of older workers said they'd seen or experienced age discrimination in the workplace, the highest level since the group began tracking the issue in 2003. Sixty-four percent of women said they'd faced age discrimination, compared with 59% of men.\n\nDiscrimination against older women is more likely to occur around their retirement age, Well said. If women in their 60s plan to keep going with their careers, they should make sure to tell employers about their intentions, she said.\n\nEven women well under 50 feel the pressure. Entertainer Taylor Swift, 32, on her latest album has a duet with Phoebe Bridgers, \"Nothing New.\" It's a feminist statement about their fears of growing older and being replaced by younger pop stars.\n\n\"Society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us,\" Swift told Elle Magazine in 2019. \"We aren’t allowed to age. It’s an impossible standard to meet.\"\n\nIn the current pandemic economy, where so much business has migrated online, you have a split second to make a good impression, added Mia Hur, a real estate sales associate with Keller Williams Town Life in Tenafly. That often means capturing someone's attention with a headshot, she added.\n\nHur, who turned 48 in January, said looks play a role in almost every aspect of life. She's made her concessions to that reality. She eats healthy, exercises regularly and practices yoga for self-care. Society's view of middle-aged women has changed, she said, adding that her appearance is much different from that of her mother at the same age.\n\n\"I feel 50 is the new 30,\" Hur said.\n\nNonetheless, looks can't trump experience in the real estate field, Hur said. Appearance plays a part in attracting clients, but once you get past that, you need substance, she said.\n\n\"My age actually helps me as a Realtor,\" she said. \"Being established 20-plus years in a community, with knowledge of the school system, is a big plus.\"\n\nMore than a year after moving to New Jersey, I've met many women my age and beyond who are the image of the adage that \"age is just a number.\" I've joined a dragon boat racing team where many of the female members are breast cancer survivors. They beat the disease and are now staying active and winning athletic competitions.\n\nAmerican culture in particular values youth, said Shama Haider, a former Tenafly councilwoman who was elected to the state Assembly last year in Weinberg's former district, the 37th. A native of Pakistan who emigrated to America when she was 28, she recalls the way elders were revered back in her home country.\n\n\"There is a lot of respect,\" said Haider, 72. \"No one would make crude jokes. We are very protective of our elders.\"\n\nHaider worked in arts education before entering politics. In pop culture, youth is everything, she said. But no surprise, she's found that being 60 is not the end of life.\n\n\"People have this opinion of older people,\" she said. \"Pop culture encourages us to believe that youth is everything.\"\n\nStill, the tide seems to be turning. Porizkova, who has a big social media following, has been outspoken with her criticism of the way that women over a certain age are made to feel like they no longer matter.\n\n“I am now completely invisible,” the former model said last month in Britain's The Times. “I walk into a party, I try to flirt with guys and they will just walk away from me mid-sentence to pursue someone 20 years younger.”\n\nNow 56, Porizkova said women need to fight back. She does so on her own Instagram page with over 700,000 followers, expressing herself as a model and a woman.\n\nShields, also 56, has also pushed back against the stigma of women's aging. Her new wellness company, Beginning is Now, sells clothing and other items to women over 40, a group Shields said has been forgotten by marketers.\n\nShields, a former Bergen County resident, appeared on the Tamron Hall television talk show in January to discuss the sisterhood of women over 40 and said she's part of a very full, rich community.\n\nTelevision often makes certain demographic groups into caricatures, said Well, the Barnard professor. The majority of daily life for adults isn’t spent thinking about their age or comparing themselves with others.\n\n\"This is what our society thinks we should worry about, but what if we just didn’t?\" Well asked. \"The worst part of aging is other people’s judgment about it.\"",
