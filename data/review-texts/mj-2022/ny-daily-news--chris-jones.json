  "dtliExcerpt": "COVID means a lack of tourists, short-term. But the show has all kinds of artistic beauties to offer the artist’s global fans. Thanks in no small part to the gorgeous palate created by Derek McLane, Natasha Katz, Paul Tazewell and Peter Nigrini, the show is genuinely beautiful to experience throughout, which one almost never can say about jukebox musicals. Aside from a few clanging scenes, it’s a gorgeously executed celebration of a pained subject’s artistry.",
