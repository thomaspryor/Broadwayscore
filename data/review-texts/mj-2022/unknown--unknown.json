  "showScoreExcerpt": "The fanciest choreography is executed by Lynn Nottage, whose book tap-dances around the many too-hot-to-handle issues attached to its central character. One of our boldest and most accomplished playwrights has turned surprisingly timid, nervously raising sensitive matters before instantly whisking them away, all but condemning the audience for harboring such wicked thoughts. Nottage gives into her inner fangirl, rendering Jackson as a wounded, saintly figure, too pure for a fallen world populated with bean-counting executives and other philistines. This combination of stunning technical expertise (including a superb production design) and faint-hearted playwriting yields a show that is both startlingly better and infinitely worse than the average Broadway bio musical.\n\nRead more",
