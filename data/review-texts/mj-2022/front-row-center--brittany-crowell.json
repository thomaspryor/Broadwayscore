  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Each element of the piece, however, was a true showcase of talent, craft, and artistry and deserves to be championed independently. The cast of tour dancers (consisting of Raymond Baynard, Kali May Grinder, Carina-Kay Louchiey, Michelle Mercedes, Kyle Robinson, Ryan Vandenboom, and Zelig Williams) were precise and sculpted in their choreography helmed by director-choreographer Christopher Wheeldon. There wasn’t a morsel of muscle that wasn’t fully activated in support of the movement and together with the background singers (Tavon Olds-Sample; John Edwards; Ayana George; Apollo Levine; and Lamont Walker II), they slid and moonwalked seamlessly into the various side-characters of Michael Jackson’s life story.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for cast and choreography with enthusiastic language ('true showcase', 'deserves to be championed', 'precise and sculpted'). However, single excerpt warning requires caution - this could be cherry-picked praise from a mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's elements as a 'showcase of talent, craft, and artistry' and highlights the choreography and performance. Given the single excerpt warning, the positive tone suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the talent and artistry showcased in the production, suggesting a positive experience, but it's hard to gauge the overall recommendation strength with only one excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the production's artistic elements, choreography, and ensemble performances with words like 'true showcase' and 'deserves to be championed,' indicating a strong recommendation despite limited context.",
