The cast of tour dancers (consisting of Raymond Baynard, Kali May Grinder, Carina-Kay Louchiey, Michelle Mercedes, Kyle Robinson, Ryan Vandenboom, and Zelig Williams) were precise and sculpted in their choreography helmed by director-choreographer Christopher Wheeldon. There wasn’t a morsel of muscle that wasn’t fully activated in support of the movement and together with the background singers (Tavon Olds-Sample; John Edwards; Ayana George; Apollo Levine; and Lamont Walker II), they slid and moonwalked seamlessly into the various side-characters of Michael Jackson’s life story.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong praise for cast performances and choreography ('true showcase of talent', 'precise and sculpted', 'seamless'). However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of positive moments. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the talent, craft, and artistry of the production, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the talent, craft, and artistry of the production, suggesting a positive overall assessment. However, due to the limited text available, the confidence is medium. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the choreography, dancers, and overall production values, using words like 'showcase' and 'deserves to be championed' that indicate a strong recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
