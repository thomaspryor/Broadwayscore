  "fullText": "When the song is done, Michael speaks with an MTV reporter (Whitney Bashor) who has landed a rare interview with him. \"With respect, I wanna keep this about my music,\" he says. \"Is it really possible to separate your life from your music?\" she asks, preempting a question on many minds, and his reply is a slice of \"Tabloid Junkie\": \"Just because you read it in a magazine / Or see it on a TV screen, don't make it factual.\" And that, more or less, is that. Expertly directed and choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon, MJ does about as well as possible within its careful brief. In and of itself, it is a well-crafted jukebox nostalgia trip. Lynn Nottage's script weaves together three dozen songs, mostly from the Jackson catalog. The music and the dancing are sensational. And isn't that, the show suggests, really the point in the end? Doesn't that beat all?",
