  "bwwExcerpt": "for the most part, After Midnight is a show that's as light on its feet as its very talented ensemble. Be sure to hang around after the curtain call for Ellington's 'Rockin' in Rhythm,' a kind of it-ain't-overture by Marsalis' incomparable orchestra that is sure to put a spring in your step for days to come.

Strong positive despite single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for its talented ensemble and highlights a memorable musical moment, suggesting a positive experience. The original rating of 'A-' aligns with a strong positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning reduces confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the ensemble and the overall feel of the show. The 'A-' grade suggests a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic awards the production an A- and praises its nimble staging and talented cast, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full review's tone.",
