  "bwwExcerpt": "Called 'Cotton Club Parade,' it was initially a collaboration between the Jazz at Lincoln Center program and the New York City Center, and was performed at the City Center for brief runs in 2011 and 2012. The emergent 'After Midnight' is not your typical Broadway musical. But, taken on its own terms, it's thoroughly entertaining.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified positive recommendation ('thoroughly entertaining') but with caveat ('taken on its own terms'). Low confidence due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of single quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'thoroughly entertaining,' indicating a positive assessment. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed on the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review states the show is \"thoroughly entertaining\" but also notes it's \"not your typical Broadway musical,\" suggesting a qualified recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Despite noting the show is atypical for Broadway, the critic delivers an unambiguous positive verdict with 'thoroughly entertaining,' indicating a solid recommendation. Score adjusted to upper Positive range per single-excerpt guidelines, though confidence is reduced due to limited text availability.",
