  "bwwExcerpt": "Called 'Cotton Club Parade,' it was initially a collaboration between the Jazz at Lincoln Center program and the New York City Center, and was performed at the City Center for brief runs in 2011 and 2012. The emergent 'After Midnight' is not your typical Broadway musical. But, taken on its own terms, it's thoroughly entertaining.",
