  "bwwExcerpt": "If the ensemble dancing never quite rises to the level of the specialty solos and duets, and if one or two concepts for production numbers fizzle, After Midnightis still an unmitigated pleasure. And it may be the best kind of pleasure: the kind that changes with time. (After Barrino leaves the show in February, scheduled guest stars include k.d. lang, Toni Braxton, and Kenny 'Babyface' Edmonds.) Presumably, theatrical archeologists of the future won't have as hard a time rediscovering After Midnight as our era's transcribers did in rescuing the Ellington material. Because this is one for the record books.",
