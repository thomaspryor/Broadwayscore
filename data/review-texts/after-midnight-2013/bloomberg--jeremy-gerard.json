    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The phrase 'uninterrupted pleasure' is clearly positive praise, and 'tonic dose' suggests refreshing entertainment. However, this is only one excerpt, so confidence is low and I'm scoring in the strong positive range given the unqualified enthusiasm. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as providing 'uninterrupted pleasure,' indicating a strong positive experience. The mention of 'tonic dose' and detailed praise of costumes suggests an enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as a \"tonic dose\" of pleasure, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly positive language ('tonic dose', 'uninterrupted pleasure') to describe the show as an entertaining 90-minute experience with impressive costumes, indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited context of a single curated quote.",
