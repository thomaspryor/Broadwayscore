  "bwwExcerpt": "To everyone's credit, Barrino is not cordoned off from the company like a traveling VIP. The singer, who catapulted from 'American Idol' popularity to Broadway respect in 'The Color Purple,' primarily does greatest-hits songs -- 'Stormy Weather.' She has a tangy baby/woman voice, a slow and clear scat and the ability to say a lot with stillness and a pout.",
