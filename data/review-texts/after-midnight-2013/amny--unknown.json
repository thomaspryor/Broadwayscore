  "bwwExcerpt": "While there is no plot, many of the production numbers have characters and clever concepts and lead-ins. Dulé Hill ('The West Wing') also delivers some poetic lines by Langston Hughes about Harlem's atmosphere during the period. As staged by Warren Carlyle, 'After Midnight' brings lively and snazzy period entertainment to Broadway with phenomenal sound, effervescent movement and a joyous spirit.",
