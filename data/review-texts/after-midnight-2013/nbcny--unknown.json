  "bwwExcerpt": "There are gymnastics aplenty, the most memorable coming from Julius 'iGlide' Chisolm, of the dance crew RemoteKontrol, and hip-hop artist Virgil J. Gadson, who does handstands during 'East St. Louis Toodle-oo.' Of the dancers, you'll be particularly taken with Karine Plantadit (a Tony nominee for the Twyla Tharp musical 'Come Fly Away'), who emerges from a coffin and later climbs back atop it during a number that includes the pieces 'The Gal From Joe's' and 'Black and Tan Fantasy.'",

Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights specific performers and their memorable moments, suggesting an enjoyable experience despite the limited context. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for specific performers and their memorable feats ('most memorable', 'particularly taken with'), indicating a recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, the confidence is low regarding the overall show verdict.",
