  "bwwExcerpt": "here are few things that bring smiles to even the most jaded faces - balloons, blaring trumpets and tap dancers. A new Broadway revue has two - no, make that all three - so no wonder it leaves you feeling lighter than air. 'After Midnight,' a candy sampler of some two dozen musical numbers that showcase dance, jazz or singing, opened Sunday at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre led by musical genius Wynton Marsalis, an endearing Dule Hill as its host and a thrilling guest singer in Fantasia Barrino.",

Single excerpt warning suggests caution, but tone is consistently upbeat throughout. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt is highly positive, describing the show as a 'candy sampler' and praising the performances of Wynton Marsalis, Dule Hill, and Fantasia Barrino. The tone suggests an enthusiastic recommendation, fitting the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The review highlights elements that bring smiles and leaves the audience feeling 'lighter than air,' indicating a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers strong praise for the performances ('thrilling,' 'musical genius') and overall experience ('leaves you feeling lighter than air'), indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited text available.",
