    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a highly enthusiastic recommendation, highlighting an 'all-star production' and 'sensational musicians'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the phrase \"all-star production\" and encourages the audience to stay, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I am scoring it as positive with high end of the range. | Kimi: Despite truncation and limited excerpt availability, the critic uses enthusiastic superlatives ('truly an all-star', 'sensational') and strongly urges audiences to stay for the musicians, indicating a clear positive recommendation in the upper range.",
