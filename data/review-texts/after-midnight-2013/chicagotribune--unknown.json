  "bwwExcerpt": "You have the sense that the show, which currently stars the red-hot Fantasia, did not want to be seen as a historic re-creation, and indeed, the traps there are self-evident. For many of us, hearing the fabulous Adriane Lenox belting out 'Go Back Where You Stayed Last Night' is better than any clever Broadway conceit. And the notion of fusing old school and new school certainly has an effect of enlivening the former and rooting the latter.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic praises Lenox as 'fabulous' and appreciates the fusion concept as having an 'effect of enlivening.' However, this is only one excerpt from a longer review, so confidence is low and the score reflects cautious positivity. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performance of Adriane Lenox and the fusion of old and new styles, suggesting a positive experience. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive experience, particularly praising Adriane Lenox's performance. The phrase \"effect of enlivening the former and rooting the latter\" also indicates a positive impact, but the limited text makes it difficult to assess the overall recommendation strength. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Adriane Lenox's performance ('fabulous') and approves of the show's fusion concept, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full verdict.",
