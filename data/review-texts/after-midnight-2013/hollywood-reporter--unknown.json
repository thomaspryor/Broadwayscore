  "bwwExcerpt": "The paramount requirement for any revue celebrating the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and '30s is stated right there in the Duke Ellington standard, 'It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing).' And After Midnight has it in abundance, courtesy of a superlative jazz orchestra handpicked by producer Wynton Marsalis from among the best in the business. Ninety minutes of exuberantly entertaining song and dance, this is a show that renders it impossible to keep your toes from tapping. Up first in a series of rotating special guest stars, Fantasia Barrino with her luscious vocals sets the bar high.",

The language suggests a highly positive experience, fitting the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The review uses very positive language such as \"superlative jazz orchestra\" and \"exuberantly entertaining song and dance\", indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
