  "bwwExcerpt": "As in old-school revues, 'After Midnight' highlights a range of specialty performers. While Carlyle isn't the most imaginative choreographer, you can't help but thrill as his dancers triumph in wildly different styles. So we effortlessly move from ­Alvin Ailey alums Karine Plantadit and Desmond Richardson (late of Twyla Tharp's 'Come Fly Away' and 'Movin' Out,' respectively) to hip-hop master Virgil 'Lil' O' Gadson, who engages in a spirited battle with the rubber-limbed Julius ­'iGlide' Chisolm. Of course, there's plenty of tap, too. And that, like Duke Ellington's music, never gets old.",
