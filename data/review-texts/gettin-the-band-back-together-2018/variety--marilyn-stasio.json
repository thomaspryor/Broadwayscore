One nonsensical exchange reveals that Sharon once had a thing with Aerosmith's renowned lead guitarist, Joe Perry, and was the inspiration for \"Back in the Saddle.\" \"Oh, grow up,\" Sharon scolds her scandalized son. \"So, your mom was into S&M - so what?\"",

This suggests mixed qualities with unclear overall recommendation. Low confidence due to truncated text. | Gemini: The review identifies a key positive aspect, the show's heart, but also implies that it may be lacking in other areas, suggesting a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The phrase 'one saving grace' implies significant flaws in other production elements, while acknowledging the emotional core works well. The text appears to be a truncated excerpt, limiting certainty about the overall verdict.",
