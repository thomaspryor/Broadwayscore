  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Feels like the tackiest show on Broadway, an impression advanced by its lazy plot, uninspired garage rock score, dopey jokes, and clichéd characters. Yet, for all its obvious mediocrity...‘Gettin’ The Band’ is kind of fun. What makes it so are the performers...Could have been a more sophisticated comedy...but the show itself is too deliberately childish to try for anything more profound than a knowing wink at its own silliness.”\n\nRead more",
