    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show's charm and effort ('so determined to be likable that it nearly succeeds') but ultimately concludes it falls short of Broadway standards. This is classic mixed territory - seeing merit but not recommending. | GPT-4o: The review indicates that the show falls short of being successful on Broadway, suggesting a lack of recommendation. The phrase 'nearly isn't quite enough' implies a negative verdict. | Gemini: The review states the show 'nearly succeeds' but 'nearly isn't quite enough,' indicating a mixed or neutral stance. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show's determined effort to be likable and that it 'nearly succeeds,' but delivers a firm negative verdict that it is insufficient for Broadway, constituting a recommendation against seeing it. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
