  "bwwExcerpt": "To keep with the musical parlance of the title, Gettin' the Band Back Together is like hearing an artist cover a favorite song - it's not the first time you've heard it, and it might not be all that original, but you'll be smiling and tapping your feet just the same.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The cover song analogy acknowledges lack of originality but emphasizes the positive audience experience ('smiling and tapping your feet'). Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt suggests a mildly positive experience, noting familiarity and enjoyment despite a lack of originality. The single excerpt and text quality warning suggest caution, so a lower score within the Positive bucket is appropriate. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests an enjoyable but not groundbreaking experience, indicating a positive but not rave recommendation. The limited text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show's derivative nature but promises an entertaining, enjoyable experience that delivers smiles and toe-tapping fun, constituting a qualified recommendation.",
