  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Although the subject matter about a group of guys basically trying to recapture their youth might not be the most original, the show puts its own fresh spin on that theme. The show is hilarious and will keep you laughing throughout. The music is mostly upbeat and fun, and songs like the catchy title number may even stick in your head long after you've left the theater...Anyone who grew up in the 80s...will find the show full of nostalgia even in the most surprising of ways.\"\n\nRead more",
