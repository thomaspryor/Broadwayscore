  "showScoreExcerpt": "“A hilariously fun and endearing time...Sweet, joyous, and cute but nothing all that memorable or special...It’s all good fun though...with some rocking but ultimately forgettable songs...This group of artists...put together an entertaining show, but haven’t quite figured out how to make it big and strong enough to be called a Broadway musical...The choreography is joyful but generic...It will make you laugh and you’ll all have a great time, but it won’t stay with you for too long.”\n\nRead more",
