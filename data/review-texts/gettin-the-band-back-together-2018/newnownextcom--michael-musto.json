  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A show that doesn’t lack for amiability, but which is too often bland, has some jokes that don’t land, and boasts a rap version of 'Hava Nagila' that is possibly the worst number ever on a Broadway stage. Act Two becomes more aggressively silly and therefore more enjoyable...But generally, this show belongs in certain parts of New Jersey. At least I got some Rice Krispies treats from Marilu Henner when she came down the aisle to hand them out during intermission.\"\n\nRead more",
