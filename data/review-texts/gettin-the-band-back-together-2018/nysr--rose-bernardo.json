  "bwwExcerpt": "Gettin' the Band Back Together is not based on a movie, like so many of last season's new musicals, including the Best Musical and 10-time Tony winner, The Band's Visit; it's not a jukebox show, like another just-opened tuner on 44th Street, Head Over Heels. But it is most definitely not \"totally original.\" An overwhelming feeling of déjà vu-or, to quote one of Mark Allen's more insightful lyrics-\"disappointment mixed with déjà vu\"-underscores Gettin' the Band Back Together.",
