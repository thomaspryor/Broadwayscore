  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"More sympathetic types will describe the show as satire, especially given the bona fides of director John Rando. Trust me, 'Gettin’ the Band Back Together' is not satire...The show grows increasingly desperate and reactionary...The plot sinks lower and lower into audience pandering...Will remind you, at different moments, of 'The Wedding Singer,' 'Rock of Ages,' 'School of Rock' and the Kars4Kids commercial, all of which look like Mozart’s Requiem by comparison.\"\n\nRead more",
