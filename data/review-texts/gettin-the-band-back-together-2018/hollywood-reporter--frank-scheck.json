  "bwwExcerpt": "To say that the humor is unsophisticated is an understatement. The jokes are frequently hoary (\"We're on, Mitch,\" Tygen taunts. \"We're on like your prom date's dress.\") and such running gags as Tygen constantly beginning epigrams only to leave them uncompleted (\"It's like my dad used to say. There are two kinds of people in the world.\") get tired awfully fast.",
