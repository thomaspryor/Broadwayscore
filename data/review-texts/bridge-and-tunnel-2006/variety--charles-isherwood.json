    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising Jones' performance as a 'tour de force' with 'remarkable skill' suggests positive recommendation, but limited text and potential cherry-picking warrants low confidence and upper-positive scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a 'tour de force' with 'remarkable skill', indicating a highly positive assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performer's skill and vocal mimicry, indicating a positive assessment. Given that this is the only excerpt available, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt employs superlatives like 'tour de force' and 'remarkable skill,' indicating strong praise for the solo performance. However, given this is a single curated excerpt that may be cherry-picked, confidence is low and the score is placed in the upper Positive range rather than Rave.",
