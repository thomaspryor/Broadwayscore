However, with only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the playwright's ability to create relatable characters, suggesting a positive, but potentially qualified, recommendation. Given the limited context, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the playwright's ability to create realistic, emotionally nuanced characters using words like 'gift,' indicating a clearly positive assessment of the writing quality.",
