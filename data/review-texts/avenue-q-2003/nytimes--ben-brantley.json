    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive comparison to the classic 'Company' suggests high recommendation. The phrase 'most honest show' since a landmark musical indicates significant praise, warranting upper Positive range despite single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a strong positive comparison to a classic show ('Company'), suggesting a high level of praise. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt compares the show favorably to \"Company,\" suggesting a positive, though potentially qualified, recommendation. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers high praise comparing the show to the classic 'Company', indicating a strong recommendation, though limited to a single curated quote.",
