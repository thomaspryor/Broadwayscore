    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive assessment stating the show 'succeeds' and praising its meaningful content. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for its balance of humor and meaningful content, suggesting a strong positive reception. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed on the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive view of the show, highlighting its success in balancing humor and meaningful themes. Given that it is a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt clearly praises the show's success and meaningful content, placing it in the upper range of Positive despite limited context.",
