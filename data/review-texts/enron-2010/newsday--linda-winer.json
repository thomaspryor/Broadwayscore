  "bwwExcerpt": "Despite the serious research and the playful imagination, the splendid new American cast and the irresistible craven puppets, the play tells us what it is in the first half-hour and then tells us again for another two hours. Board members are blind mice in suits. A video of Bill Clinton reminds us that he 'didn't have sex with that woman.' Voting in Florida was too close to call. Bush deregulated electricity and California is still paying for it.",
