  "bwwExcerpt": "Industry doomsayers were all wet about 'Enron.' This London bombshell is both a dazzling piece of entertainment and a gripping cautionary tale about the criminal chicanery that eviscerated the most respected corporate body in America. Still, it cost a bundle (a reputed $5 million) to haul this hi-tech show into town, and everyone's wondering if starstruck musical junkies will part with their coin for a straight play. What's clear is that the sensational stage effects deliver the same blood-pumping thrills of a musical, wrapped around a play, by Lucy Prebble, with more brains in its head than any tuner since 'Assassins.'",
