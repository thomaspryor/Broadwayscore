    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Critic calls the show 'lumbering' and says it's 'not as much fun as it should be,' indicating disappointment despite the flashy production and British acclaim. However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict may be more nuanced. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, noting the show is 'flashy yet lumbering' and not as fun as expected. The lack of full context and the single excerpt warning reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the show is \"flashy yet lumbering,\" indicating a mixed reaction. The phrase \"not as much fun as it should be\" further supports a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt presents contradictory signals—acknowledging visual flair ('flashy') while criticizing pacing ('lumbering') and entertainment value, suggesting an inconsistent experience that falls short of its potential without being an outright failure.",
