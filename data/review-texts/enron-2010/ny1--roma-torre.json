  "bwwExcerpt": "If ever there was a real life modern-day tragedy in the classical sense, the colossal rise and fall of Enron would be it. Yet while the dynamics are certainly there – hubris, larger-than-life characters, tragic flaws – Enron was an energy company! Tragic maybe, but dramatic? Stage worthy? The answer is a resounding yes! It's all in the way you tell it . . . and the telling at the Broadhurst Theatre is riveting.",
