  "bwwExcerpt": "Yet even with a well-drilled cast that includes bright Broadway headliners like Norbert Leo Butz and Marin Mazzie, the realization sets in early that this British-born exploration of smoke-and-mirror financial practices isn’t much more than smoke and mirrors itself. “Enron” is fast-paced, flamboyant and, despite the head-clogging intricacy of its business mathematics, lucid to the point of simple-mindedness. But as was true of the company of this play’s title, the energy generated here often feels factitious, all show (or show and tell) and little substance.",

  "fullText": "“Enron,” featuring Stephen Kunken, opened at the Broadhurst Theater.\n\nIn Lucy Prebble’s “Enron,” the flashy but labored economics lesson that opened on Tuesday night at the Broadhurst Theater, money doesn’t just talk. It sings. It dances. It puts on funny animal costumes. And of course it blows bubbles.\n\nNorbert Leo Butz portrays the former president of Enron Corporation in Lucy Prebble's musical, directed by Rupert Goold.\n\nWorking overtime to make an entertaining spectacle out of the Texas energy company’s world-rattling implosion in the early 21st century, “Enron” digs deep into the vaudevillian’s trunk. Ms. Prebble and the director Rupert Goold, a showman to the marrow, have come up with an assortment of annotative visual images, designed to explain both the byzantine, corrupt accounting practices that did Enron in and the moral bankruptcy of the men who ran it.\n\nYet even with a well-drilled cast that includes bright Broadway headliners like Norbert Leo Butz and Marin Mazzie, the realization sets in early that this British-born exploration of smoke-and-mirror financial practices isn’t much more than smoke and mirrors itself. “Enron” is fast-paced, flamboyant and, despite the head-clogging intricacy of its business mathematics, lucid to the point of simple-mindedness. But as was true of the company of this play’s title, the energy generated here often feels factitious, all show (or show and tell) and little substance.\n\nThe collapse of Enron was one of the great riches-to-rage business stories in American history, even if the public memory of it grows fainter with each succeeding accusation of large-scale financial misconduct. (Goldman Sachs, anyone?) Since the company filed for bankruptcy in 2001, ruining many of its share-holding employees, various how-did-it-happen books have been published. There has been a full-length documentary (“Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room”) and a made-for-television movie (“The Crooked E: The Unshredded Truth About Enron”).\n\nBut the story of Enron had not, to my knowledge, been given the full-scale theatrical treatment. You have to admire the chutzpah of Ms. Prebble, the creator of the television series “Secret Diary of a Call Girl,” for daring to bring to the stage a tale of such tangled finances that it has defied the analytical powers of many a business journalist and academic.\n\nSo far, Ms. Prebble’s gamble has paid off. First produced at the Chichester Festival Theater in England, “Enron” transferred almost immediately to the Royal Court Theater in London and subsequently settled into what looks to be a long and comfortable run in the West End, where I first saw it. British reviewers have piled on the superlatives, admiring the show’s thematic audacity, moral severity and all-out razzmatazz.\n\nOf course, British and American tastes don’t always coincide in such matters, especially when the subject is American. It will be interesting to see if the Broadway “Enron” becomes as hot a ticket as the one in the West End, where during that show’s intermission I heard youngish men and women discussing the characters’ business strategies with the ardor of teenagers debating the plot twists of the “Twilight” movies.\n\nStill, to this American  admittedly not a biz whiz  it seems as if “Enron” made the same points so arduously and repeatedly that there isn’t much room left for discussion. And in making those points, the show uses more signpost symbols than the collected works of John Milton.\n\nMs. Prebble and Mr. Goold are a bit more literal-minded than Milton was. The play begins with three blind mice, in business suits, tapping their canes across the stage. Before the show is over you will have seen lawyers with kerchiefs over their eyes; accountants with ventriloquist’s dummies; and a little girl, the daughter of the Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling (Mr. Butz), surrounded by floating bubbles as Daddy frets over stock prices. When, toward the end, a character steps to the edge of the stage to announce that she has “the best metaphor” for “the values that define price,” your instinct is to cry out, “Please, not another metaphor!”\n\nThe show does have proper characters, based on real people. At the center is Skilling, who metamorphoses from a nerdy, socially challenged man with a plan into an oil-slick master of the universe. The show traces his rise and fall via his relationships with his boss, Kenneth Lay (Gregory Itzin); his rival and occasional sex partner, Claudia Roe (Ms. Mazzie); and, most important, his protégé, Andy Fastow (Stephen Kunken, excellent), the guy who pioneered the “virtual reality” accounting that transformed Enron into both a star of financial innovation and an empty shell.\n\nWith Kickstarter, getting contributions became my main job and songwriting slipped onto the back burner.\n\nReaders offer opinions on the national popular vote plan.",

Despite some praise for the cast, the overall assessment is negative, suggesting the show is more style than substance. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's ambition and cast but ultimately finds it lacking substance and overly simplistic. It neither strongly recommends nor discourages seeing it. | Kimi: While acknowledging the flamboyant direction and committed performances, Brantley finds the show to be empty spectacle ('smoke and mirrors') that is 'lucid to the point of simple-mindedness,' ultimately criticizing its lack of dramatic substance despite the flashy presentation.",
