  "bwwExcerpt": "The brainchild of British playwright Lucy Prebble, who's just 29, it's a slice of American history and a cautionary tale that's audaciously theatrical but watery soup when it comes to content. Prebble follows a long tradition of English dramatists who've had an instinctive desire to revisit history - dissecting victims, concocting motives, even going so far as to make up revisionist excuses for them. Think: 'Frost/Nixon,' 'Stuff Happens' and 'Democracy.' Further back - Shakespeare did it, with a fictional twist. There's a lot of sizzle, but not a whole lot of steak.",
