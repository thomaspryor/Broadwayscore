  "bwwExcerpt": "With Goldman Sachs executives answering to a Senate committee this week, the latest round of financial wizards under fire after being accused of corrupt practices, perhaps the Enron scandal of 2001 seems like yesterday's news. Not so, argues the young British writer Lucy Prebble. In Enron, her intellectually challenging, exuberantly entertaining new play, Prebble makes the case that the disgraced energy company's abuses and collapse were both a harbinger of future debacles and a reflection of long-standing, deep-rooted social and human frailties.",
