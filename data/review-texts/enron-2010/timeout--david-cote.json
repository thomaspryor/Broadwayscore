  "bwwExcerpt": "The English-born multimedia docudrama Enron, about the rise and crash of the Texas energy-trading behemoth, smelled strongly of what I called “transatlantic schadenfreude” in a review of another import: a topical satire in which Brits laugh up their sleeves at greedy, gullible American rubes. I was able to hedge my low expectations with my tremendous respect for director Rupert Goold and my boundless admiration for musical-comedy trouper Norbert Leo Butz, who portrays Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling. What a surprise, then, to discover that Lucy Prebble’s multilayered play is not your typical Yank-bashing, but a darkly exhilarating portrait of hypertrophied capitalism and a society that allows faith-based fiscal systems to ravage the body economic. Drawing from a deep bag of theatrical tricks and riffling through found text, news videos and observed gestures, Prebble and Goold supply Broadway theatergoers with the sort of play they demand—a sharp-witted and rollicking business thriller to dazzle the eye and tickle the brain. If Enron’s stock were still circling the ticker, my advice would be to buy, buy, buy.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges the play's intelligence and ambition but finds significant structural flaws. The 60/100 rating aligns perfectly with Mixed bucket range (55-69). | GPT-4o: The critic acknowledges the play's ambition but criticizes it for being ungainly and overstuffed. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the play's ambition and intelligence but also points out its flaws, describing it as ungainly and overstuffed. This suggests a mixed reaction, aligning with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: While the critic praises the play's intelligence and ambition, the overriding criticism of it being 'ungainly and overstuffed' combined with the critic's own 60/100 rating places this firmly in Mixed territory.",
