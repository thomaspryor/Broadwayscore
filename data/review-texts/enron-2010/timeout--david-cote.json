    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges the play's intelligence and ambition but finds significant structural flaws. The 60/100 rating aligns perfectly with Mixed bucket range (55-69). | GPT-4o: The critic acknowledges the play's ambition but criticizes it for being ungainly and overstuffed. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the play's ambition and intelligence but also points out its flaws, describing it as ungainly and overstuffed. This suggests a mixed reaction, aligning with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: While the critic praises the play's intelligence and ambition, the overriding criticism of it being 'ungainly and overstuffed' combined with the critic's own 60/100 rating places this firmly in Mixed territory.",
