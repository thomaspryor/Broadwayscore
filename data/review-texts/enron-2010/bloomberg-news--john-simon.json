  "bwwExcerpt": "he semi-factual drama by Lucy Prebble (28 when she wrote it) will appeal to those familiar with the case and knowledgeable of the most esoteric aspects of accounting. The rest of us, lacking total comprehension, can revel in the racy dialogue, remarkable visuals and frequent humor delivered by a virtuosic ensemble. I can’t say where actual quotation and verifiable fact commingle with the author’s lively imagination. Nevertheless, Prebble’s writing and the production dreamed up by director Rupert Goold are stunning enough to provide steady wonder, involvement and delight.",
