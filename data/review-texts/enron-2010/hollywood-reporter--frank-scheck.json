  "bwwExcerpt": "But for all its imaginative conceits, 'Enron' is more intellectually than emotionally engaging. The characters rarely rise above the level of caricature and, with rare exceptions -- like the shattering moment at Lay's funeral when a financially devastated former employee angrily confronts an unrepentant Skilling -- the play fails to provide a human element to its complicated narrative.",
