However, the phrase \"even when it doesn't make complete sense\" indicates a reservation, placing it in the positive range but not a rave. | Kimi: The critic employs vivid, enthusiastic imagery ('kaleidoscopic whirl', 'contact sport', 'breathless') to praise the show's sensory impact and excitement, offering an unqualified recommendation despite noting the plot can be confusing.",
