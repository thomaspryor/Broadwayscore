  "bwwExcerpt": "If the time has come for Ms. Foster to take her place among the first rank of Broadway musical theater performers (fittingly in a season uncommonly rich in fine work from women), the moment also seems ripe for Violet, originally produced Off Broadway in 1997, to be acknowledged as an enduringly rewarding musical...But the musical concludes on a satisfying but not too sugary note of uplift. By shedding her illusions, at however painful a cost, Violet has also found a new kind of faith: a belief that her life's promise does not depend on divine intervention but the homelier comforts of human attachments.",
