  "bwwExcerpt": "Broad strokes and big effects often appear to be the default setting for Broadway musicals, so it's always refreshing to see a modestly scaled show in which the cast and creative team trust in the value of emotional intimacy. Driven by a performance of incandescent yearning fromSutton Foster that's all the more moving for its restraint, Violet is a delicate wildflower, craning toward the sun...While the story could be treacly sentiment in less skilled hands, Violet brings a quiet spiritual undertow to its characters' search for fortifying connections. It's emotionally satisfying without being manipulative. Even the heroine's inevitably deflating encounter with the televangelist is handled with a delicate touch, becoming less about religious hucksterism than faith of a more human nature.",

However, the brief text limits the depth of evaluation, leading to a medium confidence level. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"powerhouse performance\" and \"emotional depth and vocal prowess,\" indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers unqualified praise for both the lead performance ('powerhouse,' 'emotional depth and vocal prowess') and the show itself ('tender'), indicating a strong recommendation. Confidence is low due to the excerpt length.",
