  "bwwExcerpt": "Everything about 'Violet' is extraordinary, from its captivating, character-driven storytelling and pulsating country-rock score to the focused direction from Leigh Silverman and pitch-perfect casting. Sutton Foster, a two-time Tony winner, gives her most expressive, deeply felt and vibrant performance to date, fully capturing the character's yearning and volatility. It ought to be required viewing for all aspiring stage actors. She is joined by the similarly excellent Joshua Henry, Colin Donnell, Alexander Gemignani, Annie Golden and Ben Davis.",
