  "bwwExcerpt": "But when it sings, Violet obviates such concerns. I don't mean just when it melodizes. Crawley's dialogue is as pungent and musical as his lyrics. And in Sutton Foster he and Tesori have found the ideal star. Foster has never been a vain actress, but here she seems to relish the opportunity to strip away everything inessential. (She has one costume, and it ain't pretty.) All spunk erased from her delivery, she's riveting in her portrayal of a woman who, despite everything, is ready to learn, from a black friend, about the thinness of skin. That's a very American story, in contrast, say, to The Cripple of Inishmaan, in which the title character's deformity particularizes the universal and irreversible ugliness of humanity. We're never even shown Violet's disfigurement - which, by the end, is the only thing wrong with her.",
