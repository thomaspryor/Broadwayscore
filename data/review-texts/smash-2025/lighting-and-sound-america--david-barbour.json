    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Negative | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, highlighting an 'identity crisis' for both the show and its subject. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The single quote available is negative, indicating the show suffers from an identity crisis. Given the limited information, a negative score is appropriate with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt identifies a significant structural flaw (identity crisis) affecting the production, using negative language ('suffers from') that indicates dissatisfaction with the show's coherence. However, with only one curated sentence available, the full context of the review's final recommendation is unclear.",
