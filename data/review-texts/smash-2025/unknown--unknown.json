    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Critic's Pick designation indicates strong recommendation. The quote acknowledges messiness but calls it a 'sterling example,' suggesting the show succeeds despite flaws. Single excerpt warning applies - using upper Positive range due to 'Critic's Pick' and 'sterling' praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'Critic’s Pick' and praises it as a 'sterling example,' indicating strong positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The phrase \"sterling example\" indicates a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The 'Critic's Pick' designation and 'sterling example' praise indicate a strong recommendation, though the acknowledgment of a 'messy makeover' suggests minor reservations about the production's development.",
