  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "As the plot touches down for its perfect landing, I was surprised again by the turn of events. Not only the ones in the plot but also the ones well beyond it. Smash' the musical is a kind of reclamation of Smash' the series, and probably a kind of revenge as well. You won't see the program credit for Theresa Rebeck, the series' creator, without a microscope. For some fans, the changes may feel like a desecration. For the rest of us, a real musical comedy is a cause for celebration; most are either too tuneless to be musicals or too dull to be comedies. The true mystery of Smash' is how such a messy makeover produced such a sterling example of both,"
