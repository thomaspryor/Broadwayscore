  "bwwExcerpt": "The second act of ‘Smash’ hinges on which actress will end up playing Marilyn on opening night. Frankly, we don’t care, because the show is loaded with many songs for each of them to sing. Too many. In the second act, the female empowerment anthems become numbing, since each is delivered as a showstopper. How many times can a show be stopped before it actually stops?",

  "dtliExcerpt": "Susan Stroman directs, and she hasn’t been this good with a cast since she brought “The Producers” to the stage over two decades ago. The “Smash” ensemble is every bit as talented as that legendary cast. A wonderful quirk of the direction and book is that the show’s musical numbers are, for the most part, backstage looks at the rehearsal process. Broadway aficionados will love it.",
