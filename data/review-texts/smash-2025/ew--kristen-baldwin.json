Single excerpt limitation reduces confidence but sentiment is clearly enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is strongly positive, praising the talent involved and suggesting the show is well-suited to Broadway. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic clearly states that the show belongs on Broadway and expresses love for it, indicating a positive recommendation. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic expresses strong affection for the source material and clearly endorses the Broadway transfer, stating the show fulfills its destiny on stage.",
