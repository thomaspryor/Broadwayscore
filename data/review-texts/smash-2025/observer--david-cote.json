    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clearly positive language with 'showstopping songs' and 'phenomenal cast' indicating strong recommendation, but single excerpt limits full context assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for its 'showstopping songs' and 'phenomenal cast', indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language such as \"showstopping songs\" and \"phenomenal cast,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the show's musical numbers and cast using superlatives like 'showstopping' and 'phenomenal,' indicating a strong recommendation despite the limited text available.",
