    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Critic calls it 'actually good,' 'entertaining,' and 'competently made' with praise for self-awareness, but qualified language suggests solid rather than enthusiastic recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt describes the show as 'entertaining, competently made and performed,' indicating a positive assessment. The use of 'actually good' suggests the critic is pleasantly surprised by the quality, supporting a strong positive score. | Gemini: The review describes the musical as \"entertaining, competently made and performed\", indicating a positive recommendation. The limited text makes it difficult to assess the strength of the recommendation, so confidence is medium. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers a clear recommendation, calling the show 'actually good' and 'entertaining' with 'competent' performances, though single-excerpt limitations prevent higher confidence.",
