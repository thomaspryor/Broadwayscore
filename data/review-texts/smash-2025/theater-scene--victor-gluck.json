    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as 'fun' but immediately undercuts this with 'neither cutting edge nor memorable.' This is classic mixed language - acknowledging entertainment value while dismissing lasting impact. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the musical as 'fun' but also notes it is 'neither cutting edge nor memorable', indicating a mixed review. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review states the musical is \"fun\" which indicates a positive, but not overwhelmingly positive, experience. The \"neither cutting edge nor memorable\" adds a reservation. | Kimi: Single excerpt describes the show as 'fun' but criticizes it as unoriginal and forgettable, indicating a qualified, mild recommendation. Confidence is low due to limited excerpt availability and truncated text. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
