    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Pan/Negative) - using median score | Claude: This excerpt uses harsh language ('barrage of banal', 'impossible characters', 'overwrought') suggesting a pan, but with only one curated quote available, the full review context is unknown. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a strongly negative assessment, highlighting issues with dialogue, characters, and situations. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the lower end of the Pan range. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show negatively with terms like \"banal dialogue\" and \"impossible characters,\" indicating a negative assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strongly negative language describing the show's dialogue as 'banal,' characters as 'impossible,' and situations as 'overwrought,' indicating a clear negative verdict. Confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt. | Buckets: claude=Pan, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Negative",
