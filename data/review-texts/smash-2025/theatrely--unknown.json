  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Smash has a ruthlessness that's hard to believe exists in the PR'd universe of modern theater, and it does sometimes curdle. There's an ickiness to Ivy's story, where a woman attempting to self-actualize and improve herself is treated as an impediment. But Hurder finds humanity in her worst behavior, and gets to stalk deliciously around the stage in a fur coat and shades (Alejo Vietti did the spot-on costumes)",
