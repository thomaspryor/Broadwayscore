Praise for being 'sharply observant' and 'subtly, insistently feminist' outweighs mild reservation about being 'too comfortable.' Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'sharply observant' and 'subtly, insistently feminist,' indicating a positive evaluation. The 'CRITIC’S PICK' designation further supports a positive verdict. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is positive, calling the show \"sharply observant\" and \"insistently feminist.\" Given that it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language warrants a score in the positive range. | Kimi: Designated as a Critic's Pick with praise for being sharply observant and feminist, though the single excerpt limits certainty about the full scope of the review.",
