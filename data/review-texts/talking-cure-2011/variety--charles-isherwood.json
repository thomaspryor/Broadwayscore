    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Acknowledges positive elements (clever premise, witty dialogue) but the fundamental criticism that it feels like a lecture rather than living theater suggests it fails as drama. Single excerpt warning applies - this could be from a more negative overall review. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some positive elements like a clever premise and witty dialogue, but ultimately criticizes the production for lacking vitality, suggesting it is not engaging as theater. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like a clever premise and witty dialogue, but ultimately finds the play lacking as a piece of theater, leaning towards a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges specific strengths (clever premise, witty dialogue) but delivers a central criticism that the production lacks theatrical vitality. With only one curated excerpt available, the full verdict remains unclear.",
