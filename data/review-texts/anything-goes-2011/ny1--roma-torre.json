  "bwwExcerpt": "Bathed in lush lavender lights it's all very inviting up there. Director/choreographer Kathleen Marshall completes the picture with her knockout staging of the two biggest numbers 'Anything Goes' and 'Blow Gabriel Blow' featuring some fancy dancing from her star. My favorites though were the deliciously delightful duets, 'You're The Top' and 'It's De-Lovely.'",
