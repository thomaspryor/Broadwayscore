The 80/100 rating and unqualified praise indicate a rave review. | GPT-4o: The review highlights Sutton Foster's captivating performance and infectious energy, aligning with the original rating of 80, indicating a positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly positive, praising Sutton Foster's performance and the revival's energy. Given the critic's rating of 80, a score in the high end of the positive bucket is appropriate. | Kimi: The critic delivers glowing praise for the lead performance and revival ('force of nature,' 'absolutely infectious'), and the original 80 rating confirms a strong positive recommendation in the upper range of the Positive bucket.",
