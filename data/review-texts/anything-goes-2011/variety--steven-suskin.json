  "bwwExcerpt": "Why, one wonders, should Roundabout see fit to trot out 'Anything Goes,' the frequently produced 1934 musical chestnut? Turns out it has a compelling reason: Sutton Foster. She doesn't just deliver those Cole Porter hits, she knocks 'em out of the park. Joel Grey gives his happiest performance in years as Public Enemy #13, and director-choreographer Kathleen Marshall has a field day, outdoing herself with several rousing dance numbers. This new 'Anything Goes' is a daffy, shipshape romp.",
