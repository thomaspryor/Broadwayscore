  "bwwExcerpt": "Kathleen Marshall's lavish production occasionally feels labored. But for the most part, to quote one of the musical's most famous lyrics, 'it's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.' Her choreography manages to turn almost every production number into a showstopper. Foster lacks the rough-and-tough sex appeal to credibly portray Reno, but she handles the belting, dancing and comedy bits with such perfection that you hardly care.",
