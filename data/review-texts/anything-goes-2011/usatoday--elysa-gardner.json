  "bwwExcerpt": "Foster wins us over, through talent and sheer force of will. But it's more a qualified victory than an outright seduction...The younger performers also shine. As the debutante Hope Harcourt, Laura Osnes looks stunning and sings fetchingly; as Reno's old buddy Billy Crocker - in love with Hope, who is engaged to a wealthy Englishman - Colin Donnell proves a charming and comically nimble romantic lead. So despite a leading lady who isn't a natural fit - and to some extent, because of her joyful commitment -Anything Goes offers its share of delightful, de-lovely moments.",

However, confidence is reduced due to the excerpt's brevity (well under 150 words).",
