  "bwwExcerpt": "[Sutton Foster] generated more heat being wooed by an ogre in 'Shrek' than she does here. With her eyes constantly darting around as if unsure of her place on the stage, Foster seems uncharacteristically out of sync both physically and vocally with her partners...Timothy Crouse and John Weidman's re-revised book (first undertaken for the Lincoln Center production) turns the silly original into a dopey groaner. And don't worry: Cheeky survives, even if little else does.",
