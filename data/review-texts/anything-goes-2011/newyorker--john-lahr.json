    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt uses strong praise language 'triumph' and highlights both technical excellence and emotional success, indicating strong positive recommendation, but confidence is low due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('triumph', 'restores') indicating a highly favorable view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the word \"triumph,\" which indicates a rave review. The phrase \"restores both the show's wit and its heart\" further supports this classification. | Kimi: Single excerpt uses superlative praise ('triumph') indicating strong recommendation, but limited context requires low confidence per scoring guidelines for curated excerpts. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Rave, kimi=Positive",
