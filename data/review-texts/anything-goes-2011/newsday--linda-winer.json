  "bwwExcerpt": "Ethel Merman used to say that 'Anything Goes' was about 'a girl on a boat.' And that's pretty much the whole deal, except for the other girls, the guys and the fact that the boat is a deco ocean liner stocked with nonstop Cole Porter standards, standard-issue mistaken-identity convolutions and the usual bunch of '30s musical-comedy mugs...Bottom Line: By-the-numbers revival, but the numbers are prime.",
