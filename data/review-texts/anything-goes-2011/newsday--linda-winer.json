  "bwwExcerpt": "Ethel Merman used to say that 'Anything Goes' was about 'a girl on a boat.' And that's pretty much the whole deal, except for the other girls, the guys and the fact that the boat is a deco ocean liner stocked with nonstop Cole Porter standards, standard-issue mistaken-identity convolutions and the usual bunch of '30s musical-comedy mugs...Bottom Line: By-the-numbers revival, but the numbers are prime.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The 'Bottom Line' verdict acknowledges formulaic execution but endorses the show for its strong Cole Porter material. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a standard revival but appreciates the quality of the material ('the numbers are prime'). The positive tone is mild, and with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a formulaic approach but highlights the quality of the musical numbers, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: While the critic dismisses the production as 'by-the-numbers' and the plot as standard-issue, the verdict clearly praises the Cole Porter standards as 'prime,' indicating the music makes the show worthwhile despite unoriginal staging.",
