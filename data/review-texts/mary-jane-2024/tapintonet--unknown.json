  "bwwExcerpt": "(Liz Keill): The show probably could have ended with \"Anything Can Happen\" when the entire company was on stage. But this audience was glad to see more. I could have lived without the fake barking dog, which is more of a diversion than integral to the plot, and the chimney sweeps didn't need to prance thorough the Banks house at the end of the \" Step in Time\" number.  Nevertheless, these are minor observations in a show that's brimming with hope, magic and humanity.",
