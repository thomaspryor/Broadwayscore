    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising lead performance with specific, positive language. However, one curated quote cannot reliably indicate the full review's verdict - could be highlighting best element of mixed/negative review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises McAdams' performance, suggesting a positive view of her portrayal. However, the lack of a full review and single excerpt warning necessitates a cautious approach, indicating a mild positive sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt praises McAdams' performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence and a score on the lower end of the range. | Kimi: The excerpt provides clear, specific praise for Rachel McAdams's performance using laudatory terms ('lived-in naturalism,' 'immediate and specific'), placing it in the Positive bucket. Per instructions for single curated excerpts that sound clearly positive, the score falls in the 80-84 range, though confidence is low given the limited context and potential for cherry-picking.",
