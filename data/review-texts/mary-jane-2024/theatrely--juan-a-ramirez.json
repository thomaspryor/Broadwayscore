  "fullText": "Herzog weaves each of these strings into her narrative delicately, carefully piling them on without causing suffocation. And it’s Mary Jane’s dedication to an unseen peaceful future, filtered through McAdams’ touching performance, that stops it from becoming unbearable. Like the character, Mary Jane reaches the depths of dread, but with the most human of touches.",
