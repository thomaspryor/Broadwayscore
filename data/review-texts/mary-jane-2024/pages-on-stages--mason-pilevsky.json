However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low and the score is at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt is positive, describing the show as \"insightful.\" Given the limited information, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strong positive critical language ('insightful') indicating a favorable view of the production, though the single-excerpt format requires low confidence as the full verdict context is unavailable.",
