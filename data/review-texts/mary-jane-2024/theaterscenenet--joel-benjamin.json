    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with positive language (\"emotional heft\", \"intriguingly\") suggests recommendation, but limited text and potential cherry-picking warrants lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the show's emotional impact, but the single quote provides limited insight into the overall review sentiment. Confidence is low due to the lack of full context. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, but it's a single sentence and the full review is unavailable, so confidence is low. I'm scoring it as positive but not strongly so, given the limited information. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
