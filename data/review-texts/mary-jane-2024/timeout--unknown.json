    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the performances and direction with positive language like 'lovely detail' and 'characteristic attention,' but with only one curated quote available, the full verdict is unclear and requires conservative scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the detailed rendering by the cast and director, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances, direction, and detail, suggesting a positive experience overall, but the lack of stronger language and the single excerpt warning warrant a score in the lower end of the Positive bucket.",
