    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The opening phrase 'Like all great plays' establishes a clear positive assessment, placing the work among distinguished theater. However, this is only an excerpt and the full verdict may be more nuanced. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the play's ability to reveal different ideas, suggesting some merit. However, the tone is contemplative rather than enthusiastic, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the play has depth and offers different interpretations, but the comparison to a post-Covid perspective and inquest into death implies a potentially heavy or uneven experience. Without a clear recommendation, it leans towards a mixed assessment.",
