However, the single excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation language lead to a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The phrase \"like all great plays\" suggests a positive assessment, but the limited excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation warrant a score in the lower end of the Positive bucket.",
