Friedman Theatre, is an intelligent yet understated work that nonetheless almost blunts its own power. \n\nIn another writer’s hands, this story of a single mother facing the enormous challenges of dealing with a very sick young child would elicit almost instant sobs from its audience. Instead, Herzog’s rather matter-of-fact approach to the tale stems those baser impulses, leaving one more inclined to think than feel.\n\nStructured as series of one-on-one scenes, the play initially paints Mary Jane – played here with surprising sunniness by Rachel McAdams-- as a woman with a strong head on her shoulders, one that allows her to matter-of-factly deal with the severe illness facing her (never-seen) son Alex, who seems “lucky” to have even survived for two years.\n\nIn the first half of the one-act play (it’s really two short acts, but done without an intermission), we sit in Mary Jane’s apartment (the deceptively simple set is by the great Lael Jellinek) as she chats with a variety of women: her straightforward apartment superintendent, a take-charge home nurse and her sweet college-aged niece, and another mom with an ill child with whom Mary Jane has kindly chosen to share her hard-earned wisdom. These conversations, though smartly written and having the keen sense of verisimilitude, nonetheless don’t quite add up to very much, making us wonder if we’ll feel much of anything.\n\nHowever, when Alex is suddenly rushed to the hospital in the show’s second half, the story gains some urgency, especially as the boy’s condition worsens. Mary Jane begins to transform before our eyes, and we finally see not only the pain and anger she has struggled so hard to control, but the fact that she has never allowed herself to face the gravity of her situation. Fortunately, McAdams (in her first-ever Broadway outing) proves up to this daunting task.\n\nIn keeping with Herzog’s schemata, more one-on-one encounters ensue during this section, including Mary Jane speaking with assorted, well-meaning hospital personnel, the Orthodox Jewish mother of another ill child, and an elderly Buddhist nun who is aware there are no easy answers to be had from religion. These discussions seem somehow both less authentic yet far more meaningful.\n\nUnder Anne Kaufmann’s straightforward direction, and aided by Brenda Abbandandolo’s simple but effective costuming, four excellent actresses -- April Matthis, Susan Pourfar, Lily Santiago, and Brenda Wehle -- handle all the supporting parts with true aplomb, creating distinct characterizations in mere minutes. (Pourfar and Wehle also appeared in the play’s 2016 Off-Broadway debut at New York Theatre Workshop.)\n\nThe play’s actual ending is up for interpretation. Nonetheless, Herzog leaves us with a delicate understanding that, whether we are the mother of a sick child, a struggling college student or an overworked hospital employee, life is what we choose to make of it.\n By Brian Scott Lipton\n\nVisit the Sitehttps://www.manhattantheatreclub.comOpen/Close DatesOpening 4/23/2024Closing 6/30/2024\nTheatre Info\nSamuel J.

While noting the first half doesn't quite add up to much, the critic finds the second half gains urgency and meaning, with McAdams proving 'up to this daunting task.' | Gemini: The review is generally positive, highlighting McAdams' performance and the play's intelligent approach, but notes that it almost blunts its own power. The critic appreciates the play's delicate understanding of life's challenges. | Kimi: The critic admires the intelligence of the writing and praises Rachel McAdams and the supporting cast highly, but criticizes the first half for failing to coalesce emotionally and finds the matter-of-fact approach leaves the audience thinking rather than feeling, creating a respectful but distant experience.",
