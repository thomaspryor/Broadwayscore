However, due to the single excerpt and lack of a full review, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review highlights the positive aspects of the play, such as the clear-eyed and compassionate nature of the story, the quality of the dialogue, and the cast's performance. However, due to the limited text available, a more conservative score is appropriate.",
