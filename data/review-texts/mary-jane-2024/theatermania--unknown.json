It's difficult to sit through, and yet, there is something consoling about it.

The mention of consolation suggests some redeeming qualities, but the overall tone is neither strongly positive nor negative. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the difficulty of the subject matter but ultimately finds something consoling and worthwhile in the experience, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation.",
