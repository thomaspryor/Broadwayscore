  "bwwExcerpt": "(Jim Beckerman): But the energy of the cast, the boisterousness of the production under Mark S. Hoebee's direction, and the vigor of much of the dancing choreographed by Denis Jones carry the day triumphantly, for the most part. Kids will love this show. Adults, too, if they don't mind a \"Mary Poppins\" that is all bustle, with little of the delicacy of the original books or even the Disney film.",
