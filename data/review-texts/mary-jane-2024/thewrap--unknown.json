The lack of a full review and the single excerpt caution a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the play has a powerful moment that is worth waiting for, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. The single excerpt and lack of a clear rating temper the enthusiasm.",
