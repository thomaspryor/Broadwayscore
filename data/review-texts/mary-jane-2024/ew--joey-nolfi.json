    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising lead performance as 'powerhouse' with 'raw emotional authenticity' suggests positive recommendation, but limited text prevents full assessment of overall show verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises McAdams' performance with strong language, indicating a positive view. However, with only one curated excerpt available, the overall sentiment of the review is uncertain, leading to a lower confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt praises McAdams' performance as a \"powerhouse\" and describes it as anchoring the drama with \"raw emotional authenticity,\" indicating a strong positive assessment. Given it is a single excerpt, I am placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers strong praise ('powerhouse performance') for the lead and the drama's emotional authenticity, indicating a clear positive recommendation. However, as a lone curated quote, it may not represent the full review's balance or final verdict.",
