It asks a lot, specifically, of the actress playing Mary Jane. Rachel McAdams turns out to be more than up for the task.\" -",

The lack of a full review text and the single excerpt warning suggest a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on a positive aspect of the production (Rachel McAdams' performance), suggesting a positive but potentially reserved recommendation. The single excerpt and lack of overall context warrant a score in the middle of the positive range.",
