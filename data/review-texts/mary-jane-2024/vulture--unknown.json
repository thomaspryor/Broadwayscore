It asks a lot, specifically, of the actress playing Mary Jane. Rachel McAdams turns out to be more than up for the task.\" -",

The lack of a clear, strong recommendation lowers the confidence slightly. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights a key aspect of the play and praises the actress's performance, suggesting a positive experience overall, but the initial concern about tonal balance implies some reservations.",
