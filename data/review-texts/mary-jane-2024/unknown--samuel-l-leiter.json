    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong positive language ('deeply engaging') promising emotional impact. Given excerpt-only warning and clearly positive tone, scoring upper end of Positive bucket, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('deeply engaging', 'tear-inducing') suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, describing the show as \"deeply engaging\" and \"tear-inducing.\" Given the single excerpt and warning, I am placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly positive evaluative language ('deeply engaging,' 'tear-inducing') indicating an effective, moving production. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the 80-84 range, though confidence is low given the limited context.",
