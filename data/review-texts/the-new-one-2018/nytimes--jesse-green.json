However, the phrase \"if not always polished\" indicates reservations, placing it in the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The critic praises the performer's likability and calls the show 'engaging' while acknowledging it is 'not always polished,' indicating a solid but qualified recommendation.",
