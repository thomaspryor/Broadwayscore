  "bwwExcerpt": "Similarly to his previous work (such as \"Sleepwalk With Me\") Birbiglia relies upon a well-honed \"nice guy\" persona. In doing so, he comes off as heartfelt and relatable - not so different from any given audience member who is figuring out life as it goes along. There is an appealing smoothness and simplicity to his shows, which tend to be autobiographical in nature. Birbiglia excels at offering fun anecdotes, dramatizing conversations with offstage characters, making Seinfeld-style observations ",
