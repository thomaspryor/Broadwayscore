  "bwwExcerpt": "Rylance's Richard, if undoubtedly compelling, is more challenging. He bellows the famous opening words — 'Now is the winter of our discontent' — with a curious giddiness that quickly dissolves into sardonic self-loathing. Laughing nervously at himself, Rylance can make the murderous madman seem as wilted in spirit as he is physically.",
