  "bwwExcerpt": "There are many insults hurled at the hunched back of Richard of Gloucester (later to game his way to the throne as Richard III): Most of the taunts are animal-based (toad, boar, dog). No one, however, calls him a dummy. In Mark Rylance’s innovative, sickly comic turn, Richard simpers like a royal family’s idiot son. Dull-eyed and slack-jawed, the wretch’s withered left arm is pinned to his side, the paralyzed hand the size of a toddler’s (the actor wears a repulsive prosthetic). Of course, the I, Claudius act is just a front for bloody ambition. Richard is always good for a few nasty chuckles, but Rylance clowns it up shamelessly. His apish glee upon seducing the mourning Lady Anne (Joseph Timms) is almost infectious. And his shrimpy skittering is contrasted nicely by Angus Wright’s strapping, manly Buckingham, the lord who helps Richard murder and slander his way to the crown.",

Praises Spacey's performance with enthusiastic language ('delicious relish', 'palpable charisma'), but this appears to be a brief excerpt focused only on the lead actor. | Gemini: The review praises Spacey's performance, highlighting his 'silky menace' and 'delicious relish,' indicating a positive experience. The original rating of 80 supports this classification. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Spacey's performance ('delicious relish', 'palpable' charisma), and the provided original rating of 80 confirms a solid positive recommendation despite the text appearing to be a brief excerpt.",
