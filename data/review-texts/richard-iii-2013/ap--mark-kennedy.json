  "bwwExcerpt": "Rylance's Richard III doesn't have the customarily slow burn into madness that others have taken. There are times it's hard to separate him from a buffoon, bumbling about like a twit with oddly little charisma. He gets laughs — but not scared ones — for delivering such lines as 'He cannot live' and 'I'll have her; but I will not keep her long' ('What?' he asks the audience in a humorous aside).",
