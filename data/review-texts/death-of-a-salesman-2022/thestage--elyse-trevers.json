    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows positive assessment ('moving and engrossing') but lacks strong enthusiasm. Given single excerpt warning and qualified language, scoring at lower end of Positive range with low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as 'moving and engrossing,' suggesting a positive reception. The mention of race adding another dimension implies a thoughtful enhancement of the original material. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates that the play is \"still moving and engrossing\" and enhances the message. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, a positive score is appropriate. | Kimi: Single excerpt describes the production as 'moving and engrossing' with the racial dimension 'enhancing the bigger message,' indicating a clear recommendation. Scored at upper end of Positive bucket per single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive language, with low confidence due to limited context.",
