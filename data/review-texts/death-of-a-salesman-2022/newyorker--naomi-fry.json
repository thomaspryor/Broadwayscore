    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows sophisticated appreciation for Pierce's performance, praising his ability to capture the character's 'tragic dignity.' However, with only one curated quote available, this could be cherry-picked from a mixed or negative review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Pierce's performance, highlighting a complex portrayal of Willy with 'tragic dignity.' The positive tone suggests a recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the actor's portrayal of the character as retaining a tragic dignity. This suggests a positive assessment of the performance, but the limited text and excerpt-only warning lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the lead actor's nuanced portrayal, describing the performance with admiring language ('tragic dignity') that suggests a positive assessment of the production, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the overall verdict.",
