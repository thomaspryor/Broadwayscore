  "bwwExcerpt": "The 'Death of a Salesman' that opens tonight on Broadway begins and ends with the people around Willy Loman literally singing the blues - the music that turned the bitterness and exhaustion of the African American experience into something powerful and beautiful. The hope for that same kind of vital transformation is surely what is behind the casting of Wendell Pierce as Willy Loman, Sharon D Clarke as his wife Linda, and other Black actors as Willy's family, in this sixth Broadway production of Arthur Miller's modern tragedy about an ordinary American.",
  "bwwRoundupUrl": null,
  "showScoreExcerpt": "These two formidable talents do give largely invigorating performances, and the recasting of the Lomans as a Black family certainly offers a fresh take on a play that’s been steadily produced since its much-acclaimed Broadway debut in 1949. But for all the boldness of the reimagining, and the stellar track record of so much of the cast, “Death of a Salesman” is a disappointment in several ways.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt acknowledges strong performances and fresh reimagining but concludes the production is 'a disappointment in several ways.' Since this is a single excerpt that may not represent the full verdict, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges strong performances and a fresh take but ultimately describes the production as a disappointment, indicating a negative verdict. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, but the clear negative statement guides the score. | Gemini: The review excerpt states that despite the talent and reimagining, the production is a \"disappointment.\" Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as negative, but with low confidence. | Kimi: While the critic praises the lead performances as 'invigorating' and the casting concept as a 'fresh take,' the overall verdict is explicitly negative, calling the production 'a disappointment in several ways.' With only one excerpt available, confidence is low.",
