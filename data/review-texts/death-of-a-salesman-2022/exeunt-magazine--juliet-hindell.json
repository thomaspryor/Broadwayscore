    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes 'electrifying performances and inventive staging' which is strong praise. However, confidence is low due to limited text - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and staging as 'electrifying' and 'inventive', suggesting a strong positive reception. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the phrase \"electrifying performances and inventive staging,\" which indicates a positive assessment. Given that this is the only excerpt available, I am scoring it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('electrifying performances,' 'inventive staging') indicating a clear recommendation for this revival production. Score reflects upper range of Positive bucket per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, with low confidence due to limited available text.",
