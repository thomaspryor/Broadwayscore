  "bwwExcerpt": "The performances are individualized and powerful, including Pierce's mercurial Willy (jovial and hammy, then innocently bewildered and shaking), Clarke's tough-as-nails, weathered Linda (whose handling of the 'attention must be paid' monologue is superb), Khris Davis' soft and sensitive Biff, and McKinley Belcher III's oily and upbeat Happy.",
