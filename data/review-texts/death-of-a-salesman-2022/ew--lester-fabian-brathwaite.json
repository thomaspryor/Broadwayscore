    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with thoughtful, affirming language about universal themes and enduring messages suggests positive assessment, but limited text and philosophical tone rather than enthusiastic recommendation keeps score in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive takeaway about the universality and aspiration within the production, but lacks strong evaluative language or explicit recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, a lower positive score is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive interpretation of the show's message, but without more context, it's difficult to gauge the overall strength of the recommendation. The phrase 'aspire to be great' implies a positive takeaway, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt praises the production's 'enduring' and 'universal' message about the American Dream, indicating clear appreciation for its thematic depth and resonance.",
