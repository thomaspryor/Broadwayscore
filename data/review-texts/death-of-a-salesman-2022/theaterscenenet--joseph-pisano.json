Single excerpt warning means limited view of full verdict, but language suggests strong positive assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the casting and performances, particularly highlighting the 'revelatory production' and the impactful performances of the lead actors. Despite the text quality warning, the language indicates a strong positive sentiment. | Gemini: The review praises the direction and especially the performances of the leads, calling the production \"revelatory.\" Given the single excerpt, I am scoring it on the higher end of positive. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong praise for the 'revelatory production' and lauds both lead performances, particularly highlighting the emotional devastation and depth brought to the roles, though limited text necessitates conservative scoring at the upper end of Positive.",
