    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies - this appears to be a positive recommendation based on the star performance, but with only one curated quote available, the full review sentiment is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the star performance as the main reason to see the show, indicating a positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a lower confidence level and a score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is strongly positive about the star's performance, calling it \"the reason to see the show.\" Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for a lead performance and explicitly identifies it as the reason to attend, constituting a clear recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced, but the language ('rich and moving') and explicit recommendation place it in the upper range of Positive.",
