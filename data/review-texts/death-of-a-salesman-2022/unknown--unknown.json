However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so a lower score within the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive reception with the phrase \"notably rich and mostly successful approach.\" However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise ('notably rich') with minor qualification ('mostly successful'), indicating a positive recommendation for this production. Limited to a single excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
