    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic calls the performances 'extraordinary' and declares this production unmatched ('unlikely ever to see a finer production'), which is superlative language indicating a rave. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - the full review context is unknown. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the performances and the overall production, suggesting it is a must-see. However, the single excerpt warning reduces confidence in the full review's sentiment. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the performances of the leads and the overall production, stating that it is unlikely to see a finer production of the play. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise calling this the finest production imaginable with extraordinary performances, but as a single curated quote the confidence in the overall verdict is limited. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
