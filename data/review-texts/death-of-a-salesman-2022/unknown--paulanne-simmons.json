    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as a 'crowd pleaser' that makes audiences 'feel a lot better' - clearly positive language. However, confidence is low due to limited text from one curated quote that may not represent the full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as a 'crowd pleaser' with humor that makes the serious themes more palatable, suggesting a strong positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive experience, using phrases like \"crowd pleaser\" and describing the show as making the audience \"feel a lot better.\" Given it's a single excerpt, I've scored it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production as a 'crowd pleaser' with humor that makes the difficult material go down smoothly, indicating a clear positive recommendation despite the limitation of having only a single curated quote.",
