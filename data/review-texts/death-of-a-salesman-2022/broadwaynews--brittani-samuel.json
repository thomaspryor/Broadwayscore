    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a lack of emotional engagement or tension, which implies a mixed response. However, without the full context, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The critic states they did not feel nervous about Willy's death, suggesting a lack of emotional connection or impact from the production. Given that this is the only excerpt available, and it expresses a negative sentiment, I am scoring it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers conflicting signals: praises the depiction of Willy's 'achingly complicated life' but notes a lack of tension regarding his impending death, suggesting uneven emotional impact. With only one curated quote available, the overall verdict is ambiguous.",
