    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows praise ('quite a show') immediately tempered by criticism ('too much of a show'), suggesting mixed feelings. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, praising the showmanship but indicating it may be excessive at times. With only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a mixed reaction, acknowledging a strong performance but suggesting it can be excessive. Given the limited text, a mixed score with low confidence is appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, acknowledging the production's spectacle and entertainment value while criticizing its excess, suggesting a lukewarm recommendation. With only one curated excerpt available, the full verdict may differ significantly.",
