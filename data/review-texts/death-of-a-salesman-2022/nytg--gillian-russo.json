    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic expresses enthusiasm to continue watching even after a very long runtime, indicating strong engagement and recommendation despite the length. | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses a strong positive sentiment, indicating the critic found the production engaging enough to desire more, despite its length. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is set at the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The critic states they would gladly stay longer to watch the story continue, indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic expresses strong engagement and enjoyment, indicating that despite the long runtime, the production was so compelling they wished it would continue. This represents an enthusiastic endorsement of the show's quality and hold on the audience.",
