The climactic fight all the way to the inevitable conclusion is not affectingly tragic, and there is no build to speak of. Nice songs, but not enough attention was paid to the basics.",

The lack of build and ineffective climax suggests a show that fails to deliver on its basic promises. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the lack of emotional impact and structure in the show, indicating a negative assessment. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a lack of emotional impact and insufficient attention to fundamental aspects of the production, leading to a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic finds the climactic sequences ineffective and lacking build, criticizing the dramatic fundamentals while offering only faint praise for the music, indicating a negative assessment of the production.",
