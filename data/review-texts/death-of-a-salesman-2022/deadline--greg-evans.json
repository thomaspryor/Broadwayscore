However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, but it's a single quote, so confidence is low. The language suggests a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the production's distinct identity and fresh interpretation, placing it in the Positive bucket. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence in the overall verdict is reduced.",
