The original 87 rating indicates positive territory, but the 'expensive fan fiction' critique suggests lower-end positive rather than high positive. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 87 and the description of the show as a 'dazzling spectacle' indicate a strong positive recommendation, despite some reservations about the story. | Gemini: The critic's rating is 87, but the review text tempers the enthusiasm by calling the story \"expensive fan fiction.\" I am scoring it lower in the \"Positive\" bucket to reflect this reservation. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
