However, it also notes the story feels like 'expensive fan fiction,' indicating some reservations. | Gemini: The review praises the stagecraft and faithfulness to the source material, but notes the story feels like fan fiction. This suggests a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers high praise for the production values ('marvel of stagecraft') while expressing significant reservations about the story quality ('expensive fan fiction'), resulting in a recommendation based primarily on technical theatrical merits.",
