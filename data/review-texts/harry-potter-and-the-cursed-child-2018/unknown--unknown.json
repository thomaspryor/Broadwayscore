    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: CRITIC'S PICK designation with strong praise ('diamond-sharp', 'dazzling', 'magical', 'ravishingly entertaining') despite acknowledging commercial motivations. Single excerpt warning requires caution - this sounds clearly positive so using upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong praise for the production's staging and visual imagination, indicating a positive review. Despite noting some minor excisions and commercial motivations, the overall tone is enthusiastic. | Gemini: The review calls the show \"ravishingly entertaining\" but also notes it's a \"more obvious attempt to cash in on Pottermania.\" This suggests a positive recommendation with reservations. Confidence is low due to the excerpted nature of the review. | Kimi: The 'CRITIC'S PICK' designation and superlatives like 'diamond-sharp,' 'dazzling,' and 'ravishingly entertaining' indicate a strong recommendation, though the caveat about 'cash in on Pottermania' and noted excisions prevent it from being an unqualified rave. Scored at the upper end of the Positive range per the single-excerpt guidance, with low confidence due to the limited available text.",
