  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Folks yearning for an old-fashioned musical may finally get their wish as the 1980 movie \"9 to 5\" arrives on Broadway, starring Allison Janney and Marc Kudisch and with no little help from Dolly Parton. What exactly is an old-fashioned musical? A silly but amusing story with lots of jokes, catchy tunes, zesty lyrics and exuberant dancing on the way to a happy ending. Attractive women and suave men don't hurt either, but mind-lulling entertainment is the sine qua non.",
