  "bwwExcerpt": "\"'9 to 5\" is a female-empowerment theme-park musical - complete with a spunky Dolly Parton impersonator and lots of faceless scenery that might as well have been moving animatronics. The lavish and harmless entertainment, which opened last night with a shiny-colored and efficient score by Parton, is mostly a tracing-paper adaptation of the popular secretary-revenge movie - which, you may have noticed, was dated when it starred Parton, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin in 1980.\"",
