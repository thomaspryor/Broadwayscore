The phrase 'doesn't always reward such efforts' indicates mixed feelings about the overall production. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges Hugh Jackman's strong performance but suggests the drama itself may not fully justify or complement his efforts, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges Jackman's talent but states the drama doesn't always reward his efforts, indicating a mixed or lukewarm reception. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges Jackman's considerable talent and charisma, the explicit judgment that the drama 'doesn't always reward such efforts' indicates the production fails to capitalize on its star's strengths, resulting in a disappointing experience rather than a recommendation.",
