  "bwwExcerpt": "As in his 2008 Off-Broadway play about marital mystery, 'Parlour Song,' Butterworth displays a gift for moody atmospherics here. Scenes can sometimes go slack, like during rhapsodic arias about fishing. Director Ian Rickson, the author's longtime collaborator, showcases the play with a quiet, intimate staging. The audience is just a few feet from the cast, which include the very fine Cush Jumbo and Laura Donnelly. But the show is all about Jackman. His sturdy star turn is manly, measured and speckled with melancholy. Without him, 'The River' is a play that could flow by in a small Off-Broadway theater and not make much of a ripple.",
