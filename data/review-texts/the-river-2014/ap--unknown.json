  "bwwExcerpt": "Jackman himself is earnest and slightly flabbergasted as his character's narrative and memory gradually crack, but lacks any real slipperiness, making him more a victim of circumstance than a man complicit in his past tales. The actor's natural sweetness shines through when what we really want to see is the rogue. The role may get more mileage from a wolf, not a Wolverine. Butterworth's voice is always welcome and he returns with a pretty, less bombastic script than 'Jerusalem,' though one with gorgeous turns of phrase. (A fish is 'like a bar of precious metal. Like God's tongue.') He has a knack for dialogue between two people testing each other and his recurring love of fearsome nature - 'There are monsters out there. Huge monsters,' the fisherman warns about the fish - is darkly romantic.",
