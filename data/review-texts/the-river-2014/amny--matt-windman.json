  "bwwExcerpt": "Hugh Jackman deserves a lot of credit for returning to the New York stage in 'The River,' a new work by the little-known English playwright Jez Butterworth ('Jerusalem'), considering that most major film stars come to Broadway in revivals of fail-proof, classic dramas (i.e. Denzel Washington in 'A Raisin in the Sun,' Scarlett Johansson in 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'). 'The River' is, instead, a quiet, elusive drama with little mainstream appeal.",
