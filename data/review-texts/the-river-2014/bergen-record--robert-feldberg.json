  "bwwExcerpt": "Each of the actresses (if you're wondering, Cush Jumbo - her real name - is an attractive young Englishwoman) does this very well, but it's Jackman's character, sometimes intense, other times oddly remote, who fascinates us. The actor gives a strong, yet beguilingly subtle, portrayal of a man whose life has become an endless loop. There's a final surprise in 'The River,' which is startling and feels completely right. It's a moment that's deeply revealing - or so it seems.",
