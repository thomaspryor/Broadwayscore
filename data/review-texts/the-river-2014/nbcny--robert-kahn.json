  "bwwExcerpt": "Heraclitus once said it, and it was even seconded by Pocahontas in the eponymous Disney film: 'No man ever steps in the same river twice.' The sentiment, the Greek philosopher argued, alludes to the idea of ever-present change in the universe-the always-moving river. Some people, of course, aren't so comfortable with change. The Man, I think it's safe to acknowledge, is one of them.",
