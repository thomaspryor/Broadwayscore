The critic praises Jackman's performance but finds the play itself 'frustratingly opaque,' suggesting mixed feelings without a clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges Hugh Jackman's committed performance but criticizes the play as 'frustratingly opaque,' indicating a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review praises Jackman's performance but finds the play itself \"frustratingly opaque,\" indicating a mixed reaction and no clear recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic praises Jackman's committed performance, the conjunction 'but' signals that the negative assessment of the drama ('frustratingly opaque') outweighs the positive, indicating the production is not worth seeing. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
