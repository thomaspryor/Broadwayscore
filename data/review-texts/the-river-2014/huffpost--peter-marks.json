  "bwwExcerpt": "The 85-minute play falls somewhere between thriller and love story, without being sufficiently filling as either; the plot keeps its numerous secrets so close to the vest that it never manages to tantalize, and its characters are too cold to develop feelings for. Jackman's character, identified only as The Man, is a robust fishing enthusiast who can't seem to land the woman of his dreams - if such a woman exists. The atmosphere of 'The River' is all. Director Ian Rickson, in concert with set designer Ultz, conjures the rustic interior of The Man's fishing retreat as dark and earthy - hauntingly beautiful, perhaps haunted. Butterworth's overwrought language, by contrast, draws too much breathless attention to itself.",
