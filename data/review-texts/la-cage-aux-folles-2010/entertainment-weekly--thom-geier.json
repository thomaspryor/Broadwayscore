  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Hodge and Grammer provide a solid grounding for the show,  but the  rest of the cast offers all the flourishes you'd expect from a  show  rooted in drag performance. The six Cagelles are an impressively  lithe  and acrobatic ensemble (the choreography is by Lynne Page), and  Robin de  Jesus (In the Heights) is uproarious as Albin's devoted   butler/maid who aspires to be Cagelle himself. By the end of this   well-paced production, it's hard not to concur with the refrain of   Albin's second-act",
