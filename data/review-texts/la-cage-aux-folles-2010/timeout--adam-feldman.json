  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Terry Johnson's superb revival is tighter and  bolder. This La Cage aux Folles is no longer breaking ground; it's  planting new crops and watching them bloom. I would never have thought  that we needed another revival of this musical so soon after the last  one's flames flickered out. Yet somehow this familiar show blows the  roof off the Longacre Theatre, and makes a case for La Cage as a classic  of American musical comedy.\"",
