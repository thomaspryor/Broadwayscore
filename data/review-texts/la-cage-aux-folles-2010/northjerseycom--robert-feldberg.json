  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Housed in the Longacre, which has a small stage for a musical, and  with eight musicians jammed into two boxes above the stage, the  production suggests that, rather than being sleek and swanky, the  nightclub that Georges owns and in which Albin performs is on the seedy  side. Albin, meanwhile, might be a star, but he's not particularly  talented - more like a second-rate music-hall performer.\"",
