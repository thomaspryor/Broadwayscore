Despite acknowledging good intentions, the overall assessment is that it doesn't work. | GPT-4o: The review indicates that the revival fails to overcome issues related to time and tone, suggesting it is not recommended. | Gemini: The review states that the revival \"can't work miracles\" and that the tone \"no longer seems quite right,\" indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging the production is well-intentioned, the critic concludes it cannot overcome the dated nature of the material, stating it 'can't work miracles' against the passage of time.",
