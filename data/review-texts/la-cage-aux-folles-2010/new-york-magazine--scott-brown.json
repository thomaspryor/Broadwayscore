  "bwwExcerpt": "\" Hodge adds something new: a touch of sputtering rage  that's neither  heroic nor pathetic. Too agitated to hold stage center,  he jerks himself  around, looking for release, but finding only an  audience. And for  once, the performer delivering this fight-song  doesn't seem to assume  his listeners share his feelings or his fight.  For all the spittle and  vibrato on display, Hodge's number feels  strangely like a private  moment. This Albin is not articulating a  credo. He's simply furious.\"",
