  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Why mount another Broadway production of \"La Cage aux Folles\" when we  just had one in 2004? The answer is that Terry Johnson's London staging  and its Olivier Award-winning star, Douglas Hodge, inject this 1983  Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical version of the 1978 French film  with ingenious razzmatazz and a heartbreaking humanity that its  immediate predecessor lacked.\"",
