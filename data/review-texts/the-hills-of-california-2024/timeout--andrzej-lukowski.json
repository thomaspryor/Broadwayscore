  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "While the play is an ensemble effort, it is also an extraordinary showcase for Donnelly. The present here is haunted by the past, and the two collide powerfully in the wreckage and reckoning of the play's third act. (Butterworth has rewritten it for the better from the version that played in London.)"
