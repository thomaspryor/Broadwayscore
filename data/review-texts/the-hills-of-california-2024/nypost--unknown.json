However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low and score reflects cautious positive territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes an 'appealing haunted atmosphere' and notes that the play 'distinguishes itself,' which suggests a positive view. However, the lack of full context and the single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious, low-confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive sentiment, highlighting the play's appealing atmosphere and distinguishing qualities, but it's a single excerpt, so confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the play's 'appealing haunted atmosphere' and emphasizes that it distinguishes itself from similar dramas, indicating a solid recommendation despite limited available text.",
