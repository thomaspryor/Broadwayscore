  "bwwExcerpt": "The three-act play is 2 hours and 45 minutes long, and the plot lingers too long on tenterhooks for Joan, the estranged sister who has been away from Seaview for over two decades, to return and say her goodbyes. While the unraveling of the mystery surrounding Joan is a real gut punch, Butterworth spends more time anticipating a death than uncovering a family secret.",

  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Ultimately, it is the cast that makes the Seaview memorable. The play is a true ensemble showcase, with the adult sisters and their younger counterparts hitting all the stops... Butterworth's portrayal of grief and the memories people choose to remember  and forget  is moving, and worth checking into the Seaview (the Broadhurst Theatre) to experience.",
