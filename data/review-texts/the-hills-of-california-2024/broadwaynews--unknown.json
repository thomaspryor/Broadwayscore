However, confidence is low due to having only one curated excerpt that may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the playwright's skill and the rich texture of the play, indicating a positive view. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set towards the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the playwright's skill and the richness of the world-building, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the playwright's expert craftsmanship and the rich texture of the production, indicating a solid recommendation despite the long runtime. As a single curated excerpt, the sentiment appears strongly favorable toward the show's construction.",
