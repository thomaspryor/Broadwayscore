  "fullText": "John Lithgow: Stories by Heart: ‘As affable and daring as a dish of vanilla ice cream.’ Photograph: Joan MarcusView image in fullscreenJohn Lithgow: Stories by Heart: ‘As affable and daring as a dish of vanilla ice cream.’ Photograph: Joan Marcus This article is more than 8 years oldReviewJohn Lithgow: Stories by Heart review – star presence can't save humdrum one-man showThis article is more than 8 years oldAmerican Airlines Theatre, New York\n\nAn updated version of the star’s stage performance of both personal tales and published short stories is a disappointingly ordinary experience\n\nMaybe some ticket buyers to John Lithgow: Stories by Heart have long dreamed of Lithgow fixing them cocoa, tucking them in, and regaling them with a bedtime tale. Those people have probably not seen Raising Cain.\n\nOne of the finest things about Lithgow is how unclassifiable he is, how idiosyncratic. Another pale giant with a rabbit face and a plum pudding voice might have become a niche performer, but he has always moved gracefully among classics and schlock, leads and character roles, charmers and drips and villains and extraterrestrials. So it is both a pleasure and a disappointment to find him doing something as aggressively ordinary as this one-man show, which Lithgow first developed a decade ago, alternating family reminiscences with good-natured performances of two short stories, Ring Lardner’s Haircut and PG Wodehouse’s Uncle Fred Flits By.\n\nRead moreLithgow, dressed in a loose gray suit, steps on to a stage decorated to look like a wood-paneled study. Friendly and avuncular, he bathes for a while in the audience acclaim and then offers a series of rhetorical questions about the matter at hand. “Why do all of us want to hear stories?” he asks. “Why do some of us want to tell them? Why, for that matter, are all of you even here tonight?” That last question is actually a pretty good one and raises others: why would a leading non-profit like the Roundabout devote a Broadway theater to something so humdrum? Were no new plays available? Is a cracking turn on The Crown so bankable? Has no one there seen Dexter?\n\nThen Lithgow introduces a book central to his childhood, Tellers of Tales, a collection of 100 short stories selected by W Somerset Maugham. When Lithgow was young, his father, Arthur Lithgow, an intermittently successful actor, director and producer, would read his children a story from it at bedtime. Now Lithgow does the same, though after a page or two he abandons the book itself and begins to act out the stories.\n\nThe first, set in a rural Michigan town, is an American gothic, the second, which begins at the bread roll-battered Drones Club, is an English trifle, with an unnecessary intermission in between. Lithgow performs both ably, switching voices, postures and outsized facial expressions with ease. But that’s really the bare minimum for a successful single-actor, multi-character show. When you set yourself a low bar, it’s easy enough to step over. There is one startling moment when Lithgow looks likely to remove his trousers, but he’s only tucking in his shirttail.\n\nStories by Heart is cozy and folksy, as affable and daring as a dish of vanilla ice cream. When performing Uncle Fred Flits By, Lithgow speaks of a character who has generated “a great store of loopiness which expends itself with frightful violence”. That could describe plenty of Lithgow’s performances. Not this one. The man has been de-looped.\n\nAt any point, you can opt out of the sale of all of your personal information by pressing",

Despite praising Lithgow's abilities, the overall assessment is clearly negative. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'disappointingly ordinary' and 'humdrum,' indicating a negative assessment. However, due to the truncated text, the final verdict may be missing, so the confidence is low. | Gemini: Despite Lithgow's talent, the reviewer finds the show humdrum and aggressively ordinary, suggesting it's not worth the Broadway space. The truncated text makes me less confident in the score. | Kimi: While acknowledging Lithgow's technical skill, the critic finds the show 'aggressively ordinary' and 'humdrum,' questioning why a major nonprofit would devote a Broadway theater to such a 'bare minimum' experience. Confidence is low due to truncated text that may have contained a final verdict.",
