  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The artist creates a comfort zone in which tension fades and spirits rise...You’ll be glad you came...This show, beautifully honed over a ten year period, is comprised of two short, enacted stories...Lithgow is warm, inventive, and utterly charming. He owns every moment of this potent pleasure from hokum to heartache. One can only hope there’s a sequel...This version of the presentation is directed by Sullivan whose talents here are both broad and nuanced. There’s never a dull moment.”\n\nRead more",
