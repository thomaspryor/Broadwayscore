The positive tone and strong endorsement of his storytelling and voice work indicate a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt strongly praises Lithgow's performance, stating it's worth the ticket price. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The single excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for Lithgow's performance with an explicit recommendation ('worth the price of admission'), placing it in the upper Positive range, though confidence is low given the limited text available.",
