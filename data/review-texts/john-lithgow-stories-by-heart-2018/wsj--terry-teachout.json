Joan MarcusNew York\n\nThe solo show is one of Broadway’s best-established genres, but it’s also enervatingly unvaried. Far too many of the one-person shows that open there are cliché-encrusted exercises in theatrical taxidermy in which a famous actor pretends to be a famous historical figure. While the best such shows can be spectacularly effective vehicles for a great performer, most of them leave you sneaking peeks at your watch and muttering, “Is he ever going to die?” Not so “Stories by Heart,” in which John Lithgow, following in the hallowed footsteps of Charles Laughton, reads two of his favorite short stories out loud and tells us how he came to know them. That’s all there is to “Stories by Heart,” and it’s more than enough. Rarely have I spent so entertaining a night at the theater—or witnessed so touching a tribute to a departed parent.",

The only reservation is a minor suggestion about toning down the comic effects, but this doesn't detract from the overall positive assessment. | Kimi: Teachout opens by disparaging the solo show genre, but delivers a strongly positive verdict for this production, calling it 'more than enough' and 'rarely so entertaining.' The single reservation about comedic timing is immediately qualified and dismissed.",
