  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Lithgow’s love for his father is palpable in this piece, and I found that particularly moving...Lithgow is marvelously specific in the physicality he gives these short stories, realistically pantomiming an early 20th Century 'two bit' shave-and-a-haircut in the Lardner...This production is lively and vivacious, due in equal parts to Lithgow’s native theatrical intelligence and Daniel Sullivan’s canny direction. 'Stories by Heart' is thoroughly sincere and sentimental, which I find very refreshing.\" \n\nRead more",
