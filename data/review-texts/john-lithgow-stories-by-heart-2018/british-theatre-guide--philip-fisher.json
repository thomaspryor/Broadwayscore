  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Both very personal and universal. Lithgow frames two short stories...with two poignant excerpts drawn from his own history...Lithgow delivers a masterclass, while providing a worthy memorial to his parents in a quiet show that does exactly what his fans will expect. Quite how much of an impression it will make on those sitting at the back of the auditorium may be open to question but, in close-up, it is a unique opportunity to commune with an institution.”\n\nRead more",
