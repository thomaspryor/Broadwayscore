  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Sweet, engaging, sentimental, and charming...but also a bit too easy and dull on the ears, mind, and heart...This lovely performance celebrating the art of acting as well as paying homage to the beauty of storytelling almost put me to sleep with its soothing charm and pleasant wit. Lithgow glows with a comforting personality, sharp wit, and winning smile, but for this theater junkie, I guess I need a more compelling reason to turn up at a Broadway theatre.”\n\nRead more",
