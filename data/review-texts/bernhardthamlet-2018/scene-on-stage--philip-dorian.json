'Bernhardt/Hamlet' straddles the extremes brilliantly...What makes this display so smart – and so funny –is that we’re dealing here with, arguably, the greatest play ever written...McTeer’s tour de force performance lays bare the flaws, foibles and fortunes of the premiere actress of her day...A perfect partnership between playwright and actor.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with 'brilliantly,' 'tour de force,' 'perfect partnership,' but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for being smart and funny, with a 'tour de force' performance by McTeer, indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"brilliantly\", \"tour de force performance\", and \"perfect partnership\". Given the limited excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper range of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt uses superlatives like 'brilliantly,' 'tour de force,' and 'perfect partnership' to praise the writing, performance, and overall production. However, confidence is low given the single-excerpt warning that curated quotes may not represent the full review.",
