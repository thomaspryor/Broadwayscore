Given the single excerpt warning, a score at the lower end of Positive is appropriate. | Gemini: The review praises McTeer's performance and Rebeck's portrait, but also notes that McTeer's skill threatens to undermine the premise. This suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance and finds the play's portrait thoroughly convincing, indicating a clear positive recommendation, though the single-excerpt format warrants low confidence.",
