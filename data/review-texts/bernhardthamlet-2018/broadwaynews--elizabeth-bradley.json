    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong praise for lead performance ('triumphantly', 'career-defining') and positive assessment of direction and writing ('deftly constructed', 'idea-rich'), but low confidence due to limited text availability. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises McTeer's performance as potentially career-defining and highlights the play's relevance and humor. The language suggests strong enthusiasm, but with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises McTeer's performance as a \"career-defining star turn\" and highlights the play's relevance and humor, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for McTeer's 'career-defining' performance and calls the play 'deftly constructed and idea-rich,' warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket. However, given the single-excerpt warning that such quotes may be cherry-picked, confidence is reduced and the score stays within Positive rather than Rave territory.",
