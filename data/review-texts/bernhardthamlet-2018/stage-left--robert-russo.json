For my money, I’d much rather see Ms. McTeer play Hamlet.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear criticism - play 'does none of them well' and 'has nothing particularly interesting to say.' However, single excerpt warning requires caution as the full verdict may be different. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the play for failing to effectively explore its themes and suggests it lacks relevance. The recommendation to see Ms. McTeer play Hamlet instead implies a negative view of the current production. | Gemini: The review states the play does not do any of the things it attempts well and that the reviewer would rather see the actress play Hamlet than watch the play. | Kimi: The excerpt consistently criticizes the play for failing to achieve its goals, finding it unilluminating and dull ('like watching a rehearsal'), with the critic explicitly stating preference for an alternative production.",
