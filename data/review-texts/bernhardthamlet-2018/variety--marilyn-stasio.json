    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for both the lead performance ('barnstorming') and the play itself ('fascinating'), but this appears to be a truncated excerpt with limited evaluative content to assess full recommendation strength. | Gemini: The review highlights a strong performance and calls the play 'fascinating,' indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: Strong positive language throughout: 'barnstorming performance' and 'fascinating biographical play' indicate clear recommendation. However, this is a very short excerpt with no explicit verdict statement, so confidence is medium rather than high.",
