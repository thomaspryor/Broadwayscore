    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise with strong language ('compelling', 'towering performances', 'exacting direction', 'important dramatic exploration'). However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the performances and direction, describing the play as 'compelling' and 'important.' Given the single excerpt warning, confidence is low, but the language suggests a highly positive review. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language about the performances, direction, and script, indicating a favorable review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of 'Positive' but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for performances, direction, and script using words like 'towering' and 'compelling,' though as a single curated quote it may not represent the full review.",
