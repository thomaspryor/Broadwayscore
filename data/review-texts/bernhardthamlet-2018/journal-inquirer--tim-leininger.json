  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"McTeer gives a powerful, electric performance as Bernhardt. It is a rich and colored canvas with depth, conflict, ego, and insecurity...It’s Bernhardt’s inability to work with the character of Hamlet the way he is written that is compelling about 'Bernhardt/Hamlet' and makes me believe that Rebeck’s motives are not nearly as surface-level...She has created an exceptional piece of feminist theater by making a woman not only powerful for her time.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance ('powerful, electric') and playwright's achievement ('exceptional piece of feminist theater'), but single excerpt warning requires caution about full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises McTeer's performance as 'powerful, electric' and describes the play as 'an exceptional piece of feminist theater'. Despite the single excerpt limitation, the tone is clearly positive, warranting a score in the upper Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the lead performance and calls the play an \"exceptional piece of feminist theater,\" indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the limited text available, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for both the lead performance ('powerful, electric') and the play's thematic depth, calling it 'exceptional' and 'compelling.' However, as a single curated excerpt, it may not reflect potential reservations in the full review.",
