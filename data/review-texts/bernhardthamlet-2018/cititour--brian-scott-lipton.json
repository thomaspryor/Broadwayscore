  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"As enjoyable as the play is, the thunderous ovation at the end of these 2 ½ hours is primarily for the dazzlingly brilliant Janet McTeer. Guided by the savvy director Moritz von Stuelpnagel, the Tony-winning star makes not just a meal but an entire tasting menu out of the central role of the celebrated French actress Sarah Bernhardt. Egotistical, self-deprecating, romantic, self-reliant, foolish, super-smart, McTeer's Bernhardt literally contains multitudes.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt clearly praises the play as 'enjoyable' and describes McTeer's performance as 'dazzlingly brilliant' with 'thunderous ovation.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked praise from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as enjoyable and highlights Janet McTeer's performance as dazzlingly brilliant, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning indicates potential cherry-picking, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the positive aspects of the play and Janet McTeer's performance, indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing the score towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Janet McTeer's 'dazzlingly brilliant' performance and calls the play 'enjoyable,' indicating a clear recommendation driven by the star turn. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is low.",
