    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, the language is unambiguously enthusiastic with superlatives ('remarkable,' 'electric thrill,' 'immortal') and an explicit urgent recommendation to 'RUN' to see it. The praise spans writing, staging, and performance. | GPT-4o: The excerpt contains strong praise for the playwriting, staging, and McTeer's performance, urging theatergoers to 'march, walk, RUN' to see the show, indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt contains very enthusiastic language (\"electric thrill\", \"undoubted brilliance\", \"march, walk, RUN\"), indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, it is only a single excerpt, so confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains urgent recommendation language ('RUN...to witness') and praise for performances, direction, and writing as 'electric' and 'imaginative,' but limited context necessitates caution. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
