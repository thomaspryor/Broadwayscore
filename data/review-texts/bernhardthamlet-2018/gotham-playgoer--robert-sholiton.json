  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The 'Hamlet' production seems to get lost...The final scene has a clever coup de théatre that unfortunately offers too little too late. McTeer makes a convincing Bernhardt, but when she portrays Hamlet, her speech becomes too quiet and rapid...The pace set by Moritz von Stuelpnagel’s direction often seems rushed. All in all, it was a disappointment.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt shows consistent criticism: production 'gets lost', McTeer's speech becomes 'too quiet and rapid', direction 'seems rushed', and concludes 'it was a disappointment'. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - the full review might contain more balanced assessment. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt concludes with 'All in all, it was a disappointment,' indicating a negative verdict. The critique of pacing and performance issues supports this assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"seems to get lost\", \"too little too late\", \"too quiet and rapid\", \"rushed\", and \"disappointment\", indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic explicitly calls the production a disappointment, citing rushed direction, flawed performance choices, and insufficient theatrical impact despite isolated clever moments.",
