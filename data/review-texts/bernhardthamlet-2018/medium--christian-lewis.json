  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"When you base a new play off of a lengthy, brooding, melancholic, overly poetic play, your are bound to bore the audience with too many 'words words words'...The most upsetting structural element, however, is the fact the after over two hours of rehearsal and debate, we are never given a glimpse of Sarah’s actual performance as Hamlet. Despite all the plays problems, there is certainly a great deal to praise to be given, almost entirely to the extraordinary Janet McTeer.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Review identifies significant structural flaws ('bore the audience', 'most upsetting structural element') but balances this with high praise for McTeer's performance. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears genuinely mixed rather than cherry-picked positive. | GPT-4o: The review highlights significant structural issues and potential for audience boredom, but acknowledges praise for Janet McTeer's performance. The mixed evaluation suggests neither a strong recommendation nor a complete dismissal. | Gemini: The review highlights structural problems and boredom, but praises Janet McTeer's performance, suggesting a mixed experience worth seeing for her alone. The single excerpt and truncated nature lower confidence. | Kimi: The critic finds the play boring and structurally frustrating ('upsetting structural element'), but offers strong praise for Janet McTeer's performance, suggesting a mixed verdict where the star is the primary draw.",
