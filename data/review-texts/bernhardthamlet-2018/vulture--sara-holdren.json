Full of period frills and actorly flourishes, it fails to convey either astonishing mythos or full, authentic humanity.

Even acknowledges McTeer's talent but states she 'can't save' the production. Medium confidence due to excerpt-only format. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the play for falling into common traps and failing to deliver on its potential. Despite praising Janet McTeer, the overall tone is negative, suggesting the production is not worth seeing. | Gemini: The review excerpt is negative, stating the play \"fails to convey\" and that even a strong performance can't save it. Confidence is low due to the truncated text. | Kimi: The critic argues the bio-play falls into familiar traps, fails to convey authentic humanity or mythos, and fills the protagonist with passé sentiments, concluding that even a talented lead performance cannot redeem the production.",
