  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Brimming with ideas and saucy banter, it’s lively but exhausting, manic and overstuffed...Rebeck opts for a grand, multi-layered affair with lots of exposition, ginned-up histrionics, and florid speechifying. But there’s not enough narrative...Scene after scene blows by...some of it witty and deft—but the drama itself hardly rolls forward...On the plus side, it’s a bouncy, handsome production, and the actors a merry bunch...McTeer struts and frets to swashbuckling perfection.”\n\nRead more",
  "bwwExcerpt": "I do wish Rebeck had taken her protagonist's utterances to heart in this energetic but scattershot period homage, Bernhardt/Hamlet. Brimming with ideas and saucy banter, it's lively but exhausting, manic and overstuffed, too much-possibly like the Divine Sarah was in life.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Review balances significant criticisms (overstuffed, lacks narrative drive, doesn't move forward) with notable positives (bouncy production, good actors, McTeer's performance). Confidence low due to truncated text. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as lively but also exhausting and overstuffed, indicating a mixed reaction. While there are positive notes about the production and performances, the critique of the narrative and pacing suggests a lack of strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive aspects (lively, handsome production, good actors) and negative ones (exhausting, overstuffed, not enough narrative). This suggests a mixed experience. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance and production values ('bouncy, handsome production') but substantial criticism of the play's structure ('overstuffed,' 'not enough narrative,' 'hardly rolls forward'). Without a clear recommendation or the full review's conclusion, this reads as a balanced assessment of strengths and weaknesses.",
