The sexual politics from 1899 make you realize we haven’t gotten that far at all some 119 years later. Janet McTeer is a treasure, commanding the stage like few others these days. It’s time for her to be celebrated.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for McTeer's performance ('treasure', 'commanding') and calls for celebration, but single excerpt warning means full verdict unclear. Upper end of Positive range given enthusiastic tone. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the timeliness of the play's themes and highlights Janet McTeer's performance as commanding and worthy of celebration. Despite the text quality warning, the strong positive language suggests a high score within the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Janet McTeer's performance and the play's timeliness, suggesting a positive overall experience. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performance ('treasure,' 'commanding like few others') and the production's timeliness, clearly recommending the show, though the single-excerpt format warrants caution.",
