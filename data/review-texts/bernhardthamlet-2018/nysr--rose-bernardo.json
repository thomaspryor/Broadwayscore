    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance with superlative language ('no one better suited', 'titanic Tony-winning turn'). However, this is only one excerpt focusing on the star, so confidence is low and may not represent full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for Janet McTeer's performance, suggesting a positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low and the score is set at the lower end of the positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt strongly praises Janet McTeer's performance, suggesting a positive overall experience. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the praise is strong. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Janet McTeer's performance, describing her as perfectly cast and referencing her previous Tony-winning work, but limited context from only one curated quote warrants low confidence.",
