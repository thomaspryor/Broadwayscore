    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises both the play's thematic depth and LuPone's distinctive performance as filling a crucial dramatic function. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation - the full review verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises LuPone's performance, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises LuPone's performance and the play's theme, suggesting a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Patti LuPone's performance, describing it as filling the play's thematic core with 'emotional truth,' indicating a positive assessment despite limited context.",
