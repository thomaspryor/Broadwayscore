  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Rebeck’s play is truly a fictional documentary, at least in its long first act, for its story does not advance much until the second act begins...There is much in this first act to delight us...In the second act...there is much conflict; and the sparks do fly...Rebeck has proved to be prolific, and continues to write plays of substance; sometimes provocative, always entertaining. Here she is writing about sacrifice to achieve change, and the courage to fight tradition.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows measured praise ('much to delight', 'entertaining', 'substance') but notes pacing issues in first act. Given single excerpt warning and qualified positive language, scoring at lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the play, highlighting its entertaining and substantive nature, despite a slow first act. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive view of the play, describing it as entertaining and of substance, though the first act is slow. Given the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Rebeck's writing as 'substantial' and 'always entertaining,' noting the play delivers 'delight' and dramatic 'sparks,' indicating a clear recommendation despite some first-act pacing concerns.",
