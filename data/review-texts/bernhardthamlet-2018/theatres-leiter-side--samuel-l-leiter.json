  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Only partly satisfying…Rebeck's dialogue is smart and engaging but the plot lumbers along…without much dramatic thrust and laden with lots of talk and numerous emotion-wrought moments…McTeer gives a tour de force performance of Bernhardt, whom she resembles not in the least, including the fact that she's 6'1\" and the Divine Sarah was 5'2\". But she has the fire, the gumption, the humor, and the fury, not to mention the voice, the energy, the presence, and the intelligence.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Opens with 'only partly satisfying,' praises dialogue but criticizes plot as lacking dramatic thrust. Raves about McTeer's performance but overall assessment is balanced positive/negative. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review praises McTeer's performance but criticizes the plot's lack of dramatic thrust. The mixed tone suggests some positive elements but overall reservations. | Gemini: The review praises the dialogue and McTeer's performance but criticizes the plot's pacing and dramatic thrust, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the critic praises Janet McTeer's 'tour de force' performance and finds the dialogue 'smart and engaging,' the overall verdict is 'only partly satisfying' due to a plot that 'lumbers along' with little dramatic thrust. The strong performer praise is undercut by significant criticism of the play's structure.",
