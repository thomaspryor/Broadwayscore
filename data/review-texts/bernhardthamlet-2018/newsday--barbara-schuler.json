    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review acknowledges flaws but concludes the production is 'stimulating' and worth forgiving those flaws. However, confidence is low due to excerpt-only format and potential missing context. | GPT-4o: The review highlights strong performances and a fascinating portrayal of the subject, despite noting flaws in the work. The overall tone suggests a positive recommendation, but the text quality warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review praises McTeer's performance and the intimate look at Bernhardt, but acknowledges flaws in the work. The overall tone suggests a positive recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: While acknowledging flaws in the script and challenging pacing, the critic praises McTeer's commanding stage presence and finds the production ultimately stimulating, indicating a clear recommendation.",
