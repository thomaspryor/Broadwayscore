Curated excerpts limit confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review praises McTeer's performance and the comedy direction but criticizes the play for meandering and not deepening its inquiry. The mixed elements suggest a balanced view without a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises McTeer's performance and Von Stuelpnagel's direction, but criticizes the play itself for being bogged down in speechifying and not deepening the inquiry. This suggests a mixed experience, leaning slightly positive due to the performance. | Kimi: The excerpts praise McTeer's magnetic performance and the direction's breeziness, but criticize the play for getting bogged down in speechifying, meandering, and failing to deepen its inquiry into the subject matter.",
