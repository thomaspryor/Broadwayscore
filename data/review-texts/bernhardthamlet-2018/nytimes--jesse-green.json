Janet McTeer stars as Sarah Bernhardt, then in her mid-50s and aging out of the dying courtesan roles that made her world-famous. As far as Shakespeare is concerned, she is caught in the gap between Ophelia and Gertrude.\n\nEnter the men: Edmond Rostand (Jason Butler Harner), one of France’s greatest young dramatists; Alphonse Mucha (Matthew Saldivar), the Art Nouveau illustrator of Bernhardt’s gorgeous posters; and Louis (Tony Carlin), a critic so parsimonious with praise I suppose it’s only fair that he’s given no surname.\n\n“A woman with power,” he says of Bernhardt, and right to her face, “is a freak.”\n\nIt is not just the assumption of male opportunities and prerogatives that bothers these men; to be fair, Rostand, whom Ms. Rebeck posits as Bernhardt’s lover, is actually turned on by her Hamlet boots.\n\n“It is delightful to undress a man and find a woman inside,” he says, undoing her drag after rehearsal.",
