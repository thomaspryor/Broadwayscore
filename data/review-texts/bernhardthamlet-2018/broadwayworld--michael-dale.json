  "bwwExcerpt": "Playwright Theresa Rebeck offers her star many such pithy moments in her fact-based comedy/drama Bernhardt/Hamlet. Her explanation as to why a woman would be the most sensible choice to play Shakespeare's \"passionate, confused boy with the mind of a man of forty,\" is inarguably logical....",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"There's some damn good, expressive and provocative writing in 'Bernhardt/Hamlet,' and the opportunity to see an exceptional artist like McTeer draw every complex nuance out Rebeck's best words is an experience worthy of any Broadway season.

The text is an excerpt, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review praises the writing and McTeer's performance, calling it an experience worthy of Broadway. However, it also mentions frustrating parts and unexplored themes, indicating reservations. Confidence is low due to the truncated text. | Kimi: While the excerpt praises the 'damn good' writing and calls McTeer's performance 'exceptional' and 'worthy of any Broadway season,' it also criticizes the play's structure for not fully exploring its themes, indicating a solid but qualified recommendation.",
