  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"It takes a good amount of meandering through Act 1 to see where exactly this plane is headed, but director von Stuelpnagel guides it along playfully...Act 2 is where the story finally gathers its momentum and the meticulously placed pieces from Act 1 realign in ways that offer insight into questions both broadly about the timeless conflicts between men and women and narrowly about the passionate relationship between Rostand and Bernhardt.” \n\nRead more",

Positive but with clear reservations about pacing issues. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a slow start but ultimately a rewarding Act 2, suggesting a mildly positive experience. The single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a slow start but praises the director's guidance and the eventual alignment of the story's elements, suggesting a positive, albeit qualified, recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges a slow, meandering Act 1 but praises the director's playful handling and the momentum and insight gained in Act 2. With only one curated excerpt available, this registers as mildly positive with reservations.",
