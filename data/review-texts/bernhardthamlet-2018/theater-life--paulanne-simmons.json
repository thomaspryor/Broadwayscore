  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"With very little real conflict or drama going on, Rebeck resorts to giving McTeer a huge amount of stage time in which Bernhardt analyzes the role she is about to inhabit, something the famously melodramatic actress in pre-Stanislavski times would hardly undertake. Nevertheless, McTeer is magnificent as she struts back and forth, giving Bernhardt youth and vitality, if not very much depth...One cannot argue with Rebeck’s premise. One can only wish she’d written a better play.\" \n\nRead more",

The final wish for 'a better play' suggests disappointment despite the strong lead performance. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the lack of conflict and drama, and while praising McTeer's performance, it ultimately wishes for a better play. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, but the overall tone is negative. | Gemini: The review praises McTeer's performance as Bernhardt but criticizes the play's writing. The final sentence, \"One can only wish she’d written a better play,\" indicates a mixed overall impression. | Kimi: While praising Janet McTeer's performance as 'magnificent,' the critic finds the play itself lacking in conflict and drama, explicitly wishing the playwright had written a better work. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
