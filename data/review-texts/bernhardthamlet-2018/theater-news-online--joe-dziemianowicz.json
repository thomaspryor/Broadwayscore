  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A terrifically theatrical and entertaining but not quite airtight new Broadway comedy...Makes you laugh and think about gender, power and theater. The play speaks to today, but, happily, never hammers its relevance. Rebeck is a smart writer. She trusts the intelligence of her audience. The play gets a lift each time Sarah goes through scenes of Hamlet with fellow actors...But at times things go slack...McTeer elevates everything with her stirring voice and striking physicality.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite praise for being 'terrifically theatrical and entertaining' and positive comments about the writing and lead performance, the critic notes significant flaws ('not quite airtight', 'at times things go slack'). Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mildly positive with reservations. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the play as 'terrifically theatrical and entertaining' and highlights its ability to provoke thought, indicating a positive recommendation. However, it also notes that the play is 'not quite airtight' and that 'at times things go slack,' suggesting some reservations. | Gemini: The review excerpt is mostly positive, calling the play \"terrifically theatrical and entertaining\" and praising the writing and lead performance, but also notes that \"at times things go slack.\" Given the single excerpt and the caveat, a score in the middle of the positive range seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers strong praise ('terrifically theatrical', 'smart writer', 'elevates everything') and clear recommendation ('entertaining'), though significant reservations about pacing ('things go slack') and construction ('not quite airtight') prevent it from being an unqualified rave.",
