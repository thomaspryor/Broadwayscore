  "showScoreExcerpt": "“What ‘Bernhardt/Hamlet’ perversely refuses to give us is a coherent sense of Bernhardt’s performance in the role...Perhaps Rebeck is afraid that Bernhardt’s take on Hamlet would look dated or worse to a modern audience...While it is sometimes ungainly, the play is amusing on its own inside-theater terms. Moritz von Stuelpnagel’s staging...has a handsome rotating set...and capable performances not only by McTeer, who is incapable of being dull, but a strong supporting cast.”\n\nRead more",
  "bwwExcerpt": "But for all of Bernhardt/Hamlet's limitations, it reminded me of Bernhardt's own motto: quand même, which translates roughly to \"even so\" or \"at the same time.\" While it is sometimes ungainly, the play is amusing on its own inside-theater terms....",

Excerpt only with no clear final verdict makes confidence low. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the play's amusing aspects and capable performances but criticizes its coherence and staging. The overall tone is mixed, with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges amusement and capable performances but criticizes the lack of coherence in Bernhardt's performance and the play itself. This suggests a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The review criticizes the play's central conceit as 'perverse' and 'ungainly' but ultimately finds it 'amusing' with praise for the staging and performances, suggesting a tempered, qualified response rather than a clear recommendation.",
