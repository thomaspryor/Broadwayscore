  "showScoreExcerpt": "“McTeer is quite, quite wonderful. Period. She is mercurial and thoughtful. She conveys the feeling that she is looking for just the right word to say, and that she herself is not certain what that might be. She keeps you on alert...Less satisfying is the play...What is lacking is a strong plot, a reason to move forward, something that raises the stakes. This is not easy in a biographical drama...And because of this McTeer never makes the leap into the Bernhardt that everyone is discussing.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Praises McTeer's performance as 'quite wonderful' but finds significant issues with the play itself, lacking plot and stakes. Single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review praises McTeer's performance but criticizes the play's lack of a strong plot and stakes, resulting in a mixed assessment. The excerpt suggests some positive elements but overall reservations. | Gemini: The review praises McTeer's performance but criticizes the play's lack of plot and stakes, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers high praise for Janet McTeer's performance but substantial criticism of the play's plot and structure, noting she never fully achieves the transformative leap into the character. With only one excerpt available, the overall verdict remains unclear but appears balanced between acting praise and material criticism.",
