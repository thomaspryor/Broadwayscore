  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Rebeck’s premise is promising, but ‘Bernhardt/Hamlet’ fails to deliver...‘Bernhardt/Hamlet’ never manages to decide whether it’s a comedy...or a dead-serious play...The result is the worst of both worlds, a preachy backstage farce...McTeer isn’t interesting...You never get the feeling that she has anything particularly original to say about the role, which can’t help but undercut the whole premise...Would that set, director and cast had been used instead for another, better play.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative verdict with harsh language: 'fails to deliver', 'worst of both worlds', 'preachy', criticism of lead performance as 'not interesting', and explicit wish for 'another, better play'. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is strongly negative, criticizing the play for failing to decide its tone and describing it as a 'preachy backstage farce.' The lack of interest in McTeer's performance and the suggestion that the cast and crew would be better used on another play further supports a Pan classification. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review is clearly negative, calling the play a \"preachy backstage farce\" and criticizing the lead performance. The final line wishes the cast and director had been used for a better play, indicating a strong lack of recommendation. | Kimi: The critic finds the show fails to deliver on its promising premise, criticizing its tonal confusion and uninteresting lead performance while suggesting the talented cast and production team were wasted on inferior material.",
