  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Bernhardt’s story is filled to the brim with exciting and bizarre facts, many of which find their way into ‘Bernhardt/Hamlet’, the intricate and charming new play...Gorgeously portrayed...McTeer relishes every word and breath that comes out of Sarah...The play fails to end with a bang, like it does within the final moments before intermission, but it signifies a historical moment and its meaning to the profession...McTeer’s portrayal...is as great and grand as the dame herself.” \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite noting the ending doesn't match the first act's impact, the critic uses consistently positive language ('intricate and charming', 'gorgeously portrayed', 'great and grand'). Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as 'intricate and charming' and highlights McTeer's performance as 'great and grand'. While it notes the play 'fails to end with a bang', the overall tone is positive. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong praise for the play and the lead actress, suggesting a positive recommendation. The phrases 'intricate and charming' and 'great and grand' indicate enthusiasm. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('intricate and charming', 'gorgeously portrayed', 'great and grand') with only a minor reservation about the ending failing to land with a 'bang', indicating a clear but not unqualified recommendation.",
