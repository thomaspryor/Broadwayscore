    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong praise for McTeer's performance and direction, but notes the book 'is wordy and wavers.' Limited text suggests qualified positive recommendation focused on the lead performance. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises McTeer's performance and the direction, but notes issues with the book being 'wordy and wavers'. The positive elements are emphasized, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review strongly praises McTeer's performance and von Stuelpnagel's direction, while noting reservations about Rebeck's book. Given the single excerpt and the emphasis on McTeer, I'm placing it in the upper range of positive. | Kimi: Despite noting that the book is 'wordy and wavers,' the critic emphasizes Janet McTeer's commanding, fierce performance and the taut direction, suggesting the production succeeds as a showcase for its star.",
