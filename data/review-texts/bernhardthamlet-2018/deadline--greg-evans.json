  "dtliExcerpt": "Whatever combination of passion, narcissism and bravery swirl to form an actor’s decision to tackle Hamlet must merit a spot in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Short of that, we’ll have to rely on the wondrous Janet McTeer’s star turn in Theresa Rebeck’s spirited, funny new play Bernhardt/Hamlet to guide us up theater’s Mount Everest. Opening tonight at the Roundabout Theatre Company’s American Airlines Theatre, Bernhardt/Hamlet is based on a real-life chapter in the life of legendary stage actress Sarah Bernhardt. Rebeck’s play – by turns comedy and drama – goes backstage as “the Divine Sarah” rehearses for her scandalous, much-anticipated debut as the Dane.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Rebeck’s spirited, funny new play...As ‘Bernhardt/Hamlet’ widens its scope to examine the very nature of art itself...things get talky. Very talky. There are witticisms galore, and a good amount of genuine laughs, but points are made and remade...Rebeck is too good at her craft, though, to let the play slip away. An Act II surprise introduces another strand of theatrical history, bringing plots together, refocusing ideas into new shapes and, finally, pointing to a new world fast approaching.”\n\nRead more"
