However, confidence is low due to truncated excerpt format. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the play's talkative nature but praises its wit and craftsmanship. The overall tone suggests a positive recommendation despite some reservations about pacing. | Gemini: The review acknowledges talkiness and repetition, but ultimately praises Rebeck's craft and the play's refocusing in Act II. Due to the truncated text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic praises the play as 'spirited' and 'funny' with 'genuine laughs' while acknowledging it becomes 'very talky' and repetitive, but ultimately credits the playwright's skill and satisfying Act II resolution.",
