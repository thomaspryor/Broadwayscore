  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Ever-agile playwright Theresa Rebeck has fashioned a highly entertaining portrayal of the struggle Bernhardt faced in bringing her Hamlet to life. Rebeck illuminates why a woman is an ideal choice to play the role, while also giving us insight into the artistic challenges facing Bernhardt in particular in making the role align with her decidedly majestic approach to acting...As Bernhardt, McTeer is scintillating and mesmerizing, just like you would want 'The Divine Sarah' to be.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows consistent praise for both the playwright's work ('highly entertaining') and the lead performance ('scintillating and mesmerizing'). However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked positive content from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as 'highly entertaining' and provides positive remarks about the lead performance and the playwright's insights. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper range of Positive. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the playwright and the lead actress, calling the portrayal \"highly entertaining\" and the actress \"scintillating and mesmerizing.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong praise for both the playwright's 'highly entertaining' writing and the lead's 'scintillating' performance, indicating clear recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, the complete verdict context is unknown.",
