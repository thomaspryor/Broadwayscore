  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"McTeer’s Bernhardt is impetuous, sardonic, and assertive in captivating ways, and she makes no secret of loathing her rival, Eleanora Duse, who she feels experiences no emotions onstage but her own...The play meanders into some dullness and has some heavy-handed dialogue ('You are Sarah Bernhard…'), but also a lot of witty banter—and the actress reveals at one point that she was infatuated with a female sculptor. I bet she had a hard time molding Sarah.\"\n\nRead more",

The balancing of positive and negative elements without a clear recommendation suggests mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises McTeer's performance but notes the play's meandering and heavy-handed dialogue. The mixed elements suggest a balanced view, with both positive and negative aspects. | Gemini: The review praises McTeer's performance but notes some dullness and heavy-handed dialogue, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Confidence is low due to the excerpted nature of the text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for McTeer's performance ('captivating') and appreciates the witty banter, but criticizes the play's structure ('meanders into dullness') and heavy-handed dialogue, indicating a qualified recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
