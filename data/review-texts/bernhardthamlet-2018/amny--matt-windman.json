  "showScoreExcerpt": "“McTeer’s Bernhardt is an imposing diva, but she is also jovial, eccentric, unsure and vulnerable...Directed in an overly aggressive manner...While the play contains many witty lines and delves into important topics, it is too discursive for its own good, leading to minimal and muddled plot development...By the second act, the play becomes tiresome and feels long-winded...An inspired, timely and interesting idea for a play — if only it had been better executed.”\n\nRead more"
