  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A search for an absent father and finding solace on the stage are both captured beautifully in Theresa Rebeck’s new play 'Bernhardt/Hamlet.' The problem is, there’s more to the play...The strengths of this production, finely staged by Moritz von Stuelpnagel, center on scenes in which Bernhardt makes choices in rehearsal about her performance and demonstrates her generosity...It is a very busy backstage world, but it’s finally one with a few too many male voices.\" \n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning applies - this appears genuinely mixed rather than cherry-picked positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights both positive aspects (beautiful capture, strengths in staging and performance) and negatives (too many male voices, more to the play than needed). The mixed signals suggest a balanced review with both praise and criticism. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the staging and Bernhardt's choices, but also notes a problem with too many male voices, suggesting a mixed but overall positive assessment. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt praises specific production elements as 'beautiful' and 'finely staged' but introduces significant caveats about structural problems and excess characters, suggesting a qualified recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
