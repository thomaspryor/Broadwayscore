  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The play's limitation it is that is both light comedy and mainly chitchat. We see Bernhardt rehearse snippets of ‘Hamlet,’ but they are continually interrupted by visitors, Rostand, Mucha, Maurice. Most of these are the soliloquies, a great deal of poetry that she finds difficult, and she assigns poor Rostand the job of rewriting Shakespeare's play to take out the iambic pentameter and put the verse into prose. There is much talk of Parisian theater, Sarah's hits and misses, and rival actors.”\n\nRead more",
