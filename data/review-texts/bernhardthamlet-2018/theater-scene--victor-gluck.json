  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The play's limitation it is that is both light comedy and mainly chitchat. We see Bernhardt rehearse snippets of ‘Hamlet,’ but they are continually interrupted by visitors, Rostand, Mucha, Maurice. Most of these are the soliloquies, a great deal of poetry that she finds difficult, and she assigns poor Rostand the job of rewriting Shakespeare's play to take out the iambic pentameter and put the verse into prose. There is much talk of Parisian theater, Sarah's hits and misses, and rival actors.”\n\nRead more",

Given only one curated quote with 'Read more' suggesting truncation, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the play's limitations, focusing on its light comedy and chitchat nature, without clear praise or strong criticism. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning suggest caution in interpretation. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the play as \"light comedy and mainly chitchat,\" which suggests a mixed or neutral assessment. The lack of a clear recommendation and the limited text contribute to the low confidence. | Kimi: The single available excerpt identifies structural 'limitations' and characterizes the content as 'mainly chitchat,' indicating criticism of the play's substance and pacing. Without access to the full review or verdict paragraph, the sentiment appears mixed-to-negative, warranting a low confidence rating.",
