  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"It is McTeer’s impossible task to come up with a creditable interpretation of the fire that was Bernhardt...It’s a full-throttle performance that, while enthusiastic, never varies much...Part of the problem is with Von Stuelpnagel...He has derailed the proceedings without imbuing any seamless shadings or editing. In this case, it is a free-for-all of the preposterous with no reining in of the rough edges that are way over-the-top for his leading lady and the plotline.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Single excerpt criticizes lead performance as lacking variation and director as having 'derailed the proceedings' with no control over over-the-top elements. Language suggests clear disappointment with execution. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes both the lead performance and the direction, describing the show as 'preposterous' and 'over-the-top'. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a low confidence negative score. | Gemini: The review criticizes McTeer's performance and Von Stuelpnagel's direction, stating that the proceedings have been derailed. The overall tone is negative, indicating a lack of recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers strong criticism of both the direction ('derailed the proceedings') and lead performance ('never varies much'), using harsh language like 'preposterous' and 'rough edges.' However, with only a single curated excerpt available, the full verdict remains uncertain.",
