  "dtliExcerpt": "Bernhardt’s audacious act on both stage and film — then a work of creative sedition that caused critics and patriarchs to splutter with righteous indignation — is the topic of playwright Theresa Rebeck’s lively, weaponized, often confusing and richly caustic new Broadway play, “Bernhardt/Hamlet,” now by the Roundabout Theatre Company with the remarkable classical actress Janet McTeer in the leading role. When the play sticks to the words that reside on the marquee — that would be “Bernhardt-slash-Hamlet” — the work is a fascinating reminder that before any social change becomes mainstream, someone has to be a pioneer, and that someone often twists painfully in a storm until there’s enough supportive wind beneath her wings. So it went with the French-born Bernhardt, who leveraged her own singular stardom to make her Hamlet possible, reminding us that the previously empowered often are in the best spot to do seditious stuff. But only if, like Bernhardt, they have enough guts.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Perhaps everyone was worried that would have limited the play's appeal, rendering it nerdy and overly Shakespearean. Come on, it's only the greatest play, ever. I say it would only have deepened its truths, and it would have freed McTeer in the process.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite calling the play 'often confusing,' the critic uses positive descriptors like 'lively,' 'weaponized,' 'richly caustic,' and 'fascinating,' with strong praise for McTeer's performance. However, confidence is low due to truncated text. | GPT-4o: The review describes the play as 'lively, weaponized, often confusing and richly caustic,' indicating a mix of positive and negative elements. The excerpt praises the thematic elements but also suggests complexity and potential confusion, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"lively\", \"weaponized\", \"fascinating reminder\", but also includes \"often confusing\". Given the limited excerpt, it seems like a positive review with reservations. | Kimi: The critic praises Janet McTeer as 'remarkable' and the historical subject as 'fascinating,' but explicitly calls the play 'often confusing' and implies it works best only when focused on its central premise, indicating a qualified recommendation.",
