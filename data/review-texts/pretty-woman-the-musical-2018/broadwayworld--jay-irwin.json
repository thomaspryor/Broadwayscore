  "bwwExcerpt": "The story of the film shouldn't work, but with the writing of J.F. Lawton and the direction of the incomparable Garry Marshall it does. So, it's no surprise that the book of the musical is lifted almost verbatim from the screenplay. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. But then there are the songs from Adams and Vallance. A less inspiring bunch of pop pablum I haven't heard in a while. Utterly forgettable and not a one of them moves any part of the story along. Dolby Theater - Los Angeles, CA",
