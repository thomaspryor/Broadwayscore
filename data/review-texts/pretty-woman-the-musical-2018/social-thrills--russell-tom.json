  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Pretty Woman: The Musical\" shows off the right curves for the soft rock concert you'll want to spend the evening with. The songs are well produced and performed like a rock concert. But only a few will have an everlasting effect that can connect with the audience on a personal level.
