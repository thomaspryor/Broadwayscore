  "bwwExcerpt": "Stepping into Julia Roberts's leather boots, Samantha Barks, from the 'Les Misérables' film, is agreeable as Vivian, and Andy Karl-who proved how well he could play charming assholes in 'Groundhog Day'-is an appealingly handsome Edward. The bright spots, though, come from the supporting cast, including Eric Anderson, double cast as Barney and a street vender selling maps to the stars, and Orfeh, who, as Kit, actually seems to be having fun. But it's clear that the all-male creative team hasn't interrogated the story, beyond selling T-shirts that pair the title with phrases like 'Funny Woman' and 'Strong Woman.'",
