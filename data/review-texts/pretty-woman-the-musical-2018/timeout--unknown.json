  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Ms. Barks is clearly a talented singer and actress...she has been given no chance to banish stardust memories of the woman who created her part. Directed and choreographed as if on automatic pilot by Jerry Mitchell. Its creators have hewed suffocatingly close to the film’s story, gags, and dialogue...Mostly, Ms. Barks conducts herself like a peppy, tomboyish cutup from a sitcom. She often doesn’t seem entirely at ease, but her discomfort is nothing compared to Mr. Karl’s.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt criticizes the lead performer as uncomfortable and sitcom-like, pans the direction as 'automatic pilot,' and faults the adaptation for being suffocatingly close to the source. However, single excerpt warning applies - the full review verdict may differ from this negative sample. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the direction and choreography as uninspired and suggests the performances fail to overcome comparisons to the original. The tone is negative, but due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is mostly negative, criticizing the direction, choreography, and adherence to the film. While acknowledging the actress's talent, it ultimately suggests a disappointing experience. | Kimi: While acknowledging the lead's talent, the critic pans the direction as mechanical and the adaptation as suffocatingly faithful to the film, noting the performers' visible discomfort.",
