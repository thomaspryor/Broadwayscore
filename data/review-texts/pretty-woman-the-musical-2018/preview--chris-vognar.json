  "bwwExcerpt": "The biggest problem, not just with this production but the musical, is that the songs aren't terribly inspired. Written by '80s power ballad belter Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance, they too often feel flat and extraneous. This isn't always their fault. Ideally, a musical gives way from dialog to song when emotions overwhelm the characters to the extent that they must sing. Nobody seems very overwhelmed here; as a result, too many of the musical numbers feel like padding.",
