  "showScoreExcerpt": "“A charming piece of romantic theater with a serviceable pop score by Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance...This is a reproduction of the film, with songs and dance numbers added...I doubt if anyone is going to remember most of the music...The individual numbers are enjoyable for what they are – pleasant interludes...There are not many magical moments in ‘Pretty Woman’ but there are enough pleasing moments to guarantee you a night of relaxed fun.”\n\nRead more",
