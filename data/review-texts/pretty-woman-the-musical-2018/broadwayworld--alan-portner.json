  "bwwExcerpt": "This incarnation faithfully follows the plotline of the 1990 romantic comedy starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. It surprises in that its outrageous premise works after adding all the Broadway razzmatazz. \"Pretty Woman The Musical\" is a theatrical anachronism in many ways. It works particularly well as a fun evening measured against the political and social turmoil that swirls the country more than thirty years following the film version.
