  "bwwExcerpt": "The oddest thing about Pretty Woman is that it does all the things it needs to do badly, and the rare moments it skis off-piste away from the movie's central storyline are done so well. Such moments are rare and Bracco, the show's breakout star, features in every one-hence the deserved audience acclaim he and Thompson receive at the curtain call.",
