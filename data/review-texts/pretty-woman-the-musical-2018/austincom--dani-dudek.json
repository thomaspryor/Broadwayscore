  "bwwExcerpt": "As Kit De Luca , Jessica Crouch performs the most powerhouse vocals in the show. She is outstanding and a joy to watch on stage. The role of the bellhop isn't a lead, but that doesn't stop Michael Dalke from making this character one of our faves. I'd tell you to keep your eye on him when he's in scenes, but honestly, I don't need to tell you that.",
