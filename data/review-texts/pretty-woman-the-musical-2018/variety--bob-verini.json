  "bwwExcerpt": "There's also no doubt about anyone's frame of mind, since the country-tinged pop numbers consistently announce each singer's subtext. Though the lyrics teem with cliche, the cast gives its all to sell them, starting with the vocally confident Barks and Karl. Orfeh's Kit - all gospel-worthy pipes and Jersey Shore attitude - is utterly tangential to the story but welcome in every appearance...An iconic movie bids to become 'My Fair Lady of the Evening,' but isn't quite so loverly.",
