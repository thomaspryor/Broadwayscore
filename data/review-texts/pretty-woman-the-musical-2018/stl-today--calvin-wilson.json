  "bwwExcerpt": "With a few exceptions, such as Vivian's statement of intent \"Anywhere but Here,\" the songs by Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance are little more than serviceable. And the book by Garry Marshall and J.F. Lawton is cribbed too heavily from the film, which Marshall directed and Lawton wrote. Not much has been done to rethink the story for the stage. And it might be argued that, in the #MeToo era, the whole premise is woefully dated.",
