  "bwwExcerpt": "Pretty Woman doesn't quite work as a musical. Or, at least, not this musical. There are a couple of numbers that work well enough (Barks' heartfelt 'This is My Life,' for example). But overall, the songs by Bryan Adams (yes, that Bryan Adams) and Jim Vallance feel uninspired, a little cheesy (again, that Bryan Adams), and lifeless - try as they might to rev them up with Bon Jovi-esque guitar power chords. The lyrics can be downright lazy. For the record, any song that contains the line 'For the first time I can see...' should be banned from Broadway from this moment into perpetuity.",
