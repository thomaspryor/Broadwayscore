  "bwwExcerpt": "Adam Pascal and Olivia Valli give excellent performances as Edward and Vivian. They have chemistry that works in the theater. Jessica Crouch is a corker as Vivian's sassy best friend, Kit De Luca. Kyle Taylor Parker shines as the narrator known as the Happy Man, who morphs into the very different but equally wise hotel manager, Mr. Thompson. Matthew Stocke hits the mark precisely as Edward's unsavory lawyer, Philip Stuckey. Shea's Performing Arts Center - Buffalo, NY",
