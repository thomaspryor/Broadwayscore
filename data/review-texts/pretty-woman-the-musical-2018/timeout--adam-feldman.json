Describes the show as committee-assembled with serviceable songs and shallow book - standard negative review language without being a complete pan. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as lacking depth and having only serviceable songs, aligning with the critic's original rating of 40, indicating a negative assessment. | Gemini: The critic explicitly states the show feels 'assembled by committee' and that the songs are 'serviceable' and the book adds 'little depth'. The critic's rating of 40 confirms a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 40/100 aligns with negative descriptors like 'assembled by committee' and 'serviceable' songs, indicating the production falls short of Broadway standards without being a complete disaster.",
