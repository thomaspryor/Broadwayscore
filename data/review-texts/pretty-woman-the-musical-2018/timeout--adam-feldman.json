  "bwwExcerpt": "The cast makes the most of what Pretty Woman allows them. The winsome Barks, who played Éponine in the movie Les Misérables, sings very well and has a believable connection with Karl, who undersells his sexiness wisely. Orfeh provides sass and power vocals as Vivian's best friend, and Jason Danieley is a solidly smarmy villain; Eric Anderson injects humor and showmanship into his dual roles as a street-singing narrator and a benevolent hotel manager. But although it is capably staged, the show has no reason to exist beyond, one assumes, a desire to make money by pimping out a familiar property. Broadway can do better than the same old tricks.",

Describes the show as committee-assembled with serviceable songs and shallow book - standard negative review language without being a complete pan. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as lacking depth and having only serviceable songs, aligning with the critic's original rating of 40, indicating a negative assessment. | Gemini: The critic explicitly states the show feels 'assembled by committee' and that the songs are 'serviceable' and the book adds 'little depth'. The critic's rating of 40 confirms a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 40/100 aligns with negative descriptors like 'assembled by committee' and 'serviceable' songs, indicating the production falls short of Broadway standards without being a complete disaster.",
