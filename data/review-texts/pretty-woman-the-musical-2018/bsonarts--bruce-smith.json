  "showScoreExcerpt": "“This musical adaptation...holds pretty close to the plot of the original...But as any number of flops...have illustrated, that transfer is very tricky...’Pretty Woman’ lacks...imagination and creativity...Both of the leads do everything they can to make their characters credible without a script that reveals why they are attracted to each other and how that attraction transforms them...What was once charming and engaging in the movie theatre has become mediocre and bland.”\n\nRead more",
