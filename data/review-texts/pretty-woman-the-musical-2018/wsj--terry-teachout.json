The 'well-intentioned' and 'pleasant' qualifiers don't overcome the fundamental criticism that it fails dramatically. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'dramatically inert' and the songs as 'pleasant but unmemorable', indicating a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review states the show is \"dramatically inert\" and the songs are \"unmemorable\", indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic offers faint praise ('well-intentioned,' 'pleasant') but ultimately pans the production as dramatically ineffective with forgettable songs, indicating a show that fails to engage.",
