  "bwwExcerpt": "The ensemble is outstanding. With a nod to diversity, the multiple ethnicities represented contain some outstanding voices, particularly the duo who sing the duet from La Traviata, Christian Douglas and Amma Osei. And especially Trent Soyster as Guilio, who all but steals the show with his rubber band body and excellent comedic timing. Matthew Stocke is appropriately smarmy as the slimy lawyer played by Jason Alexander in the movie. Durham Performing Arts Center - Durham, NC",
