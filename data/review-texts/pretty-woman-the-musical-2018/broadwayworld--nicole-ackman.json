  "bwwExcerpt": "In many ways, the musical is a poor imitation of the film with its generic musical theater pop songs and generic musical theater dance. (There is one standout dance scene in which the hotel manager Mr. Thompson teaches Vivian to ballroom dance with the help of the hotel staff.) The show tries to recreate the iconic costumes and famous lines of the movie, but the way in which the jewelry box moment falls flat seems indicative of the rest of the show.
