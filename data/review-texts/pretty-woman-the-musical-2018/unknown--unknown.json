  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Ms. Barks is clearly a talented singer and actress...she has been given no chance to banish stardust memories of the woman who created her part. Directed and choreographed as if on automatic pilot by Jerry Mitchell. Its creators have hewed suffocatingly close to the film’s story, gags, and dialogue...Mostly, Ms. Barks conducts herself like a peppy, tomboyish cutup from a sitcom. She often doesn’t seem entirely at ease, but her discomfort is nothing compared to Mr. Karl’s.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite acknowledging the lead's talent, the critic finds major flaws in direction ('automatic pilot'), adaptation choices ('suffocatingly close'), and performances ('discomfort', 'doesn't seem entirely at ease'). The overall assessment is clearly negative. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights significant criticism of the direction and performance discomfort, suggesting a negative view. However, the single excerpt limits confidence in fully capturing the review's sentiment. | Gemini: The review excerpt is mostly negative, criticizing the direction, choreography, and the lead actress's performance. The overall tone suggests a lack of originality and discomfort. | Kimi: While acknowledging Barks' innate talent, the excerpt criticizes the direction as uninspired ('automatic pilot'), the adaptation as suffocatingly faithful to the film, and both lead performances as uneasy and uncomfortable.",
