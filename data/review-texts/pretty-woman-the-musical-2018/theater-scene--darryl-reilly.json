  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A lackluster stage treatment that is dull from start to finish...Adams and Vallance’s pop score is a bland compendium of long-winded ballads, mediocre production numbers, and wan character songs. There are some soaring melodies but the lyrics are uninspired...The book is a leaden reinvention of the material as a Broadway musical.
