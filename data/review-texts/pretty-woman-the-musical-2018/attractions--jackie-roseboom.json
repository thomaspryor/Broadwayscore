  "bwwExcerpt": "All in all, it's a sexy, fun, and feel-good musical about two damaged people finding and making each other better humans. Oh, don't worry, the whole ensemble joins in at the end for a sing-a-long of Roy Orbison's \"Oh, Pretty Woman\". PS. My 23-year-old son has seen the original movie, but isn't into romantic movies like I am. He thought the musical was just OK. Kravis Center for the Performing Arts - West Palm Beach, FL",
