  "showScoreExcerpt": "“A pale shadow of the film...with characters, dialogue, and songs that suggest something close to genuine human emotion, but never quite get there...The musical is too safe...Baldly simplistic and predictable, every cliché is employed...”Pretty Woman’ features a painfully uninspired new score, a largely Xeroxed script, no romance, and a gaudy and cheap-looking production entirely devoid of emotion or entertainment. Turning this film into a stage musical was a big mistake. Huge.”\n\nRead more",
