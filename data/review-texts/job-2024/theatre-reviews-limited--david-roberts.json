However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the actors' performances, suggesting a positive but incomplete review. Given the single excerpt and truncated nature, I'm scoring it as a low positive. | Kimi: Single curated excerpt offers mild praise for the performances ('authentic and believable'), but the text is truncated mid-sentence and lacks the review's full verdict or context.",
