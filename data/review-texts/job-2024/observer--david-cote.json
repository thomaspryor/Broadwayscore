However, single excerpt warning requires caution - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('cannot overpraise', 'snappy production', 'shivers down your spine'), indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a rave review. | Gemini: The critic uses strong positive language like \"cannot overpraise\" and describes the production as \"snappy\" and emotionally impactful, indicating a highly favorable review. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unambiguously enthusiastic praise ('cannot overpraise', 'sends shivers', 'tears down your cheeks'), indicating a strong recommendation, though single-excerpt limitations prevent higher confidence.",
