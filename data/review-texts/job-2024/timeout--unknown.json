    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it a 'galvanizing accomplishment' with directive to 'remember her name' indicates enthusiastic recommendation, but single excerpt limits confidence in full review assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as a 'galvanizing accomplishment,' suggesting strong praise and a must-see recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"galvanizing accomplishment\" and \"remember her name,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise describing the work as a 'galvanizing accomplishment' and urging readers to remember the playwright's name, indicating an enthusiastic recommendation despite the limited context of a single curated quote.",
