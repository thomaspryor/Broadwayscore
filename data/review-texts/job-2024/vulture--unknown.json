    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('hits as hard as it does', 'heroes we actually need') suggests enthusiastic recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness of full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is clearly positive, highlighting the play's impact and the relatable heroes. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the play's impact and the relatability of its characters, suggesting a positive overall assessment. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the language points to a recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the play's emotional impact and thematic resonance, calling it hard-hitting and praising its heroes as exactly what audiences need. As a single curated excerpt, the confidence is low, but the language clearly places it in the upper range of Positive.",
