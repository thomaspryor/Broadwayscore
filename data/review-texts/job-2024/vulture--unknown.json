    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('hits as hard as it does', 'heroes we actually need') suggests enthusiastic recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness of full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt presents a strong positive sentiment, emphasizing the impact and relevance of the play's characters. Despite the limited text, the enthusiastic tone suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses strong positive sentiment, describing the play as impactful and highlighting the relatable and necessary heroes at its core. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the play's emotional impact and relevance, describing it as hitting hard and featuring necessary heroes, though the single-quote limitation reduces confidence in the overall verdict.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "The first time I saw the play, crammed like a sardine right up near the performers at the SoHo Playhouse, the final moments left me with a sickly feeling like the space had filled with poison gas. I’m all for feel-bad theater, but if it’s not precisely concocted, you quickly develop an immunity. A few days after seeing Job then, the poison had passed through me, and I found myself not thinking much about the drama at all. Seeing Job again on Broadway, I didn’t experience the same queasiness when the twist arrived. Maybe the experience suffered because I didn’t have the same physical proximity to the performers. But I also sensed that the play, like a particular kind of internet edgelord, was throwing out shock value to protect itself from having to dig deeper.",
