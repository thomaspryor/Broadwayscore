  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "A new reading of The Crucible becomes both scary and liberating. Just as John Proctor is shown to be not the hero of Miller's play (but rather, for Shelby, the much be-knighted Abigail Williams), so Mr. Smith is shown to be far from the supportive teacher we and the girls may have thought. From Lee's menace and temper to shoulder-rubbing memories of Ivy's \"gross\" dad, the evidence of patriarchal abuses in the everyday fabric of their lives become apparent to the young women.",

However, this is only one curated excerpt, so confidence is low and the verdict may not represent the full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'scary and liberating,' suggesting a positive reinterpretation. However, due to the single curated quote, the confidence is low, and the score is at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive reinterpretation of the play, highlighting its impact. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the production as effectively reframing the classic play to reveal patriarchal abuses, calling the result 'scary and liberating'—clearly positive evaluative language indicating an appreciative review.",
