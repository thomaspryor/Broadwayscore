    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows strong positive language ('engage and electrify') with broad audience appeal noted. However, confidence is low due to limited text - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a strong recommendation, highlighting the show's ability to engage and electrify both teenagers and adults. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show will \"engage and electrify\" audiences, which is a positive sentiment. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am placing it in the upper range of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers an unambiguous recommendation using strong positive language ('electrify'), suggesting the show successfully connects with audiences rather than being cynical commercial fare. However, confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "It’s muscle-tensing and entertaining, particularly in the play’s middle stretch, to watch a meeting of two differently melted minds. And satisfying when Loyd pokes at Jane’s hypocrisies and delusions, her conviction that she’s nothing and also an online martyr – “It’s a privilege to suffer as much as I do,” she says. Still, Friedlich’s line-by-line writing is shrewd enough to convey Jane’s internal hell of self-reflective mirrors, her spiral of judgment to nowhere. Job is, for the most part, a tonal highwire act that wisely keeps to a taut 80 minutes. Or perhaps the more accurate metaphor is trapeze – swinging wildly between farce, zeitgeist-y drama and thriller. Somehow, it lands most of the tricks, including a turn toward the pitch-black in the final act, which ends just before it runs this tight battle of wills and expertise off the rails. Job smartly knows when to log off; there may be no grand messages (and thank God), but this is one of the more insightful internet spirals.",
