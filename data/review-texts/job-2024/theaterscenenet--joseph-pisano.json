    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describing the show as 'rare' and 'genuinely rewarding' suggests strong positive assessment, but confidence is low due to lack of full review context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a strong recommendation, indicating the show is exceptional enough to warrant seeing multiple times. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is strongly positive, suggesting a recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt contains strong praise suggesting exceptional quality and rewatchability, warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket per the single-excerpt scoring guidelines, though limited context prevents Rave classification.",
