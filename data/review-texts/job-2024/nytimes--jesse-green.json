By comparison, “The Patient,” the FX series starring Steve Carell as a psychiatrist held hostage, seems like a model of earned dramatic tension. The tension of “Job” feels merely gratuitous.",

  "wrongFullText": "How long would you like to spend with a psychopath?\n\nIf 80 minutes sounds good, you can take my seat at the Helen Hayes Theater, where the extremely effective, often funny and quasi-sadistic “Job” opened on Tuesday. I’ll just tiptoe away.\n\nBut if you’re not a fan of relentless thrillers, you’re likely to feel that the gun the psychopath is aiming at her shrink when the lights come up — and keeps handy for the entirety of their supersized session — is really aimed at you.\n\nAdmittedly, the shrink would quibble with my diagnosis: Jane, the patient, is probably not a psychopath. Or not just. Having apparently swallowed the D.S.M.-5 whole, she at various times displays symptoms of paranoia, post-traumatic stress, obsessive-compulsive disorder, narcissism and snark. In layman’s terms, a real piece of work.\n\nAnd work is why the 20-something Jane has come to see the 60-something Loyd, a psychiatrist with expertise in desperate cases like hers. Having recently been put on leave from her position at a Bay Area tech company — a video of her standing on a desk screaming at co-workers went viral — she needs his sign-off to return to her job.\n\nBringing a gun to a mandated therapy session does not seem like putting one’s best foot forward. But the play, by Max Wolf Friedlich, labors to make Jane, or at least her job, sympathetic. She works in “user care” — a euphemism for content moderation, itself a euphemism for the removal of violent, disgusting and often criminal material from the internet.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access."
