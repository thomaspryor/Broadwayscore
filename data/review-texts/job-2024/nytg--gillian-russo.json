  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "I could be jaded about John Proctor is the Villain and nitpick how some major developments get revealed abruptly for plot's sake, how the male characters are broadly drawn archetypes known all too well in both fiction and reality: the charming predator, the obvious creep, the well-meaning dolt. But John Proctor seems to know that. It also knows it's a reclamation of age-old stories by intelligent, thoughtful young women whose views of themselves and others are nonetheless a work in progress.",
