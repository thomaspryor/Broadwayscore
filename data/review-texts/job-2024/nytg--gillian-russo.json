  "bwwExcerpt": "Though superbly acted and unrelentingly tense under Michael Herwitz's direction, that conversation reveals little food for long-term thought beneath its slick veneer. The most interesting theme — one of many that, for better or for worse, make Job feel less like a period piece and right at home in 2024 — revolves around responsibility and action: Jane believes her job as an online content moderator, viewing and destroying disturbing media, is as essential as that of a frontline worker, which she relishes. It forces her to actually sit with the world's evils and do something more meaningful about them than shouting into the void of Twitter (I'm not calling it X) and the like. It gives her power, she says.",
