    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong positive language ('brilliantly tied up', 'genuinely thrilling', 'heady rush of glee', 'leaves you happy you came') suggests enthusiastic recommendation. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as a 'heady rush' that leaves the viewer 'happy you came', indicating strong enthusiasm and a must-see recommendation. The single excerpt warning suggests using the upper end of the bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, describing the play as a \"genuinely thrilling\" experience that leaves the reviewer \"happy\" they came. This warrants a score in the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt describes a visceral, positive theatrical experience with words like 'brilliantly' and 'genuinely thrilling,' concluding that the viewer is 'happy you came,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence remains low regarding the full review's overall verdict.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Whether or not the audience will be up to the challenge is a larger question. While the tension remains when the gun goes away, the show slowly oozes out information like an IV drip. At times, the show’s desire to remain obtuse gets in its own way. But, unlike its other less-successful, black-mirroresque peers, I promise Job’s final rattling, supreme reveal is worth it.",
