  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "There's a moment in the play featuring a song by Lorde that elicited in me a dizzy gasp, then an eye-roll, then gave way to a moment of catharsis. In one gesture, it brilliantly tied up the play's themes, aesthetics and narratives in a genuinely thrilling way, while getting me to consider a long-beloved favorite in a new light. John Proctor Is the Villain is much like that: a heady rush of glee, shock and understanding that takes you by surprise, and leaves you happy you came.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong positive language ('brilliantly tied up', 'genuinely thrilling', 'heady rush of glee', 'leaves you happy you came') suggests enthusiastic recommendation. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as a 'heady rush' that leaves the viewer 'happy you came', indicating strong enthusiasm and a must-see recommendation. The single excerpt warning suggests using the upper end of the bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, describing the play as a \"genuinely thrilling\" experience that leaves the reviewer \"happy\" they came. This warrants a score in the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt describes a visceral, positive theatrical experience with words like 'brilliantly' and 'genuinely thrilling,' concluding that the viewer is 'happy you came,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence remains low regarding the full review's overall verdict.",
