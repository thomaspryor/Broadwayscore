    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies - this curated quote praises 'subtle brilliance' of writing/direction and notes excellent pacing. Since this sounds clearly positive and is likely cherry-picked, scoring upper end of Positive bucket, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the writing and direction as 'subtle brilliance' and notes the seamless experience of the runtime, indicating a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the upper end of the Positive range is used. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the writing and direction, indicating a positive experience. The phrase \"subtle brilliance\" suggests a strong positive sentiment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the writing ('subtle brilliance') and direction (pacing that makes runtime unnoticeable), indicating a strong recommendation. However, confidence is low as only a single curated excerpt is available, which may not represent the full review's verdict.",
