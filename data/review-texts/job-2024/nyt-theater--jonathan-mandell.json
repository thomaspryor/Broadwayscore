With only one excerpt available, the confidence is low, but the sentiment is clearly negative. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the play sacrifices its potential for theatrics, which suggests a negative assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the show for abandoning intellectual substance in favor of cheap thrills, indicating the production fails to achieve its dramatic ambitions. With only one curated excerpt available, the full verdict may contain additional nuance.",
