Single excerpt warning applied with upper-range scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges some shortcomings but ultimately describes the production as a 'stunner', indicating a strong positive recommendation despite reservations. | Gemini: The review states that despite shortcomings, the production is a stunner. This indicates a positive recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the production has 'shortcomings' and room for improvement, the use of 'stunner' as a final verdict and praise for the lead performance indicates a clear recommendation in the upper-positive range.",
