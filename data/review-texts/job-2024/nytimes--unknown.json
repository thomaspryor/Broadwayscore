    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses skepticism about the show's approach to drama and trauma, suggesting a mixed or uncertain response. Without more context, it's unclear if the review leans positive or negative overall. | Gemini: The single quote expresses doubt about the effectiveness of the dramatic approach, suggesting a negative assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt expresses skepticism about the show's methodology, questioning if the traumatic material is worth the dramatic catharsis. This indicates significant reservations rather than a clear recommendation, placing it in Mixed territory. Confidence is low due to limited excerpt availability and truncation.",
