However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a significant issue with the show's premise, suggesting a negative experience. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers strong criticism of the show's writing/book, finding the central premise blatantly improbable. With only one curated excerpt available, the overall verdict may differ, but the excerpt indicates a negative assessment.",
