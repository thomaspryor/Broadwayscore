However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes a scene as \"deeply satisfying,\" indicating a positive experience. Given that this is the only excerpt available, confidence is low, but the positive sentiment suggests a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for a specific scene, calling it among the most deeply satisfying on Broadway this season, indicating a strong recommendation. As this is a single curated excerpt, confidence is low.",
