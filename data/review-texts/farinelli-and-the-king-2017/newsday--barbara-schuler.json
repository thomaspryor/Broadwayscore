  "bwwExcerpt": "Really, though, this is a play about the curative qualities of music. While it would be satisfying enough to simply embrace Rylance's mastery and the glorious works of (mostly) Handel, there is a more significant message, one well documented by research but perhaps more valid to theater lovers in the soaring popularity of 'You Will Be Found' from 'Dear Evan Hansen.' Bullied, anxious, depressed? Music can make you feel better.",
