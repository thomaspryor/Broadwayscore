  "bwwExcerpt": "It may contain arias from obscure Baroque operas and candlelit chandeliers, but the play is, at heart, a straightforward and sentimental 'bromance,' one in which Farinelli is willing to give up adoring audiences all over Europe to serve at the king's command. It is also a celebration of the power of music to overcome emotional and mental instability. Rylance, who excels at playing sad and strange characters, gives a full-bodied and endearing performance that combines volatile behavior and over-the-top comedy with gentle contemplation. As it turns out, van Kampen, who also did the musical arrangements, and Rylance are married, so it's no wonder that 'Farinelli and the King' is so specifically suited to their talents.",
