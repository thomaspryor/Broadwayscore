  "bwwExcerpt": "Davies's singing provides most of the high notes in this otherwise workmanlike play. The nature of the central musical therapy is barely explored; instead, we get contrived court intrigue, low comedy about English theater, a rushed quasiromance and an equally hasty coda, delivered in a steady march of flat-footed exposition. 'I'm telling you this as the King's chief minister,' says the King's chief minister. 'As the King's doctor, I am of the opinion that the King's illness has turned,' says the King's doctor. 'As the King's second wife I am unpopular,' says the queen (a bland Melody Grove). The pleasures of John Dove's production-the music, Rylance's halting propulsion, Jonathan Fensom's sumptuous sets and costumes-gleam to no purpose, real jewels glued to a trinket crown.",
