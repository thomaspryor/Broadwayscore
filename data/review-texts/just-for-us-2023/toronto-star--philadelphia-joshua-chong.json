  "bwwExcerpt": "Objectively speaking, John O’Farrell’s Live Aid retrospective doesn’t stand out among the sea of jukebox musicals that wash up on our shores these days. His dialogue is often trite. The characters come across as one-dimensional, cardboard cut-outs. And the songs (including hits such as “Dancing in the Streets,” “My Generation” and “All You Need Is Love”) aren’t integrated with the story so much as they’re body checked into the plot.",
