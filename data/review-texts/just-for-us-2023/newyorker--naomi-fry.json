    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic uses clearly positive language ('bracingly political', 'manages to be') and praises the show's balance of humor and depth. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as both 'deeply personal' and 'bracingly political', highlighting its ability to be 'funny and unsettling in equal measure'. This suggests a strong positive assessment, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as \"deeply personal and bracingly political\" and \"funny and unsettling\", which suggests a positive recommendation. Given that it is only one excerpt, I am scoring on the higher end of the bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise, describing the show as 'deeply personal,' 'bracingly political,' and successfully balancing humor with unsettling themes. However, confidence is low given only a single curated excerpt is available.",
