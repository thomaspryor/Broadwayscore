    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language with 'thoughtful', 'nuanced', and praise for achieving both personal depth and universal appeal. Single excerpt warning means caution needed, but the tone is clearly appreciative - upper end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'thoughtful' and 'nuanced', indicating a positive assessment. The caution about single excerpt suggests using the upper end of the Positive range if clearly positive. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"thoughtful, nuanced exploration\" and \"universally relatable\", suggesting a positive recommendation. However, as only one excerpt is available, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the show's thematic depth and universal accessibility, placing it in the upper range of Positive, though the single curated excerpt limits confidence.",

  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "It's Groff's energy and charisma that anchor Just in Time. The brilliance of the show's opening is that, by creating a staged-concert atmosphere from the start, it frees us from the need to compare him to Darin and instead foregrounds Groff's own passion for telling his story. Groff even concludes the evening with an unexpectedly eloquent tribute to the evanescent yet transcendent power of theater. How rare it is for a jukebox bio-musical to feel like it comes genuinely from the heart.",
