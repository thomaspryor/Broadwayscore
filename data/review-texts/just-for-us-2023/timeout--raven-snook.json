    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt focuses on positive elements (plentiful laughs, master of callbacks, funniest jokes) and describes Edelman's comedic skills favorably. However, with only one curated excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the abundance of laughs and praises Edelman's comedic skills, suggesting a positive experience. However, the focus on comedy over catharsis implies some reservations, leading to a mid-range positive score. | Gemini: The review highlights the plentiful laughs and Edelman's comedic skills, suggesting a positive experience, but also notes the lack of catharsis, indicating a reservation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring conservatively.",
