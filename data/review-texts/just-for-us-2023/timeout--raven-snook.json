Comedian Alex Edelman learned that lesson firsthand a few years back when he infiltrated a meeting of white nationalists in Queens. A favorite at international Fringe festivals, Edelman is known for being sharp-witted but rarely political; his fright night with the alt-right was ostensibly inspired by a barrage of anti-Semitic tweets—and a colleague who nagged him to take a stand in his stand-up—but surely also by the promise of hilarious potential material in store.\n\nThat promise is kept in Just for Us, in which his account of reactionary repartee serves as a framing device for a deeper dive into questions of identity and the limits of empathy. Edleman deftly interweaves disparate tales about his Israeli Olympian brother, an unkosher Christmas, Jared Kushner and religion-based vaccine hesitancy into a portrait of the entertainer as a young Jewish man in a polarized society. But he does this without pulling any punchlines: The laughs are plentiful. Despite the incendiary issues lurking at the edges of his tale, Just for Us is more focused on comedy than catharsis. Edelman is a master of callbacks, and his funniest jokes are accented with wonderful bulging eyes.\n\nEdelman performed Just for Us Off Broadway last year. It's a mitzvah that the show has now moved to Broadway for a summer engagement, so more audiences can sit with his uncomfortable truths in a time of increasing anti-Semitic hate. Under Adam Brace's well-calibrated direction, and employing just one mic and three stools, Edelman conjures a roomful of enemies he naively believes he can charm. They don't succumb, of course, but theatergoers do.\n\nHudson Theatre (Broadway). By Alex Edelman. Directed by Adam Brace. With Edelman. Running time: 1hr 30mins. No intermission.\n\nFollow Raven Snook on Twitter: @ravensnookFollow Time Out Theater on Twitter: @TimeOutTheaterKeep up with the latest news and reviews on our Time Out Theater Facebook page\n\nBeen there, done that?

However, with only one curated excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the abundance of laughs and praises Edelman's comedic skills, suggesting a positive experience. However, the focus on comedy over catharsis implies some reservations, leading to a mid-range positive score. | Gemini: The review highlights the plentiful laughs and Edelman's comedic skills, suggesting a positive experience, but also notes the lack of catharsis, indicating a reservation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring conservatively.",
