  "fullText": "Broadway has a great tradition of Jewish comedians, especially the late Jackie Mason, whose hilarious solo shows from “The Prune Danish” to “The Ultimate Jew” I covered for decades, blown raspberries, flailing arms, jumping shoulders and all.\n\nWhen Mason’s material hit the danger zone, which it often did, Mason would protect himself by sweetly noting “I say this with the greatest respect,” as accompanied by his famously cheeky and disarming smile.\n\nAlex Edelman in JUST (Matthew Murphy)\n\nEnter now Alex Edelman, a Jewish comedian of a much-younger generation whose very funny new solo show at the Hudson Theatre, “Just For Us,” has one foot in that great Mason history and another in the tradition of Mike Birbiglia, another cheerfully geeky Broadway performer who is generally seen as more of a storyteller than merely someone who stands up and cracks jokes.\n\nLike Birbiglia, who is one of Edelman’s producers and confidantes, Edelman structures his show around an event at once ordinary and bizarre. In the case of “Just For Us,” which opened Monday night, that would be his uninvited attendance — he grew up as an Orthodox Jew — at a meeting of tawdry white supremacists in Queens.\n\nAlex Edelman in \"Just for Us.\" (Matthew Murphy)\n\nAs he takes us through that night in real time — will these fools discern the interloper from the yeshiva in their midst? Should he try and change minds? Is it OK for him to flirt with the cute girl named Chelsea? — he talks of his childhood in “the racist part of Boston known as Boston” and gently mines the flash points between Jewish rules (by definition illiberal) and Jewish values, which make up for that and also promote a more ethical world.\n\nAnd, as befits the times, he makes it very clear that Jews do not, in his mind, enjoy so-called white privilege.\n\nMost comics who like longer narratives do one of two things. The great Scottish comedian Billy Connolly and the late monologist Spalding Gray used to keep several stories of equal weight in the air, wrapping them all up only at the end. Edelman’s one-act show keeps the one big story functioning like a river with numerous tributaries, allowing him to temporarily divert his boat into all kinds of wacky Jewish waters and then return, calling out where he has been before. It’s very clever and very funny.\n\nAt various points, Edelman hints at a personal history of neurodivergence, or at least of authority figures trying in vain to medicate away his personality, which the audience immediately clocks as far more interesting than most. Certainly, he’s a highly physical performer who bounces all over the stage and whose vocal and physical energy never flags; he’s not the type to stand still in front of a microphone and yet he achieves an easy intimacy. I suspect if this Broadway show does well this summer, as it surely should, he will be back.\n\nAlex Edelman stars in one-man show \"Just for Us.\" (Matthew Murphy)\n\nEdelman first found fame on the U.K. comedy circuit and he has been writing of late for BBC Radio comedy shows or, as he puts it, “podcasts for the dying.”\n\nAs such, he does write and tell actual jokes, far more explicitly than Birbiglia. “Dumb jokes,” by his own description.\n\nThese gags are often hilarious. My favorites were the gentle jabs at his brother, Adam, a four-time Israeli national champion in the bobsled-like skeleton event. ”Shul Runnings,” or “The Frozen Chosen” are what Alex calls his brother’s team.\n\nSilly, sure, but humanizing at the same time.",
