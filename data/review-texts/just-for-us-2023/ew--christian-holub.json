  "bwwExcerpt": "The core of Just For Us is Edelman unwinding this central story of what happened at that meeting, interspersed with frequent tangents about his life and upbringing in a religiously observant Jewish family from Boston. Though similar to a stand-up comedy routine, Just For Us' focus on this meeting gives it a theatrical aura worthy of the Hudson Theatre (especially when Edelman assembles stools on stage to mimic the semicircle formation he remembers), and there's a lot of physicality with the performer running back and forth. He's an energetic, self-deprecating raconteur whose stories are also quite thought-provoking.",

  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "When Just In Time does conclude, it goes out with an exuberant bang, and though the vapor forms, it's clear that this is a show guaranteed to linger... whether it be the toe-tapping tunes, the memory of Groff's enthralling presence, or a certain thought, sure to cross your mind on the way out: \"When can I see it again?"
