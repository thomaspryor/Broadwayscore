    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Calls it Sondheim's 'masterpiece' and a 'handsome revival' with Zeta-Jones making a 'commanding' debut, but qualifies her vocals as 'more stylish than stirring.' Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds mildly positive with reservations, so scored at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Zeta-Jones' performance and describes the revival as 'handsome,' indicating a positive view. However, the mention of her vocals being 'more stylish than stirring' suggests some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, a score at the lower end of the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The review praises Zeta-Jones' performance and calls the revival 'handsome,' but notes her vocals are 'more stylish than stirring,' indicating a reservation. Given the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Zeta-Jones's commanding stage presence and the handsome production values, but includes a specific reservation about her vocal performance being more stylish than emotionally stirring, suggesting a qualified recommendation.",
