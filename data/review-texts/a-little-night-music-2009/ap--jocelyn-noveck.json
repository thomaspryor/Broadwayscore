  "bwwExcerpt": "She and Stritch, a fellow Tony winner, are making a welcome return. When Stritch sings of failing standards in 'Liaisons,' she's not talking about acting (well, not in the traditional sense) but one can't help extrapolating a bit. 'Where is style?' she asks. 'Where is skill?' 'Where's passion in the art, where's craft?' Here's one place you can look: Right at her, onstage at the Walter Kerr Theatre.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt strongly praises the lead performance with 'welcome return' and positions the performer as embodying the 'style,' 'skill,' and 'craft' the show seeks. However, this is only a single curated excerpt focused on one performer, so confidence is low and the verdict may not represent the full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performance of Stritch, suggesting a strong recommendation to see the show. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Stritch's performance and suggests the audience can find skill and passion in her work, indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper range of 'Positive'. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Elaine Stritch's 'welcome return' and identifies her as an exemplar of theatrical craft and passion, clearly recommending attendance specifically for her star turn.",
