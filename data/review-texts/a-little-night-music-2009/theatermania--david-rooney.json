    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('sumptuous feast', 'splendid') with no visible caveats, but confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - the full review verdict may differ from this curated quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as a 'sumptuous feast' and highlights Catherine Zeta-Jones's 'splendid' debut, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"sumptuous feast\" and \"splendid Broadway debut,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic superlatives ('sumptuous feast', 'splendid') indicating strong praise for both the production and lead performance. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence remains low regarding the full review's overall sentiment.",
