  "bwwExcerpt": "This being the first Broadway revival of 'A Little Night Music,' I get the feeling that many felt as if it should have been bigger and brighter and more expensive, rather like the Lincoln Center Theater revival of 'South Pacific.' Nevertheless, on the whole, this is a really beautiful production. And I do believe that many will find great satisfaction in it.",
