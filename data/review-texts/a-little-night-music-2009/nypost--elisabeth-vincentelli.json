  "fullText": "Bernadette Peters (with Alexander Hanson) gives Sondheim's musical the finesse and coherence it lacked. \n Joan Marcus \n \n \n \n \n \n By stepping into the revival of Stephen Sondheim’s “A Little Night Music,” Berna dette Peters and Elaine Stritch are doing more than merely replacing Catherine Zeta-Jones and Angela Lansbury, respectively. They — especially Peters — have transformed the entire show. Trevor Nunn’s production felt murky and undernourished when it opened back in December. Now, a coherent whole has emerged.\n\nIf Mrs. Michael Douglas won a Tony for her one-note performance as charismatic theater actress Desirée Armfeldt, you’ve got to wonder what Peters should get. A Medal of Honor? The Nobel Prize?\n\nPeters creates a multifaceted woman strong enough to anchor Sondheim’s bittersweet comedy about romantic entanglements. She is the axle around which the show rotates, and her presence is felt even when she isn’t onstage.\n\nOf course, this Desirée remains the seductive, playful stage star she’s meant to be. But she isn’t young anymore, and is fully aware of the passage of time.\n\nBeing reunited with her old lover Fredrik Egerman (Alexander Hanson) prompts an avalanche of mixed emotions. It’s a rare pleasure to watch them all flicker on Peters’ face, to catch a sudden melancholy briefly cloud her gaze even as she unleashes her plentiful charms on her conquests.\n\nAnd her “Send in the Clowns” is one for the books, a masterpiece of interpretative finesse that should be retitled “Send in the Handkerchiefs.”\n\nLansbury was the best thing in the December cast, so the new Madame Armfeldt doesn’t have the same radical impact as the new Desirée. Still, Stritch is a hoot to watch, as always. She spits out her bon mots with acidic relish and turns “Liaisons” into a mesmerizingly bizarre experience halfway between storytelling and performance art.\n\nLike a rising tide lifting all boats, the newcomers have inspired the original cast to raise its game. Hanson, in particular, looks a lot more relaxed and isn’t afraid to sound menacingly wolfish in “Now,” while Erin Davie nails Charlotte’s sarcastic disenchantment.\n\nWith everybody firing on all cylinders, Nunn’s spare, twilit staging finally makes sense, and even the smallness of the orchestra feels appropriate. This is about presenting Sondheim’s sorry-grateful, regretful-happy take on love, sex and marriage without pretenses or adornments — but with plenty of style and wit. How adult!\n\nelisabeth.vincentelli@nypost.com",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for Peters' transformative performance ('Medal of Honor? Nobel Prize?'), enthusiasm for the production improvements, and positive assessment of all elements working together. The 'How adult!' exclamation shows clear recommendation despite some opening context about the show's previous state. | Gemini: The review praises Peters' performance as transformative and Stritch as a hoot. The critic states that the newcomers have inspired the original cast to raise its game, and that the staging finally makes sense. | Kimi: The critic celebrates Bernadette Peters' performance as a 'masterpiece' worthy of 'the Nobel Prize' and declares that the previously 'murky' production has become a 'coherent whole' with the new cast. The enthusiastic praise for the staging, ensemble, and Sondheim interpretation indicates an unqualified recommendation despite the text truncation warning.",
