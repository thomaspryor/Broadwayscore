    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for the company and show's emotional impact, calling it 'fine' and highlighting thematic depth. However, single excerpt warning and truncated text require reduced confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production and performances, describing the impact as 'fine' and highlighting the thematic depth. The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the cast and the show's themes of love, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the cast ('bright and handsome company') and the production's thematic weight ('fine impact'), indicating a solid recommendation. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this scores in the upper Positive range.",
