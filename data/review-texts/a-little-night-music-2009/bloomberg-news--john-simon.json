Peters replaced Catherine Zeta-Jones on July 13 in this production of Sondheim's musical. Photographer: Joan Marcus via Bloomberg\n\nIt is lucky enough when a replacement\ncast can match the original one; it is more than serendipitous\nwhen the newcomers surpass their predecessors. That is the case\nwith “A Little Night Music,” which resumes after a recess,\nwith Bernadette Peters and Elaine Stritch taking over for\nCatherine Zeta-Jones and Angela Lansbury, respectively.\n\nRecall that “A Little Night Music” is Hugh Wheeler’s\nadaptation of Ingmar Bergman’s “Smiles of a Summer Night,”\nwith a score by Stephen Sondheim -- a Broadway hit in 1973, a\nfailed movie in 1978 and variously revived since. This austerity\nproduction, directed by Trevor Nunn, did well in London in 2008,\ntransferred to New York and, among other things, earned Zeta-\nJones a Tony Award for her performance as the celebrated stage\nactress Desiree Armfeldt.\n\nSet in Sweden, circa 1900, it is the story of lawyer\nFredrik Egerman and his still virginal child-wife Anne; of\nFredrik’s unhappy theology-student son, Henrik, in love with his\ncoeval stepmother; of Desiree, currently mistress to the\narrogant officer Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm, and of the count’s\nmostly neglected wife, Charlotte.\n\nAlso of Desiree’s imperious mother, Madame Armfeldt, a\nformer courtesan of international repute, now mentoring\nFredrika, Desiree’s illegitimate teen-age daughter, whom the\nthespian-despising old lady co-opted while the actress is\ntouring all over Sweden.\n\nThere is, further, Anne’s feisty and sexually experienced\nmaid, Petra, as well as a chorus of two men and three women, the\nWeekenders, weaving in and out of the action. Fredrik becomes\nreinvolved with his old flame Desiree, and amorous and jealous\nimbroglios climax during a tempestuous house party at Madame\nArmfeldt’s country estate.\n\nThe Wheeler book, which retains much of Bergman’s\nscreenplay while adding a good deal of his less than equal own,\ndepends mostly on Sondheim’s music and lyrics, which are of\nprime quality. The music is mostly waltz or waltzlike, sometimes\nverging on folk ballad, as in “The Miller’s Son,” or turning\nclassic show tune as in the ever-popular “Send in the Clowns.”\n\nPeters continues to be the ageless, adorable living doll we\ntreasure, though despite some uncustomary mugging this is not\nexactly what the Sarah Bernhardtish Desiree calls for. But it is\na vast improvement over her predecessor, especially in the\ndelivery of “Send in the Clowns,” which here is thoughtful and\nunderstated rather than brashly self-indulgent.\n\nLansbury, a true artist, was a fine Madame Armfeldt. But\nStritch is both actress and personality, and her highly\nidiosyncratic gestures, intonations and pauses add a whole\ncomically offbeat subtext to the role. British import Alexander\nHanson is now an even more relaxed and worldly Fredrik Egerman,\nAaron Lazar a more autocratically domineering Count, Erin Davie\na fulgently embittered Countess, and Leigh Ann Larkin, a savvy,\nsaucy Petra.\n\nBut whereas Hunter Ryan Herdlicka is a suitably naive and\nimpassioned Henrik, Ramona Mallory’s Anne is a somewhat less\nthan irresistible ingenue. The Weekenders constitute a winning\nensemble, and Bradley Dean, in the underwritten role of Madame\nArmfeldt’s valet, does what he can.\n\nThe scaled-down scenery and tasteful costumes of David\nFarley contribute handsomely, and Nunn’s staging is subtly\nincisive. The reduced orchestra under Rob Bowman does manfully\nby Jason Carr’s judicious orchestrations, and for Lynne Page’s\nspare but sufficient choreography. Over nearly four decades\nsince its premiere, I have come to appreciate the show a good\ndeal more than I originally did.\n\nAt the Walter Kerr Theatre, 219 W. 48th St. Information:\n+1-212-239-6200; hhtp://www.telecharge.com\nRating: ***\n\nWhat the Stars Mean:\n**** Do Not Miss\n*** Excellent\n** Good\n* Poor\n(No stars) Worthless\n\n(John Simon is the New York drama critic for Muse, the arts\nand leisure section of Bloomberg News.
