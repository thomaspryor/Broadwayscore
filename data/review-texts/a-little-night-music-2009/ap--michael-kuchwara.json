  "bwwExcerpt": "The first Broadway revival of 'A Little Night Music,' the enchanting, moonstruck musical based on the Ingmar Bergman film 'Smiles of a Summer Night,' is a curious affair. There are some lovely moments, most of them supplied by Angela Lansbury, but too much of this adult, sophisticated show, which opened Sunday at the Walter Kerr Theatre, seems forced, boisterous and a little crude.",
