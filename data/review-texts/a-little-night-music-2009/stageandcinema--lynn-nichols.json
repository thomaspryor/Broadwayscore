Too limited to determine overall show recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review highlights Zeta-Jones' glamour but criticizes her vocal performance as lacking depth. This suggests a mixed assessment, with no clear recommendation or discouragement. | Gemini: The review praises Zeta-Jones' glamour but criticizes her vocal performance, indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: Brief excerpt offers balanced assessment praising the star's glamour while criticizing her vocal suitability for the role, without issuing a clear see-it-or-skip-it verdict.",
