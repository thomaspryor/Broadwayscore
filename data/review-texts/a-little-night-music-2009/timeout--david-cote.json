  "bwwExcerpt": "If you’ve never seen a production of this romantic classic, by all means, go. The principals are suave and poised, and although Nunn seems to have encouraged them to sing their lyrics somewhat pedantically over the music, they sparkle and charm. Not to be missed is the venerable Lansbury putting her personal stamp on another Sondheim character. Alexander Hanson is a dashing figure, the sort of mature leading man we hardly ever see on Broadway. Would someone please steal his passport?",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear recommendation with enthusiastic language ('by all means, go', 'sparkle and charm', 'Not to be missed'). However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential for cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a strong recommendation to see the show, praising the performances and highlighting standout moments. The tone is clearly positive, though the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review recommends seeing the show, praising the leads and Lansbury, but notes a reservation about the singing style. Given only one excerpt, I'm scoring it as a solid positive with reservations. | Kimi: Explicit recommendation to attend ('by all means, go', 'not to be missed') with strong praise for performances ('suave and poised', 'sparkle and charm'), despite minor reservation about singing direction.",
