However, this appears to be an excerpt, so confidence is reduced. | GPT-4o: The review praises the production for achieving what others have not, making Sondheim's songs feel natural, suggesting a standout revival. The tone is enthusiastic and highlights a significant accomplishment. | Gemini: The review is positive, highlighting the production's success in making Sondheim's songs feel natural. However, the mention of the musical being \"problematic\" suggests some reservations. | Kimi: The critic praises this production for achieving what most revivals could not—making Sondheim's songs feel naturally integrated into the show's world—indicating a strong recommendation despite acknowledging the musical's inherent challenges.",
