  "bwwExcerpt": "Mr. Nunn’s “Little Night Music,” the first full Broadway revival of the show, may well be a hit too, though not because of any artistic finesse. It has what is a producer’s favorite form of insurance these days: stars known to the public from movies, television and tabloids, of whom people can later say things like “She’s even more beautiful in person” (as they surely will of the lustrous Ms. Zeta-Jones) or “She’s amazing for her age” (in reference to the 84-year-old Ms. Lansbury).",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic praises this production for succeeding where others have failed, calling the musical 'bewitching' and noting the songs feel like 'natural expressions.' However, this appears to be a brief excerpt, limiting confidence in the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review praises the production for achieving what others have not, making Sondheim's songs feel natural. The tone is enthusiastic and highlights a significant accomplishment. | Gemini: The review is positive, highlighting the production's success in making Sondheim's songs feel like natural expressions. The phrase \"problematic musical\" indicates some reservations, but the overall tone is positive. | Kimi: The critic offers high praise for this production's ability to successfully integrate Sondheim's songs where other revivals have failed, using words like 'crystalline' and 'natural expressions,' though the brief excerpt limits certainty about the overall verdict.",
