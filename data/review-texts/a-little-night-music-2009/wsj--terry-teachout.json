It was the presence of Catherine Zeta-Jones and Angela Lansbury in the first Broadway revival of \"A Little Night Music,\" not the production's dubious artistic merits, that kept it running for six months. Now that they've moved on, the producers have decided to take a very big chance and replace them not with a second pair of certified screen stars but with Elaine Stritch and Bernadette Peters, two deservedly beloved Broadway performers whose names are not generally known to the public at large (though Ms. Peters teetered on the edge of full-scale celebrity in the 1970s and '80s and Ms. Stritch's guest appearances on \"30 Rock\" have made her a somewhat more familiar face).\n\nElaine Stritch and Bernadette Peters star in \"A Little Night Music\" in the roles initially revived by Angela Lansbury and Catherine Zeta-Jones, respectively.
