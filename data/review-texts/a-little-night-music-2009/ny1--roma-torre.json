  "bwwExcerpt": "Sondheim being Sondheim, you know that anything he writes is going to be intelligent, sophisticated, witty and lyrical, often self-consciously so. That's all there in the revival of his 1973 musical 'A Little Night Music,' directed by Trevor Nunn whose acclaimed London production made the trip across the pond. As modern musicals go, it's considered by many the gold standard and this production turns out to be beautiful and deeply resonant, hitting every note with stunning honesty.",
