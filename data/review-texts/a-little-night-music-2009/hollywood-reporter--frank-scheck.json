    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt clearly recommends seeing the show ('demands a repeat visit') and praises the leads for bringing 'a whole new level' to the production. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the new leads and suggests the show is worth seeing again, indicating a strong positive impression. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The phrase \"demands a repeat visit\" indicates a strong positive recommendation. The mention of new leads bringing \"a whole new level\" further reinforces this positive sentiment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the replacement cast, stating they elevate the production to a 'whole new level' and explicitly recommending that the show 'demands a repeat visit.' While clearly positive, the limited excerpt warrants caution and a score in the upper Positive range rather than Rave.",
