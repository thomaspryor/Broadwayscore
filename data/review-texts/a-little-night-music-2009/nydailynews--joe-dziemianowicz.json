  "bwwExcerpt": "New York's heat wave has apparently swept all the way to Sweden, the locale of 'A Little Night Music.'\nSuddenly, the Stephen Sondheim-Hugh Wheeler musical is aglow with a brilliant and irresistible warmth.\nDon't credit the climate. Thank Bernadette Peters, who's assumed the role of Desiree Armfeldt, the famous but fading actress played to Tony-winning effect by Catherine Zeta-Jones.",
