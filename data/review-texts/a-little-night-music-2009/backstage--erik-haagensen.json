  "bwwExcerpt": "Bernadette Peters and Elaine Stritch are offering a mother-daughter combo far closer to that created by the roles’ incomparable originators, Glynis Johns and Hermione Gingold, than to the excellent work of Catherine Zeta-Jones and Angela Lansbury. And you know what? The company has adjusted, and the show is still pretty wonderful.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive verdict calling the show 'pretty wonderful' despite cast changes. Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds clearly positive so scoring upper end of Positive bucket, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of Bernadette Peters and Elaine Stritch, comparing them favorably to past performers, and concludes that the show is 'still pretty wonderful.' This suggests a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates that despite changes in the cast, the show remains \"pretty wonderful,\" suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic praises the new cast's interpretation as closer to the original than the previous Broadway cast, and explicitly calls the show 'pretty wonderful,' indicating a clear recommendation to see it.",
