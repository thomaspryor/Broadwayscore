  "bwwExcerpt": "Bernadette Peters and Elaine Stritch are offering a mother-daughter combo far closer to that created by the roles’ incomparable originators, Glynis Johns and Hermione Gingold, than to the excellent work of Catherine Zeta-Jones and Angela Lansbury. And you know what? The company has adjusted, and the show is still pretty wonderful.",
