  "bwwExcerpt": "So, it is richly rewarding to at last get to see this lovely, intelligent show unfold before my eyes on a Broadway stage. Now if only the parts were worthy of this remarkable whole! Unfortunately, this production, directed by Trevor Nunn and based on one he did at the intimate Menier Chocolate Factory in London a year ago, fails to deliver on most fronts. The main failing here is the presentation of the music. Music director Tom Murray leads a tiny band of eight musicians, and they never provide the lush sound that this show needs and deserves. (Check out Lincoln Center's South Pacific if you're not sure what I'm talking about.) Most of the cast sings—well, not poorly, but oddly: words are pronounced strangely and phrased weirdly, and some of the songs are more spoken than sung. And the tempo is disturbingly sluggish.",

Single excerpt warning applies - confidence is low as this may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review expresses disappointment with the production, particularly criticizing the music and presentation. Despite some appreciation for the show's potential, the overall tone is negative, indicating a failure to meet expectations. | Gemini: Despite calling the show \"lovely\" and \"intelligent,\" the reviewer ultimately finds the production lacking, specifically criticizing the musical presentation and sluggish tempo. Because only an excerpt is available, confidence is medium. | Kimi: While the critic praises the show's material as 'lovely' and 'intelligent,' they heavily criticize the current Broadway production's direction, musical arrangements, and performances, describing the tempo as 'disturbingly sluggish' and finding the presentation fails to meet the show's needs.",

  "wrongFullText": "By Staff Writer| 2025-12-18 Capturing Stage Drama: Theater Photography Tips Explore key tips for theater photography, highlighting the importance of rehearsal shoots, understanding dramatic lighting, and capturing emotion and narrative. Learn how to build relationships with theater companies and grow your artistic skills.\n\nTheater photography typically happens during dedicated tech rehearsals or dress rehearsals rather than live performances with audiences present. This allows photographers to shoot without the constraints of absolute silence, though remaining unobtrusive remains essential as actors and crew are working through final preparations. Coordinate closely with directors and stage managers to understand critical moments worth capturing, identify optimal shooting positions that won't interfere with sightlines or technical operations, and confirm whether flash photography is permitted during any portions of rehearsal.\n\nTheatrical lighting presents unique challenges and opportunities. Stage lighting is designed for dramatic effect rather than photographic exposure, creating extreme contrasts, saturated colors, and intentional shadows that push camera sensors to their limits. Embrace high ISO settings (3200 to 6400 or beyond), shoot in RAW format for maximum post-processing flexibility, and use spot metering to expose for actors' faces even when backgrounds go dark. The theatrical lighting itself becomes part of your composition—spotlights, colored gels, and shadow patterns contribute to the emotional atmosphere you're documenting.\n\nCapturing narrative and emotion distinguishes great theater photography from simple documentation. Study the script beforehand if possible to anticipate dramatic peaks, intimate moments, and visually striking scenes. Look for gesture, facial expression, and body language that convey character and story, frame shots that show relationships between actors and their spatial dynamics, and include elements of costume, set design, and staging that establish production style and period. A compelling theater photograph should give viewers who weren't present a sense of the production's tone, energy, and artistic vision.\n\nBuilding relationships with local theater companies opens doors for consistent work and artistic growth. Start by approaching community theaters and smaller production companies, offering to photograph shows in exchange for portfolio-building experience and promotional images they can use. Deliver a diverse gallery promptly after each production—action shots, character studies, ensemble moments, and detail images of technical elements—and you'll likely receive repeat invitations. As your reputation grows, pursue work with larger regional theaters, consider whether to specialize in particular genres like musicals or experimental work, and explore opportunities to have your theater photography exhibited as fine art that celebrates the collaborative magic of live performance.",
