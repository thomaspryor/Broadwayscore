  "bwwExcerpt": "But for theater lovers there can be no greater current pleasure than to witness Bernadette Peters perform the show's signature number, 'Send In the Clowns,' with an emotional transparency and musical delicacy that turns this celebrated song into an occasion of transporting artistry.
