Praises individual performances but finds the overall production concept fundamentally flawed. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the production fails to enhance the story and is hindered by its presentation. While performances are praised, the overall verdict is negative due to the ineffective direction. | Gemini: The review criticizes the director's choices and states that the attempts to untether the play have only locked it away further. While the performances are described as 'rock-solid,' the overall sentiment is negative. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the directorial concept as failing to deepen the material and effectively locking the play away, despite acknowledging the performances are 'rock-solid.' With only a single curated excerpt available, the full context of the review is unknown.",
