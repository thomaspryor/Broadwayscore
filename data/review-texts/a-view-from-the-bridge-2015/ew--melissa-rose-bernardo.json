He goes for the jugular, but not our heartstrings...If you find yourself dry-eyed at the end of van Hove’s high-concept, low-frills production, there’s no need to check your pulse. And if you find yourself relating to Eddie, there’s no need to panic; that means Strong (and Miller) succeeded.\"\n\nRead more",

Low confidence due to single cherry-picked excerpt. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights both negative aspects (tiresome music) and positive elements (Strong's performance), suggesting a mixed reception. The lack of emotional impact is noted, but the performance is acknowledged as successful. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive and negative aspects, such as Strong's performance and the music, without a clear recommendation. The dry-eyed comment suggests a lack of emotional connection, but success is acknowledged if one relates to Eddie. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the 'dirge-like' music as tiresome and heavy-handed, and suggests the production fails to forge an emotional connection, though it acknowledges the lead actor's technical success.",
