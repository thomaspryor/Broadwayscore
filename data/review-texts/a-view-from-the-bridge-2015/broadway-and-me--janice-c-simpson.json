    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic compares the production to classical Greek theater and declares it potentially the finest performance of the season, indicating exceptional praise despite being a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the performance, comparing it to an original production of a play by Sophocles, and suggests it may be the finest of the season. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt contains very strong praise for the performances and the production, suggesting a highly positive experience. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains superlative praise comparing the production to an original Sophocles play and declaring it the season's finest performance, warranting upper Positive range. Confidence is low per guidelines for excerpt-only reviews. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
