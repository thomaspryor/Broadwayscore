But in Ivo van Hove’s thrillingly claustrophobic version, last seen on the West End, the action all takes place in one small square – a bit like a boxing ring, a bit like a prison cell – with the audience surrounding it on three sides.\n\nA View from the Bridge, based loosely on a real-life incident, describes the upheaval in the home of Eddie Carbone (Mark Strong), a career longshoreman who lives with his wife, Beatrice (Nicola Walker), and her niece, Catherine (Phoebe Fox), who has just been offered a secretarial job when the play begins. Conflict arrives in the bodies of Marco (Michael Zegen) and Rodolpho (Russell Tovey), Beatrice’s cousins, newly smuggled ashore from Italy. Marco is a macho sort, so he and Eddie get along fine. But Rodolpho, who sings and dances and sews, discomfits Eddie, especially when Rodolpho fixes his attentions on Catherine.\n\nRead moreVan Hove is a genius at revealing and actualising the emotional currents that run underneath dialogue, of giving subtext a visceral and violent expression. So it wasn’t a given that he would succeed with Miller. More than one character explicitly states Eddie’s predicament, a deeply felt but dangerously unacknowledged desire for his niece, so this text isn’t exactly sub. But Miller can be mealy mouthed about desire itself, which he always seems to treat as something at least a little distasteful. By focusing so keenly on it, Van Hove inflames what had come to seem a settled text. This is an exhilarating production, assured and perilous, abstract and concretely physical.\n\nView image in fullscreenRussell Tovey, Fox and Strong: ‘Van Hove inflames what had come to seem a settled text.’ Photograph: Jan Versweyveld/SuppliedVan Hove shows us the too-long embraces between Eddie and Catherine, her childish way of wrapping her legs around his waist that doesn’t seem so childish any more. And if Van Hove adjoins a kiss that is not in Miller’s play, it makes the scripted one that follows it all the more disturbing. Maybe that first kiss seems out of character for Eddie, but Miller’s play acknowledges that “a passion” “had moved into his body, like a stranger”, and in Mark Strong’s extraordinary and visceral performance we see a man who has become a stranger to himself, a paragon of manhood unmanned and set adrift both by his own desires and by challenges to his masculine assumptions.\n\nStrong is well supported by the other cast members, though accents can waver between south Brooklyn and north London. But pronunciation aside, they’re all very much in the same play and very much entrapped in what Van Hove, following on from Miller, envisions as a supremely tragic cycle. The shower that opens the play, Eddie’s ablutions after a sweaty day on the docks, is echoed in the bloody rain that concludes it, suggesting that the violence that propels the play is inexorable. We are all of us caught, rapt and culpable, in its spray.\n\nAt any point, you can opt out of the sale of all of your personal information by pressing",
