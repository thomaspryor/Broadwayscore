  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The current production sets a new standard, and it certainly refreshes the play. What van Hove does – quite brilliantly – is to reduce ‘View’ to its essence…His ‘View’ works so well in large part because it’s done so simply, by an ensemble of superb actors...But there are a number of new touches at least as overwrought as the traditional ones...On balance, though, this 'View from the Bridge' is a production that should be seen by anyone interested in Miller and his work.\"\n\nRead more",
