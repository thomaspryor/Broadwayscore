And what is so painfully sad about van Hove’s unbearably tense production is the way it reminds you that the sorrow here has its origins in generosity...Just as there is no escape for characters, there is none either for the actors and they are all magnificent.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the staging ('how good'), direction ('unbearably tense production'), and performances ('all magnificent'). However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'unbearably tense' and highlights the 'magnificent' performances, indicating a strong positive sentiment. Despite the limited excerpt, the language suggests a highly favorable view. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the staging and the actors, describing the production as \"unbearably tense\" and \"magnificent.\" The phrase \"mark of how good this staging is\" indicates a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm using the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the staging ('good', 'unbearably tense') and performances ('magnificent'), indicating a clear recommendation, though confidence is reduced due to the single curated excerpt potentially being cherry-picked.",
