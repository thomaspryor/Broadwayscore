    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite calling it 'a bit arty,' the critic praises the production's 'stark power,' 'spectacle,' and 'overpowering conclusion.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's spectacle and power, especially in its conclusion, despite noting it can seem 'a bit arty.' The overall tone is positive, emphasizing the impactful nature of the production. | Gemini: The review describes the production as having \"stark power\" and an \"overpowering conclusion\", indicating a positive, though potentially qualified, recommendation. The limited excerpt makes confidence low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production's 'stark power' and 'overpowering conclusion,' while acknowledging it can be 'a bit arty.' The emphasis on spectacle and undeniable power indicates a clear recommendation despite minor reservations.",
