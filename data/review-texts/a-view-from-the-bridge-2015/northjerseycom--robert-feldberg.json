This is theater at its most direct and enthralling, with the usual supporting elements stripped away so that the characters, on a nearly bare stage, are vividly revealed as creatures of pure, irresistible human impulse…If the atmosphere is stylized, the performances are totally naturalistic, led by English actor Mark Strong’s haunting portrayal of Eddie.\"\n\nRead more",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong, enthusiastic language ('enthralling', 'irresistible') and praises the performances and staging. Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone suggests a highly positive review. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"most direct and enthralling\" and \"irresistible human impulse,\" indicating a positive review. Given that it is a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's enthralling staging and standout performances, warranting a score in the upper Positive range despite the limited context.",
