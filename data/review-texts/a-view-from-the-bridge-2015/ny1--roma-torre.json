Van Hove’s harrowing staging of the climactic final scenes will leave you emotionally drained. But I’m a little perplexed by some directorial choices - the bare feet, the inconsistent accents and the constant drumbeats - distracting touches that momentarily took me out of the here and now.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the production's emotional impact but notes distracting directorial choices. The positive elements outweigh the negatives, suggesting a recommendation with reservations. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review highlights moments that are breathtaking, but also points out directorial choices that are distracting, leading to a positive but reserved recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers strong praise for the production's emotional impact ('took my breath away', 'emotionally drained') with only minor caveats about specific directorial choices. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced per instructions.",
