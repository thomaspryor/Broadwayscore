When this happens, it’s a case for Ivo van Hove...This radical rejuvenation of this over-familiar Arthur Miller drama takes up a deserved berth...This sleek, minimalist staging helps the production to feel as tightly, and inexorably, wound as a Greek tragedy.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt contains strong positive language ('radical rejuvenation', 'deserved berth', 'sleek, minimalist') and compares it favorably to Greek tragedy. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and truncated text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as a 'radical rejuvenation' and highlights the 'sleek, minimalist staging' that enhances the play. The positive language suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the 'radical rejuvenation' and 'sleek, minimalist staging,' indicating a positive reception. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the language suggests a strong positive leaning. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the production's minimalist staging and tragic intensity, calling it a 'radical rejuvenation,' though the limited single excerpt warrants conservative scoring in the upper Positive range per guidance.",
