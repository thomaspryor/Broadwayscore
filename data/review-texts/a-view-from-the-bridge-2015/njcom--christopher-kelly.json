  "bwwExcerpt": "...Ivo van Hove...presents this 'View' in a square space framed by a low wall of plexiglass, with audience members on rafters on either side of the stage. There are no props, and curiously the actors wear no shoes. Lending to the strange, anxious atmosphere is an underscore of murmurous music that is heard throughout the show. The result is alternately powerful and a wee bit ridiculous. The power comes mostly courtesy of an astonishing lead performance by British actor Mark Strong ('Sherlock Holmes,' 'The Imitation Game'), who takes a nearly impossible-to-play character...and transforms him into a viscerally flesh-and-blood, palpably tortured figure...Alas, this 'A View from the Bridge'...doesn't quite cohere...a touch more humor and humility might have gone a very long way. It's one thing to serve up something strange and dark and unexpected; it's another thing entirely to be so deadly 'serious' and 'intense' that you risk devolving into self-parody.",
