  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Ivo van Hove’s stripped-back staging is definitive enough to ward a generation off Arthur Miller’s family drama. Played barefoot on a bare white stage, freed from its real-world setting, it’s like the play has been triple-distilled and served neat: 100 percent proof. For two hours straight, it plays on a knife-edge as we wait, wound-tight, for the inevitable detonation. You daren’t blink. You scarcely breathe. This is theater as an out of body experience.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Extremely strong praise with vivid metaphors ('triple-distilled', '100 percent proof') and powerful imagery about the theatrical experience. The phrase 'out of body experience' indicates transcendent theater, clearly in Rave territory despite being only an excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly enthusiastic language, describing the production as 'definitive' and '100 percent proof,' with an intense, immersive experience. The phrase 'theater as an out of body experience' suggests a strong, positive impact. | Gemini: The review uses strong, positive language such as \"definitive\", \"triple-distilled\", and describes the experience as an \"out of body experience.\" The critic also emphasizes the intense and captivating nature of the production. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise ('definitive,' 'out of body experience,' '100 percent proof') describing an intense, immersive production. However, as a single curated excerpt, it warrants placement in the upper Positive range rather than Rave with low confidence.",
