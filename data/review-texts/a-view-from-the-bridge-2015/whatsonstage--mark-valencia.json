    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clear positive language ('thrillingly rendered') praising both director and cast, but limited text makes full verdict assessment uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the director's approach and the ensemble cast, indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"thrillingly\" which suggests a positive review. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for van Hove's direction ('forensic thought') and the ensemble ('thrillingly rendered'), indicating clear approval. As a single curated excerpt, it suggests a positive verdict but lacks the 'must-see' superlatives of a rave.",
