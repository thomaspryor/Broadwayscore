    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Extremely strong language ('revolutionary', 'simply staggering', 'cements his place irrefutably') indicates a rave, but single excerpt warning requires caution about incomplete verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'staggering' and highlights van Hove's revolutionary impact, indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"staggering\" and \"revolutionary\" to describe the production, indicating a rave review.
