Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a strong rave. | Gemini: The review uses strong, positive language such as \"sets a new standard\", \"once-in-a-lifetime production\", and urges the reader to \"go see this show\". | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified superlatives ('once-in-a-lifetime', 'sets a new standard') and an explicit imperative to attend, warranting the top of the Positive range. Confidence is low due to reliance on a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review.",
