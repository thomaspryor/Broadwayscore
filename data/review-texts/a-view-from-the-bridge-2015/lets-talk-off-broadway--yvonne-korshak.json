  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'A View From the Bridge' succeeds in giving powerful and persuasive universality to the emotional conflicts of the Carbone family. On the other hand, the ethnic immediacy, physical context, social issues and gritty realism that also fired Miller in writing the play are submerged. I’m thrilled to have seen this version and feel it brought me to a deeper knowledge of the play than I had before….but I miss the old neighborhood.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic expresses being 'thrilled' and gaining 'deeper knowledge,' but balances this with significant criticism about losing the play's ethnic immediacy and physical context. The 'but I miss the old neighborhood' suggests meaningful reservations about this interpretation's choices. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production for its powerful emotional impact, suggesting a positive experience. However, it notes the loss of certain elements, indicating some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review states the production \"succeeds\" and the critic is \"thrilled\" to have seen it, indicating a positive recommendation. However, the critic also misses the \"old neighborhood,\" suggesting some reservations. | Kimi: The critic expresses genuine enthusiasm ('thrilled to have seen it') and praises the production's emotional power, but levies substantial criticism regarding the loss of ethnic immediacy and gritty realism central to Miller's original work.",
