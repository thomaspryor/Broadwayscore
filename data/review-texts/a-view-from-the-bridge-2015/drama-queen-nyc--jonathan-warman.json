  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"I liked this as well as I could. Ivo von Hove is a very thoughtful director, but he’ll never be my favorite...Hove’s production of Miller’s 'A View from the Bridge', is, however, the most lucid work I’ve seen from this sometimes opaque auteur director. It’s rock-solid theater for sure, but not quite up to the mark of director Gregory Mosher’s production a few seasons back...Worth seeing, but I didn’t find it the revelation some other people felt it to be.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds like qualified praise at the lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The critic acknowledges the production as 'rock-solid theater' and 'worth seeing', indicating a positive recommendation despite some reservations about its impact compared to other productions. | Gemini: The review states it is \"worth seeing\" but also expresses reservations and compares it unfavorably to a previous production. The overall tone is positive but not enthusiastic. | Kimi: The reviewer explicitly recommends the show ('Worth seeing', 'rock-solid theater') but qualifies this with significant reservations about it falling short of previous productions and failing to live up to the hype.",
