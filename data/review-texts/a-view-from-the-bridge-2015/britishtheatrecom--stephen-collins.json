The telling of Miller’s tale is clean, pulsates with reason and truth and, like a great orchestral symphony, has a shape, a fierce force, a presence greater than each of its parts...Unmissable. Almost certainly the play of 2015. Do anything, absolutely anything, to get a seat.\"\n\nRead more",

Clear rave despite single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives like 'dynamic', 'inspirational', 'superb', and 'unmissable', indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, the confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"superb in every way\" and \"unmissable\", indicating a rave review. The critic urges the reader to \"do anything\" to see it. | Kimi: The excerpt uses unqualified superlatives ('highest order', 'superb', 'unmissable') and explicitly urges readers to 'do anything' to get tickets, indicating an enthusiastic rave despite being a single curated quote.",
