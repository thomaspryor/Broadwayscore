    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive recommendation with 'not to be missed' despite acknowledging some pacing issues. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the verdict language is unambiguously positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction, cast, and production elements, with minor reservations about pacing. The phrase 'not to be missed' suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review contains strong positive language such as \"classy cast\", \"vivid and believable life\", \"magnetic centerpiece\", \"visually and aurally elegant production\", and \"not to be missed tribute\". Although there is a minor reservation about pacing, the overall tone is highly positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Van Hove's direction and the cast, particularly Mark Strong, calling the production 'not to be missed' and 'breathtaking,' though it notes a few slow spots in the middle. With only a single excerpt available, this represents a clearly positive recommendation in the upper range of the Positive bucket.",
