    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('remarkable') about the production and direction. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's restraint and focus, suggesting a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set towards the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"remarkable\" to describe the production, which indicates a positive assessment. Given that it is only a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt uses unambiguously positive language ('remarkable') praising the production's direction and textual fidelity, suggesting a strong recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full review's verdict.",
