  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The very best plays, like 'A View from the Bridge', are director and concept proof...The drama somewhat stalls in a slow scene in the family home and another featuring the young lovers, where the director seems keener to make artistic points than drive the narrative forward but thereafter, it heads inexorably towards an inevitable denouement. Despite some auteurial moments that do the original few favours, Arthur Miller has written far too strong a play for viewers to come away disappointed.\"\n\nRead more",
