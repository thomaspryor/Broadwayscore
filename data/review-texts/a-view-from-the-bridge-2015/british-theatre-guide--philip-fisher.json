  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The very best plays, like 'A View from the Bridge', are director and concept proof...The drama somewhat stalls in a slow scene in the family home and another featuring the young lovers, where the director seems keener to make artistic points than drive the narrative forward but thereafter, it heads inexorably towards an inevitable denouement. Despite some auteurial moments that do the original few favours, Arthur Miller has written far too strong a play for viewers to come away disappointed.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite criticizing some directorial choices as stalling the drama and making 'auteurial moments that do the original few favours,' the critic concludes audiences won't be disappointed due to Miller's strong writing. Single excerpt warning requires caution - this sounds mildly positive with reservations. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some issues with the direction and pacing but ultimately suggests that the strength of the original play prevents disappointment. The single excerpt provides limited context, leading to a mixed verdict with low confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges some directorial choices that detract from the original, but ultimately concludes that the play is strong enough to overcome these flaws and avoid disappointment. Given the single excerpt and mixed signals, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic criticizes specific directorial choices and slow pacing, the final verdict clearly recommends the production, stating the strength of Miller's play ensures viewers won't be disappointed. As a single curated excerpt with mixed signals, confidence is reduced.",
