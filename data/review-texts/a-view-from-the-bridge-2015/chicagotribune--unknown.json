  "bwwExcerpt": "The white-hot director Ivo van Hove is not the first to embrace the passionate smolder behind Arthur Miller's 1955 play of forbidden passion in Italian-American Brooklyn...But it is hard to recall another staged production -- beyond this exquisitely profound Broadway import from London's Young Vic Theatre Company starring Mark Strong, Nicola Walker and Phoebe Fox -- that has depicted with such complexity and intensity what Eddie and his niece actually had together, before his infuriatingly effeminate usurper Rodolpho arrives, illegally, from the motherland...this is the very rare production that matches the complexity of the text, with its mixed-messaged collision of the cerebral and the sensual, a dichotomy at the heart of everything Miller ever wrote...Van Hove's brilliance is multifaceted, but much rests on his ability to focus the mind and soul on a work's tiny moments.",

The language suggests high recommendation despite being a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's complexity and intensity, highlighting the director's brilliance and the cast's performance. The language suggests a highly positive view, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"exquisitely profound\" and \"brilliance\", indicating a positive recommendation. The critic praises the production's complexity and intensity. | Kimi: The excerpt offers high praise for the production's complexity and the director's brilliance, but as a single curated quote, the overall verdict may not be fully represented.",
