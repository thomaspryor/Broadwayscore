  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"While I am not necessarily an enthusiast for this kind of theatre, it works brilliantly in this production...By shearing MIller's awkwardly stylised play of all theatrical paraphernalia Van Hove returns it to its roots in Greek classical tragedy...We lose something in the process, the sweaty aroma of working men and sexually charged woman. But we gain a clarity in the telling and the play's architecture is exposed as through the lens of a microscope. A lean, mean drama machine.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite opening with personal reservations about the genre, critic finds this specific production 'works brilliantly' and praises the director's approach as creating 'a lean, mean drama machine.' Acknowledges trade-offs but views them positively overall. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's effectiveness and clarity, describing it as 'brilliant' and a 'lean, mean drama machine.' Despite noting a loss of certain elements, the overall tone is strongly positive. Given the single excerpt warning, a score at the upper end of the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The critic states the production \"works brilliantly\" and calls it a \"lean, mean drama machine,\" indicating a positive, though not ecstatic, review. The opening disclaimer and acknowledgement of lost elements suggest some reservations. | Kimi: The critic praises the production as 'brilliant' and a 'lean, mean drama machine,' valuing the director's stripped-back approach despite noting some loss of atmospheric detail.",
