    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as a 'nightmare' and 'ominous,' suggesting a dark and potentially unsettling experience. Without a clear recommendation or discouragement, it falls into the Mixed bucket. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the production as a \"nightmare\" and \"ominous parable,\" suggesting a powerful and impactful experience, but also potentially unsettling. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the positive bucket, but with a lower confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt uses elevated, admiring language to describe the production's intense theatrical power, praising its 'chimerical world' and 'heightened emotions' despite (or because of) its nightmare-like atmosphere, indicating strong artistic achievement.",
