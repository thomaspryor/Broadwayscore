It's a timely tragedy: a reminder of how easily wounded pride can mutate into xenophobic aggression...Ignoring conventional markers of space and time, van Hove concocts a steadily mounting pressure.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises van Hove's direction as 'timely' and creating 'steadily mounting pressure,' suggesting artistic merit, but with only one brief excerpt available, the full recommendation strength is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as a 'timely tragedy' with 'steadily mounting pressure,' suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review describes the production as a \"brutal parable\" and a \"timely tragedy,\" indicating a positive, albeit serious, assessment. The excerpt suggests the production is impactful and relevant. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production's timely relevance and directorial craft, describing it as a 'brutal parable' and 'timely tragedy' that generates steadily mounting tension. While the clearly positive tone suggests strong endorsement, the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full review's verdict.",
