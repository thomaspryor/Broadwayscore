  "bwwExcerpt": "In a bright stroke, the director dreams up a wordless prologue. Eddie and coworker Alfieri (Michael Gould) wash up after a day on the docks. But the point of the drama is that nobody comes out clean. 'Whatever happened,' says Bea, 'we all done it.' Van Hove sees to it that everyone's dripping in guilt.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises a specific directorial choice as 'bright stroke' and suggests effective staging ('Van Hove sees to it'), but with only one curated excerpt available, this may not represent the full verdict. Scored conservatively in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a thematic focus on guilt and a creative directorial choice, but lacks clear positive or negative evaluative language. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall tone. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights a \"bright stroke\" in the direction and emphasizes the theme of guilt, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic assessment. Given that it is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt contains clearly positive evaluative language ('bright stroke') praising the director's creative staging choice, placing it in the upper range of the Positive bucket per scoring guidelines for single excerpts.",
