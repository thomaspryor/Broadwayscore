    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises direction as 'marvel' and lead performance as 'towering,' but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the staging as a 'marvel' and highlights a 'towering performance' by Mark Strong, indicating strong positive sentiment. The original rating of 80 supports a high Positive score. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"marvel of focused intensity\" and \"towering performance,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given the limited text, the score is placed towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the direction ('marvel of focused intensity') and lead performance ('towering'), aligning with the critic's 80/100 rating. However, confidence is low due to reliance on a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review.",
