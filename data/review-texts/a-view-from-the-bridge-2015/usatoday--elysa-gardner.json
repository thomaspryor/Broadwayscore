  "bwwExcerpt": "Generally, though, the performances are powerful -- Michael Gould's gritty, heartfelt take on Alfieri, a local lawyer who predicts Eddie's doom, is another standout -- and van Hove holds us rapt throughout, even when his flourishes feel overstated. While Miller's dialogue hardly requires such added fuss, the director should be commended for offering a fresh take that sacrifices none of its sting.",

The overall tone is strongly positive, indicating a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the performances and direction, but notes that some flourishes feel overstated. This suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the powerful performances and direction, noting van Hove holds the audience rapt and commending his fresh approach, though with minor caveats about overstated flourishes.",
