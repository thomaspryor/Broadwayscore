  "bwwExcerpt": "Generally, though, the performances are powerful -- Michael Gould's gritty, heartfelt take on Alfieri, a local lawyer who predicts Eddie's doom, is another standout -- and van Hove holds us rapt throughout, even when his flourishes feel overstated. While Miller's dialogue hardly requires such added fuss, the director should be commended for offering a fresh take that sacrifices none of its sting.",

Some casting concerns noted but overall positive assessment.

The overall tone suggests a positive recommendation with some criticisms. | Gemini: The review praises Strong's performance and Van Hove's direction, but notes that Fox is a less-than-ideal fit and Van Hove's flourishes are overstated, indicating a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Mark Strong's 'fearless, riveting' performance and Van Hove's compelling direction, recommending the production despite specific reservations about one casting choice and occasional overstated directorial flourishes.",
