    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic calls it an 'incredible theatrical event' with 'stunning and breathtaking' moments and expresses desire to see it again. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this may be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language, describing the production as 'stunning and breathtaking' and an 'incredible theatrical event'. The desire to see it again indicates a highly enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses phrases like \"stunning and breathtaking\" and \"incredible theatrical event,\" indicating a strong positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains enthusiastic praise ('stunning,' 'breathtaking,' 'incredible theatrical event'), but limited context requires conservative placement in the upper Positive range per excerpt guidelines. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
