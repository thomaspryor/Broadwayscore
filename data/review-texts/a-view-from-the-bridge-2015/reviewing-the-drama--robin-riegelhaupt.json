Due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low, but the language indicates a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The critic states they know good theatre when they see it, and that Van Hove has revitalized a classic. This indicates a strong positive sentiment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the production's raw power and direction, calling it 'good theatre' and crediting the director with revitalizing the material. As a single curated quote, it suggests a clearly positive verdict but warrants reduced confidence without the full review context.",
