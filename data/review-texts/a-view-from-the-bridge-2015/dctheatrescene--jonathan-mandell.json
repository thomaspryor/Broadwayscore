  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The intense performance by Mark Strong, making his Broadway debut, supported by the rest of the outstanding cast, makes this 'View' worth viewing, but the powerful acting is not what makes this production distinct from previous versions. It’s the direction by Ivo van Hove...aggressive staging has provoked passionate and opposing reactions...Any production whose cast so engages the audience with the playwright’s words pays the ultimate respect to the playwright.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive recommendation ('worth viewing') with praise for 'outstanding cast' and 'intense performance.' Single excerpt warning noted - this sounds clearly positive, so scoring in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances and engaging direction, suggesting a positive view. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context suggest caution, leading to a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review states the performance is \"worth viewing\" and praises the cast and direction, but also notes the direction has provoked \"opposing reactions,\" indicating some reservations. Given the limited excerpt, a score in the middle of the Positive range seems appropriate. | Kimi: The critic explicitly recommends the show as 'worth viewing' and praises the 'outstanding cast' and 'intense performance,' though notes the direction provokes opposing reactions. As a single excerpt, confidence is reduced despite the clear positive verdict.",
