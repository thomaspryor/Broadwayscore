However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review, the confidence is low, and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the set, sound effects, and Mark Strong's performance, indicating a positive but potentially qualified recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single excerpt contains strongly positive evaluative language ('mesmerizing performance,' 'stark set'), indicating clear approval of this production, though the truncated text and limited context warrant a low-confidence, upper-range Positive score per the single-excerpt guidelines.",
