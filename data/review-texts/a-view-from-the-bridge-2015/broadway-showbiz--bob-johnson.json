    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive verdict ('very good', 'worth seeing') but with noted flaws (sightline issues, dialect problems). Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mildly positive with reservations, placing it in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive recommendation, stating the show is 'very good' and 'worth seeing', but notes issues with view obstruction and dialects, indicating some reservations. | Gemini: The review states the show is \"very good\" and \"worth seeing\", but also mentions some issues, indicating a positive but not rave review. The single excerpt and truncated nature lower confidence. | Kimi: The critic explicitly recommends the show as 'very good' and 'worth seeing,' while noting specific flaws (sightlines and dialects) that prevent it from being great. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced per scoring guidelines.",
