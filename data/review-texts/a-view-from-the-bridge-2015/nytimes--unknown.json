Despite being a single excerpt, the language is unambiguously rapturous. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong praise ('magnificent', 'extreme emotional territory') and highlights a powerful performance, indicating a highly positive verdict. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"magnificent\" and \"most powerful single performance.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring it as a strong positive, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unambiguous superlatives ('magnificent reconception,' 'most powerful single performance') that indicate an enthusiastic, must-see recommendation typical of a rave review.",
