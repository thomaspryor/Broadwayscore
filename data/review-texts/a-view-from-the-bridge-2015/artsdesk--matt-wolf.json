    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt shows both praise (Greek tragedy evocation, plot simplicity) and clear criticism (too shouty, one long climax). With only one curated excerpt available and mixed signals, this falls into Mixed territory with low confidence due to incomplete information. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights both positive and negative aspects: a unique staging approach with a Greek tragedy simplicity, but also criticizes the production for being overly intense and 'shouty'. The mixed tone suggests neither a strong recommendation nor a discouragement. | Gemini: The review describes the production as breathless and evocative of Greek tragedy, but also notes that it can get a bit shouty. Given the limited excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive with reservations. | Kimi: The critic praises the production's Greek tragedy ambitions and breathless pacing but criticizes the 'shouty' acting and lack of dynamic variation ('one long extended climax'). With only one excerpt available, the mixed signals suggest neither a clear recommendation nor dismissal.",
