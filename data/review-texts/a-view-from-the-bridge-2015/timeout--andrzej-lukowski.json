    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Declares it 'the best show at the moment' and compares it to Stonehenge - calling it 'pure, primal, colossal' with superlative language throughout. However, single excerpt warning requires medium confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlative language to describe the production as unparalleled and monumental, indicating a strong recommendation. However, the confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review uses extremely strong language, calling the production \"pure, primal, colossal\" and comparing it to Stonehenge. Despite the single excerpt, the tone is overwhelmingly positive, justifying a Rave score. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers superlative praise calling it the 'best show at the moment' and 'visionary' with descriptions like 'pure, primal, colossal,' but confidence is low given this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's reservations or context.",
