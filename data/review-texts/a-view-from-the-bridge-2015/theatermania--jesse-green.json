    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it a 'masterclass' with 'powerhouse performance,' but as a single curated excerpt, this may not represent the full review verdict. Scored in upper Positive range due to superlative language but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language like 'masterclass' and 'powerhouse performance', indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"masterclass\" and \"powerhouse performance,\" indicating a positive recommendation. However, since it is a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt features strong superlatives ('masterclass', 'powerhouse') indicating clear enthusiasm for both the direction and lead performance. Per single-excerpt guidelines, this scores in the upper Positive range (80-84) given the unequivocal praise, though confidence is low due to limited context.",
