It is strong meat served very rare...This production has become a potent, pared-down, animalistic ritual...A knot of dread seems to tighten in his gut at the same rate it did in mine. I’ve seen this show before and knew what was coming. What makes it so impressive is that it still takes you by surprise.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling the production 'impressive' and 'potent,' with visceral impact described. However, this is a single curated excerpt which may not represent the full review verdict, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'potent' and 'impressive', suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"potent\", \"impressive\", and describes a tightening knot of dread, indicating a compelling and effective theatrical experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's potency and emotional impact, describing it as 'impressive' and capable of surprising even a returning viewer. However, as a single curated excerpt, it may not represent the full review's balance.",
