There could be things that irritate, distract or downright annoy you but if that happens please stay with it, because it’s worth it...For a cast to give performances which invoke realism in the context of a non-realistic production is impressive...The power of the performances did however, not so much change my mind, as lead me to feel that the flaws were entirely worth tolerating in order to witness this remarkable production.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear endorsement calling it 'remarkable' and 'worth it' despite acknowledged flaws. Single excerpt warning applies - strong positive language suggests upper Positive range, but limited text reduces confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'remarkable' and emphasizes the power of performances, suggesting that any flaws are worth tolerating. Despite the warning about potential irritations, the overall tone is strongly positive. | Gemini: Despite acknowledging flaws, the reviewer states the production is \"truly remarkable\" and \"worth it\", indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I've scored it towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives like 'truly remarkable' and urges audiences to tolerate flaws because the experience is 'worth it,' indicating a strong positive recommendation with acknowledged reservations.",
