    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the director's approach and lead performance, comparing the work favorably to Shakespeare's enduring plays. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed overall review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as a successful reimagining of a classic, with strong performances and direction. Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone is clearly positive. | Gemini: The review praises the production's faithfulness to Miller's original intent and its ability to reimagine the play, suggesting a strong positive assessment. The critic uses phrases like \"does Miller a great honor\" and \"living, breathing work\". | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the director's vision and lead performance, comparing the work to Shakespeare, though as a single curated quote it may not represent the full review's balance.",
