    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Exceptional praise with superlatives ('hypnotic power that is rarely seen', 'superb casting', 'succeeded completely') and transformative language ('makes you feel that you have never seen the play before'). However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('hypnotic power', 'superb casting', 'communal act of catharsis') indicating an enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"hypnotic power\", \"superb\", and \"succeeded completely\", indicating a rave review. While it's only an excerpt, the language is overwhelmingly positive. | Kimi: The single available excerpt contains superlative praise ('hypnotic power,' 'superb,' 'succeeded completely'), indicating a strong recommendation. Per the single-excerpt guideline for clearly positive quotes, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive bucket, though confidence is reduced due to potential cherry-picking.",
