  "bwwExcerpt": "Hove takes a scalpel-edged, stripped-down yet over-the-top approach that drains the play of its naturalistic flavor...But what really hurts the two-hour production is Hove's never-ending use of an unsettling, dirge-like soundscape, which interrupts the dialogue and is often disconnected from the storytelling. It is most effective at the play's brutal climax, which also contains a splashy visual feat. Mark Strong conveys Eddie's inner torment with a quiet intensity...For the record, this production received big raves in London, and I'm sure that many people here will be similarly turned on by it. But by the same token, I suspect that plenty of others will find it pretentious and obnoxious.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges the production received raves in London and some will be 'turned on by it' but personally finds significant flaws (drained naturalistic flavor, disconnected soundscape) and predicts polarized audience response including many finding it 'pretentious and obnoxious.' | GPT-4o: The review highlights both positive and negative aspects, noting the production's divisive nature. While it acknowledges potential appeal, it also criticizes the soundscape and approach, suggesting a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive and negative aspects, such as Mark Strong's performance and the director's approach, but ultimately expresses reservations about the soundscape and overall experience, suggesting a mixed reception. | Kimi: The review criticizes the directorial approach and soundscape as damaging while praising Mark Strong's performance, ultimately acknowledging the show will polarize audiences between 'turned on' and 'pretentious'.",
