  "bwwExcerpt": "Hove takes a scalpel-edged, stripped-down yet over-the-top approach that drains the play of its naturalistic flavor...But what really hurts the two-hour production is Hove's never-ending use of an unsettling, dirge-like soundscape, which interrupts the dialogue and is often disconnected from the storytelling. It is most effective at the play's brutal climax, which also contains a splashy visual feat. Mark Strong conveys Eddie's inner torment with a quiet intensity...For the record, this production received big raves in London, and I'm sure that many people here will be similarly turned on by it. But by the same token, I suspect that plenty of others will find it pretentious and obnoxious.",
