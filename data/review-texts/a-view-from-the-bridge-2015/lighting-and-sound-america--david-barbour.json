  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"It is clear that the director has built his own show on Miller's script. 'A View From the Bridge' may have been written in a relatively conventional naturalistic style, but it teems with life - ugly, vivid, and violent. Van Hove's staging freezes its emotions and arranges them into a sleek, minimalist tableau. You may very well enjoy it, but I hope that someday you get to see the play that Arthur Miller wrote. \"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic clearly disapproves of the director's interpretation, saying it 'freezes' Miller's vivid emotions and recommends seeing the original play instead. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may be more nuanced. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the director's unique staging but suggests it diverges from Miller's original intent. The tone is mixed, with appreciation for the production's style but a longing for the original play's essence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges potential enjoyment but criticizes the director's interpretation, suggesting a departure from the original play's intent. This indicates a mixed reaction. | Kimi: The critic finds Van Hove's staging freezes the emotions of Miller's original into a cold, minimalist tableau. While conceding some might enjoy it, the final verdict clearly prefers the original play to this interpretation, effectively recommending against this specific production. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
