However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review excerpt contains extremely strong positive language, calling it one of the most extraordinary theatrical productions and faultless. | Kimi: The excerpt contains extreme superlatives ('faultless', 'doesn't get better than this', 'extraordinary') with no caveats, indicating an unreserved rave recommendation.
