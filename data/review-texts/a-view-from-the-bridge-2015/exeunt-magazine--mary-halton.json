  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'A View From the Bridge' is a two hour pot coming to the boil, a slow motion train wreck, a car speeding down the hill (no brakes). You have to buy in, from the beginning, to the idea that none of this can possibly end well, that this isn’t a straightforward fight but it’s so beautifully thought out, so well played, that you want to be right there, clinging to the ropes as they circle each other after the last bell. The intimacy and intensity of this has been lost in a bigger space.\"\n\nRead more",

This suggests diminished impact despite quality elements. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'beautifully thought out' and 'well played,' suggesting a strong recommendation despite some loss of intimacy in a larger space. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is at the upper end of Positive. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the play as intense and well-played, making it a positive experience. However, the reviewer notes that some intimacy has been lost in a bigger space, indicating a reservation. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
