  "bwwExcerpt": "The latest revival of 'A View From the Bridge' -- the Arthur Miller play is having its third Broadway outing in 18 years -- will be noted for its stark set, ghostly sound effects and mesmerizing performance by Mark Strong, as the conflicted Italian-American longshoreman Eddie Carbone...'Bridge' steadily builds anxiety, because of its performances, surely, but also due to a ceaseless humming that reminds you of being at the movies when a subway passes nearby ... though here, the rumbling never stops...This production hangs on the performance by Strong, who acts with his entire lanky body and nimbly moves between rationality and psychosis. Is he in control of his incestuous feelings, or do they control him?",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises Mark Strong's 'mesmerizing performance' and effective production elements like set design and sound. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may not be captured. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's set, sound effects, and especially Mark Strong's performance, indicating a positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review highlights the 'mesmerizing performance' of Mark Strong and notes the play 'steadily builds anxiety'. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive with reservations and low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Mark Strong's 'mesmerizing' performance and the production's atmospheric design, indicating a solid recommendation despite limited available text.",
