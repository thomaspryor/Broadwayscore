  "bwwExcerpt": "Van Hove is a genius at revealing and actualising the emotional currents that run underneath dialogue, of giving subtext a visceral and violent expression. So it wasn't a given that he would succeed with Miller. More than one character explicitly states Eddie's predicament, a deeply felt but dangerously unacknowledged desire for his niece, so this text isn't exactly sub. But Miller can be mealy mouthed about desire itself, which he always seems to treat as something at least a little distasteful",
