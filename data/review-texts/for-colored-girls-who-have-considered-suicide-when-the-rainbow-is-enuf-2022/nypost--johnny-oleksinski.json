The lack of any reservations or negative comments supports a high score within the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"stunning poetry,\" \"power and grace,\" and \"deeply moving theatrical experience,\" indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The review offers strong praise for the performances ('power and grace') and describes the production as a 'deeply moving theatrical experience' using superlatives like 'stunning' and 'timeless,' indicating a clear recommendation without visible reservations. Confidence is low due to the brevity of the excerpt provided.",
