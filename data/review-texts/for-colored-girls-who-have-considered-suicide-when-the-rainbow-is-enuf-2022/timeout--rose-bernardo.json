    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear praise for the production's artistic elements ('truly does feel like a choreopoem', 'amazing', 'organic, natural and triumphant'), but with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may not be represented. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's choreography and performance, describing it as 'organic, natural and triumphant.' The positive language suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"amazing\" and \"triumphant\", suggesting a positive review. Given that it is only one excerpt, I am scoring at the higher end of the positive bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly positive evaluative language including 'triumphant' and 'amazing' to describe the production's movement and performances, indicating a clear recommendation. However, confidence is low given this is a single curated excerpt with truncated text.",
