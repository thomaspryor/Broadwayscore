  "bwwExcerpt": "nternment camps, racial discrimination and an atomic bomb blast are challenging topics to incorporate into a satisfying night of theater. The heavy-handed, cliche-driven 'Allegiance' which opened Sunday at the Longacre Theatre tries to take on all three - but does so unsuccessfully in a bombastic and generic Broadway musical. It has an ambitious agenda - touching on pride, citizenship, degradation, interracial romance, bravery and honor - and it's too much. While it's great that an Asian cast is telling a chapter in its own history, it's through an old-fashioned, stereotypical style that's out of touch with where Broadway is going.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative assessment calling the show 'heavy-handed,' 'cliche-driven,' 'bombastic,' 'generic,' and 'unsuccessful.' Despite acknowledging the importance of Asian representation, the critic finds the execution fundamentally flawed. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for being 'heavy-handed', 'cliche-driven', 'bombastic', and 'generic', indicating a negative assessment. However, it acknowledges the ambition and representation, which slightly tempers the negativity. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"heavy-handed\", \"cliche-driven\", \"unsuccessfully\", \"bombastic\", and \"generic\". It also states that the show is \"out of touch\". | Kimi: The critic finds the show fails to successfully incorporate its ambitious subject matter, criticizing it as heavy-handed, generic, bombastic, and out of touch with modern Broadway trends, despite noting the importance of the cast telling their own history.",
