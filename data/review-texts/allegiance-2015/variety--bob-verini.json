Single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges strengths in the personal material and production quality but criticizes the political aspects and writing. The single excerpt suggests a mixed verdict, but the lack of full context limits confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges some positive aspects (\"personal material lands\", \"handsome production\", \"talent to spare\") but ultimately finds the writing lacking, suggesting a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers balanced criticism, praising the production values and cast while noting the writing and political material lack sufficient weight and nuance for Broadway, suggesting a middling rather than enthusiastic assessment.",
