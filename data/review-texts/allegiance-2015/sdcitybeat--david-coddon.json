    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('seamless and stirring', 'takes our breath away', 'tender') with no caveats visible. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('seamless and stirring', 'takes our breath away') indicating a highly favorable view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"seamless and stirring transition\" and \"takes our breath away,\" suggesting a favorable review. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the language pushes the score towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
