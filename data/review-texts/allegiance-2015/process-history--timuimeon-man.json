Despite the text quality warning, the positive tone suggests a high score within the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review states the musical \"succeeds on many levels\" and praises the production and cast, but also notes a somewhat predictable plot line in the first act, leading to a positive but not rave score. The excerpted nature of the review lowers the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers a clear positive verdict praising the production and cast, with only minor reservation about the first act's predictability. Per single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, scored at the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
