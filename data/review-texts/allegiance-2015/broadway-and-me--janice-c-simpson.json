  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"It's a shame 'Allegiance' isn't doing better at the box office because no other show on Broadway right now speaks more directly to this moment...It's all well-intentioned stuff and, under Stafford Arima's forthright direction, it's prettily presented but 'Allegiance' lacks the spark that would make it a must-see. Maybe it just isn't angry enough. And there's plenty to be angry about.\"\n\nRead more",

This is a mixed assessment that neither recommends nor discourages. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show is well-intentioned and prettily presented but lacks the necessary impact to be compelling. The critique indicates a mixed review, noting the absence of a 'spark' and sufficient emotional intensity. | Gemini: The review acknowledges good intentions and presentation but ultimately finds the show lacking a crucial spark, stopping short of a clear recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the show's timely relevance and pretty presentation but explicitly states it lacks the spark to be essential viewing, resulting in a middle-ground assessment that acknowledges merit while noting significant shortcomings.",
