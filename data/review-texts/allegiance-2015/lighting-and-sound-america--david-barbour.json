    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies - this appears positive overall (praises surprises, striking moments, honest portrayal) but acknowledges significant flaws. Lower end of Positive bucket due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges flaws and moments that don't work, but also highlights surprising and striking elements. The overall tone suggests a mix of positive and negative aspects, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws but highlights striking and shocking elements, suggesting a positive but qualified recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: While the critic notes significant flaws including elements that are 'flat-out wrong,' the review emphasizes that the show consistently delivers striking and surprising moments that overcome its sentimental tendencies, indicating a qualified but clear recommendation.",
