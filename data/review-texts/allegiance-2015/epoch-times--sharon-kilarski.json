    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed signals: criticizes pacing ('rushed', story doesn't 'find its footing' early) but praises score as 'enjoyable' and calls it a 'gripping tale'. Limited text prevents clear verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt notes issues with pacing ('rushed') but praises the score as 'rather enjoyable' and describes the tale as 'gripping'. The mixed elements suggest a balanced view with both positive and negative aspects. | Gemini: The review excerpt notes the show seems rushed early on but ultimately calls it a gripping tale and says the score is enjoyable. Given the limited text, a score in the middle of the positive range seems appropriate. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows qualified praise—criticizing the rushed early show but praising the score as 'rather enjoyable' and ultimately calling it a 'gripping tale,' indicating a mild but clear recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
