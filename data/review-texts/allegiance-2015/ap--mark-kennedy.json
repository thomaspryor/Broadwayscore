However, confidence is medium due to truncated excerpt - the full review might contain additional context or qualification. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt criticizes the show as 'heavy-handed,' 'cliche-driven,' 'bombastic,' and 'generic,' indicating a strongly negative assessment. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt clearly states that the musical is unsuccessful, bombastic, and generic, indicating a negative assessment. The truncated nature lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers a clear negative verdict, criticizing the show as heavy-handed, clichéd, and generic in its execution of ambitious themes, with no redeeming qualities mentioned in the available text.",
