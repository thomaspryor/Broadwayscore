Most impressive of all, this original work manages to thread together myriad themes — of family strife, politics, patriotism, racial prejudice — into a beautifully unified exploration of what it means to be true to something.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Uses 'sublime' and calls it an 'original work' that 'beautifully unified' complex themes. Despite being a single excerpt, the superlative language and unqualified praise suggests strong recommendation, though confidence is medium due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('sublime', 'beautifully unified') and praises the musical's ability to balance complex themes. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly favorable review. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses very positive language such as \"sublime new musical\" and \"beautifully unified exploration\", indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise with words like 'sublime' and 'most impressive,' indicating clear enthusiasm for this musical. Per instructions for single curated excerpts, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive bucket (80-84) with reduced confidence due to the risk of cherry-picking. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
