  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"My biggest criticism is of 'Allegiance’s' predictable plot. For the most part, this isn’t a problem…The show still packs serious emotional weight. I’m not ashamed to admit that I teared up multiple times...So 'Allegiance' isn’t just set in the 1940s, it feels as if it were written back then, too.That’s (mostly) a good thing. The show perfectly captures the era’s style…Even with its flaws, 'Allegiance' is a wonderful new American musical.\"\n\nRead more",
