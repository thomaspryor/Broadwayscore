  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Up until I saw the show, I’ll admit I was skeptical of how good it really could be. Something told me it would be exceedingly difficult to illustrate this dark topic in a musical (which are usually lighthearted and fun) and maintain any sense of seriousness. However, I was pleasantly surprised: it worked out. The cast was fantastic...The musical was moving to me...and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a romantic drama about a black eye on America’s history that should be taken seriously.\"\n\nRead more",
