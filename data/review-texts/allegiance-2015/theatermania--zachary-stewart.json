    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('shockingly, it works', 'compelling', 'delightfully') with praise for production values and direction. Single excerpt warning applies, but tone is clearly enthusiastic rather than qualified. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises 'Allegiance' as a 'grandiose epic' and 'compelling family drama,' with a 'delightfully old-school' tone, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. The single excerpt and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"compelling\", \"delightfully old-school\", and \"ample humor and heart\", suggesting a positive review. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt expresses genuine surprise that the show succeeds, praising it as a compelling family drama and grandiose epic with humor, heart, and skilled direction. Confidence is low due to reliance on a single curated excerpt.",
