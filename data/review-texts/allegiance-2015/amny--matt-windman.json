The tone suggests a negative verdict, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt starts with a negative sentiment about the musical having \"so many problems.\" Given the truncated nature of the text, it's hard to gauge the full extent of the negativity, but the initial statement points towards a negative review. | Kimi: The available excerpt expresses clear disappointment with the show's execution despite its worthy subject matter, describing it as having 'so many problems.' Given this is a single truncated excerpt, the full verdict is uncertain but the visible content is unambiguously negative.",
