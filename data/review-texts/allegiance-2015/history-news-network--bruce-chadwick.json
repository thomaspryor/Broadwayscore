The phrase 'must see for history lovers' indicates a strong recommendation. However, the confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"one of the best\", \"superb acting\", \"strong plot\", and \"must see for history lovers\", indicating a rave review. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers strong praise including 'must see,' 'superb acting,' and 'stellar drama,' warranting a high Positive score, though confidence is reduced due to potential cherry-picking of this curated quote.",
