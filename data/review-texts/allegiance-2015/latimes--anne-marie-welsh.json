Single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges promising scenes and strong performances but criticizes the lack of focus and consistency, leading to a mixed verdict. The excerpt suggests both positive and negative elements, without a clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like the cast's singing and promising scenes, but criticizes the lack of focus, generic romances, and sentimental warblings. This suggests a mixed assessment rather than a clear recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges powerful performances and promising scenes but emphasizes significant flaws including tonal inconsistency, generic book elements, and sentimental drift, resulting in a mixed assessment.",
