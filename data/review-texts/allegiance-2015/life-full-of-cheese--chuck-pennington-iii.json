    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('powerful and bold', 'thrilling life', 'deftly and honestly performed') with educational value praised. Single excerpt warning applied - using upper Positive range due to clearly enthusiastic tone. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, calling the show 'powerful and bold' and highlighting its educational value. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"powerful\", \"bold\", \"thrilling\", and \"honestly performed\", indicating a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise describing the show as 'powerful,' 'bold,' and 'thrilling' with 'deftly' performed work, warranting a high-positive score per the single-excerpt guidelines, though the limited context necessitates low confidence.",
