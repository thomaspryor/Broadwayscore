The phrase 'demands to be seen and heard' indicates a positive recommendation, but the acknowledgment of lacking sophistication suggests reservations. | Gemini: The review states that the show \"demands to be seen and heard\", which indicates a positive recommendation. However, it also mentions that the show doesn't always succeed, suggesting reservations. | Kimi: The critic explicitly recommends the show ('demands to be seen') but qualifies this with significant reservations about its lack of theatrical sophistication, fitting the 'solid recommendation with reservations' profile.",
