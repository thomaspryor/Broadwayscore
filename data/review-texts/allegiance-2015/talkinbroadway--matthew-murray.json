The phrase 'demands to be seen and heard' indicates a positive recommendation, though with noted reservations about its sophistication. | Gemini: The review states that the show \"demands to be seen and heard,\" which indicates a positive recommendation, but it also mentions that the show \"doesn't always succeed,\" indicating reservations. | Kimi: The critic strongly urges attendance ('demands to be seen') but balances this with criticism about the production's lack of theatrical sophistication, creating a qualified positive recommendation typical of the 75-79 range.",
