The show, however, let’s be honest, maybe shouldn’t have been a musical and certainly not one that runs 2 ½ hours. The story is too important to be taken lightly.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic gives a qualified 'should go' recommendation but with significant reservations about the musical format and length. The conditional nature ('if you're interested') and criticism of the execution suggests mixed rather than positive territory. | GPT-4o: The review suggests interest in the subject matter but criticizes the format and length of the show, indicating a mixed reception. The excerpt is limited, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review recommends seeing the show, but expresses reservations about the musical format and length. The single excerpt and truncated nature of the text lower the confidence. | Kimi: The critic offers a qualified recommendation based on subject matter interest, but heavily criticizes the choice to make it a musical and its length, implying the serious story was mishandled. With only one excerpt available, the full verdict may differ.",
