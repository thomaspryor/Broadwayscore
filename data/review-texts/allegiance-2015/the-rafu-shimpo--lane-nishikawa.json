    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Uses strongest recommendation language ('highly recommend', 'must see', 'witness history') with enthusiastic tone telling readers to book flights to see it. Despite being a single excerpt, the superlative language clearly indicates a rave. | GPT-4o: The excerpt strongly encourages seeing the show, using phrases like 'highly recommend' and 'witness and be a part of history,' indicating a rave review. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review strongly recommends seeing the show, urging the reader to \"book your flight\" and \"be a part of history.\" The language is enthusiastic and positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers an urgent, enthusiastic recommendation urging readers to travel to see the show, calling it a historic and emotionally powerful experience. However, confidence is low as only one curated excerpt is available, which may not represent the full review. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
