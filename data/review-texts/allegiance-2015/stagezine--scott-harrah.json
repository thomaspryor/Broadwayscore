It concludes with the show being a 'missed opportunity,' indicating a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review praises performances but criticizes the musical score and script, ultimately calling it a 'missed opportunity.' This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the excerpt praises the heroic source material and top-notch performances, the critic's final verdict is that the show was 'misguided from the get-go' and constitutes 'one big missed opportunity' in its current form, indicating a recommendation against seeing it as is.",
