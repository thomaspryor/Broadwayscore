    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for the musical as 'powerful' and handled with 'surprising deftness,' plus praise for 'excellent cast.' However, single excerpt warning requires caution - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast and describes the musical as 'powerful' and 'handled with surprising deftness.' Given the single excerpt warning, the strong positive language suggests a score in the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"excellent cast\" and \"powerful musical\", suggesting a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt describes an 'excellent cast' and praises the show as 'powerful' with 'surprising deftness,' indicating a clear positive recommendation despite the limited available text.",
