  "bwwExcerpt": "The knowledge that the story was inspired by Takei's childhood hardships in the Japanese-American 'relocation centers' of World War II adds significantly to the emotional impact. But the powerful sentiments involved are too often flattened by the pedestrian lyrics and unmemorable melodies of Jay Kuo's score, making an unconvincing case for this material's suitability to be a musical...Nonetheless, writers Marc Acito, Kuo and Lorenzo Thomas have woven together a plot that's admirable in its bid to shine a light on the injustices committed against 120,000 West Coast Americans of Japanese descent, by focusing on the festering discord within one such family.",
