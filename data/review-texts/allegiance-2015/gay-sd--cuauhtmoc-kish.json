    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for the production's technical elements with 'perfectly professional balance.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for its professional balance of script, music, and choreography, indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the show's balance of script, music, and choreography while addressing a sensitive historical topic. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the show's handling of sensitive subject matter and its technical execution, describing a 'perfectly professional balance' of key elements. While the single-excerpt format limits confidence, the language indicates a clear recommendation without reservations.",
