The voices are powerful, the dancing fun and lively, and the sets flow seamlessly from act to act, creatively portraying images of the times. Allegiance turns out to be so much more than the documentary that it appears to be at first glance, and will leave you telling your friends that they must see it too.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Unqualified praise with superlatives ('outstanding') and explicit must-see recommendation. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong, enthusiastic language ('outstanding production', 'must-see') and highlights multiple positive aspects. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly positive review. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"outstanding production\" and \"must-see\", indicating a rave review. The critic also highlights the powerful voices, lively dancing, and seamless sets. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains explicit 'must-see' recommendation and enthusiastic praise for performances and design. Following guidance for clearly positive single excerpts, scored at upper end of Positive bucket (80-84) with low confidence due to risk of cherry-picking.",
