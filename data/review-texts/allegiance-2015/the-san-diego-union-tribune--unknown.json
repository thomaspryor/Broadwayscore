  "bwwExcerpt": "The show, though, retains both its powerful story core and a good deal of its score, along with nearly all the top cast members from the original version... If there's one aspect of this new 'Allegiance' that gives pause, it's a nagging sense the creators felt compelled on occasion to dial up the emotional pitch for Broadway with big, earnest ensemble numbers, instead of simply trusting the story material to deliver its potent impact.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the 'powerful story core' and 'good deal of its score' while expressing one reservation about over-dramatization. Single excerpt with mixed signals warrants lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates that the show retains its powerful story and strong cast, suggesting a positive view. However, the critique about dialing up the emotional pitch suggests some reservations. Given the single excerpt and warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show retains its powerful story and score, but there are some reservations about the emotional pitch being dialed up for Broadway. Given the single excerpt and the reservations, a score of 75 seems appropriate. | Kimi: The critic praises the Broadway transfer for retaining the powerful story, score, and cast from the original production, but criticizes the addition of overly earnest ensemble numbers that unnecessarily dial up the emotional pitch.",
