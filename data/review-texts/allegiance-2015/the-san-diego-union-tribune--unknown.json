  "bwwExcerpt": "The show, though, retains both its powerful story core and a good deal of its score, along with nearly all the top cast members from the original version... If there's one aspect of this new 'Allegiance' that gives pause, it's a nagging sense the creators felt compelled on occasion to dial up the emotional pitch for Broadway with big, earnest ensemble numbers, instead of simply trusting the story material to deliver its potent impact.",
  "bwwScore": 8
