    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show's good intentions but implies it falls short theatrically. The phrasing suggests neither strong recommendation nor complete dismissal - a classic mixed verdict. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 40 aligns with the negative bucket, and the review text indicates that despite the show's good intentions, it fails to deliver as effective theater. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that good intentions do not make good theater, implying that the musical falls short despite its noble subject matter. The critic's rating of 40 further supports a negative classification. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 40 and the dismissive framing—acknowledging the show's intentions while declaring they don't translate to quality—indicate a negative verdict, though the excerpt is very brief.",
