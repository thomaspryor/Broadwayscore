    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Opening with 'I loved it' and declaring it 'everything a musical is supposed to be' with multiple positive descriptors indicates strong enthusiasm. Single excerpt warning suggests caution, but the language is unqualifiedly positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, describing the musical as 'everything a musical is supposed to be' with multiple positive attributes. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly positive review. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses strong positive sentiment, calling the musical everything it is supposed to be. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strong praise ('I loved it', 'everything a musical is supposed to be') and highlights multiple production strengths, but as a single curated excerpt it may not represent the full review's balance or any reservations.",
