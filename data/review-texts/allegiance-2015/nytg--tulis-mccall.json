  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'Allegiance' is more of an operetta than a musical. As such the characters find their voices in the music. There is little in the dialog that is remarkable or revealing. There is an interracial love story that livens up the plot, but other than that the story and the blocking are fairly predictable. Which is not to say boring. Because it is the music that tells the tale, and the music is quite wonderful...Ultimately what wins you over is the heart to heart connection. \"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite criticizing predictable story and blocking, the critic emphasizes the 'wonderful' music and emotional connection that 'wins you over,' indicating a qualified positive recommendation. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mildly positive, placed at lower end of bucket. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges predictable elements but praises the music and emotional connection. The excerpt suggests a positive view, but the single quote limits confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges predictable elements but praises the music and the emotional connection, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Confidence is low due to the excerpted nature of the text. | Kimi: While criticizing the unremarkable dialogue and predictable story, the reviewer praises the music as 'quite wonderful' and states the show 'wins you over' through emotional connection, indicating a qualified recommendation.",
