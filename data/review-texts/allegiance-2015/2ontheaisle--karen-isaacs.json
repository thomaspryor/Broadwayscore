    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('excellent job', 'moving and touching', 'delightful music', 'amazed at the joy') but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict representativeness. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'moving and touching' with 'delightful music' and commends the director's work, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning reduces confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive experience, highlighting the joy found in the story and the director's excellent job. The phrase \"moving and touching story with some delightful music\" further supports a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the direction ('excellent job') and describes the show as 'moving and touching' with 'delightful music,' warranting a score in the upper Positive range despite limited available text.",
