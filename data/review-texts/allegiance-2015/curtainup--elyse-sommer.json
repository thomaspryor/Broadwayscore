    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows balanced criticism - acknowledges strong vocal performances but criticizes conventional approach and unmemorable lyrics. Mixed signals with no clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a mixed assessment: it acknowledges the strong vocal performances but criticizes the lyrics and narrative focus. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, so a mid-range Mixed score is appropriate. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a mixed assessment, criticizing the narrative focus while praising the cast's vocal performance. Given the limited text, a 'Mixed' score with low confidence is appropriate. | Kimi: While praising the vocally strong cast, the critic criticizes the lyrics as unmemorable and the narrative focus for weakening the show's political indictment, suggesting a mixed assessment with significant reservations about the material.",
