The carefully researched book by Marc Acito, Lorenzo Thione and Jay Kuo, who also supplied the soaring music and intelligent lyrics, collates years of events into a gripping trajectory, while the stirring score perfectly illustrates the action, seamlessly staged by director Stafford Arima. \"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with superlatives ('soaring music', 'gripping trajectory', 'stirring score', 'seamlessly staged') and enthusiastic tone. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the book, music, lyrics, and direction, describing the musical as 'passionate' and 'gripping'. The positive language suggests a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"darned passionate\", \"gripping trajectory\", and \"stirring score\", suggesting a positive review. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the production's passion, carefully researched book, soaring score, and seamless staging, using words like 'gripping' and 'stirring,' though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
