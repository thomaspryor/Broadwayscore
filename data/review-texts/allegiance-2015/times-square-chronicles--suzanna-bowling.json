    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language throughout ('touching, endearing, well written and passionate', 'will draw you in and touch your soul'). Single excerpt warning suggests caution, but the tone is consistently enthusiastic with no reservations mentioned. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the musical, highlighting its touching and well-written nature. The language suggests a solid recommendation, but the single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"touching, endearing, well written and passionate\" and \"touch your soul.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise describing the show as 'touching,' 'endearing,' and 'important,' with the creative work promising to 'touch your soul.' Given this is a single curated excerpt that may be cherry-picked, confidence is reduced, but the clearly positive language warrants a score at the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
