Director Stafford Arima keeps the action moving at a swift pace...Other elements have needlessly been polished to a Broadway shine, which undermines the story’s truthfulness...'Allegiance,' above all, has heart. And though it sometimes feels as though it’s been molded to fit a preconceived idea of what a Broadway show 'should' look like, the musical’s relevance is a haunting reminder of how fragile and fleeting our freedom can be.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed assessment - praises heart and relevance but criticizes Broadway polish undermining truthfulness and formulaic approach. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges both positive aspects ('heart', 'relevance') and criticisms ('needlessly polished', 'molded to fit'). The overall tone suggests a positive recommendation with reservations. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws but ultimately emphasizes the musical's heart and relevance, suggesting a positive but qualified recommendation. The single excerpt and truncated text reduce confidence. | Kimi: While criticizing the over-polished Broadway production elements that undermine truthfulness, the reviewer ultimately praises the show's heart and powerful relevance, ending on a note that affirms its value despite stylistic flaws.",
