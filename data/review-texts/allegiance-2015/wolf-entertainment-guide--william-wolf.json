  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A majestic and moving musical, 'Allegiance' is strikingly mounted under the direction of Arima...Many hands have helped give the production its impressive look in the face of the challenge of having to cover the sweep of family history as well as the trajectory of the war. 'Allegiance' is a big show, but its success lies in the intimate ways in which it examines its characters and in their connecting emotionally with the audience.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with 'majestic and moving' and 'strikingly mounted', plus emphasis on emotional connection with audience. Single excerpt warning suggests this could be cherry-picked, but the language is consistently positive throughout. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the production's direction and emotional impact, describing it as 'majestic and moving' and highlighting its success in connecting with the audience. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly positive review. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"majestic,\" \"moving,\" and \"impressive.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt features enthusiastic praise using words like 'majestic,' 'moving,' 'strikingly,' and 'success,' indicating a clear recommendation to see the show. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced but the language strongly favors a positive verdict.",
