    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic explicitly states the show's strengths 'outweigh' its weaknesses and calls it 'strong and successful.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's importance and strength, acknowledging minor concerns but ultimately recommending it as strong and successful. The single excerpt warning suggests using the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review states that the strengths outweigh the weaknesses and calls it a 'strong and successful musical' despite 'minor concerns,' indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges weaknesses but states they are outweighed by the production's strengths and importance, calling it a 'strong and successful musical' with 'remarkable' performances.",
