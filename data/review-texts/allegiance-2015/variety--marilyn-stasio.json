  "bwwExcerpt": "The strength of 'Allegiance' is in the story. Not the musical's book, which is no more than serviceable, but the disturbing real-life events behind it. The book by Marc Acito, Lorenzo Thione and Jay Kuo (who also contributed the bland score), does what musicals tend to do when dramatizing major historical events - attempt to 'humanize' complex issues by refracting them through the experiences of a small representative group.",
