    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise for dialogue, performances, and writing quality with terms like 'dynamic,' 'passionate energy,' and 'stimulating performances.' However, confidence is low due to limited text availability. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the dialogue, energy, and performances, indicating a strong positive impression. The mention of humor balancing the heavy topic suggests a well-rounded production. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"dynamic dialogue,\" \"passionate energy,\" and \"stimulating performances.\" Given that this is the only excerpt available, I am scoring it on the higher end of the positive scale. | Kimi: The excerpt contains clearly positive evaluative language ('dynamic,' 'stimulating,' 'brilliant') praising the dialogue, performances, and humor, warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket. However, confidence is low given only a single curated excerpt is available, which may not represent the full review's verdict.",
