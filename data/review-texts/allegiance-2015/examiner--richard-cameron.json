    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Extreme superlatives ('one of the most important musicals ever written', 'triumphant', 'nuclear and deafening') indicate a rave. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking of most positive quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt contains strong praise with terms like 'one of the most important musicals ever written' and 'triumphant,' indicating a highly positive assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using words like \"triumphant\", \"entertaining\", \"heartfelt\", and \"important\". Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains extreme superlatives ('most important musicals ever written', 'triumphant') and unqualified praise for the book, music, and choreography, indicating strong enthusiasm. However, confidence is low given this is a single curated quote that may not represent the full review's balance. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
