Single excerpt warning applied - using upper end of Positive bucket for clearly positive sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a positive view of the show, highlighting its creativity and impact, despite mentioning minor flaws. The single excerpt warning suggests using the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws but ultimately praises the show for its creativity and impact, recommending it despite reservations. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: While the critic notes minor flaws that could be fixed with editing, they ultimately praise the show as 'successful,' 'creative,' and 'affecting,' and commend the cast superlatively. The tone is clearly appreciative and recommends the production.",
