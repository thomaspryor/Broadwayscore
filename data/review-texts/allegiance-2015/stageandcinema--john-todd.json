Tepid storytelling of a powerful event and colorless lyrics, which often repeat what we already know about the characters, keep an interesting story from becoming a good musical.\"\n\nRead more",

The critic finds the material compelling but the execution lacking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the storytelling and lyrics, suggesting the musical fails to capitalize on its potential. The lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning lower confidence in the verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses negative language such as \"tepid storytelling\" and \"colorless lyrics\" to describe the musical, indicating a negative overall assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous criticism of the show's execution ('tepid,' 'colorless') and explicitly states it fails to be good, indicating a negative verdict. Confidence is low due to single-excerpt limitation.",
