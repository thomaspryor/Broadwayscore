  "bwwExcerpt": "'Allegiance,' a new musical about the internment of Japanese-Americans in camps during World War II, could be said to suffer from a problem of divided loyalties, and I'm not referring to its characters. The show wants to illuminate a dark passage in American history with complexity and honesty, but the first requirement of any Broadway musical is to entertain. While well-intentioned and polished, 'Allegiance' struggles to balance both ambitions, and doesn't always find an equilibrium.",

Single excerpt limits full verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's well-intentioned and polished nature but highlights its struggle to balance entertainment with its historical message, suggesting a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges good intentions and polish, but ultimately finds the show struggling to balance its ambitions, suggesting a mixed or lukewarm reception. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show's good intentions and polished production values but emphasizes its fundamental difficulty reconciling serious historical subject matter with Broadway entertainment requirements, indicating an uneven execution without a clear recommendation.",
