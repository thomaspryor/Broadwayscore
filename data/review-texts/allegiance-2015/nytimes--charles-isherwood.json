  "bwwExcerpt": "'Allegiance,' a new musical about the internment of Japanese-Americans in camps during World War II, could be said to suffer from a problem of divided loyalties, and I'm not referring to its characters. The show wants to illuminate a dark passage in American history with complexity and honesty, but the first requirement of any Broadway musical is to entertain. While well-intentioned and polished, 'Allegiance' struggles to balance both ambitions, and doesn't always find an equilibrium.",
