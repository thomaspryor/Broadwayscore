  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The musical is marred by contrived storytelling and slathered-on sentimentality. Through clunky expository dialogue that over-elaborates about everything. implausibly soap-operaish plot turns, and perfunctory songs that alternate between soaring ballads and soaring anthems, 'Allegiance' dramatically wrong-foots it at nearly every turn. What helps improve things are the staging and performances…'Allegiance' relies on a first-rate cast and production to provide its emotional force.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt heavily criticizes the book and songs ('dramatically wrong-foots it at nearly every turn') while acknowledging strong staging and cast. However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict remains uncertain - the complete review might be more balanced. | GPT-4o: The review highlights significant issues with storytelling, dialogue, and plot, describing them as contrived and soap-operaish. While the staging and performances are praised, the overall tone suggests a negative view of the production. | Gemini: The review highlights significant flaws in the storytelling and music, despite acknowledging the strength of the cast and production. The overall tone is negative, indicating a lack of recommendation. | Kimi: The critic heavily criticizes the contrived storytelling, clunky dialogue, and perfunctory songs, but acknowledges that the first-rate cast and production provide emotional force and help improve the flawed material.",
