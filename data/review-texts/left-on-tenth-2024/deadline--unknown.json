Mixed verdict with lean toward disappointment. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'slight' and 'falls short', indicating a lack of strong recommendation. The 'well wishes' sentiment suggests a neutral stance rather than a clear positive or negative verdict. | Gemini: The review calls the show \"slight\" and says it \"falls short\" but ultimately offers \"well wishes\", suggesting a mixed but not negative reaction. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as insubstantial and disappointing compared to the creators' previous work, explicitly stating it falls short. The closing well-wishes are directed at the creators rather than the production itself, indicating no recommendation to see the show.",
