    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt suggests the adaptation doesn't work theatrically despite source material's merits. However, with only one quote available, the full verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the play doesn't translate well to theater and implies it might be better suited as a film or book, indicating a lack of recommendation for the stage production. | Gemini: The review suggests the play has potential but doesn't fully work on stage, indicating a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: The critic finds the adaptation inferior to its source material and unsuited to the theatrical medium, constituting a clear non-recommendation despite limited excerpt availability. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
