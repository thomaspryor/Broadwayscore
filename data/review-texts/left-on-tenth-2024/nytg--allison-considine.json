The final verdict explicitly states it 'shines in moments but struggles to find its footing on stage' - classic mixed review language. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges strong performances and some delightful moments but ultimately suggests the play struggles to translate effectively to the stage, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review is mixed, praising the performances and some moments, but noting that it doesn't fully translate to the stage. The final verdict is that it \"shines in moments but struggles to find its footing on stage.\" | Kimi: The review praises the lead performances highly (Margulies and Gallagher 'spark magic') and calls the story 'delightful,' but consistently criticizes the stage adaptation as inferior to the source material, noting it 'doesn't fully translate to theatre' and has moments that 'fall flat.'",

  "fullText": "Read our review of Left on Tenth on Broadway, a new play adapted from the 2022 memoir by Delia Ephron and starring Julianna Margulies and Peter Gallagher. Delia Ephron’s Left on Tenth has all the hallmarks of a romantic comedy: an urban setting, romantic tension, and perhaps most importantly, adorable dogs. But the play, based on Ephron’s bestselling memoir, may have a greater impact on the page than the stage. And while it would make a charming rom-com film, it doesn’t fully translate to theatre. Borrowing from its origins as a memoir, the play utilizes direct-to-audience dialogue, allowing Delia (Julianna Margulies) and Peter (Peter Gallagher) to break the fourth wall and share personal thoughts. Some of these moments feel cheesy or fall flat, while the shared scenes soar. Margulies and Gallagher spark magic as a widow and widower who learn to open their hearts again after loss. Margulies is especially impressive in the scenes where her character battles leukemia, and Gallagher is incredibly charming and supportive as her partner through it all. Tonally, the play volleys from comedy to melodrama. It is, after all, a true romance story with the patina of grief. The funnier moments come from Peter Francis James and Kate MacCluggage, who portray various characters throughout the play with the help of wigs and accents. Director Susan Stroman adds a sense of lightness to the scene transitions, featuring characters inspired by Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, an early influence on Ephron, and nurses dancing with rolling hospital screens. All in all, the soundtrack of romantic songs and the play’s various settings would likely shine best in the format of a movie, complete with a rom-com montage. Left on Tenth is based on Delia Ephron’s 2022 memoir Left on Tenth: A Second Chance at Life. The stage adaptation chronicles her journey of falling in love again after the loss of her husband, exploring themes of grief, resilience, and the joy of a second chance. Ephron, an award-winning novelist and screenwriter, is best known for collaborating with her sister Nora Ephron on rom-com films like You’ve Got Mail and Sleepless in Seattle. Left on Tenth features the quintessential charming New York City apartment that many Ephron movies showcase. Here, it's a Greenwich Village jewel with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves that feature an Easter egg for You’ve Got Mail fans: the “Shop Around the Corner” plaque. Beowulf Boritt’s impressive moving set takes audiences from Delia’s apartment to Central Park, from the Bay Area to the 9/11 Memorial Pools, and even from a hospital ward to the Wye Valley in Wales. A backdrop with projections of watercolor renderings, designed by Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew, helps transport. Left on Tenth runs 1 hour and 40 minutes, with no intermission. As of publication, Left on Tenth has three audience reviews on the review aggregator Show-Score, mostly praising the performances. Read more audience reviews of Left on Tenth on Show-Score.
