However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is strongly positive about a performance. Given the limited text, I am scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the performance quality, describing it as 'beautiful' and 'deeply grounded in truth,' indicating clear enthusiasm. However, given this is a single curated excerpt without the full review context, confidence is low.",
