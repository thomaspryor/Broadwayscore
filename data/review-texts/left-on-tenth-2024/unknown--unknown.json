    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic suggests the adaptation fails to capture what made the source material compelling, indicating disappointment with the theatrical version. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be part of a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a significant shortcoming in the adaptation, suggesting the play lacks the impactful elements of the memoir. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is negative, suggesting the play avoids important aspects of the source material. Given the limited information, I'm placing it in the negative bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic faults the adaptation for omitting substantial elements from the source memoir, suggesting the production lacks emotional weight. With only this single excerpt available, classification trends toward negative Mixed with reduced confidence.",
