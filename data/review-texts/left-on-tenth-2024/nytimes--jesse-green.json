The comparison to a 'memorial service' suggests something respectful but not engaging or dynamic. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the quality of acting and staging but criticizes the overall impact, describing it as lacking a fully realized theatrical experience. This suggests a mixed review. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like acting and staging, but ultimately finds the show lacking as a theatrical experience, indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic offers genuine praise for the performances and production values but ultimately finds the show lacking theatrical vitality and dramatic impact, creating a balanced but unenthusiastic assessment.",
