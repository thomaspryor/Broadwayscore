Single excerpt warning noted, but the language is unambiguously negative about the show's execution despite acknowledging good intentions. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the play for being superficial and rushed, with a negative tone suggesting disappointment. The lack of depth and reliance on exposition are highlighted as significant flaws. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses disappointment, stating the play is \"frustratingly surface level\" and relies on \"verbose exposition.\" This indicates a negative assessment, but the single excerpt and lack of a full review make confidence low. | Kimi: The critic describes the play as shallow, rushed, and reliant on verbose exposition, with dismissive comparisons to Hallmark sentiments indicating a negative recommendation.",
