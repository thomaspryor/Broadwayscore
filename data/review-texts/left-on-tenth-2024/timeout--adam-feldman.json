    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The comparison to a 'drugstore greeting card' is clearly pejorative, suggesting the show is cheap, artificial, and lacking substance. However, this is only one excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a lack of depth or originality, akin to a 'drugstore greeting card', which implies a mixed sentiment. However, with only one excerpt, the overall tone is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is clearly negative, comparing the show's energy and color scheme to a drugstore greeting card. Given the limited text, the confidence is low, but the negative sentiment is clear. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a mixed assessment praising the show's energy while comparing its visual style to cheap, mass-produced sentimentality. With only one curated quote available per the warning, the overall verdict is unclear but suggests shallow or tacky production values tempering the show's vitality. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Margulies’s Ephron is too glossy to believe, as though this production didn’t trust the appeal of its own story. “No one wants to hear about older people getting it on,” Delia says—“Yes, that’s true!” said an elderly woman behind me, loudly and conclusively—so instead of the adorable real people of Ephron’s memoir we get famously attractive actors getting it over with. Aside from them, however, the show is not very pretty. Directed by Susan Stroman, Left in Tenth has the energy and the color scheme of a drugstore greeting card: This is a cheap-looking production, from Beowulf Boritt’s jankily angled set to Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew’s blotchy projections and the least realistic prop drinks you’ll ever see.",
