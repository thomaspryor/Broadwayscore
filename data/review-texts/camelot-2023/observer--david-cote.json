    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Critic states that to succeed, the revival would need spectacular design, knockout leads, or daring new book, then explicitly says 'all are absent.' This is a clear negative assessment. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential for fuller context in complete review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates the production lacks the necessary elements to be more than a 'museum piece', suggesting disappointment and a lack of recommendation. The absence of 'spectacular design, knockout leads, or a truly daring new book' points to a negative assessment. | Gemini: The critic states that the production lacks the necessary elements to be anything but a museum piece, indicating a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is medium. | Kimi: The critic argues that a successful revival would require spectacular design, knockout leads, or a daring new book, but finds all these elements absent, dismissing the production as a mere 'museum piece' with no compelling reason to see it.",
