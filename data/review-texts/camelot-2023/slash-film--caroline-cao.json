    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic explicitly states they 'can neither recommend or discourage' the show, which is the textbook definition of a mixed review. Single excerpt warning applies - this quote directly captures the critic's neutral stance. | GPT-4o: The critic explicitly states they can neither recommend nor discourage the show, indicating a mixed review. The lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning suggest a low confidence level. | Gemini: The critic explicitly states they can neither recommend nor discourage the show, placing it squarely in the Mixed bucket. The single excerpt and truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states they can neither recommend nor discourage the production, describing it as merely a 'watchable experiment' with 'fractures,' indicating a neutral, ambivalent verdict that fits the Mixed bucket.",
