An evening at the Vivian Beaumont Theater is a theatrical event in and of itself, and I enjoyed a themed cocktail at intermission called Here in Camelot and people-watching at the Lincoln Center complex.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise for energy and performances, but limited scope and focus on venue/atmosphere rather than show substance suggests measured positivity rather than strong enthusiasm. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights energetic and praiseworthy performances, suggesting a positive experience. However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning necessitate a lower confidence and score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the energy and performances, indicating a positive experience, but the lack of a strong concluding statement suggests a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the production's energy and performances, indicating a positive recommendation. However, confidence is low as only one curated excerpt is available, which may not represent the full review's verdict.",
