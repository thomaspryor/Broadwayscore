  "bwwExcerpt": "Once again, Lincoln Center Theater shows that it knows how to amplify a musical. The real singing voices and the real playing of 30 musicians in the pit can be heard. Marc Salzberg and Beth Lake’s sound design merely supports the music; it doesn’t replace the original sound. It’s ironic because when the Vivian Beaumont opened in 1965, the venue was lambasted as the acoustic nightmare of Broadway theaters. Today, it is the last refuge of experiencing Broadway musicals as they were meant to be heard.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction as 'a marvel' and implies a strong positive experience of the musical. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the direction, but mentions the book being messy, suggesting a positive but not rave review. The truncated nature lowers confidence. | Kimi: The critic offers high praise for Sher's direction, calling it a 'marvel' even when the book is at its 'messiest,' and celebrates the production's sound quality as the 'last refuge' of traditional Broadway. While the messy book criticism tempers the enthusiasm, the overall verdict favors experiencing the production.",
