    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows strong praise for direction as 'a marvel' and positions show as essential Broadway experience, but limited text prevents full assessment of overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Sher's direction as a 'marvel' even when the book is messy, suggesting strong overall approval. The phrase 'last refuge of experiencing Broadway musicals as they were meant to be heard' implies a high recommendation. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the direction as a marvel and suggests the show represents Broadway musicals as they should be experienced, indicating a positive recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt offers effusive praise for Sher's direction as a 'marvel' and elevates the show as the 'last refuge' of authentic Broadway musicals, indicating a strong recommendation despite acknowledged messiness in Sorkin's book. Per the single-excerpt warning, confidence is low and the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range.",
