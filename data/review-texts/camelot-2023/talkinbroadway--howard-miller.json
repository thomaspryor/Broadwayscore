  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Bartlett Sher's usually strong hand seems to have focused largely on the staging, which is often quite effective. There is an especially nerve-wracking scene of close swordplay that is a visual highlight of the action. Ultimately, though, this Camelot revival falls on its own sword with its reworked book.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Problematic from the start and still problematic now in Aaron Sorkin's rewritten version, the revival opening tonight...continues to display the general mismatch between the enchanting score, beautifully performed here by both cast and orchestra, and its still-knotty book.”\n\nRead more",

This suggests a divided assessment, but confidence is low due to truncated text that may not include the final verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the enchanting score and performances but criticizes the book as problematic. The mixed assessment of strengths and weaknesses suggests a balanced view without a clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review highlights a mismatch between the score and the book, suggesting a mixed experience. The 'still-knotty book' indicates ongoing issues despite rewrites. | Kimi: The critic praises the 'enchanting' score and 'beautifully performed' cast but finds the book 'problematic' and 'knotty,' indicating a fundamental mismatch that prevents a clear recommendation despite aesthetic strengths. As this is an excerpt only, confidence is reduced.",
