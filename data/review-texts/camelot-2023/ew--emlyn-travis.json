Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper range of Positive. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the absence of 'literal magic' but highlights the presence of 'theater magic', suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt and 'Read more' prompt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges one missing element (literal magic) but emphasizes 'endless' theatrical magic throughout the entire performance, indicating a clear recommendation with only minor caveats.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "More than 60 years after its original Broadway debut, Camelot's overarching message of trying to make the world a better place — even if one should fail along the way — still feels as fresh and resonant as ever. Reinvigorated by Sorkin — who has long painted a dreamy, egalitarian view of politics within his works — and his new book, the musical succeeds in evoking that dream for one brief, shining moment once again.",
