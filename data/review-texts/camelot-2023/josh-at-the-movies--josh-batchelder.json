Despite the single excerpt warning, the strong positive language suggests a high score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Sorkin's writing and the lead performances, calling the production \"truly next level.\" Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I've scored it as a strong positive. | Kimi: The excerpt employs enthusiastic superlatives ('truly next level', 'stunning', 'playful zippiness') indicating a strong recommendation for this production. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence must remain low regarding the full review's overall sentiment.",
