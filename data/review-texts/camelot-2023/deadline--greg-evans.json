  "bwwExcerpt": "Aaron Sorkin works up an answer to that question in the new Lincoln Center Theater production of the 1960 Lerner & Loewe musical, and the result is an adaptation that seems at every turn to be pleading its case for its own relevance. Where the West Wing creator conjured a real sort of writerly sorcery in 2018 with his transformation of the beloved property To Kill A Mockingbird into a new, relevant and thrilling stage work, his efforts this time around often seem strained in their attempts to drag Camelot into the 21st Century.",

However, this is only an excerpt and may not reflect the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the adaptation struggles to find relevance, with efforts described as 'strained'. The lack of a clear positive or negative verdict and the truncated nature of the text lead to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The review compares this adaptation unfavorably to Sorkin's previous work, suggesting it's strained and not entirely successful. This indicates a mixed or lukewarm reception. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes Sorkin's adaptation as strained and overly eager to prove its relevance, unfavorably contrasting it with his previous 'thrilling' work on To Kill A Mockingbird. Given this is only a curated excerpt, confidence is low.",
