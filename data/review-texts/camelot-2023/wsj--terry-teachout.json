The single excerpt warning suggests using the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: Extracted from malformed response | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the production values ('handsomely mounted') and creative choices (successful balance of fidelity and modernization), indicating a clear recommendation. Single excerpt limits confidence.",
