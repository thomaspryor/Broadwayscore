For many fans, that will be worth the ticket.”\n\nRead more",

However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive experience, particularly for fans of the score, but the limited text and the \"for many fans\" qualifier suggest a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production's scale and musical direction, specifically citing the 'glorious' orchestration of the Lerner and Loewe score and explicitly stating it is 'worth the ticket,' indicating a clear recommendation despite limited context.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "But in its place Sorkin and the veteran director Bartlett Sher (“South Pacific,” “The King and I”) jettison much of the fun, too. What remains is a cooler “Camelot,” with its own head-scratching dramaturgy. In making the three central characters — King Arthur (Andrew Burnap), Queen Guenevere (Phillipa Soo) and Sir Lancelot (Jordan Donica) — all tied up in emotional knots yet strangely aloof, the production’s creative team also deprives the show of much of its heart, joy and romance.",
