The review acknowledges positive elements (strong performances, beautiful moments) but delivers an overall ambivalent verdict with significant structural criticisms. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review, and the text describes the production as both 'overstuffed and undercooked' while acknowledging 'strong performances and beautiful moments'. | Gemini: The review uses language like \"overstuffed and undercooked\" while acknowledging \"strong performances and beautiful moments,\" indicating a mixed assessment. The original rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60/100 rating places this in the Mixed bucket, and the text balances significant criticism ('overstuffed and undercooked') with acknowledgment of redeeming qualities ('strong performances and beautiful moments').",
