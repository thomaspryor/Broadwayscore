Why is the atmosphere so drained of color and life? And why does no one appear to be having the tiniest bit of fun?

It's a transmutation that would challenge the wiliest medieval alchemist; the result is arid, a musical that can't decide why anyone is singing.\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning applied but tone is consistently negative throughout. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as lacking magic, color, and life, with a failed attempt to transform it into a historical drama. The tone is strongly negative, indicating a pan. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses disappointment with the production, describing it as melancholy, drained of color and life, and arid. The critic questions why anyone is singing, indicating a lack of enjoyment and purpose in the musical. | Kimi: The excerpt consistently criticizes the production's atmosphere, tone, and conceptual approach, finding it drained of life and magic with fundamental flaws in its adaptation.",
