  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"The pleasure of watching Shucked is not only that it's very funny, it is also a musical comedy comfortable in its merry skin, thanks to Jack O'Brien's equally mischievous direction, full of stop-starts, playing to the audience, and letting the jokes and reaction to the jokes breezily pace the show.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language praising the show as 'very funny' and 'comfortable in its merry skin' with appreciation for the direction, but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for being very funny and well-directed, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, the single excerpt warning means the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the show as \"very funny\" and a \"musical comedy comfortable in its merry skin,\" indicating a positive recommendation. The description of the direction as \"mischievous\" further supports this assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the show's comedy, tone, and direction with phrases like 'very funny' and 'merry skin,' indicating a solid recommendation despite being a single curated quote.",
