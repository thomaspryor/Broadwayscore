    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language praising the show as 'very funny' and 'comfortable in its merry skin' with appreciation for the direction, but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for being very funny and well-directed, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, the single excerpt warning means the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the show as \"very funny\" and a \"musical comedy comfortable in its merry skin,\" indicating a positive recommendation. The description of the direction as \"mischievous\" further supports this assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the show's comedy, tone, and direction with phrases like 'very funny' and 'merry skin,' indicating a solid recommendation despite being a single curated quote.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Then we hear some guards talking to the man she has been talking to. It’s King Arthur. Guenevere visibly wilts under her hooded disguise. She is briefly mortified. The surreally fascinating thing in this Broadway revival of Camelot, directed by Bartlett Sher, is watching this meet-cute curdle into a stultifying, grizzly marriage of two characters with zero chemistry, and then watching that relationship implode entirely—and not really care about its destruction, because this new Camelot doesn’t make us care. Even the swaggering introduction of romantic fly-in-the-ointment Lancelot du Lac (Jordan Donica) doesn’t inject any life.",
