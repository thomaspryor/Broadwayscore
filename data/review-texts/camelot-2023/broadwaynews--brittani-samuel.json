    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt uses strong positive language ('riotous', 'delirious') and draws favorable comparisons to successful shows. However, confidence is low due to limited text from curated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'riotous' and 'delirious', suggesting a highly entertaining and enthusiastic tone. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"riotous\" and compares the show favorably to successful productions. However, due to the limited excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise using words like 'riotous' and 'delirious' and favorably compares the show to hits like 'The Book of Mormon,' suggesting a strong recommendation. However, confidence is reduced to 'low' due to the single-excerpt warning that such quotes may be cherry-picked.",

  "fullText": "Few would call the Middle Ages a period of thriving liberal democracy, but in Aaron Sorkin's modernized upgrade to Lerner & Loewe's 1960 classic \"Camelot,\" the quest for equality abounds. Few would call the Middle Ages a period of thriving liberal democracy, but in Aaron Sorkin’s modernized upgrade to Lerner & Loewe’s 1960 classic “Camelot,” the quest for equality abounds. Protagonist King Arthur is dead set on transforming his loyal but brutish legion of warriors from knights who “behave badly” to ones who use their “might for right.” That idealistic ethos is quintessential Sorkin (creator of “The West Wing,” adaptor of Broadway’s recent “To Kill a Mockingbird”), who — with “Camelot”’ — imbues another historical work with gregarious dialogue, broiling romance and boundless hope for a more just future. The result is an at times dramatically lagging, but consistently polished and warming tale playing out at Lincoln Center’s Vivian Beaumont Theater. Sorkin’s “Camelot” is my first theatrical encounter with the beloved legend King Arthur (Andrew Burnap), Arthur’s betrothed French Princess Guenevere (Phillipa Soo), his right-hand man Sir Lancelot (Jordan Donica), a roundtable of knights and the rest. Sorkin and director Bartlett Sher mercifully thwarted my preconceived notions of blinding chrome costumes and fog-clouded magic, opting for a more grounded fable — one rooted in current political debates about the ethics of national leaders — and executed by a skillful, ethnically diverse cast.",
