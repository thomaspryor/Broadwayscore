    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt uses strong positive language ('riotous', 'delirious') and draws favorable comparisons to successful shows. However, confidence is low due to limited text from curated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'riotous' and 'delirious', suggesting a highly entertaining and enthusiastic tone. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"riotous\" and compares the show favorably to successful productions. However, due to the limited excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise using words like 'riotous' and 'delirious' and favorably compares the show to hits like 'The Book of Mormon,' suggesting a strong recommendation. However, confidence is reduced to 'low' due to the single-excerpt warning that such quotes may be cherry-picked.",
