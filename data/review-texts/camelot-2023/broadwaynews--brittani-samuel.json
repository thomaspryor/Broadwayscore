    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt uses strong positive language ('riotous', 'delirious') and draws favorable comparisons to successful shows. However, confidence is low due to limited text from curated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'riotous' and 'delirious', suggesting a highly entertaining and enthusiastic tone. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"riotous\" and compares the show favorably to successful productions. However, due to the limited excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise using words like 'riotous' and 'delirious' and favorably compares the show to hits like 'The Book of Mormon,' suggesting a strong recommendation. However, confidence is reduced to 'low' due to the single-excerpt warning that such quotes may be cherry-picked.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Filling up all that empty space, however, are some of the American theater’s finest talents. Burnap and Soo are crisp conductors of Lerner and Loewe’s vocal score. Donica as Sir Lancelot is a revelation; Sher architects for him one of the sexiest Broadway entrances I’ve seen all year. Lancelot’s devout zeal for serving the king is complicated by his attraction to Guenevere, sparking a love triangle that earths the fantastical tale in the most human of impulses: desire, jealousy, lust. Lancelot, restrained by his allegiance to the throne, sings “If Ever I Would Leave You” — an aching aria of yearning — to Guenevere, conjuring a level of heat matched only by the balmy, 75-degree weather outside Lincoln Center’s doors. It helps that this song, and the remainder of them, is in the prodigious hands of music director/conductor Kimberly Grigsby and her 30-piece pit orchestra. Grigsby keeps firm control over the spritely percussive swells and thunderous drum rumbles driving the action of “Camelot” forward.",
