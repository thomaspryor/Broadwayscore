    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Praises music, visuals, and performances but identifies a significant failing in emotional weight and dramatic tension. Single excerpt warning applies - this suggests overall mixed reception despite positive elements. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the music and visual elements, but notes a lack of gravitas and danger. With only one excerpt, the review is likely positive but with reservations. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the music, visuals, and actors, but mentions a missing gravitas and danger, suggesting a positive but not rave review. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for technical elements ('superb' music, 'astonishing' visuals) but only faint praise for the actors ('acquit themselves') and explicitly identifies a critical failing: the missing 'gravitas and danger of the situation.' Without explicit recommendation language and with this significant caveat, it reads as a qualified, mixed assessment rather than a clear endorsement. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Positive, gemini=Positive, kimi=Mixed",
