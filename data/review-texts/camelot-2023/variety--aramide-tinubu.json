However, confidence is low due to the excerpt-only nature of the text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as a 'sumptuous feast' and highlights Sorkin's successful adaptation, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, the confidence is low due to the lack of full review context. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the revival as a 'sumptuous feast' and notes that Sorkin's book breathes new life into the classic musical. Given that it is an excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production's visual and auditory splendor as well as Sorkin's successful book adaptation, indicating a clear recommendation despite limited available text.",
