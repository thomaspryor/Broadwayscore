  "bwwExcerpt": "The migrant-worker tragedy 'Of Mice and Men' may be compulsory reading in freshman English, but should it feel like homework for Broadway audiences, too?...We're meant to see in George, and his tough-love tendernesses toward Lennie, the forces of redemption at work. Except we don't see much of anything in Franco's inexpressive countenance. Poised handsomely in work clothes, he registers changes in his features barely perceptibly, as if he is waiting during the 15th take for the camera to pick up the facial nuances...O'Dowd is called on here to convey intellectual slowness in that big, conventionally physical way, with slurred speech and a slightly unfocused gaze. It's a better than serviceable performance under the circumstances; he's doubtless required to fill some of the emotional vacuum left by his co-star.",

However, the brevity of the review limits the depth of evaluation, resulting in medium confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the direction and its faithfulness to the source material, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic assessment. | Kimi: The critic commends the direction for successfully balancing the play's emotional elements and respecting Steinbeck's original work, indicating a worthwhile production without using extreme superlatives.",
