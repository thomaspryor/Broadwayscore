  "bwwExcerpt": "Franco is not terrible; he's an intelligent actor. But his George reveals no shadings of feeling, or internal life. It's a performance that just evaporates. Only Norton, a canny veteran, manages to suggest the poignancy of his trapped character. When one of the other men in the bunkhouse takes Candy's old, deaf dog outside to euthanize her, Candy sits shaken and silent, waiting - along with everyone in the audience - for what seems like minutes, for the sound of the inevitable shot that will tell him the deed is done. It's the only suspenseful moment in an otherwise very long evening.",
