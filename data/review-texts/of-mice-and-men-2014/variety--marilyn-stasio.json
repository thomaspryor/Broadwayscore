  "bwwExcerpt": "James Franco and Chris O'Dowd may be the big draws (and well deserving of all their kudos) in this emotionally devastating revival of John Steinbeck's 'Of Mice and Men.' But the other star of the show is helmer Anna D. Shapiro, who turns in an impeccably mounted production without a single blemish. The ensemble acting is flawless. The design work is breathtaking. And Steinbeck's Depression-based views on the human connections that are our only hope of survival in desperate times are just as relevant -- even imperative -- for living through our own cruel times.",

However, this appears to be a very brief excerpt with no clear recommendation, warranting low confidence. | Gemini: The review uses the term \"workmanlike\" to describe the revival, which suggests a competent but uninspired production. This falls into the mixed category. | Kimi: The term 'workmanlike' signals competent but uninspired execution, placing the assessment in middle ground without strong enthusiasm or condemnation. The extreme brevity indicates this is likely an excerpt with the final verdict cut off.",
