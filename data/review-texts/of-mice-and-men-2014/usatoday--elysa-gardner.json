  "bwwExcerpt": "In the new Broadway production of Mice (* * * ½ out of four stars)...Lennie is played by Irish actor Chris O'Dowd...You wouldn't necessarily recognize him here; his wavy locks shorn to a buzz cut, O'Dowd stoops, suggesting a man either hiding or apologizing for his physical height and might. When Lennie is excited or curious, the fingers on his left hand curl, as if grasping for information he cannot comprehend; when he's afraid, or ashamed, he flinches, like a child being scolded. It's a vivid, sensitive performance of the piece with director Anna D. Shapiro's staging...It's a credit to Shapiro and her company that, in this revival of Mice, hope comes through as powerfully as its ultimate futility.",
