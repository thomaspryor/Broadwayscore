  "bwwExcerpt": "Whereas 'the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry,' the Broadway revival of 'Of Mice and Men' couldn't get much better...The new Broadway production, directed by Anna D. Shapiro ('August: Osage County') with a cast of Hollywood names (James Franco, Chris O'Dowd and Leighton Meester, all making their Broadway debuts) alongside stage regulars (Jim Norton and Ron Cephas Jones), is genuinely gripping, gritty and emotionally shattering. O'Dowd...makes a convincing, full-bodied transformation into the innocently excited, gentle giant Lennie...Franco, a regular presence on film, in the tabloids and even academia, acquits himself very well as George, stressing the character's introspective nature, frustration in trying to protect Lennie from the outside world and the loneliness and guilt that leads him to take on the challenging role of his protector.",
