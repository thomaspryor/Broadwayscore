    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic's own 80 rating places this squarely in Positive territory. The text praises the lead performances as 'effective' and notes successful character portrayals. However, confidence is low due to the very brief excerpt that lacks broader context about the overall production. | Gemini: The review highlights the effective pairing of the actors and their performances, suggesting a positive experience overall, but it is a short review. | Kimi: The explicit rating of 80 and praise for both lead actors' nuanced, effective performances indicate a solid positive recommendation, though the provided text is a brief excerpt.",
