  "bwwExcerpt": "Celebrated director Anna D. Shapiro pulls no punches in her savage take on 'Of Mice and Men'...It certainly helps that she has two gifted performers as her leading men, James Franco and Chris O'Dowd, both making memorable debuts...It's O'Dowd (the doughy Irish actor and comic, of 'Bridesmaids'), as Lennie, who has the hardest job...His Lennie is a human being of emotional intelligence, whose overwhelming feelings often get the better of him. O'Dowd gives an endearing interpretation of a mentally addled man who wants nothing more than 'to live off the fat of the land.' Franco, the performer-director-writer-teacher -- geez, he's such a multitasker that he even appears in a Gucci ad on the back of the Playbill -- is such a cult object that I feared his presence would throw the characters out of equilibrium. My fears were unwarranted, because he gives such an understated and natural performance.",
