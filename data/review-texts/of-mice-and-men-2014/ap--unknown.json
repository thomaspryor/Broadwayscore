  "bwwExcerpt": "There are hordes of teenage girls waiting outside the Longacre Theatre each night hoping to squeal over uber-muffin James Franco. But true theater fans should be waiting for his co-star to emerge. Chris O'Dowd, known more for films like 'Bridesmaids' and 'Friends With Kids,' turns in a very impressive performance as the mentally challenged Lennie in a fine revival of 'Of Mice and Men.' Franco? He's pretty good in his Broadway debut as George, but O'Dowd, in a tricky role, steals the show...O'Dowd, his hair shaved and sporting a bushy beard, beautifully conveys Lennie's innocence, his tics and his toddler-like frustrations. Franco is more standoffish, creating a George who apparently longs to be alone, tries to be decent and squints a lot.",
