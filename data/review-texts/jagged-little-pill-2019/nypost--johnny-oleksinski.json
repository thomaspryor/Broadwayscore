  "bwwExcerpt": "More social issues are addressed in 'Jagged Little Pill' than at a Democratic presidential debate. Opioid addiction, race, bisexuality, sexual assault - the Alanis Morissette musical, which opened Thursday night on Broadway, has got 'em all. But, like trying to shove Elizabeth Warren's entire platform into a single evening, nearly every topic gets short shrift.",
