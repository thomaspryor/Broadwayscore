No positive elements mentioned to offset the criticism. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for lacking subtlety and feeling forced, indicating a negative assessment without any redeeming praise. | Gemini: The review is clearly negative, criticizing the show's writing and integration of Morissette's songs. The phrase \"subtlety of a sledgehammer\" indicates a lack of nuance and a negative experience. | Kimi: The review describes the show as manufactured ('written by committee') and criticizes the heavy-handed integration of songs ('shoehorned') and themes ('subtlety of a sledgehammer'), indicating a clear negative assessment.",
