  "bwwExcerpt": "You'd be surprised. 'Jagged Little Pill' is no blast-from-the-past jukebox musical but an urgent, rock-driven slice of modern life that tackles nearly every issue of the day: sexual identity, opioid addiction, racial tension, rape. As its writer, Oscar winner Diablo Cody ('Juno'), has readily admitted, just about anything with a hashtag is in here. What makes 'Jagged Little Pill' work so well is its multigenerational storyline, a self-aware sense of humor and Morissette's surprisingly sturdy songs. (The production includes selections from other albums and two new numbers by Morissette.)",
  "bwwScore": 8
