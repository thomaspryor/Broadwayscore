  "bwwExcerpt": "Along the way, we go through protests, marriage counseling, back-alley opioid scores, bitchy Connecticut coffee klatches, an overdose, and an extremely bad breakup. That's when Jo discovers Frankie in bed with another classmate, Phoenix (Antonio Cipriano) - 'He was wearing dog tags with no shirt like a douche,' Jo yells - and vents with 'You Oughta Know.' Patten starts the first halting words in almost a whisper: 'I want you to know / That I'm happy for you.' But as the song builds in volume and intensity, it's clear she's not simply singing; she's trying to pull the love out of her body. It's an emotional exorcism - and a performance that leaves her, and the audience, exhausted and exhilarated after its rock-concert-level conclusion.",
