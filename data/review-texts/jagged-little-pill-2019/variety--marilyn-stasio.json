  "bwwExcerpt": "Right from the start, the audience feels under attack by the fierce hormonal energy of angsty adolescents and the unfocused anxiety of their parents. Unsurprisingly, 'All I Really Want' is right up there, close to the top of the show, with the entire company articulating their inexpressibly painful needs. The spastic movements devised by choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui provide a brilliantly crazed energy that smartly reflects their raging hormones and unfocused outrage. Even Emily Rebholz's rag-bag costumes contribute to the disjointed adolescent emotions that overflow the stage.",

This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the show's use of source material while implying structural weaknesses elsewhere, suggesting inconsistent quality without a clear recommendation to attend.",
