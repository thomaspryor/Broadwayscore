  "bwwExcerpt": "But turn that record over. On Broadway, Jagged Little Pill harnesses the hyperemotionalism of its source to shake off the cynicism and formulaic strictures of the typical jukebox musical. Yes, its plot is shaky and contrived, its songs - and there are so, so many of them - histrionic. It seizes on enough hot-button issues - sexual assault, the opioid epidemic, internet addiction, workaholism, misogyny, sex and gender identity, and OK, sure, gun violence, too - to singe the first row. It is, indisputably, too much and that too muchness is what makes it so watchable.",
