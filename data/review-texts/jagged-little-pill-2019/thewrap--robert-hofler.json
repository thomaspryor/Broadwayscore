  "bwwExcerpt": "Cody makes her Broadway debut with the book for 'Pill,' and the 'Juno' screenwriter gives Mary Jane enough trauma to trigger a dozen somber musicals, much less one bad flashback. She's called Mary Jane because otherwise Morissette's song 'Mary Jane' from the album wouldn't fit into the stage show. No matter that the song is about marijuana and that a woman born to clueless parents in the late 1960s would have shortened it to Mary to avoid all those inevitable jokes about guys wanting to smoke her stash. Jonathan Deans' sound design for 'Pill' is so mushy you won't be able to understand the lyrics (by Morissette and Glen Ballard) anyway. Do remember, every character in 'Pill' has a lot of crap to get off his, her or their chest.",
