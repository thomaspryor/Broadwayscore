  "bwwExcerpt": "Songs from Jagged Little Pill, augmented by others from Morrisette's back catalogue and two new ones written for the show, are folded into the story. The numbers themselves, spiky with adolescent angst and a more pronounced sense of outrage over how the female of the species is abused regardless of age, have lost none of their power. (I say this as someone who must have been AWOL when the album was released, but who found the songs as pungent and on target as if they'd been written today.) That doesn't save JLP from a bit of Mamma Mia-itis, which is what happens when a story is meant to frame a song list (there's also additional music by Morrisette and Glen Ballard), but the songs don't always quite fit, requiring a slather of narrative mortar.",
