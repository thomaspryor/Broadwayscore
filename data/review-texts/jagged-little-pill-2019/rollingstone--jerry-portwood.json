  "bwwExcerpt": "Because, of course, it's Morissette's music that saves the day. After the floodgates open with 'You Oughta Know,' the star of the show, MJ (a stunning Elizabeth Stanley), takes over, writhing on her sofa in the grips of an opioid overdose, singing the Grammy-winning 'Uninvited,' with a doppelgänger dancer-demon mimicking her agony. 'Hand in My Pocket' brings a grin. 'Head Over Feet' is adorable. 'Ironic' gets big laughs because it's set amid a high-school creative-writing workshop and invokes all the criticisms that have been launched at the song's quirky lyrics: It's not ironic, y'all! And the sublime movement by Belgian choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui (who also choreographed sequences in Beyoncé and Jay-Z's 'Apeshit' video) recalls the spastic, emotive motion you'd recognize from a Sia music video.",
