  "bwwExcerpt": "But Next to Normal has a strong focus on a single story, and an original score created to support that focus. Morissette's songs, most of them cowritten with Glen Ballard, weren't designed for that work. Cody has found clever places for some of them-'Ironic' is framed, self-deprecatingly, as a high school student's gangly attempt at writing poetry-but the balance is off. Two of Morissette's definitive numbers, 'Hand in My Pocket' and 'You Oughta Know,' are assigned to the side character of Frankie's sort-of-girlfriend, Jo (a first-rate Lauren Patten); the latter is a bona fide showstopper, but it's too big a moment for its place in a romantic subplot. And the show's defining incident-the sexual assault of Nick's friend Bella (Kathryn Gallagher) at a house party-is fleshed out much less fully, with a generic rich-white-jock predator as the villain. At a certain point, it starts to feel like several after-school specials crammed into one.",

The review acknowledges flaws but ultimately describes the show as 'affecting' with 'surprising depth', indicating a recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The critic explicitly calls the show \"affecting\" and notes its \"surprising depth,\" but also acknowledges that it is \"flawed.\" The critic's rating of 80 aligns with a positive assessment. | Kimi: The critic assigns an 80/100 rating and describes the show as 'affecting' with 'surprising depth,' indicating a recommendation despite acknowledging it is 'flawed.'",
