The review acknowledges flaws but ultimately describes the show as 'affecting' with 'surprising depth', indicating a recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The critic explicitly calls the show \"affecting\" and notes its \"surprising depth,\" but also acknowledges that it is \"flawed.\" The critic's rating of 80 aligns with a positive assessment. | Kimi: The critic assigns an 80/100 rating and describes the show as 'affecting' with 'surprising depth,' indicating a recommendation despite acknowledging it is 'flawed.'",
