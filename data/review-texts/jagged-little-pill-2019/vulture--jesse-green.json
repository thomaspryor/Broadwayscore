However, the text is too brief to determine the overall recommendation with confidence. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the show excels in certain aspects (the rock concert elements) but implies a lack of cohesion or success as a traditional musical. This indicates a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review suggests the musical aspects are weaker, but praises the rock concert elements, indicating a mixed experience. | Kimi: While praising the cast's vocal performances, the critic implies the show fails as a cohesive musical and only succeeds when abandoning theatrical conventions for concert format. As an excerpt under 150 words with ambiguous final verdict, confidence is low.",
