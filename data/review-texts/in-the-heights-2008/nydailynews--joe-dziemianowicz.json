The original rating of 80 aligns with a solid positive classification. | Gemini: The review uses very positive language, calling the musical a 'blast of fresh air' and 'exuberant.' The critic's rating of 80 aligns with a positive assessment. | Kimi: The critic's own 80/100 rating places this firmly in the Positive bucket (70-84), and the excerpt contains enthusiastic praise ('exuberant,' 'blast of fresh air'), though the brevity of the excerpt warrants reduced confidence.",
