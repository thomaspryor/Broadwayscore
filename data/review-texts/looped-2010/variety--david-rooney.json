The praise for Valerie Harper's performance supports a positive score, though the 'slight' descriptor suggests some reservations. | Gemini: The review describes the play as \"slight but entertaining\" and praises Valerie Harper's performance, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic finds the play 'slight' (insubstantial), the description 'entertaining' and praise for Harper's 'committed performance' constitutes a qualified recommendation to see it.",
