This indicates a recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review states that the actors' joy is infectious, making it likely that the audience will enjoy the show, even if they don't fully understand it. This indicates a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: Critic delivers enthusiastic praise for the lead performances, describing them as 'infectious' and likely to entertain even if the plot is confusing, indicating a clear recommendation based on the stars' work.",
