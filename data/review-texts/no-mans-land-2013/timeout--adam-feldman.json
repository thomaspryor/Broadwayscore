The key quote highlights the success of the production, particularly due to the performances and the use of Pinter's language. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the production 'succeeds,' indicating a positive assessment. The focus on the actors and the language suggests a recommendation based on these strengths. | Kimi: The critic explicitly rates the production 80/100 and states it 'succeeds' while praising the lead performances, indicating a solid recommendation despite the brief excerpt.",
