    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of the actors but does not provide a clear overall verdict on the production. The lack of a full review text and the absence of strong evaluative language lead to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the actors' performances but doesn't offer a clear recommendation for the play itself. Without a more definitive statement, it's difficult to classify beyond a mixed assessment, and the limited text reduces confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers specific, appreciative evaluations of the lead actors' contributions, using theatrical terms like 'manic engine' and 'anchors the evening' that indicate effective performances. However, as a curated excerpt focusing solely on acting without broader context about the production's overall merit or the critic's final verdict, confidence remains low.",
