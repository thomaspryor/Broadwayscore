  "bwwExcerpt": "Judged as a showcase, American Buffalo works beautifully. Rockwell has exactly the right tools to crack the Mamet safe. His half-whine, half-growl voice sings in what Todd London evocatively called the writer's 'fricative riffs' - unsurprisingly, given how well he's suited to other writers of masculine lyric like Martin McDonagh. Fishburne, judging his rhythms to the nanosecond, grips the play and captains it, and it's lucky that the close quarters of Circle in the Square allow you to see the details of his casual command. Criss, too, does fine work as the play's slow-minded straight man, though he finds fewer details in his character than the other two men.",

However, confidence is low due to the very limited text available. | Gemini: The critic highlights the strong performances of the three leads and how they make the play feel both contemporary and classical, indicating a positive experience. | Kimi: The critic praises the lead performances and the production's successful balance of contemporary relevance and classical style, indicating a solid recommendation without reservations.",
