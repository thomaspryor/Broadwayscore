The phrase \"master class\" also suggests a high level of quality, leading to a positive score. | Kimi: The critic employs superlative language ('master class') and praises the principal performances as crackling with 'desperate energy,' delivering an unqualified enthusiastic recommendation without caveats. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
