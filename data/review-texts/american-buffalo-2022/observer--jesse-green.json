Given single excerpt warning and strong language, scored in upper Positive range, though medium confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as a 'masterclass in acting' with 'powerhouse performances,' suggesting a strong positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is at the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the acting as a \"masterclass\" and highlights the \"powerhouse performances,\" indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt uses strong praise ('masterclass,' 'powerhouse') specifically for the acting, suggesting a clear recommendation, but limited to one curated quote warranting caution.",
