Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt concludes with \"must-see\", indicating a strong positive recommendation. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: While noting the production doesn't pack the wallop of previous iterations, the critic explicitly designates it a 'must-see' for its thrills, indicating a strong recommendation. Single excerpt limits confidence.",
