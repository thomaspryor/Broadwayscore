However, this is only an excerpt so confidence is medium. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the performances and direction, highlighting the show's vitality compared to other revivals. The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but the lack of a full review text limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the performances and direction, indicating a positive experience. However, due to the truncated nature of the text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the performances ('superbly performed') and direction ('finding every comic beat'), noting the production retains a vitality missing from other recent revivals. While clearly positive, the limited excerpt warrants reduced confidence.",
