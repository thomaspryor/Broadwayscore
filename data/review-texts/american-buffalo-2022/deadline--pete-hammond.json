    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with 'crackles with electricity,' 'superb actors,' and calling it 'arguably Mamet's best work.' However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the production and actors, describing it as 'crackling with electricity' and featuring 'superb actors'. The mention of Mamet's best work suggests a high level of enthusiasm. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"crackles with electricity\" and \"superb actors at the top of their game.\" Given the single excerpt, I am scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Despite limited context, the excerpt uses strongly positive language ('crackles with electricity,' 'superb actors') to praise both the production energy and performances, indicating an enthusiastic recommendation.",
