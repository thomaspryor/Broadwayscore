However, this is only one excerpt from a longer review, so the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a lack of engagement with the production, describing it as 'little more than an acting exercise,' which implies a negative assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic states the production feels like \"little more than an acting exercise,\" indicating a negative assessment. Given it is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the production as insubstantial and hollow, describing it as merely an 'acting exercise' rather than a fully realized theatrical work, indicating a clear negative verdict despite the limited excerpt available.",
