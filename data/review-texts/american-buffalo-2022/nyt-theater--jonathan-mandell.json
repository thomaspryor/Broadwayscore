  "bwwExcerpt": "So, I'll resist analyzing 'American Buffalo,' avoid trying to figure out whether the original interpretations of it still hold up, given what we now know about Mamet's beliefs. That leaves me with a production that feels like little more than an acting exercise.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "the challenge of the roles..is for the actors to master the timing of the street poetry in such a way that their performances are both thrilling and  believable as human beings. And only one of the three came close to doing all that for me: Sam Rockwell. Admittedly, he has it the easiest.

However, with only excerpted text ending in 'Read more', the full verdict may be missing, requiring low confidence. | GPT-4o: The review highlights a challenge in the roles and notes that only one actor, Sam Rockwell, came close to meeting it, suggesting a mixed performance overall. The excerpt is limited, so the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the performances, with only one actor standing out. The truncated text makes it difficult to determine the overall recommendation, but the focus on a single positive performance suggests a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic singles out Sam Rockwell as the only cast member who successfully meets the challenges of the role, implying disappointment with the other two performances in this three-character play. With only excerpts available and the review truncated, the full verdict is unclear, but the visible criticism suggests a mixed assessment at best.",
