    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'clear, straightforward, and intelligent' with an 'unbelievable cast' and suggesting it may be 'the best to date.' Single excerpt warning noted, but this is clearly positive with high praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's pacing and clarity, and suggests it may be the best rendition to date. Despite only having a single excerpt, the positive tone is clear. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong praise for the direction and cast, suggesting this production is the best to date. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive sentiment is clear. | Kimi: Despite the limitation of a single excerpt, the language is strongly positive ('unbelievable cast', 'best to date'), warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket per scoring guidelines for clearly positive isolated quotes.",
