  "fullText": "★★★★☆ The cult musical's Broadway revival highlights its addictive ABBA melodies and lively Tim Rice lyrics.\n\nIn 2008, before a two-night Chess concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London, lyricist Tim Rice reflected on the beloved, broken musical he wrote with Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus: \"Chess has been that kind of wayward child—you know, that one on drugs that you hope will get right.\"\n\nWe'll spare you a complete chronicle of the show's checkered past; that's why we have theater message boards and subreddits. Chess began in 1984 as a hit concept album. The 1986 West End production ran for three years, despite a rocky start. However, the 1988 reworked Broadway version closed after only two months, launching Chess into the pantheon of prized but probably unproduceable musicals.\n\nNow, Tony-winning director Michael Mayer (Spring Awakening) and Emmy-winning writer Danny Strong are playing the game in the musical's first-ever Broadway revival, a shamelessly enjoyable production that puts the spotlight on its best asset: the score.\n\nIf you've never seen, or heard, Chess, trust us. Every song is a banger, and the stars—Nicholas Christopher as Russian chess champion Anatoly Sergievsky, Aaron Tveit as American champ Freddie Trumper, and Lea Michele as Florence Vassy—know it. You'll never hear a better \"Anthem,\" the sweeping love-of-country ode that brings down the Act 1 curtain, and the house, than Christopher's. Tveit goes for broke—and hits every crazy high note—on the electrifying \"Pity the Child.\"\n\nWhether Chess-heads will vibe with Strong's overhauled libretto likely depends on their taste for metadrama. The role of the Arbiter (Bryce Pinkham, needlessly amped up to 11) has been expanded into a genial, omniscient narrator.\n\nBut back to the chess. We \"see\" one match between the volatile, mentally unstable Freddie and the mechanical, detached Anatoly; cleverly, they face the audience, whispering their unfiltered thoughts into microphones.\n\nFor those who miss the board and pieces, and complain that no chess is actually being played, have you ever watched a chess match? Florence, Freddie, Anatoly, and Anatoly's estranged wife, Svetlana (Suffs breakout Hannah Cruz)—they're the chess pieces. Russian coach/possible KGB agent Alexander Molokov (Broadway vet Bradley Dean, exceptional) and CIA officer Walter de Courcey (Sean Allan Krill) are moving them around.\n\nThis all makes Chess sound rather dour, and it's anything but. The show looks sensational: Lighting designer Kevin Adams washes the stage in American blue and Russian red, to eye-popping painterly effect. The 16-member ensemble moves with striking precision thanks to choreographer Lorin Latarro. The Act 2 curtain-raiser, \"One Night in Bangkok,\" is a buzzy delight.\n\nThere will be much ado, and much debate, about the ending—which we won't reveal here. But it's the 11 o'clock number, \"Someone Else's Story,\" that's bothering me. Unsurprisingly, Michele's rendition is wonderful, even if she's plagued by sound-mixing issues. It just comes out of nowhere—an emotional moment manufactured simply to give the star a chance to shine.\n\nIt's been 40 years—how long can we spend trying to fix all the fractured parts of Chess? I can't help but think of kintsugi. Literally \"golden joinery,\" the ancient Japanese art form mends broken items with a mix of lacquer and powdered metal. The idea: Don't hide the cracks; rather, celebrate their beauty. Embrace the imperfections.",
  "dtliExcerpt": "If you’ve never seen, or heard, Chess, trust us. Every song is a banger, and the stars—Nicholas Christopher as Russian chess champion Anatoly Sergievsky, Aaron Tveit as American champ Freddie Trumper, and Lea Michele as Florence Vassy, a top chess strategist and the woman loved by both—know it. You’ll never hear a better “Anthem,” the sweeping love-of-country ode that brings down the Act 1 curtain, and the house, than Christopher’s. (Sorry, Josh Groban.) Tveit goes for broke—and hits every crazy high note—on the electrifying “Pity the Child.” And are these Rice’s best-ever lyrics? A personal favorite: “I see my present partner/ In the imperfect tense,” from Michele’s killer power ballad “Nobody’s Side.”",
