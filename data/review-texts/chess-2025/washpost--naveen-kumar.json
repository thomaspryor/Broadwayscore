    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The phrase 'unwieldy but rousing hot mess' captures both criticism and praise - acknowledging flaws while finding energy and ambition. The single excerpt limitation requires conservative scoring within the mixed range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'unwieldy' and a 'hot mess,' which suggests significant flaws, but also 'rousing' and ambitious, indicating some redeeming qualities. This points to a mixed review with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review calls the show a \"rousing hot mess\", which implies it is enjoyable despite its flaws. Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring conservatively.",
