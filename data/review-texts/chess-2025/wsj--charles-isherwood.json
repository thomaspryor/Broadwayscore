    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Praises the singing as 'always superb' but expresses significant reservations about the show's dramatic impact overall. The 'but' construction and 'one still wishes' indicates disappointment despite acknowledging quality elements. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the singing but criticizes the lack of dramatic impact, suggesting a mixed review. The single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the singing but expresses a desire for more dramatic impact, indicating a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the vocal performances as 'superb' but delivers a significant critique that the production 'as a whole' lacks sufficient dramatic intensity or 'bite,' indicating a middle-of-the-road assessment with notable reservations about the show's overall impact.",
