Single excerpt warning requires conservative scoring within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the superb singing but criticizes the lack of dramatic impact, indicating a mixed reception. The single excerpt suggests a balance of positives and negatives, leading to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The review acknowledges superb singing but expresses a desire for more dramatic bite, indicating a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to a score in the middle of the Mixed range.",
