  "fullText": "After the revelatory 2023 revival of “Merrily We Roll Along,” which finally clarified another difficult 80s musical, there was hope that “Chess” might enjoy a similar breakthrough. This isn’t that breakthrough. But when the commentary dies down and the music takes over, the show soars, proving again why people keep trying to resurrect it. As drama, “Chess” remains a puzzle. As a concert, though, it can be thrilling—and in this production, that’s what ultimately wins.",
