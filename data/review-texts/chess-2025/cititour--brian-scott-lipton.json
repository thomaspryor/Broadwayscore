Even with (and partly due to) a heavily revised book by Danny Strong, the show remains a rather convoluted tale about three members of international chess royalty struggling to find personal and professional happiness while being used as pawns in a political power struggle between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. \r\n\r\nNot that any of that matters to the show’s many fans. And, without question, if you want to hear its irresistibly catchy score, penned by ABBA’s Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus along with EGOT winner Tim Rice, superbly sung by the powerhouse trio of Lea Michele, Aaron Tveit, and Nicholas Christopher, the Imperial Theatre is where you’ll want to be. \r\n\r\nSince I don’t have space to discuss the many iterations of “Chess,” let me make this version as simple as possible. This go-round, “Chess” is a meta-musical with the snarky Arbiter (a well-cast Bryce Pinkham) presenting the show in flashback and providing both necessary exposition of the plot and some humorous (if arguably unnecessary) political commentary, comparing the actions of Cold War-era politicians to today’s leaders.\r\n\r\nStill, the show’s basic love triangle remains the musical’s main attraction. Initially, the show focuses on the arrogant, severely bipolar American chess champion Freddie Trumper (Tveit), who has been romantically involved for many years with his “second,” the brilliant but frustrated strategist Florence Vassy (Michele). \r\n\r\nFinally fed up with his antics and put-downs, she quickly falls deeply in love with his opponent, Russia’s seemingly single-minded star player Anatoly Sergievsky (Christopher), with whom she previously had a brief dalliance. Eventually, Florece agrees to run away with him to the UK, even though he’s married and has children.\r\n\r\nWhen the threesome reunite in Bangkok three years later for another tournament, the more stable Freddie – still in love with Florence -- has become a TV commentator, while Anatoly is now facing a new Russian competitor, as well as the reappearance of his wife Svetlana (a fine Hannah Cruz), who wants him to return to Russia so she can feel safe in their country.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, there a two strong-willed outside forces influencing the match (as they did the first time): single-minded CIA agent Walter De Courcy (a droll Sean Allan Krill), who cares nothing about chess or individual people, and Anatoly’s former coach, KGB agent Alexander Molokov (an imposing Bradley Dean) who threatens possible nuclear war if Anatoly doesn’t throw the match and the Americans don’t stop their NATO exercises. Got all that?\r\n\r\nIntriguingly, director Michael Mayer has opted for an Encores-like staging with the orchestra on stage and a minimal yet effective set by David Rockwell (aided by Peter Negrini’s excellent projection design and Kevin Adams’ customarily first-rate lighting).\r\n\r\nThere is also a large, gray-suited ensemble (costumes by Tom Broecker), who are almost always onstage executing Lorin Latarro’s energetic choreography (which is best spotlighted in the Act 2 opener, the now-legendary “One Night in Bangkok,” which features Tveit thrusting in his tight tighty-whities and some bare-chested male dancers who must spend every waking hour in a local gym).\r\n\r\nStill, a lot of this production consists of the leads simply standing and belting their big numbers to the roof (which is, honestly, why most of the audience came). Michele remains a truly mind-blowing vocal powerhouse, whether blasting through the rock-infused “Nobody’s Side” or investing fully in the introspective ballad, “Someone Else’s Story” (which perhaps unwisely has been moved to the 11 o’clock number slot, where it fits less snugly than it did originally).\r\n\r\nGiving what I think is his best-ever Broadway performance – actually making us feel sorry for the difficult Freddie -- Tveit stops Act II in its tracks with his extraordinary rendition of the ultra-difficult “Pity the Child,” a rather belated exposition-song detailing his unhappy childhood. \r\n\r\nChristopher, while decidedly impressive, is a tad too robotic (and uses an odd accent that doesn’t really sound Russian). As a result, his first-act closer, the gorgeous “Anthem,” while still stirring, doesn’t quite measure up to the definite version by original Broadway star David Carroll.\r\n\r\nFrankly, for all its great songs, “Chess” contains a few too many clunkers (including a dull new solo for Svetlana, “He is a Man, He is a Child”) to go along with its overstuffed book -- resulting in a bloated running time that exceeds two and a half hours. \r\n\r\nStill, thanks to its superb stars, “Chess” remains a knight – I mean night -- to remember.\n By Brian Scott Lipton\n\nVisit the Sitehttps://chessbroadway.com/Open/Close DatesOpening 11/16/2025Closing Open-ended\nTheatre Info\nImperial Theatre249 West 45th StreetNew York, NY 10036 Map\n\nCititour.com is your guide to interesting places throughout New York City.
