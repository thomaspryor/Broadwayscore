The single excerpt indicates a mixed impression, with some redeeming qualities. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights the actors' ability to find depth despite the show's overt emotionality, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic assessment. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring conservatively.",
