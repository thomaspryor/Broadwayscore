  "fullText": "Aaron Tveit, Lea Michele, and Nicholas Christopher star in the rock opera by Tim Rice and the ABBA guys.\n\nHonestly, how can it not be when you have Aaron Tveit, Nicholas Christopher, Lea Michele, and Hannah Cruz coming front and center and singing like their lives depend on it? Strong's revision centers the first act around the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) of the Carter-Brezhnev era and the second during the 1983 Able Archer nuclear war scare of the Reagan presidency. So, in the high-stakes context of the story, they do.\n\nThe initial match is between Freddie Trumper (Tveit), bipolar American chess world champion, and sad sack Soviet Anatoly Sergievsky (Christopher). If Anatoly loses, he'll almost certainly be disappeared by the KGB. But does that matter when Freddie's public antagonism of Russia leads to breakdown of SALT II? That's when CIA operative Walter De Courcey (Sean Allan Krill) approaches Anatoly's coach, Alexander Molokov (Bradley Dean), with a proposition: bring the Soviets back to the negotiating table, and America will ensure paranoid Freddie's defeat\n\nAmid the international intrigue is a love-rectangle. Freddie is on the outs with girlfriend and coach, Florence Vassy (Michele), a Hungarian refugee who once had a fling with Anatoly. When Freddie quits the match and their relationship implodes, Florence and newly minted champion Anatoly defect to England. Enter his estranged wife, Svetlana (Cruz) and their children, who become political pawns themselves in a match that could spell the end of the world—theirs, and everyone else's.\n\nIf the original Broadway production was about \"nothing except the authors' own pompous pretentions,\" as Frank Rich said in his review, this revival is at least about something; namely, Strong's self-satisfied meta-commentary that underscores the contemporary parallels in bright red ink, because, of course, none of us are smart enough figure it out on our own.\n\n\"So the Americans and the Russians team up to defeat Freddie Trumper, an attempted partnership so unusual it wouldn't be seen again for many decades until RFK Jr. attempted to team up with the worm in his brain\"—\n\n\"With a reckless arrogance that would be seen again many decades later when Joe Biden decided to run for re-election…the KGB decides to use an international crisis to help win back the championship\"—\n\nThat Bryce Pinkham, as narrator-cum-chess arbiter, delivers these heaps of Rossiyskiy without rolling his eyes is nothing short of heroic. The milquetoast titters they receive from the house tell you all you need to know about these \"jokes\" that suck the air out of the plot.\n\nA show that wears its emotions so nakedly on its sleeve is not a place where you typically find earth-shattering nuance, so it's surprising how deep the actors manage to dig amid the bombast and goofiness. Florence is still woefully underwritten role, but Michele knows exactly how to build and sell a power ballad like \"Someone Else's Story,\" now given the 11 o'clock slot. Cruz, onstage only in Act 2, brings a wealth of honesty to Svetlana, even though she, too, is basically a throwaway. Seems a show with exactly one woman on its primary creative team doesn't know how to deal with its female characters—go figure.\n\nNaturally, the men are well-served. Krill and Dean make the most of their asides, trading barbs with the timing of seasoned comedians. Owning the stage with ego-driven confidence, Tveit is the best he's ever been, a livewire act of charisma and bravado. And, mark my words, this is Christopher's star-making vehicle. His \"Anthem\" at the end of the first act is the kind of showstopper that will be remembered long after the specifics of this production have been forgotten. Remarkably, it's topped by his electrifying \"Endgame\" much later on.\n\nMayer is a savvy-enough director to know exactly where the big moments are and how to keep focus there.
