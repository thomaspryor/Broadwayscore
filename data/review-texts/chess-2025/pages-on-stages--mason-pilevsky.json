    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear disappointment with the book/rewrites but acknowledges the music as a positive element. The 'though' suggests partial redemption but disappointment dominates. | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses disappointment with the rewrites, but acknowledges the music as a positive aspect. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, so a score in the negative range is appropriate, but not too low due to the positive note on the music. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates disappointment with the rewrites, although the music is still enjoyable. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic expresses strong disappointment with the rewritten book ('deeply disappointing') while conceding that the score remains effective ('music still hits home'), indicating a mixed verdict with significant reservations about the production changes. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",
