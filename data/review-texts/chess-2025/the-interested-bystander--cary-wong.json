    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the musicians and ensemble, indicating a positive view of the musical elements. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the musicians, cast, ensemble, and songs, but it's a single excerpt, so confidence is low. I'm placing it at the lower end of the positive range because it's not overwhelmingly enthusiastic. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains clearly positive language ('terrific', 'gorgeous') praising the musicians and ensemble, warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket per instructions for cherry-picked excerpts.",
