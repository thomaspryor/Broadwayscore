The language suggests a lack of recommendation, but the text is truncated, so the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the infectious score but also points out the ongoing struggle with the story, indicating a mixed assessment. The phrase 'still struggles' suggests it hasn't overcome its issues.",
