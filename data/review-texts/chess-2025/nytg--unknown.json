The lack of a full review or clear recommendation leads to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The provided text focuses solely on the lighting design, offering a positive comment on that aspect. Without further context or a clear overall assessment of the show, it's difficult to determine a definitive recommendation. I'm placing it in the 'Mixed' bucket with low confidence due to the truncated nature of the review.",
