  "fullText": "The received wisdom is that the book has always been the problem with Chess, if only—as so many have attempted—the book could be fixed. But, as the much-anticipated revival of Sir Tim Rice and Abba's Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus' 1986 musical on Broadway reveals, Chess is its own cabinet of curiosities, and it delights in displaying them all on stage in real time as brashly as its two peacocking competitors, the Russian Anatoly Sergievksy (Nicholas Cristopher) and the American Freddie Trumper (Aaron Tveit).\n\nWe barely see any chess played between them in this almost three-hour musical endurance test (Imperial Theatre, booking to May 3, 2026). But rather like a chess match, the show (directed by Michael Mayer, with a new book by Danny Strong), stares down each one of its own structural and narrative flaws, fixes the audience with a challenging glare, then makes a series of moves best known to itself to win our attention.\n\nThe show—less about chess, more about the possible end of the world because of Russian-American tensions—works in enough fits and starts to cohere, and in a few sung moments to actually thrill, thanks to the go-for-broke commitment of Christopher, Tveit, and Lea Michele as Florence, Freddie's lover and chess strategist. The trio are differently excellent performers, who try—ultimately in vain—to make Chess' characters and story intelligible.\n\nThe also-excellent Bryce Pinkham almost upstages them as the Arbiter, who archly narrates events with pointed present-day commentary inserted. An ensemble of dancers, when not leaping and thrusting, stay on stage as a leeringly watchful Greek chorus (the choreography is by Lorin Latarro). Musicals who want to know how to end a first act should look no further than Christopher's thunderously powerful marshaling of Anthem.\n\nPerhaps it's unsurprising that the story has always been this battering ram of a musical's principal problem. Chess began life not as a musical, but a concept album released in 1984. It remains a redolent creature of the 1980s, with its earnest macro-themes of East-West politics and nuclear perils. David Rockwell's geometric set of shifting panels and platforms and Kevin Adams' primary-colored lights (red for Russia, blue for America) are just as era-specific.\n\nBut while the show's songs run furiously hot, its characters stay resolutely cold and uninvolving. And, the book—despite Pinkham's comically authoritative guiding hand—remains a messy puzzle, using the lingering Cold War and 1980s nuclear superpower tensions to implausibly sex up, well, chess.\n\nChess next introduces Svetlana (Hannah Cruz), Anatoly's wife, long left behind in Russia, to try and win him back from Florence, with the added PR victory of Russia reclaiming one of their own. But this too is a narrative cul-de-sac, because Anatoly immediately says No, and the couple again have no chemistry.\n\nBig numbers and baffling story almost spent, Chess leans into the possibility that nuclear war is extremely nigh, and the outcome of a final chess match could kill us all. There is even more personal and political plot within wailed lyrics, a surprise ending that is not only no surprise but also not the emotional wallop the show intends, and songs that make head-scratching sense. But Chess doesn't care. It's here to pulverize you with high-stakes passion, possible global apocalypse, and blazing over-emotion. It is, like many spectacles, good, bad, needily insistent, and unapologetically exhausting. As soon as you buy your ticket, it's checkmate before you've even taken your seat.",
