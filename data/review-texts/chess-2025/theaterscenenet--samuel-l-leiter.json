    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed assessment - praises the music but criticizes fundamental elements (book, characters). Chess metaphor suggests the show doesn't achieve its goals. Low confidence due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights issues with the book and characters, but notes admiration for the music. The sentiment is mixed, with more focus on flaws than strengths. | Gemini: The review excerpt points out flaws in the book and characters, but acknowledges the music. This suggests a mixed assessment, leaning towards a conditional recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the music but heavily criticizes the book as 'stumbling' and characters as 'cut-out,' noting the show fails to achieve its potential ('delivering a real checkmate') or emotional engagement ('caring who captures the king'), indicating significant reservations despite musical strengths.",
