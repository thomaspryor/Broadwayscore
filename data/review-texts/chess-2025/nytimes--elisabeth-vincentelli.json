  "dtliExcerpt": "Parts of the show are absolutely thrilling and parts are flat at best, aggressively dumb at worst. At least Mayer’s production, starring Nicholas Christopher, Lea Michele and Aaron Tveit, is not a bland bore. Thinking back to Michele’s big, then bigger, then biggest “Nobody’s Side” or Christopher’s red-hot, neck-vein-bursting “Anthem,” I can feel the needle move toward the positive side of the dial.",

The positive mentions of performances suggest some redeeming qualities, but the overall tone is balanced between positive and negative. | Gemini: The review highlights both thrilling and disappointing aspects of the show, ultimately calling it a 'draw'.
