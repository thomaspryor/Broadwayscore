  "fullText": "Parts of the show are absolutely thrilling and parts are flat at best, aggressively dumb at worst. At least Mayer’s production, starring Nicholas Christopher, Lea Michele and Aaron Tveit, is not a bland bore. Thinking back to Michele’s big, then bigger, then biggest “Nobody’s Side” or Christopher’s red-hot, neck-vein-bursting “Anthem,” I can feel the needle move toward the positive side of the dial.",
