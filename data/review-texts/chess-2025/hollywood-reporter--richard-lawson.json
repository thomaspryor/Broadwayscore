Aaron Tveit, Lea Michele (last on Broadway in 2023 in Funny Girl) and Nicholas Christopher are in black and white, expressions stern and the faintest bit sultry. This, the marquee advertises, is going to be a mature, sophisticated rendering of a musical long relegated to the joke bin of Broadway nostalgia. \n\n\tBut what's happening inside the theater complicates and contradicts that solemn marketing. Director Michael Mayer's version of things, which opened on November 16, sets a musical about the Cold War at garish, sometimes glorious, war with itself. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\n\tBusiness\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBroadway Box Office: &#039;Harry Potter&#039; Brings In $2.65 Million As Industry Heads Into Slow Winter Months\t\t\n\n\tLifestyle\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChanning Tatum&#039;s &#039;Magic Mike Live&#039; Comes to New York\t\t\n\n\tChess is notoriously amorphous. First conceived by famed lyricist Tim Rice (Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita, The Lion King) and given musical voice by ABBA's Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus, Chess has lived many lives. It began as a 1984 concept album, blossomed into a successful West End production in 1986, and then flopped out on Broadway in 1988. Its DNA has changed repeatedly over the years; major overhauls to the script have essentially rendered each iteration of the show an entirely separate entity. What remains at least semi-constant is the music, an alternately gliding and lurching melange of early 1980s soft-rock pop, and Lloyd Webber-ian operetta. It's a lumpy but often sweetly sonorous mess that many ardent fans love mostly for a handful of songs, a few of which became radio hits in the 1980s. \n\n\tSo what is a modernist like Mayer, who made such cool craft of ancient stuff 20 years ago with Spring Awakening, to do with something as hokey and booby-trapped as Chess? Well, he's brought in the screenwriter Danny Strong (Game Change, Dopesick) to introduce what is essentially entirely new packaging. Geopolitics come heavily to bear on this Chess — espionage and nuclear anxiety widen the scope of the show to nothing smaller than the fate of the world. But these jittery apocalyptic concerns are mostly addressed from a contemporary remove; Mayer's Chess gazes back at what might have been during the paranoid final days of the Cold War without seeming terribly worried that any of it might actually affect the play's characters. \n\n\tAn administrative role from past productions, The Arbiter, has been blown up and altered into an omniscient narrator, a sort of trickster-god/game-show-host/Our Town stage manager figure played with limber wit and energy by Bryce Pinkham. (Full disclosure: Pinkham and I were college-theater classmates two decades ago.) He there's to contextualize things for the audiences of today: both what was genuinely at stake as America and the USSR circled one another at the dawn of the Reagan administration and where the musical Chess fits into all that (if anywhere). There is a lot of sardonic referencing of the show itself, a winking acknowledgment that, yes, some of this is pretty dated and corny. \n\n\tWhich is often amusing, sometimes grating. Jokes that yoke the time of Chess to recent headlines — RFK Jr.'s brain worm, Biden's failed second-term bid — are awfully wheezy. (When the gags are really bad, one almost wonders if one is actually across the street watching Operation Mincemeat.) But some of the show's Brechtian self-awareness works quite well, giving Chess a giddy shiver of the prescient or the eternal. Mayer and Strong offer a broad pop-history lesson, gesturing toward the vexing tensions and turmoils that have cyclically churned throughout the decades; the only thing that's changed are the aesthetics. Pinkham is an able and engaging docent on this musical museum tour, in which the 40-year-old core of Chess is used as an ironic vessel for Mayer and Strong's latter-day arguments about past politics informing present nightmares.  \n\n\tThat irony does come at a cost, though. There, keening and belting at the center of Mayer and Strong's eyebrow-raised meta-show, are three star performers who, it seems, are just trying to do Chess for real. \n\n\tAs Anatoly, the gloomy and passionate Russian prodigy with the weight of an empire's expectations on his shoulders, Christopher uses his handsome baritone to power through his songs (most strikingly the act one closer \"Anthem\") as if he is doing \"Wheels of a Dream\" up at Lincoln Center. His voice is lush and enormous, filled with yearning. \n\n\tMichele, the American musical theater's most hard-charging inevitability, tucks into her romantically ambivalent character Florence's numbers — the barn-burning solo \"Nobody's Side,\" the distaff duet \"I Know Him So Well,\" et al — as if Andersson and Ulvaeus are lovingly gazing down at her in their rainbow necklaces from a box at the Kennedy Center. Her acting is flat and presentational — Michele is mostly doing a concert version of her favorite songs from the show. But when she lets rip with a note as big as Siberia, who really cares? \n\n\tWhen Tveit — one-time Broadway golden boy turned tawny man, here playing a faded wunderkind turned aimless and mentally addled party boy — tears into \"Pity the Child,\" a ballad of childhood trauma as stirring as it is silly, it's as if he's performing a rock concert in heaven. All while dressed like Danny Ocean at a Miami funeral, no less. He's ridiculously good in those minutes, in which all of the show's arch conceit falls away and the production stands proud in the glitzy, high-theater melodrama of Chess at its purest. Tveit even plays \"One Night in Bangkok,\" a half-rap synth trifle (in)famous the world over, almost entirely straight. \n\n\tBut then Mayer's framing descends upon him — and Michele, and Christopher — once more. Kevin Adams' glibly gaudy lighting blares back on like the reopening of a pinball arcade, David Rockwell's spare industrial set clanks things back to cold reality. How are these three earnest tenderhearts, emotive and gesturing madly, supposed to comfortably exist under the diminishing glare of The Arbiter's, and Mayer's, wry commentary? Even when The Arbiter walks out on stage after an impressive aria and says something like an appreciative, \"Wow,\" there's the slightest hint of sarcasm in it. Mayer gives talented performers a platform to deliver top-tier Broadway cheese, but then immediately scrambles to insist that what we just watched is actually bad for our diet. \n\n\tThere's a strange, undermining, conflicted nature to Mayer's project, a push and pull between eras and customs. Perhaps that is actually the great insight of this Chess. Not about the Able Archer 83 incident that almost ended the world, nor about the whirring mechanics of mind and heart that govern chess phenoms. (Truly, the actual game barely factors in here, save for two inventively staged sequences that imagine the interior monologues of players during a match.) Rather, this Chess teaches us a history lesson about the world pre-meta-irony and the one post-, in which we find ourselves mired at the moment. While I found myself longing for a wholly heartfelt Chess — whatever that might be — I also enjoyed the peppery, style-forward way that this production almost makes the amoebic musical itself a tragicomic plot point. In the unending battle between sincerity and snark, I'm afraid I have to call this particular showdown a draw. \n\n\tVenue: Imperial Theater, New York\nCast: Nicholas Christopher, Lea Michele, Bryce Pinkham, Aaron Tveit\nDirector: Michael Mayer\nBook: Danny Strong, based on an idea by Tim Rice\nMusic and Lyrics: Benny Andersson, Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus, Tim Rice\nSet designer: David Rockwell\nCostume designer: Tom Broecker\nLighting designer: Kevin Adams\nSound designer: John Shivers\nVideo designer: Peter Nigrini\nPresented by: Tom Hulce, Robert Ahrens, The Schubert Organization\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead More About:\n\n\taaron tveit\n\n\tLea Michele\n\n\tMusicals\n\n\tTheater\n\n\t\tTHR Newsletters\n\n\tSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\n\t\tSubscribe\t\n\n\t\t\tSign Up\n\n\t\tMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\n\tshopping\n\n\t\t\t\t\t&#8216;Euphoria' Costume Designer Creates Jewelry Inspired by Her Work With David Lynch",
