    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt suggests the show requires lowered expectations to be appreciated, implying it's flawed but potentially enjoyable if approached correctly. Very limited text makes confident scoring impossible. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the show should not be taken seriously, which implies a mixed tone. The lack of seriousness might appeal to some but not others, indicating a neutral stance. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Kimi: The excerpt suggests the show can be appreciated if not taken seriously, implying a qualified recommendation. However, with only one curated excerpt that cuts off before the final verdict, confidence is low.",
