However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt lists several positive aspects of the show, suggesting a recommendation. However, without the full review, it's difficult to gauge the overall enthusiasm, so a score in the middle of the 'Positive' range is appropriate.",
