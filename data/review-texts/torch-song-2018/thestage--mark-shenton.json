  "bwwExcerpt": "The play's defiant and universal humanity shines through with a burning intensity in Moises Kaufman's beautifully modulated production. It is galvanised by the fierce combination of unsentimental vulnerability and independent dignity that Michael Urie brings to the character of Arnold, while Mercedes Ruehl errs just the right side of dramatic cliche in her performance as his overbearing Jewish mum.",
