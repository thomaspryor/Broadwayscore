  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Fierstein’s landmark gay play ‘Torch Song’ is back on Broadway with an abridged text and title, but its heart and humanity intact. On second viewing, this production feels more muted and a bit too comfortable, but the performances are richer and better, and the subject matter as timely as ever.
