  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Urie is lighting up the stage with his virtuoso performance...It’s a towering performance that is so filled with surprises...Beautifully directed...and powerfully acted by a cast that offers the sort of support that supplies theatrical fireworks...Fierstein’s ‘Torch Song’ is an early work that showed great promise and has now become a promise gloriously fulfilled. In this production Urie and Ruehl memorably personify its two central characters.”\n\nRead more",
