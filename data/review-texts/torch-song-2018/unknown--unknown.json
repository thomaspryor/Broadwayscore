It also feels, well, bigger...That’s Ms. Ruehl’s part, which she walks, not runs, with and nearly steals the show in an expertly coiled performance.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise for performances and direction ('happy revival', 'smoother and quicker', 'nearly steals the show'). However, confidence is low due to limited text from curated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the revival as 'happy' and praises the performances, suggesting an enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"happy revival\" and praises the performances of Michael Urie and Mercedes Ruehl. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise, calling it a 'happy revival' that is 'smoother and quicker on its feet' with performances that 'nearly steal the show.' However, confidence is low given this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review.",
