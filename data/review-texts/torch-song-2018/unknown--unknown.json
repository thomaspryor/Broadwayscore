It also feels, well, bigger...That’s Ms. Ruehl’s part, which she walks, not runs, with and nearly steals the show in an expertly coiled performance.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear praise for the revival ('happy revival'), improved staging ('smoother and quicker'), and strong performances (Ruehl 'nearly steals the show'). Single excerpt warning applies - setting confidence to low due to limited text, but the available quotes are consistently positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides clear positive sentiment about the production, praising both the lead performance and the staging. The use of 'happy revival' and 'pull you out of your election-season weariness' suggests an enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"happy revival\" and praises the performances of Michael Urie and Mercedes Ruehl. Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for this 'happy revival,' citing smoother staging and expert performances, indicating a strong recommendation despite the limited text available.",
