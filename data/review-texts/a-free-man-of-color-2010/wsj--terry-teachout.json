  "bwwExcerpt": "If neatness is what you expect from John Guare's 'A Free Man of Color,' you'll be doomed to disappointment. Mr. Guare's ambitious new play, which tells the fantastic tale of Jacques Cornet (Jeffrey Wright), a 19th-century millionaire playboy from New Orleans who happens to be black, has a cast of 33 and runs for 2½ crowded hours. Yes, it sprawls, but for all its hectic messiness, 'A Free Man of Color' is one of the three or four most stirring new plays I've seen since I started writing this column seven years ago.",
