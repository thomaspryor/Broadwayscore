    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic suggests the show is tedious for audiences despite potentially being enjoyable for the writer, indicating a negative experience. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be setup for a more positive verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, implying the show is less enjoyable to watch than it was to create. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests the show is not enjoyable to watch, indicating a negative review. Given the limited context, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt suggests the play is tedious or self-indulgent, privileging the playwright's enjoyment over the audience's experience. With only one curated quote available, this indicates a negative verdict but confidence is reduced due to potential cherry-picking.",
