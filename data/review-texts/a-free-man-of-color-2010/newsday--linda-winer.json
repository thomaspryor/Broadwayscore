  "bwwExcerpt": "Somewhere very far away - as far, say, as the final 15 minutes - 'A Free Man of Color' becomes an important play. Finally, after 2 ½ hours of brain-blurring historical asides, strenuously costumed artifice and luxuriously overpopulated incoherence, the point and resonance of this crazy-ambitious collaboration between playwright John Guare and director George C. Wolfe fall deeply into place.",
