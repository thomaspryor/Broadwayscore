  "bwwExcerpt": "Somewhere very far away - as far, say, as the final 15 minutes - 'A Free Man of Color' becomes an important play. Finally, after 2 ½ hours of brain-blurring historical asides, strenuously costumed artifice and luxuriously overpopulated incoherence, the point and resonance of this crazy-ambitious collaboration between playwright John Guare and director George C. Wolfe fall deeply into place.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic finds most of the play problematic ('brain-blurring', 'incoherent') but acknowledges it becomes 'important' in the final 15 minutes. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review highlights significant issues with the production, such as 'brain-blurring historical asides' and 'overpopulated incoherence,' but acknowledges that the play becomes important in its final moments. This suggests a mixed verdict with some redeeming qualities. | Gemini: The review describes the play as having \"brain-blurring historical asides\" and \"luxuriously overpopulated incoherence\" for most of its duration, but states that it becomes an important play in the final 15 minutes. This suggests a mixed experience with some redeeming qualities. | Kimi: The critic describes the first 2.5 hours as 'brain-blurring' and 'incoherent' but acknowledges the final 15 minutes deliver importance and resonance, creating a mixed assessment with significant reservations about the execution.",
