However, confidence is low due to limited text availability. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong negative language ('excruciating', 'headache-inducing') indicating a clear pan. The tone suggests a strongly negative experience with no redeeming qualities. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong negative language such as \"excruciating\" and \"headache-inducing\", indicating a pan. | Kimi: The single available excerpt uses extreme negative language ('excruciating', 'headache-inducing') to characterize the experience, warranting a pan classification despite limited context.",
