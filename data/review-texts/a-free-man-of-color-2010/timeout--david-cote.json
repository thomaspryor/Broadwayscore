  "bwwExcerpt": "Wright can hold an audience with a cock of the head and his low, raspy voice, but here he’s surrounded by some of the city’s finest stage actors, whipped into a frenzy by director George C. Wolfe. Among others, we savor Veanne Cox as one of Cornet’s several married conquests; Mos (formerly Mos Def) as his sly manservant Murmur; and Reg Rogers as Cornet’s white half-brother, a whinnying simp desperate to reclaim his birthright. John McMartin and Paul Dano contribute nicely shaded portraits of the diffident President Thomas Jefferson and Western explorer Meriwether Lewis, respectively.",

Given single excerpt warning and clear praise throughout, scoring upper end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and direction, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of a clear overall verdict lead to a lower confidence and a score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the performances and direction, indicating a positive experience. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the cast and direction, using admiring verbs like 'savor' and 'nicely shaded' to describe the performances; however, as a single curated quote, it may not capture the full critical verdict.",
