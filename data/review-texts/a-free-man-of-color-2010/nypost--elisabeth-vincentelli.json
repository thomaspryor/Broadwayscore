  "bwwExcerpt": "A spectacular folly has just crash-landed at Lincoln Cen ter Theater. Eight years in the making, John Guare's latest play, 'A Free Man of Color,' is an ambitious, awkward, fascinating, lumbering endeavor about the mapping of America's modern physical, social and racial borders. Most of the show, directed by George C. Wolfe, is a maddening slog. But the last 30 minutes are so brilliant that you can't dismiss the whole thing.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic calls it an 'ambitious mess' that tries to 'cram too much' - clearly negative language despite acknowledging ambition. However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict may be more nuanced. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as an 'ambitious mess' with too much content, indicating a negative view. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt calls the play an \"ambitious mess,\" indicating a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt and negative language, I placed it in the negative bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt uses the phrase 'ambitious mess' and criticizes the play for trying to 'cram too much' material, indicating a clear negative verdict on the production's execution despite acknowledging its scope.",
