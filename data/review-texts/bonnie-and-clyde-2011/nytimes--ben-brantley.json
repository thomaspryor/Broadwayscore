    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative assessment citing fundamental tonal problems and lack of artistic coherence. The critic identifies a core failure in the show's execution without any positive elements mentioned. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the musical for failing to find the right tone, suggesting it is unsuccessful in its execution. The lack of a clear recommendation indicates a negative verdict. | Gemini: The review indicates that the musical struggles to find the right tone, suggesting an uneven or inconsistent experience, which aligns with a mixed classification. | Kimi: The critic identifies a fundamental tonal problem that undermines the entire production. 'Never finds the right tone' and 'veering uneasily' indicate a serious structural flaw with no redeeming qualities mentioned. The single-sentence format suggests this may be a capsule review or excerpt, limiting confidence.",
