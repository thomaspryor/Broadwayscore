  "bwwExcerpt": "These gifted performers are given songs that dip into bluegrass or country, gospel or rock, not to mention that ubiquitous Wildhorn favorite, the blustery power ballad. But the composer and lyricist show little flair for marrying story with song. And while several of them are catchy, the numbers mostly remain derivative pseudo-pop, too often regurgitating the same ideas. That and the superficial book drain the blood from what should be a dynamic story",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt criticizes core elements (songs, book) as derivative and superficial, saying they 'drain the blood' from the story. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be from a longer mixed review. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the music as derivative and the book as superficial, suggesting the show fails to deliver a dynamic story. Despite acknowledging gifted performers, the overall tone is negative. | Gemini: The review excerpt criticizes the songs as derivative and the book as superficial, draining the dynamism from the story. This indicates a negative overall assessment, despite mentioning gifted performers. | Kimi: While praising the performers as 'gifted,' the critic fundamentally criticizes the music as 'derivative pseudo-pop' and the book as 'superficial,' concluding these elements drain the life from the story. With only one excerpt available, the confidence is low, but the tone is clearly negative.",
