    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges 'many virtues' but emphasizes 'enough flaws to keep it from blowing you away,' indicating a balanced but ultimately lukewarm assessment. Single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked from a longer review. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges both strengths and weaknesses, indicating a balanced view without a strong recommendation. The text quality warning and single excerpt suggest caution, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review notes both virtues and flaws, indicating a mixed assessment. The phrase \"keep it from blowing you away\" suggests it doesn't fully succeed. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges positive qualities like 'great efficiency' and 'many virtues' but emphasizes notable flaws and a slow start that prevent the production from being truly impressive, resulting in a balanced assessment that neither recommends nor discourages attendance.",
