  "bwwExcerpt": "The one thing that a show about infamous killers Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow should not be is safe. Unfortunately, book writer Ivan Menchell, lyricist Don Black, composer Frank Wildhorn, and director-choreographer Jeff Calhoun have settled for a paint-by-numbers primer that presents the murderous pair as a couple of misunderstood kids trapped by the Depression. But there were many people in the 1930s who didn't respond to poverty and oppression by robbing banks and",

However, with only one truncated excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may be cut off. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show for being 'safe' and 'paint-by-numbers,' indicating a lack of originality and depth. The negative tone suggests a recommendation against seeing the show. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates the show is \"safe\" and a \"paint-by-numbers primer,\" suggesting a negative assessment. Given the truncated nature, the score is in the negative range but not a pan. | Kimi: The critic condemns the show for being 'safe' and 'paint-by-numbers,' faulting the creative team for a sanitized, formulaic portrayal of the notorious killers. With only a single truncated excerpt available, confidence is low, but the explicit criticism and dismissive tone indicate a negative assessment.",
