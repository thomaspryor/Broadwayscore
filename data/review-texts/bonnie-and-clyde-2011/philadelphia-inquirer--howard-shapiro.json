    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic uses a harsh metaphor comparing the show to being 'its own worst enemy,' which is strongly negative language. However, with only one excerpt available, this could be cherry-picked from a longer review with more nuanced assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view by comparing the show unfavorably to its subject, implying it fails to deliver. However, with only one excerpt, the full context is unclear, leading to low confidence. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is clearly negative, stating the musical is its own worst enemy. Given the limited context, confidence is low, but the negative sentiment is clear. | Kimi: The critic's wordplay condemns the production as fundamentally self-sabotaging, clearly advising against attendance despite the historical figures' notoriety.",
