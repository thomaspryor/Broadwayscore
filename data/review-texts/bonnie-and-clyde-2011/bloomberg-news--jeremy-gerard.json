However, single curated quotes can be cherry-picked, so using lower-middle Positive range given excerpt-only limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for its catchy songs, story, and direction, indicating a positive reception. The lack of full context and single excerpt warning suggests using the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights positive aspects such as catchy songs, a fleshed out story, and heart, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the production's songs, story, direction, and design, indicating a clear recommendation despite opening with a comparative caveat.",
