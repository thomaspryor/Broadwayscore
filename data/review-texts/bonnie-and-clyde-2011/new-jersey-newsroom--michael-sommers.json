    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic acknowledges some moments ('occasionally jolts') but concludes the show 'generally fails to electrify' and doesn't inspire audience connection. However, this is a single excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show is largely ineffective in engaging the audience emotionally, with a lack of electrifying moments or sympathy for the characters. The mention of a potential operatic treatment implies the current production falls short. | Gemini: The review states that the show \"generally fails to electrify viewers or inspire much pity,\" indicating a negative assessment. The suggestion of an operatic treatment implies the current production is lacking. | Kimi: The critic finds the production ineffective at delivering emotional impact or audience engagement, noting it only occasionally works but generally falls short of illuminating its dark subject matter.",
