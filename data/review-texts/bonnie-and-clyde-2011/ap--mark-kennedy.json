  "bwwExcerpt": "Jordan, who was in \"Rock of Ages,\" is charisma in person, a ball of swaggering arrogance with a sad boy underneath that's catnip to Bonnie (and many of the women in the audience). Bonnie, we are told, was a ravishing redhead, and Osnes is just that — this \"Anything Goes\" alumna transforms from a girl in need of attention (her sad \"How 'Bout a Dance\" is beautiful) to a stone-cold fox cradling a shotgun. This is a killer combination: They will slay you, literally.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performances with vivid, enthusiastic language ('charisma in person', 'transforms', 'killer combination'). However, single excerpt warning requires caution - this could be cherry-picked praise from a mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of the leads, describing them as charismatic and transformative. The phrase 'killer combination' suggests a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, a score at the upper end of the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The review excerpt is very positive, praising the charisma of Jordan and the transformation of Osnes. The phrase \"killer combination\" suggests a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for both lead performers, using words like 'charisma,' 'beautiful,' and 'killer combination,' indicating a strong positive recommendation despite being limited to one curated quote.",
