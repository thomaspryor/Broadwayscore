  "bwwExcerpt": "Jordan, who was in \"Rock of Ages,\" is charisma in person, a ball of swaggering arrogance with a sad boy underneath that's catnip to Bonnie (and many of the women in the audience). Bonnie, we are told, was a ravishing redhead, and Osnes is just that — this \"Anything Goes\" alumna transforms from a girl in need of attention (her sad \"How 'Bout a Dance\" is beautiful) to a stone-cold fox cradling a shotgun. This is a killer combination: They will slay you, literally.",
