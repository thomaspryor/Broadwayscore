Classic mixed review structure. | GPT-4o: The review highlights both strengths and weaknesses, praising the relationship focus but criticizing the plot for being too busy. This suggests a mixed verdict with no clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive and negative aspects, indicating a mixed opinion. It suggests the show has strengths but also suffers from weaknesses. | Kimi: The review acknowledges strong elements in the character relationships but criticizes the overstuffed plot, resulting in an even-handed assessment without clear recommendation.",
