  "bwwExcerpt": "How do you replace documentary reality with coherent drama when there's virtually no forward action except people collapsing? Hardbody's model seems to be A Chorus Line....The production is earnest and solidly performed by a cast including Keith Carradine and Hunter Foster under the direction of Neil Pepe. But all of their skill, and the authors', can't finesse a problem of emotional scale. How much can even a Texan want a truck?...For all the worthy effort to valorize lives not usually depicted in musicals, this has the opposite effect: It makes them seem petty.",
