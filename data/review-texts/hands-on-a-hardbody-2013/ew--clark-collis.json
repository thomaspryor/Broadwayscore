  "bwwExcerpt": "he actors also include the great Keith Carradine, who is probably best known now for appearing on Showtime's Dexter but who both sang and wrote the Oscar-winning song 'I'm Easy' for Robert Altman's 1975 movie Nashville. Sadly, few of the numbers in Hands on a Hardbody are as memorable as that melancholic ditty. The tunes that work best find Anastasio and cowriter-lyricist Amanda Green at their musically Phishiest - notably the bitter, Foster-sung 'God Answered My Prayers.' But the pair's excursions into country, blues, and a clutch of other genres rarely rise above the generic. Moreover, while the songwriters and book author Doug Wright clearly regard this insane competition as a prism through which to consider such weighty subjects as war, religion, and racism, it is rather difficult to engage with such ruminative choreography when the cast is literally dancing around an enormous car.",
