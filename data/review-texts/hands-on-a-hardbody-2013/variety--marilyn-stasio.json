  "bwwExcerpt": "Well, Broadway finally got itself an all-American musical in 'Hands on a Hardbody.' The question is, will an all-American audience go for it? It's hard to picture hotel concierges, travel agents and group sales ladies pitching tourists a show about some working-class stiffs from East Texas clinging desperately to a cherry-red pickup truck in a marathon competition to win it...Still, no matter how this dark tuner fares under Gotham's cold glare, regional bookers should be lining up six deep...If the show has a weakness, it's that the music is so consistently all-of-a-piece that some of the songs tend to melt into one another. But in a character-rich show like this, one of them is sure to stand up and make a musical statement that gets you between the eyes.",
