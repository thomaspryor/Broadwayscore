  "bwwExcerpt": "After watching S.R. Bindler's 1997 documentary 'Hands on a Hard Body'-about a 1994 Texas contest in which people stand around a Nissan truck while always keeping one hand on it, and the last left upright wins the vehicle-I shook my head and thought, 'I just don't see it.' Nevertheless, many a good musical has been born out of apparently unpromising material. Now that I've experienced 'Hands on a Hardbody'...I still haven't seen it. The tuner coarsens its self-effacing, quietly observant source with cheesy soap-opera backstories, forced Lifetime-movie subplotting, and self-righteous hot-button-issue pressing in an obviously manipulative attempt to stir our emotions. Padded out with an unnecessary intermission and extraneous songs to nearly two-and-a-half hours, the proceedings rarely come to life.",
