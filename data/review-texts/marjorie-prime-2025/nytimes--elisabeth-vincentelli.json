  "fullText": "Not much has changed about “Marjorie Prime” since its Off Broadway run in 2015. Yes, the play’s Broadway premiere — it opened Monday night in a Second Stage Theater production at the Helen Hayes Theater — has a new cast, now headed by June Squibb instead of Lois Smith. But the playwright Jordan Harrison made only light tweaks to his script, and the production sounds and looks essentially the same, with the director Anne Kauffman reuniting with the designers Lee Jellinek (set), Daniel Kluger (sound) and Ben Stanton (lighting).\n\nBut what a difference a decade makes! The way we take in “Marjorie Prime” has completely changed because the story revolves around the use of artificial intelligence, which is now a reality affecting our daily life. If anything, the show rustles up more questions — and stirs up more trouble — than it did 10 years ago because we’re not dealing with hypotheticals anymore.\n\nThe setup is that A.I.-driven “Primes” can be made to look like loved ones who have died. They are exact physical duplicates, but how they fare on the mental and psychological front is a work in progress — these sophisticated chatbots constantly evolve based on the information they are fed. So 85-year-old Marjorie (Squibb) can hold conversations with Walter (Christopher Lowell), a replica of her late husband as he was in his early 30s. What this Walter learns from Marjorie is a little in flux, as her memory is fraying: One person is losing her sense of self, another is building his.\n\nWe’re told that Senior Serenity, the company making Primes, argues that companionship is “better than television,” but Marjorie’s daughter, the brittle, acerbic Tess (Cynthia Nixon), is not swayed. Her husband, Jon (Danny Burstein), has a much more positive outlook on the technology — and on life in general, it seems — and often helps fill in the blanks for Walter (and the audience).\n\nThe use of A.I. for emotional and psychological support is a common news story these days — a company like HereAfter offers, for a relatively modest monthly fee, something that is essentially Harrison’s Prime concept in app form. The application of this technology for grieving people is covered in the recent documentary “Eternal You.”\n\nInstead of making “Marjorie Prime,” which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist, feel dated, these developments explain why it has aged so remarkably well. I did not care much for the show when I saw it at Playwrights Horizons in 2015, after it premiered in Los Angeles the year before, maybe because I had been looking forward to a rare theatrical foray into science fiction, and in that respect Harrison came up short. Whether Primes are androids or 3-D holograms is unclear from what we see onstage; this vagueness bothered me back then, as did the lack of details about the general context. The show keeps a tight focus on this family, whom we see in Jellinek’s plain midcentury living room-kitchen interior in various shades of green.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",
  "dtliExcerpt": "Harrison has a dream collaborator in Kauffman, who is a master at creating emotion without hitting an audience over the head. Her approach looks as if it is detached, almost clinical, but that only means she does not overplay her hand when navigating emotional stakes. This was obvious in her last Broadway outing, the quietly devastating “Mary Jane” (2024), and so it is here, with all four actors marvelously economical — an approach that does not necessarily win awards but that lingers in audience members’ hearts and minds.",
