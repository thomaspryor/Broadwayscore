    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies - this curated quote emphasizes 'compelling' and 'tautly packed', suggesting clear appreciation. Given it's a single cherry-picked quote that sounds clearly positive, scoring at upper end of Positive bucket, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'compelling' and 'tautly packed,' suggesting a positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range with low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as a \"philosophical puzzle wrapped in a compelling story,\" which suggests a positive, though perhaps not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers clearly positive assessment praising the tight pacing ('tautly packed') and engaging narrative ('compelling story'), warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket, though limited context reduces confidence.",
