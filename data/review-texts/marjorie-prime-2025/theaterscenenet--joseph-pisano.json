    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a shift from an imaginative portrayal to something more mundane, indicating a lack of enthusiasm. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a shift in perception, implying the show's impact is diminished. This indicates a mixed or neutral sentiment. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production for shifting from fanciful to mundane, suggesting a negative assessment of the show's current impact. Confidence is low due to limited excerpt availability.",
