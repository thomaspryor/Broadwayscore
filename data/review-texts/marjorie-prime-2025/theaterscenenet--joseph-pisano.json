    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a shift from a previously imaginative portrayal to something more mundane, indicating a mixed impression. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning lowers confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a shift in perception, implying a more nuanced or ambivalent view. Without more context, it's difficult to determine a clear recommendation, placing it in the mixed category. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates a decline from 'fanciful' to 'mundane,' suggesting the production has lost its imaginative appeal and become ordinary. With only one curated sentence available, the sentiment appears negative but confidence is reduced due to limited context.",
