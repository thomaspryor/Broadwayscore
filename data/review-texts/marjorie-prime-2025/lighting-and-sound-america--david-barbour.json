    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show positively as both 'gentle' and effectively chilling, suggesting artistic success, but insufficient text to determine full recommendation strength. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive reaction, noting the piece's ability to evoke a strong emotional response despite its gentle nature. However, with only a single excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single quote suggests a positive but potentially unsettling experience, indicating a recommendation with reservations. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the show's atmospheric impact and emotional effectiveness ('sends a chill up one's spine'), indicating a recommendation despite the gentle tone. As a single curated excerpt, this represents clearly positive sentiment warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket, though confidence is reduced due to limited context.",
