    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single curated excerpt describes the show positively as having emotional impact ('sends a chill'), but the qualifier 'nevertheless' suggests some ambiguity. Given single excerpt warning and gentle praise, scoring at lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive impression with its mention of the piece being 'gentle' yet impactful ('sends a chill'). However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The phrase \"sends a chill up one's spine\" suggests a positive, albeit potentially unsettling, experience, indicating a recommendation with reservations. Given that only one excerpt is available, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates a strong physical and emotional impact ('sends a chill up one's spine'), which is clearly positive praise. However, given this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review, confidence is reduced per the provided warning.",
