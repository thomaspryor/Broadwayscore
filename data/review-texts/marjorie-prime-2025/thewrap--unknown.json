  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"At its core, \"Marjorie Prime\" tells a simple kitchen-sink story of two adults trying to care for an aging relative. Harrison tries to up the ante by dipping into his gothic drawer of horrors to deliver not one but two suicides that push the human narrative into the contrived. In the end, the machines are more honest than the humans and, better yet, there's none of the angst.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt criticizes the playwright's choices as 'contrived' but notes positive elements like the machines being 'more honest' and lacking angst. Single excerpt warning requires conservative scoring within Mixed range. | GPT-4o: The review suggests a mix of elements, with criticism of the contrived narrative but also a positive note on the lack of angst. The single excerpt provides limited context, leading to a conservative middle-range score within the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive and negative aspects, suggesting a mixed experience. The phrase 'machines are more honest' implies some appreciation, but the criticism of 'contrived' elements prevents a fully positive classification.",
