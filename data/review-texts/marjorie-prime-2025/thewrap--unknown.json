  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"At its core, \"Marjorie Prime\" tells a simple kitchen-sink story of two adults trying to care for an aging relative. Harrison tries to up the ante by dipping into his gothic drawer of horrors to deliver not one but two suicides that push the human narrative into the contrived. In the end, the machines are more honest than the humans and, better yet, there's none of the angst.\"",

The lack of a clear recommendation or discouragement leads to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive and negative aspects. The phrase 'machines are more honest' suggests a positive element, while 'contrived' indicates a negative one, leading to a mixed classification.",
