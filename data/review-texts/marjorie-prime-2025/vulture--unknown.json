  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"I kept waiting to feel ... well, more. More rapt, more heartbroken, more rattled by the harrowing questions presented by the long, slow, terribly seductive suicide humanity seems bent on carrying out via technology. Harrison is a formidable craftsman and Marjorie Prime is built very well, but in a way it resembles one of its own artificial humans: It's an extremely palatable version of the thing. It has studied how to be a play, and it's a good one  if only the feeling of study weren't quite so palpable in that goodness. If only it didn't place so much value on the neatness of its own construction.\"",
