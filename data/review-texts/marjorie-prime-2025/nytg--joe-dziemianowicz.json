  "fullText": "Read our review of Marjorie Prime on Broadway, a revival of Jordan Harrison's drama starring June Squibb, Cynthia Nixon, Danny Burstein, and Christopher Lowell. From power-on to shutdown, the compact family drama Marjorie Prime runs just 85 minutes. But there’s nothing small about the themes Jordan Harrison explores in his 2014 play about memories, identity, mortality, and the role of artificial intelligence in that mix. The new production with June Squibb and Cynthia Nixon as mother and daughter marks both the play’s and the author’s Broadway debut. It’s a perceptive and prescient talker. The play’s once-futuristic ideas are rapidly becoming real, from interactive AI avatars to simulations of deceased loved ones. But for all its clairvoyance and foresight about technology, Marjorie Prime’s most potent superpowers are its sensitivity and tenderness. Harrison’s spare, gently gripping script is a model of eloquent economy as the characters grapple with grief and what it means to truly love and remember someone. In the not-so-distant future, 85-year-old Marjorie (Squibb) is losing her memory. She’s given a “Prime,” a holographic companion modeled on her late husband, Walter, at 30. He’s built from curated memories — the happy ones, mostly — supplied by her daughter Tess (Nixon) and son-in-law Jon (Danny Burstein, reliably excellent). As Marjorie bonds with Walter Prime (Christopher Lowell), she begins reshaping their past, tweaking truth and invention. Other Primes eventually appear, the cycle repeats, and the memories evolve. Director Anne Kauffman, who staged the play’s 2015 Off-Broadway run, has assembled an A-list ensemble that hums like a finely tuned machine. The drama is a showcase for its women, with Squibb — newly 96 and last seen on Broadway in Waitress — infusing Marjorie with an irresistible, vinegary sass. Nixon, a two-time Tony winner with 45 years of Broadway experience, is without question in her prime: wry, vulnerable, and conflicted as Tess, who struggles to connect with the real Marjorie and her Prime. In a play that now hit me fathoms deeper than it did a decade ago, hers is the performance I can’t get out of my head. Marjorie Prime follows an elderly woman who receives a \"Prime,\" a hologram of her late husband, to help revive her failing memory. At its core, the play is a melancholy family drama about grief, memory and identity that asks what it means to remember someone, and whether technology can or should try to replicate our losses. A 2015 Pulitzer Prize finalist for drama, Marjorie Prime was adapted into a 2017 movie starring Lois Smith and Jon Hamm. Harrison doesn’t directly specify a date for the play, but he drops breadcrumbs in the script. We learn early on that Marjorie is 85 and later learn she was born in 1977. Do the math, and it’s 2062, though the scenic design by Lee Jellinek looks like today. A verdant theme flows through the set, from wallpaper to upholstered seating. It’s like a green screen, a space awaiting meaning. In the final moments, the space transforms in a curious, slightly disquieting way. As of publication, the play has an 83% ranking on the review aggregator Show Score. The script, acting, and forward-thinking themes all clicked with theatregoers.

Marjorie Prime is an intelligent and probing drama about the curiosity and cost of Primes: human-like robots who take the place of the deceased so they never have to die. Jordan Harrison, who has written for Orange Is the New Black, wrote this play, which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. Anne Kauffman (The Bedwetter, Mary Jane) returns to direct this show after doing so off Broadway. The play is a Pulitzer finalist, sparked a Jon Hamm-led film, and was called \"beautiful\" by New York Magazine. The show explores darker themes like loss; Broadway audiences must be four and up to see shows. Originally published on Dec 8, 202521:30",
