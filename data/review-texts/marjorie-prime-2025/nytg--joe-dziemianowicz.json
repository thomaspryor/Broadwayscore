Harrison’s spare, gently gripping script is a model of eloquent economy as the characters grapple with grief and what it means to truly love and remember someone.",

  "dtliExcerpt": "Director Anne Kauffman, who staged the play’s 2015 Off-Broadway run, has assembled an A-list ensemble that hums like a finely tuned machine. The drama is a showcase for its women, with Squibb — newly 96 and last seen on Broadway in Waitress — infusing Marjorie with an irresistible, vinegary sass. Nixon, a two-time Tony winner with 45 years of Broadway experience, is without question in her prime: wry, vulnerable, and conflicted as Tess, who struggles to connect with the real Marjorie and her Prime. In a play that now hit me fathoms deeper than it did a decade ago, hers is the performance I can’t get out of my head.",
