  "fullText": "Jordan Harrison’s Pulitzer finalist drama bows on Broadway with Second Stage.\n\n“You said you wanted a gay best friend afterwards,” Walter (Christopher Lowell) informs Marjorie (June Squibb) in the first scene of Jordan Harrison’s\n\nIf you’re reading this review, chances are you grew up in a time and place where your primary role within society has been “consumer,” an identity that informs every choice you make, from what theater tickets to buy to the people with whom you surround yourself. What is the\n\nThat’s a luxury Marjorie desires. Walter, who appears to be 50 years her junior, is not actually her late husband but a Prime, an AI-powered facsimile meant to provide comfort and companionship as Marjorie slips into senility. He’s there to jog her memory, however she would like that customized. “What if we saw\n\nMarjorie’s daughter, Tess (Cynthia Nixon), finds it disturbing. “We tell them our deepest secrets, even though we have no earthly idea how they work,” she protests in a line that made me suspect Peter Thiel would love nothing more than a data-harvesting machine disguised as a spouse. But Tess’s husband, Jon (Danny Burstein), marvels at the therapeutic potential of the Primes. Neither of them can be around 24/7, so isn’t it nice for Marjorie to have a familiar face who is? Isn’t it better she spend her final years awash in happy memories, sadness (including one very traumatic family secret) obliterated by dementia?\n\nHarrison’s strength as a playwright lies not only in his clear-eyed foresight (\n\nNinety-six-year-old Squibb, convincingly portraying a woman a decade younger, offers a vivid portrait of Generation X in its dotage. “If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it,” she repeatedly sings one line of a song, the title of which neither she nor anyone else can recall (this shade aimed directly at the BeyHive is just a small indication of Harrison’s considerable daring).\n\nThrough tiny flinches, Lowell suggests the frightening possibility that, in addition to our preferences around movies and music, AI might also be adopting our emotional sensitivities. And why shouldn’t it, when we created it in our image?\n\nAs Tess, Nixon gives an all-too-real performance of a woman who masks her psychological pain with well-read intelligence. We get the sense that she chose Jon as her husband because he’s one of the few people brave enough to really see her.\n\nBurstein gives the most emotionally wrenching performance of the bunch. There is not an ounce of cynicism in his attempt to use technology to better the lives of his loved ones. He’s a true believer, and when his crisis of faith arrives, it is devastating. How many of us will face similar disillusionment in the coming century? How many already have?\n\nWhile the idea of Primes might have seemed futuristic in 2015, the software basically exists in 2025 and people are already using AI companions to supplant the human alternative, sometimes in\n\nA quietly persuasive tale of well-intentioned hubris,\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"One of the more impressive aspects of 'Marjorie Prime' is how Harrison calls upon spectators to be active viewers. Rather than deal in specifics, he provides context clues for us to piece together the timeline and personal histories ourselves...It works here because the dialogue and performances are so strong, it's like we're viewing these moments firsthand...Thanks to the expert cast and wonderfully sensitive writing, it's a supremely emotional moment.\"",
