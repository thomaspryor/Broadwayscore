  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Anne Kauffman, who helmed the 2015 off-Broadway production, directs with a steady hand and a keen sense of light and sound. Sharp blackouts barely give us time to catch our breath before we contemplate Walter's face illuminated in a spotlight like a digital saint (Ben Stanton's lighting is more manipulative than any AI algorithm). Daniel Kluger's original string music is an echo from Majorie's past (she was a violinist) that becomes increasingly adulterated with electronic distortion. These elegant design choices undergird emotionally raw performances.\"",

However, this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review sentiment, requiring conservative scoring within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the direction, lighting, and music, highlighting 'elegant design choices' and 'emotionally raw performances,' suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on positive aspects of the production, specifically the direction, lighting, music, and performances, suggesting a generally favorable impression. However, without the full review, it's difficult to gauge the overall recommendation strength.",
