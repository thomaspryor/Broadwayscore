Single excerpt warning applied - using upper end of Positive range due to strong language, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, calling the play 'powerful and thoughtful' and 'one of the best on Broadway right now.' Despite the warning about the single excerpt, the language suggests a highly positive assessment. | Gemini: The excerpt is short but clearly positive, calling the play \"one of the best on Broadway right now.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I'm using the upper end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise ranking the show among Broadway's current best, warranting an upper-range Positive score per the single-excerpt guidance, though confidence is reduced due to limited text availability.",
