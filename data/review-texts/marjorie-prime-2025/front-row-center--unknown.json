  "fullText": "Posted by Tulis McCall | Dec 16, 2025 | Reviews June Squibb; Photo by Joan Marcus Back in 2015 this website reviewed “Marjorie Prime.” whose cast featured Noah Bean, Lisa Emery, Stephen Root and Lois Smith. Ten years later the same story (with a few adjustments) is being told with Danny Burstein, Christopher Lowell, Cynthia Nixon, and June Squibb Back in 2015 AI was a thing of our imaginations. A science fiction. A Star Trek episode. Not so much today. This changes the perspective dramatically. The chickens come home to roost in our front yard while we watch. In 2025, the idea of a beloved person morphed into a 3 dimensional being who is as capable as we wish them to be – they only learn what they are told about the person whose Prime they are – this play may finally be hitting too close to home. Thank goodness these actors are able to pick up the slack and then some. Marjorie (Squibb), a mere 85 years old, is living with her daughter Tess (Nixon) and Tess’ husband Jon (Burstein). The children have all flown and are rarely mentioned unless to use as a marker of time passing. One, the most painful, is not mentioned at all until it becomes a breaking point. You see, this family has welcomed a Prime, and AI generated computer that is Walter (Lowell), Tess’s father and Marjorie’s husband who has been dead for many years. Walter Prime’s purpose is to help Marjorie thrive rather than just exist. Marjorie had some hand in his appearance and age. When we meet them they are well into their relationship, and the parameters become clear. Walter’s behavior depends on what it is told. Facts are assimilated – like the night they got engaged – and they are shared as actual memories that help the family deal with the loved one’s absence. While odd, this seems amicable until Tess begins to melt down. In this sparse residence – not a photo or a painting on the wall, water is the only beverage, curtains are never fully opened – there is no way to avoid what is not a real person who is living with them. Jon is bearing the weight of the real life and tragedies that lay dormant. Danny Burstein, Cynthia Nixon; Photo by Joan Marcus The story is fluid. Once we understand what the beginning situation is, it changes like a breeze and Walter Prime disappears. He is replaced by Marjorie Prime who is at the very beginning of her tenure. Tess feels painted into a corner and questions the very value of the Primes. Why do we insist on keeping everyone alive, she asks. Jordan Harrison never tries o answer this question, which is a strong stance to take. Instead he lets the circumstances creep up on us until the Primes are forced to reassure one another. It is a bleak tale ably handled by this very fine cast. This is a seamless ensemble, switching partners and dance steps without a flicker of uncertainty. The gamut of emotions is pulled through the path of this family’s life like a cloth with an ancestral scent. We follow. These people, and their Primes, are not so much thinking about ramifications as they are surviving each revelation that every bend in the road reveals. And the Primes, because they are reflections of the humans who created them, end up eternally eternal. Marjorie Prime is a sobering piece knocking on our door. It has all the time in the world to wait us out.
