  "dtliExcerpt": "Nixon’s Tess is vulnerable enough for you to sense the fear in her eyes, but this is an actress with a steely core and, indeed, Nixon turns on a dime when her character realizes, as I think many of us have or will, that this brave new world is short on both guardrails and moral principles. Burstein is equally effective as husband Jon, his warm eyes dancing with empathy, although we are not always so sure about that, given his programming skills. “Am I supposed not to notice she is being nicer to that thing than me?” Tess snaps at one point, bringing up another salient A.I. issue. Squibb, 96, whose Broadway career stretches back to her role as Electra in the original 1960 production of “Gypsy,” is implacably excellent. For the record, she is the oldest actress ever to open a Broadway show.",

This suggests a mixed recommendation, highlighting strengths but noting significant shortcomings. | Gemini: The review praises the acting and direction, calling it a 'carefully calibrated' meditation.

Before it even arrived Off-Broadway, “Marjorie Prime” had big buzz — and expectations. That’s par for the course for a Pulitzer finalist being made into a movie starring Jon Hamm. Author Jordan Harrison reflected on the 1950s in his earlier work, “Maple and Vine.” Now he looks to the near-future. Primes — therapeutic humanoids with artificial intelligence — feed memories to people with age- or disease-addled minds. Like 86-year-old Marjorie (a peerless Lois Smith, who seems to age backwards in the show). She relies on Walter (Noah Bean), a prime, who looks like her late husband at age 30, to fill in the gaps. The crux of the story is that primes know only what they’re told. Should stories of our lives be edited so they’re more sunny and sanitized? If our minds are incomplete, are we our true selves? Marjorie, her deceptively fragile daughter Tess (Lisa Emery, marvelous) and her husband Jon (Stephen Root) confront such queries over time. Meanwhile, A.I.-motored machines become an increasing presence in their lives. Under the direction of Anne Kauffman, the acting is seamless.
