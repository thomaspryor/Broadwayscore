  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"What can be said here is that this Marjorie Prime, directed with restraint by Anne Kauffman (who was also behind the off-Broadway production in 2015), is both helped and hindered by its sudden relevance. It presents an intriguing and poignant suggestion of what might exist just a few decades from now, but perhaps doesn't suggest enough. With its novelty gone, Marjorie Prime must rely more firmly on its internal mechanics, which can be creaky.\"",
