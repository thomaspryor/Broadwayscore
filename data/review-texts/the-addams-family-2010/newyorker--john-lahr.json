  "bwwExcerpt": "In keeping with Addams’s graphic style, Zaks offers some delightfully surreal scenic moments: a tassel cut from the end of a rope scuttles offstage by itself; a giant squid and a monster iguanodon make surprise appearances. Zaks does his best to drive this money train down the bad track it’s laid on. (He replaced the show’s original directing team, Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch.) The show’s narrative, however, can’t handle Addams’s Grand Guignol edge; the book, written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, stays safely on the outside of Addams’s comic world, looking in. Of all the dark cards in Addams’s hand, the team has picked the weakest one: love. Wednesday, the crossbow-toting Goth, falls for Lucas Beineke (Wesley Taylor), a square from Ohio, whose buttoned-down parents come to dinner at the Addams house: in other words, it’s “The Birdcage” reimagined for Bela Lugosi. Except for the occasional blip of wit, fifteen minutes into the palaver the audience can feel the show flatlining.",
