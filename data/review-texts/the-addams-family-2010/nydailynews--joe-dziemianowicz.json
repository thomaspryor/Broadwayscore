  "bwwExcerpt": "Besides the recycling, writers Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice ('Jersey Boys') mangle the Addamses by having Wednesday tell her family to 'act normal' for the Beinekes. To the Addamses, macabre is normal. Though they've come up with eye-popping scenery, directors/designers Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch ('Shockheaded Peter') miss that essential fact. Ditto Jerry Zaks, a Broadway vet hired to consult after a Chicago tryout. Composer-lyricist Andrew Lippa ('The Wild Party') has come up with a batch of traditional songs, with no memorable breakouts. A couple of numbers are amusing, most are generic and one, 'Full Disclosure,' seems better suited to 'Legally Blonde.' The top-flight cast works hard to sell the material. Hair greased and accent set on bizarre, Lane is a riot and carries the production with his signature silliness.",
