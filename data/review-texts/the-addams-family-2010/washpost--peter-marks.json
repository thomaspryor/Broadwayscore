  "bwwExcerpt": "Oh Broadway, Broadway, Broadway. Don't you know, you never seem sadder or more imaginatively barren than when you're diving for commercial relevance in the dumpsters behind old TV shows and movies? 'The Addams Family' -- this year's answer to the question, How many talented people does it take to screw up a concept? -- marks a significant depressing of an ever-more-degraded standard. It's a new show that, despite its mechanized trickery, feels rickety beyond belief, the 2010 musical version of a series of magazine cartoons from the 1930s, '40s and '50s that became a '60s sitcom that became a '90s Hollywood franchise. What you might call a wholly pre-owned Broadway musical.",
