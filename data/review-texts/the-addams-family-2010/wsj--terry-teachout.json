  "bwwExcerpt": "If you're a New Yorker with children, or if you're bringing the family to Manhattan this summer, you'll have to go to 'The Addams Family.' It won't kill you. You'll laugh a lot, though never during the unmemorable songs, which are supposed to be funny but aren't. You're more than likely to spend a considerable part of the evening wondering how much the set cost. And as you depart the theater, you'll probably catch yourself wondering whether it was really, truly worth it to take your kids to a goodish musical whose tickets are so expensive that you can buy an iPad for less than the price of four orchestra seats.",

The mention of not insulting adult intelligence suggests some reservations, but overall it's a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The review is positive, stating that the show is \"thoroughly professional\" and achieves its goal of entertaining families. However, the phrase \"without insulting the intelligence of the adults\" suggests a slight reservation, indicating it's not a rave. | Kimi: The critic offers clear praise for the show's professional execution and its success in achieving its entertainment goals, representing a solid recommendation though without enthusiastic superlatives.",
