  "bwwExcerpt": "The hackneyed plot might have been serviceable if there were enough funny jokes in the mix, but despite Lane and the rest of the cast's best efforts, more often than not the humor falls flat. Where the obviously expensive show does shine, not surprisingly, is in the design elements, from the elaborate gothic scenery and costumes by the Improbable Theatre's ('Shockheaded Peter') Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch to the wonderfully imaginative and clever puppets designed by Basil Twist.",
