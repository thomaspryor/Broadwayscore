  "bwwExcerpt": "In his fresh, funny and chilling take on the genre, The Humans...playwright Stephen Karam believably adds elements of an old-fashioned Irish ghost story to the mix...Director Joe Mantello's exemplary ensemble is granted a wonderfully detailed and realistic two-level set by David Zinn, allowing for simultaneous action on both floors. Fitz Patton's sound design perfectly replicates the chorus of noises from city living and orchestrates them into a nightmarish soundscape. At one point Richard, more or less the observer of the gathering, describes a comic book series about a race of monsters who live in fear of humans. They may have a point. Stephen Karam sure does.",
