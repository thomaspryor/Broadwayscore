  "bwwExcerpt": "A smart decision was made to hold on to the exquisitely matched acting ensemble and also the play's, well, human scale by re-mounting it in the Helen Hayes, the smallest Tony-eligible house. As a result, the play retains its remarkable power as a tale of sorrows veined with silver threads of humor...As the evening moves like nature from light into darkness, Karam and his incomparable director Joe Mantello...take this first-class ensemble and us interlopers along a journey that's part family drama and thriller...Although the cast couldn't be bettered (and the standout remains the wildly gifted Steele), I thought they were still settling into the rhythms of a larger performance at the critics' preview I attended...I can only reiterate what I wrote earlier, that The Humans is tremendously exciting theater, and I remain convinced that you won't see a better play this season.",
