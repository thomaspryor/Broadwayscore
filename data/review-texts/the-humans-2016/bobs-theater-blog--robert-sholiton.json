  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The playwright has chosen to make the apartment, with its sudden loud noises and its abruptly failing lighting, a metaphor - a rather clumsy one, in my opinion - for the entropy in the characters’ lives. The acting is very strong and the situations are mostly easy to empathize with. However, the play loses steam toward the end and the final moments were a disappointment. Nevertheless, its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses.”\n\nRead more",
