  "bwwExcerpt": "It could certainly be argued that this home is haunted, but not by the usual suspects that pop up in horror flicks and scary campfire tales. As the Blakes gather for Thanksgiving dinner, along with Brigid's boyfriend and housemate, they are set upon, slowly but steadily, by frustrated and forsaken dreams and failed expectations...Karam...isn't interested in a polemic. Humans rather considers the trials its highly imperfect subjects face in a highly imperfect world, and resolves, without ever approaching sentimentality, that love is nonetheless resilient.",
