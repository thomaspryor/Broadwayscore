    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Critic explicitly calls the play 'a masterpiece' with 80/100 rating, indicating strong enthusiasm and recommendation despite the brief excerpt. | GPT-4o: The use of 'masterpiece' indicates a strong, enthusiastic recommendation, aligning with the original rating of 80, which suggests a high level of praise. | Gemini: The critic calls the play a \"masterpiece of ordinary dread,\" which indicates a positive assessment, though not a rave. The score aligns with the original rating of 80. | Kimi: The explicit original rating of 80 places this in the Positive range (70-84). While the excerpt uses superlative language ('masterpiece'), its brevity suggests it may be truncated or a pull-quote, warranting low confidence. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
