  "bwwExcerpt": "Our calendars are teasing spring, but it's still Thanksgiving in the Chinatown duplex Brigid Blake shares with boyfriend Richard in 'The Humans,' Stephen Karam's eloquent and wholly relatable modern family drama...Sensitively staged by Joe Mantello...Beck, too, stands out, blending the causticness brought by illness with an alarmingly healthy sense of humor about Aimee's predicament...Karam paints such a dynamic portrait of real life that I could only sit and absorb the insecurities and frailties batted around on stage. 'The Humans' is monumentally affecting, and something for which theatergoers should be oh-so-very thankful.",
