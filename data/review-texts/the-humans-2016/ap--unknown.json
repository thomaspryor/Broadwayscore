  "bwwExcerpt": "A sickening thud is the first thing you hear at Stephen Karam's powerful Broadway debut 'The Humans.' It's an unexplained noise, and unsettling. There are clearly unseen forces at work here. The dark comedy opened Thursday at the Helen Hayes Theatre with a terrific cast and an unsentimental look at the way we live today - anxiety-ridden, having little control over our environment or bodies, forever stretched and always a step from the abyss. It is an absolute triumph.",
