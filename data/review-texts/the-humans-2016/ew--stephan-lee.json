  "bwwExcerpt": "Thanks to Karam's script and the ensemble's performances, every slight, every shared memory, and every knowing glance feels utterly lived in. The brilliant direction by Joe Mantello helps hugely with believability as well -- the movement of the actors throughout the David Zinn's two-floor set, which we look in on like a dollhouse no one would want, is wonderfully intricate yet fluid...Some moments are absolutely devastating -- Reid Birney, as the hollowed-out father prone to thousand-yard stares, is the standout of the cast -- but it's unfair to label the play as simply 'depressing,' because it's depressing in the way life is depressing and hilarious in the way life is hilarious...Karam's transcendently mundane play is a reminder that family dinner dramas can still be surprising -- and they doesn't need ghosts or things that go bump in the night to achieve that. Real life is scary enough. A-",
