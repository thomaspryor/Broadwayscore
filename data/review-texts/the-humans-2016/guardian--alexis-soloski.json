  "bwwExcerpt": "The Humans...is a funny, mournful, richly detailed and deeply humane study of a beleaguered family celebrating Thanksgiving dinner in a tumbledown Chinatown apartment...Karam is a writer in the Chekhovian mode and watching The Humans may put one in mind of Chekhov's observation that while people's happiness is being created and destroyed, all they can really do is to go on eating their dinners...Karam's particular genius...is that he is less interested in the catastrophes that afflict us than in how we cope with them, gracefully and awkwardly. To pile on so much suffering would seem cruel in another playwright, but Karam is a profoundly compassionate writer. He shows us the bravery and tenderness of people trying -- and sometimes failing -- to get on with their lives.",
