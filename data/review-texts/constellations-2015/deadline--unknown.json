  "bwwExcerpt": "Gyllenhaal proved himself an irresistible stage actor a few years ago in another Nick Payne play, If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet, playing the rude, crude but immensely sympathetic uncle of a fat girl with uncomprehending parents. Wilson won her Golden Globe for The Affair and she has an off-kilter comic sensibility that works beautifully with her grounded co-star. They have great chemistry and charm here, even when saying and doing preposterous things, frequently at the same time. I was rooting for them all the way. Under Michael Longhurst's timing-is-everything direction, they work very hard at this repeated-scene business, which can't be easy. As an exercise in physical comedy, Constellations is a neat trick. But call it a trick or call it an exercise, it's never much more than either, and a challenge to take seriously.",
