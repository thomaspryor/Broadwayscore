  "bwwExcerpt": "Gyllenhaal proved himself an irresistible stage actor a few years ago in another Nick Payne play, If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet, playing the rude, crude but immensely sympathetic uncle of a fat girl with uncomprehending parents. Wilson won her Golden Globe for The Affair and she has an off-kilter comic sensibility that works beautifully with her grounded co-star. They have great chemistry and charm here, even when saying and doing preposterous things, frequently at the same time. I was rooting for them all the way. Under Michael Longhurst's timing-is-everything direction, they work very hard at this repeated-scene business, which can't be easy. As an exercise in physical comedy, Constellations is a neat trick. But call it a trick or call it an exercise, it's never much more than either, and a challenge to take seriously.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic praises the chemistry and performances but ultimately dismisses the play as 'never much more than' a trick or exercise that's 'a challenge to take seriously.' This is qualified appreciation without genuine recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review praises the performances and chemistry of the actors but ultimately describes the play as a 'trick' or 'exercise' and 'a challenge to take seriously,' indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review praises the actors' chemistry and direction but ultimately finds the play itself to be more of a trick or exercise than something truly meaningful. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to a 'low' confidence score. | Kimi: The review praises the lead actors' chemistry and charm but ultimately dismisses the play as a slight technical exercise lacking dramatic substance.",
