  "bwwExcerpt": "Who knew that higher physics could be so sexy, so accessible -- and so emotionally devastating? 'Constellations,' Nick Payne's gorgeous two-character drama, starring a perfectly matched Jake Gyllenhaal and Ruth Wilson, may be the most sophisticated date play Broadway has seen...as staged by its original director, Michael Longhurst, 'Constellations' has been scaled up without bloat, and it's every bit as affecting as I remember...It's no surprise that Ms. Wilson...is comfortable with her role's demands. But Mr. Gyllenhaal, whose theater experience is more limited, is every bit as persuasive. They are both fluent in the awkward body language of nerds in love, and in the crossed signals of emotional ambivalence. But they use contrasting and complementary physical vocabularies to balance, gracefully and clumsily, shifts in power and longing, aggression and retreat.",
