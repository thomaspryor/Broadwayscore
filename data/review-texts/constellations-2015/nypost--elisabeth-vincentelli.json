  "bwwExcerpt": "Rarely has quantum physics felt as romantic, as lively as it does in Broadway's 'Constellations'...We constantly seesaw between sweet and sour, comic and tragic, romantic and pedestrian as the actors jump back and forth between story lines...Director Michael Longhurst's understated staging helps us differentiate the assorted versions, but the entire show rests on the two actors, both making their Broadway debut. Gyllenhaal...is subtly wonderful in the less showy role. The earthy Roland tends to be the calm sort, though in some variations he reveals petulance and frustration. But mostly Roland is a sounding board for Marianne, a socially awkward type who covers her nervousness with cringe-inducing bad jokes. The British-born Wilson is tremendous here...At times the show feels more like a conceptual stunt than anything else, especially with its conclusion. But Wilson and Gyllenhaal place it in a universe where Broadway vehicles have heart.",

However, the text is very brief, limiting confidence in the full context. | Gemini: The critic states that the leads are perfectly matched in an intimate and mind-bending play, which is a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs superlative praise ('perfectly matched', 'mind-bending') without any caveats, though the single-sentence length indicates this is likely an excerpt requiring cautious interpretation.",
