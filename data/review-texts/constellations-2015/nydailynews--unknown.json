  "fullText": "Jake Gyllenhaal Ruth Wilson in a scene from Nick Payne's \"Constellations.\" (©2014 Joan Marcus) Jake Gyllenhaal and \"The Affair's\" Golden Globe winner Ruth Wilson ace their Broadway debuts in \"Constellations,\" a compact play with big ideas about life, love and death that is, happily, as brainy as it is sweet-hearted.\n\nPresented by Manhattan Theatre Club, the Nick Payne play cross-pollinates themes of science and love — similar ground to that of the British playwright's previous work, \"If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet,\" which starred Gyllenhaal in 2012.\n\nIn just over an hour, we see love bloom and face bleak hurdles for Roland (Gyllenhaal), a beekeeper, and Marianne (Wilson), a quantum physicist. The two meet cute — at a rainy barbecue. That's the stuff of classic romantic comedy. Then they meet again — and again. That's the stuff of the so-called \"multiverse,\" which forms the spine of the play.\n\nAs such, we see short variations of scenes in which things turn out a little bit or a lot differently for the two characters. It's like being in an echo chamber filled with fun-house mirrors and can be a bit off-putting — at least until the structural framework makes itself evident.\n\nPayne makes sure that it does, and that everyone's on the same page.\n\n\"Every choice, every decision you've ever and never made exists in an unimaginably vast ensemble of parallel universes,\" explains Marianne. In these counterpart worlds, different versions of ourselves act differently.\n\nWe've been down similar roads before in pop culture, with \"Groundhog Day\" being the classic version. But Payne puts his own stamp on the idea — and director Michael Longhurst's staging touches both the head and the heart deeply.\n\nEven Tom Scutt's lovely set, a bare stage below and beside a huge collection of inflated white balloons, packs a poetic touch. And the cast is swoon-worthy. Gyllenhaal is laid-back and ever-genunine as the passive Roland. Wilson, a two-time Olivier Award winner, is sensual and irresistibly carefree — a perfect foil. Together, they have something elusive: combustible chemistry.",
