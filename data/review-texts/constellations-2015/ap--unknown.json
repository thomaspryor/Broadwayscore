  "bwwExcerpt": "With impressive ingenuity, Nick Payne's touching, playful drama 'Constellations' takes on some big topics -- the nature of time and mortality -- through his unconventional presentation of a love story set in 'the multiverse'...Roland and Marianne flash through a series of scenes playing and replaying various versions of their encounters that twist into different outcomes...Despite abrupt scene and mood fluctuations, Gyllenhaal and Wilson perform the tricky repetitions and time shifts with breathtaking smoothness. Wilson expressively signals Marianne's emotions, whether glee or mischief or heartbreaking vulnerability. Gyllenhaal's performance is more opaque, yet he infuses Roland with decency and an earnest desire to communicate with the better-educated, more emotional Marianne...Despite Payne's witty, challenging structure, Michael Longhurst...keeps everything comprehensible, on track and focused, creating lovely quiet moments amid the whirlwind.",
