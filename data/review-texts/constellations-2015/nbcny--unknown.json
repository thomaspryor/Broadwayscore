  "bwwExcerpt": "'Constellations' takes a little more work to follow than, say, 'If/Then'...As it turns out, cues aren't so necessary. That's partly because 'Constellations' forsakes any linear quality for sheer chaos...It's also because the actors are so confident and well-paced (and clearly having fun) that you never doubt how they're playing any moment...The actors give true tour-de-force performances...Wilson...duels and parries with her partner to memorable effect, whether she's a sloppily emotional figure out on a first date, or an academic methodically enchanted by the mysteries of the universe. That's a tightrope to walk. Both really have to know this script like a comfortable old sweatshirt, they're wiggling around in it so much...Gyllenhaal and Wilson, with all of their many sides, are a dynamic pairing no matter which direction they're coming at us from.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performances ('tour-de-force', 'dynamic pairing') and confident execution, though acknowledges the play takes work to follow. Single excerpt limits full verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the actors' performances as 'tour-de-force' and describes them as a 'dynamic pairing,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is on the higher end of Positive. | Gemini: The review praises the actors' performances as \"tour-de-force\" and highlights their dynamic pairing, indicating a positive experience despite mentioning the non-linear structure of the play. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers high praise for the lead performances, describing them as 'tour-de-force' and 'dynamic,' though it acknowledges the play's non-linear structure requires effort from the audience.",
