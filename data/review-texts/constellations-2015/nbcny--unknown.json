  "bwwExcerpt": "'Constellations' takes a little more work to follow than, say, 'If/Then'...As it turns out, cues aren't so necessary. That's partly because 'Constellations' forsakes any linear quality for sheer chaos...It's also because the actors are so confident and well-paced (and clearly having fun) that you never doubt how they're playing any moment...The actors give true tour-de-force performances...Wilson...duels and parries with her partner to memorable effect, whether she's a sloppily emotional figure out on a first date, or an academic methodically enchanted by the mysteries of the universe. That's a tightrope to walk. Both really have to know this script like a comfortable old sweatshirt, they're wiggling around in it so much...Gyllenhaal and Wilson, with all of their many sides, are a dynamic pairing no matter which direction they're coming at us from.",
