  "bwwExcerpt": "Nick Payne's compelling drama is one for the heart just as much as the mind...The setting for the play...is 'The Multiverse,' past, present and future. As Marianne explains, cosmologists see time as an illusion; and so the theory is put into dramatic practice by showing us how each encounter can be re-played adjusting to changes in verbal nuance or personality. It's a heady conceit, and in the wrong hands, the constant repetition could be a drag - but under Michael Longhurst's splendid, balloon strewn staging, I found it most compelling. But if that doesn't blow your mind, the wonderfully fine-tuned performances will...And without sacrificing characterization, they both expertly maneuver through each new scene shift, revealing how love, that immutable force of nature, transcends the laws of time and space.",
