  "bwwExcerpt": "'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is a middle-of-the-road musical with a pale score, a flavorless book and a dearth of eye candy that could have at least made it a spectacle...Heading a large, game and polished cast, Christian Borle, a Tony winner for 'Something Rotten!' and 'Peter and the Starcatcher,' has panache as Wonka. He plays the chocolate maker as snarky, not all that sinister. As Charlie, young Ryan Foust was terrific in the performance I saw; he shares the role with two others.",
