  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The stellar cast and incredible choreography do not disappoint. The Oompa Loompa scenes were so funny and creative they had me roaring with laughter. It was hilarious…Christian Borle is perfection as Willy, and he impressed me as always. My one problem with the show are the sets. They were not spectacular, and you needed to leave it to your own imagination…A very entertaining night at the theater if you can let yourself go and let your inner child out for the night.\"\n\nRead more",
