  "fullText": "Don’t expect a sugar rush from “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” the new musical that opened at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater on Sunday. This latest adaptation of Roald Dahl’s winningly sinister children’s story from 1964 is — thank heaven — no sweeter than the two film adaptations it inspired, starring Gene Wilder (1971) and Johnny Depp (2005).\n\nThen again, this big but tentative show — which features a book by David Greig and songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman — doesn’t burst with flavor of any kind, at least not during its exposition-crammed first act. Only in its second half does the show acquire a distinct taste, and it definitely isn’t confectionary.\n\nThat no one goes to Dahl for the blandly picturesque was made clear a few years ago by the success of the darkness-shrouded musical adaptation of his “Matilda.” The appeal of this writer, for both children and grown-ups, has always been his nasty streak.\n\nAfter more than an hour of chipper throat clearing, that’s the streak that finally emerges, like a stinging ripple of rum in vanilla fudge, in this retooled adaptation out of London, directed by Jack O’Brien. It is also the moment when the show’s star, Christian Borle, at last comes into his own as the violently eccentric Willy Wonka, who owns and runs the enchanted factory of the musical’s title.\n\nThe Broadway “Charlie” is an improvement on its London incarnation, which I saw four years ago. That version was staged by Sam Mendes, then basking in commercial glory as a director of James Bond films. As frantic and gadget-driven as any 007 movie, it was a mega-musical that left you feeling glazed and overstuffed.",

He notes it's an improvement over London but still describes it as 'tentative' overall. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'big but tentative' and 'doesn't burst with flavor' in the first act, but acknowledges improvement in the second half and over the London production. The tone is mixed with some positive elements, but not a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review is mixed, praising the second half and Christian Borle's performance, but criticizing the first act and comparing it unfavorably to the London production. The overall tone suggests a qualified recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic praises Christian Borle's performance and notes the second half finally captures Dahl's darker tone, the first act is criticized as 'exposition-crammed' and 'tentative,' resulting in a qualified, mixed assessment without a clear recommendation to attend.",
