  "bwwExcerpt": "The roles are mostly well played, David Grieg's book is fine, the songs are serviceable, and the sets are fairly clever, but none of it is...transporting. To stretch the sweet-tooth metaphor as far as a piece of saltwater taffy, the new Charlie is the Broadway version of a Whitman's sampler: A few mouth-watering delights; far too many disappointing nougats. Kids will probably enjoy it a lot more than their more discerning parents.",
