Praises visual elements but finds the adaptation fundamentally lacking in capturing the source material's essence. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review. The review praises the visual elements but criticizes the lack of darker undertones, indicating a balance of positive and negative aspects. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the visual spectacle but criticizes the lack of depth compared to the source material, indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic praises the visual design and costumes but criticizes the show for lacking the darker undertones of the source material, resulting in a balanced mixed assessment matching the 60/100 rating.",
