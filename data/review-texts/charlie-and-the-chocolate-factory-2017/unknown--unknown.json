  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"This big but tentative show doesn’t burst with flavor of any kind, not during its exposition-crammed first act. Only in its second half does the show acquire a distinct taste and it isn’t confectionary...The idea of macabre punishment seems to have acted as a stimulant on the creative faculties of everyone involved as the show turns increasingly surreal...Most gratifying is the transformation of Borle...Willy switches into dissing diva mode with a skip in his step and a fork in his tongue.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt criticizes the first act as tentative and exposition-heavy, but acknowledges the show improves in the second half with more distinct character and surreal elements. Single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review describes a show that starts off weak but improves in the second half, with particular praise for Borle's performance. The mixed tone and lack of a strong recommendation suggest a score in the Mixed range. | Gemini: The review is mixed, starting tentatively but improving in the second half. The praise for Borle's transformation is a highlight, but the overall impression is not strongly positive or negative. | Kimi: The critic finds the first act 'exposition-crammed' and lacking flavor, but praises the second half's distinct tone and Borle's 'most gratifying' performance, resulting in an ambivalent assessment.",
