  "bwwExcerpt": "While Charlie and the Chocolate Factory may not enjoy more critical approval in its second iteration, it's going to make a ton of money, both on Broadway and the road. It's goofy, loud and imaginative - superatively so, in some key respects. And it delivers two things children delight in: stories about scrappy urchins triumphing over doltish adults (cf Annie, Matilda), and comical obliteration of ill-behaved nasties (cf Shockheaded Peter).",
