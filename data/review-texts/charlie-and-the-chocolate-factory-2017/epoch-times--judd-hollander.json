  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Sadly, the show fails to keep faith with its source material, proving to be an uneven mixture of satire and wistfulness…The show’s creators aren’t sure whether to present a childhood fantasy or a dark allegory...The musical numbers written especially for the stage are not nearly as strong as the tunes used in the film…But Borle does an excellent job...‘Charlie’ reminds one of a rather misshapen cake. It may taste okay, but the proper overall effect is lost.”\n\nRead more",
