  "bwwExcerpt": "The set is minimalist, save for one scene in 'a chocolate Eden,' a terrarium where you can eat the dandelions. I suspect adults will find both wanting, though things improve in the second act...Given the talent and production values, I'm sure the musical will enjoy a long life on Broadway. But for all its attempts to recreate the delight of Roald Dahl's story, it left me with something of a toothache.",
