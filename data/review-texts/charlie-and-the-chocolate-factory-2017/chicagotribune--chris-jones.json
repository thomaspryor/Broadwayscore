  "bwwExcerpt": "Borle's problems are intensified by the show's decision not to take us to the chocolate factory until intermission, spending all of Act 1 on Charlie's early life, the golden ticket backstory and, weirdly, on Charlie's relationship with the owner of the local candy shop (also played by Borle). This was a truly terrible decision (that candy store guy, who is cold, is not Wonka). It ignores what is on the marquee and also then shoves so much caper-esque plot into Act 2 that the show can't wait around for a moment to focus on what really matters.",
