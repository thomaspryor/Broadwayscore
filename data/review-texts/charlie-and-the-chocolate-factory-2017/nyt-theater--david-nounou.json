    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('visual feast', 'delight', 'stunning') but extremely brief excerpt lacks depth for full assessment of critic's overall recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review praises the visual elements and suggests the show will appeal to a broad audience, indicating a positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the visual aspects of the production, calling it a \"visual feast\" that will delight both children and adults. This indicates a positive recommendation, although it's focused on a specific element. | Kimi: The review offers enthusiastic praise for the production design ('visual feast,' 'stunning sets and costumes') and promises it will 'delight' audiences, indicating a strong recommendation. Confidence is low due to the excerpt length (under 150 words).",
