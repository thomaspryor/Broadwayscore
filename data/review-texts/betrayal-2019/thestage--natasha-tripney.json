  "bwwExcerpt": "Harold Pinter's Betrayal is a play that's easier to admire than to love. Structurally, it's masterful, charting the emotional fallout from a seven-year extramarital affair in reverse chronological order, starting at the bitter end and rewinding to the first, snatched kiss. It's also, essentially, a study of affluent people wounding each other. Fortunately, Jamie Lloyd knows exactly what he's doing when it comes to Pinter - this is very good indeed.",
