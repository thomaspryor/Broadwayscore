  "bwwExcerpt": "Harold Pinter's Betrayal is a play that's easier to admire than to love. Structurally, it's masterful, charting the emotional fallout from a seven-year extramarital affair in reverse chronological order, starting at the bitter end and rewinding to the first, snatched kiss. It's also, essentially, a study of affluent people wounding each other. Fortunately, Jamie Lloyd knows exactly what he's doing when it comes to Pinter - this is very good indeed.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite opening with qualified praise about the play itself, the critic clearly endorses this production with 'this is very good indeed' and praises Lloyd's direction. Single excerpt warning suggests confident positive assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the structural mastery of the play and highlights the director's adept handling of Pinter's work, indicating a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review acknowledges potential drawbacks of the play itself but praises the production, stating it is \"very good indeed.\" This indicates a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt clearly praises the production as 'very good indeed' and the play's structure as 'masterful,' indicating a strong positive recommendation despite noting the play is easier to admire than love.",
