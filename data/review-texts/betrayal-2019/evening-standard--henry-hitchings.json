  "bwwExcerpt": "It's Hiddleston's poise and sensitivity that impress the most. There's a brilliant scene that demonstrates his usually under-exploited flair for comedy: toying with Jerry over lunch in an Italian restaurant, he humiliates the feckless waiter, attacks his prosciutto as though fighting a duel, and gulps white wine like a bandit. Yet he's also genuinely moving, and when he weeps his eyes and cheeks glisten with tears.",

The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on Hiddleston's performance, highlighting his poise, sensitivity, and comedic flair. While it doesn't give a comprehensive overview of the entire production, the positive emphasis on the lead performance suggests a positive, but not rave, recommendation. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers strong praise for the lead actor's performance, describing it as 'brilliant,' 'genuinely moving,' and exhibiting flair for comedy, which indicates a positive recommendation, though the limited context prevents a higher confidence assessment.",
