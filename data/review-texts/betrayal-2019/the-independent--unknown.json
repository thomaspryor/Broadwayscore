  "bwwExcerpt": "In a modern classic, the actor shows off, to my mind, his classical theatre chops too. His range is beginning to look pretty limitless; Hiddleston excels in a brilliant performance as Robert, the publisher who is cuckolded by the seven-year affair between his wife Emma (Zawe Ashton) and his best friend, literary agent Jerry (Charlie Cox).",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for Hiddleston's 'brilliant performance' and calling his range 'limitless' indicates positive recommendation, but single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Hiddleston's performance as 'brilliant' and highlights his 'limitless' range, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on Hiddleston's 'brilliant performance' and 'limitless' range, indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing the score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead actor ('brilliant', 'excels', 'limitless range') and refers to the play as a 'modern classic'. Per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, scoring in the upper Positive range (80-84) with low confidence due to limited excerpt availability.",
