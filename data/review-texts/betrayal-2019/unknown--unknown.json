However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review is a critic's pick and calls the interpretation \"revelatory\", indicating a positive assessment. However, due to the limited text available, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The 'Critic's Pick' designation and description of the production as 'revelatory' indicate strong enthusiasm, but the single excerpt format necessitates conservative scoring at the high end of the Positive range.",
