  "bwwExcerpt": "Hiddleston, especially, is superb in conveying Robert's unhealed emotional wounds. His initial mocking superiority to Jerry is explained by the fact he has long been aware of his best friend's covert betrayal. In the Venetian scene, when he learns that Emma's affair has been going on for five years, he has the poleaxed stare of a man whose world has fallen apart. But there is a savage humour to the restaurant scene where Hiddleston stabs at a melon as if displacing his anger with Jerry.",
