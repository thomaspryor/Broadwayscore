  "bwwExcerpt": "Hiddleston, especially, is superb in conveying Robert's unhealed emotional wounds. His initial mocking superiority to Jerry is explained by the fact he has long been aware of his best friend's covert betrayal. In the Venetian scene, when he learns that Emma's affair has been going on for five years, he has the poleaxed stare of a man whose world has fallen apart. But there is a savage humour to the restaurant scene where Hiddleston stabs at a melon as if displacing his anger with Jerry.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong praise for lead performance ('superb'), detailed analysis of acting craft. However, only one excerpt available makes full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Hiddleston's performance as 'superb' and highlights his ability to convey complex emotions. However, without the full review or a clear overall verdict, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on Hiddleston's superb performance, suggesting a positive experience, but without the full review, confidence is low. I am scoring it as positive based on the strong praise for the actor. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance, describing it as 'superb' with 'savage humour,' suggesting a positive recommendation, though the single-excerpt limitation prevents higher confidence in the overall verdict.",
