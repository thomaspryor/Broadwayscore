  "fullText": "This fall's hot-ticket Broadway show  a revival of Harold Pinter’s 1978 drama Betrayal starring real-life Hollywood couple Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz  is a lot less steamy than you might suspect.\n\nThough sex is central to its love-triangle plot, Betrayal is driven less by hot passion than cool intellect, less trembling lips than stiff upper ones. The nine short scenes unfold in roughly reverse-chronological order, a structural choice that was probably more groundbreaking 35 years ago. And Craig and Weisz exude a certain froideur as married upper-class Brits Robert and Emma even before she begins a four-year affair with Robert’s best friend, Jerry (the sensational Rafe Spall).\n\nCraig, his famously chiseled features half-hidden under a '70s shag, seems oddly blasé about his wife's infidelity, while Weisz strikes a lovely if tentative balance between expressive physicality and inward control. Spall has the best handle on his character's inchoate and conflicted feelings, particularly in his drunken declaration of love at the end of the play (and the beginning of the affair).\n\nThough Betrayal runs less than 90 intermission-less minutes, it can feel longer  thanks in part to Pinter's notorious pregnant pauses, his elliptical dialogue of misdirection, and the languorous scene changes for Ian MacNeil's simple but stylish sets.\n\nDirector Mike Nichols' handsome, well-staged production is not your typical crowd-pleaser. Those seeking a more traditional star turn might want to scan the orchestra section before the curtain goes up. (The night I attended, the audience included Javier Bardem, Bette Midler, Glenn Close, and Oprah Winfrey.)\n\nPerhaps because Pinter's backwards structure forces him to seed each scene with clues to his puzzle-like plot, there's an off-putting guardedness to the main trio. They regard their emotions from a safe distance, as if with hands safely tucked into pockets. Unable to engage with each other, they may prove a challenge for audiences to embrace as well. B+",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | No bucket consensus - using median score | Claude: The review gives a B+ grade and calls it a 'handsome, well-staged production' with praise for Spall's performance and the staging. However, it notes the show 'can feel longer' than its runtime and describes an 'off-putting guardedness' that may challenge audiences. The positive grade outweighs the reservations. | GPT-4o: The review provides a mixed assessment, noting the production's intellectual appeal but emotional distance. The original rating of D suggests a negative leaning, but the truncated nature of the text and some positive elements (e.g., 'handsome, well-staged') warrant a mixed classification. | Gemini: The review expresses disappointment, noting the production is \"less steamy than you might suspect\" and that the characters are difficult to embrace. The B+ grade is misleading, as the review itself is largely critical. | Kimi: The review carries an explicit 'D' rating and describes the production as feeling longer than its runtime, possessing an 'off-putting guardedness,' and proving 'a challenge for audiences to embrace.' While praising Rafe Spall's performance, the overall assessment is negative. Confidence is low due to truncated text. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Negative",

  "bwwExcerpt": "But as a focused exploration of human duplicity, Betrayal is an unembellished marvel and this Broadway revival gives the 1978 play a smart, stripped down treatment. The cast, imported from last spring's London production, includes Tom Hiddleston (Loki in the Marvel films and forthcoming Disney+ series), and Charlie Cox (the title role in Netflix's Daredevil). Along with British actress Zawe Ashton (Velvet Buzzsaw), Hiddleston and Cox come with long theater resumes; they are both terrific sprung from their comic book trappings.",
