  "bwwExcerpt": "Lloyd has consummate control of each beat, each micro betrayal, how every truth or lie slices deep or shallow. The staging is stark, the set simple - just three walls of a pinkish fake marble, mostly offering a morose depth of field, occasionally pressing in claustrophobically. Whichever two characters are having their terse, tense interactions, the third lurks or looms. Maybe in the background, watchful even if unseeing; maybe moving past on a revolve, unseen yet accusatory.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows strong appreciation for the director's craft and staging choices, using praise like 'consummate control' and detailed analysis of effective theatrical techniques. However, this is a single curated excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the director's control and the effective staging, suggesting a positive view. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review text necessitate a cautious approach, placing it at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the actor's control and the staging, suggesting a positive experience, but without a clear recommendation or overall verdict, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the director's precise control and the production's atmospheric staging, demonstrating clear admiration for the technical execution despite the limitation of a single curated quote.",
