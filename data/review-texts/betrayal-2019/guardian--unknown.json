It's a handsome physical production, with large, well-appointed interiors by Ian MacNeil wafting in and out to composer James Murphy's moody noodling and glowing with Brian MacDevitt's evocative lighting. Daniel Craig shucks off his 007 persona to become Robert, a successful book publisher whose wife, Emma (Rachel Weisz) conducts a seven-year affair with Robert's friend Jerry (Rafe Spall), a literary agent. The compact, rugged Craig hasn't shrunken from years behind the camera: he projects himself fully and muscularly to the back stalls. Craig even enlivened vastly inferior material when last he was on the Great White Way, in the 2009 police melodrama A Steady Rain. And he's not emoting in a vacuum: Weisz and Spall have charisma to spare, not to mention keen sexual chemistry for their Kilburn flat trysts. So the design is lovely, the cast is appealing and the play itself, while of its time, is not essentially dated. It's simply that nobody gets the tone.\n\nOne imagines Nichols telling the actors on their first day of rehearsal: \"Kids, forget everything you thought you knew about Pinter. These aren't posh-talking, emotionally repressed stiffs who use words as instruments of torture. They screw; they get pissed; they're human.\" And so over the course of 90 minutes we get a lot of subtext acting, externalised anger and drunken slapstick, and too little of the menace and tension one associates with this author.\n\nMind you, Betrayal isn't one of Pinter's early studies of vicious bums or cryptic thugs. And it's not from his late period of grim totalitarian allegories. (As Michael Billington documented in his invaluable 1996 biography, the piece is based on Pinter's long affair with BBC presenter Joan Bakewell.) There's a good deal of tenderness and humour in Betrayal, and these charming actors bring it out. They capture the haunted, fractured half-lives of adulterers, torn between two beds, two narrative tracks, two sets of memories. But they miss the current of sadism and emotional brutality that courses underneath. It's a question of technique. Restraint, understatement and precision with language are called for, not Craig's periodic spurts of rage or Weisz's brittle weepiness. And Spall's scruffy, laddish vibe undermines Jerry's desperation and neediness.\n\nThe play is famously structured in reverse chronological order, with the first scene taking place in 1977, two years after Emma and Jerry's affair ended, and spooling back to 1968, with the first flickers of attraction. That built-in device ensures that the action unfolds with gathering, inescapable irony, so that the final scene, in which Jerry professes his love to the astonished Emma, is both spontaneous and fatalistic. If the Broadway engagement succeeds at all (beyond rampant ticket sales at absurdly inflated prices), it's because the dramaturgy is indestructible. But the music is lacking.\n\nIs that so great a pity? If you don't know how a piece of music should be performed, does it matter if it's played poorly? I can't recommend this event to anyone who loves Pinter or Betrayal. If you don't care and you've got a few hundred burning a hole in your pocket, then have at it. But for goodness' sake, don't watch the 1983 movie starring Patricia Hodge, Jeremy Irons and Sir Ben Kingsley too soon after. It is an ideal transfer of play to film, and impeccably acted. If you were to screen it after seeing this glossy, empty revival, you'd feel cheated.\n\nDid you catch this show – or any other recently?
