  "bwwExcerpt": "Tom Hiddleston is back on stage, bringing Jamie Lloyd's six-month all-hands-on-deck salute to Harold Pinter at the West End theatre that bears his name to an immensely satisfying climax - one which not only re-confirms Betrayal as a modern masterpiece, built to last, but reassures us that Hiddleston has got the theatrical acting chops to head up there among the greats.",
