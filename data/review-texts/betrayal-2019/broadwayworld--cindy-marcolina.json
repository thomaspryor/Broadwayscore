  "bwwExcerpt": "The actors - quite literally - cast shadows, the structure of their relationships reflected on the back wall. The nudity of the stage is dressed with their internal turmoil and ultimate betrayal as the director employs a dark and sexy attitude that heightens Pinter's homoerotic subtext - mainly conveyed through Hiddleston's delivery. He plays with space and distance to compress and decompress the energy through staging, which results in a sometimes airy, sometime asphyxiating breath of emotion.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses appreciative language about the director's choices and staging effects, suggesting artistic merit, but as a single curated quote it may not reflect the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction and Hiddleston's performance, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, the single excerpt and lack of a full verdict necessitate a cautious approach, placing it at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the director's choices and the actors' performances, highlighting the use of space and staging to create emotional impact. While positive, the limited text and lack of explicit recommendation keep the score in the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the direction, performances, and staging, using evocative language like 'dark and sexy' and 'breath of emotion' to describe an artistically effective production. As a single curated excerpt, full context is unavailable.",
