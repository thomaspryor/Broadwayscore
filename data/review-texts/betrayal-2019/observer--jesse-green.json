    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Clear praise calling the production a 'masterclass' with strong performances, but extremely brief text limits confidence in the full critical assessment. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language, describing the production as a 'masterclass' and highlighting the performances as both 'intimate and theatrically commanding', indicating a high level of recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses the term \"masterclass\" and praises the performances as both intimate and theatrically commanding, indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The single available sentence uses superlative language ('masterclass') with no reservations or caveats, indicating strong enthusiasm. However, with only one sentence provided, confidence is reduced as the full context of the review is unknown. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
