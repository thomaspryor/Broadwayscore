  "bwwExcerpt": "With a young, absurdly attractive cast led by Hollywood favorite Tom Hiddleston, dynamically minimalist staging and an invitation to the audience to rethink its sympathies, Lloyd presents a subtly fresh take on one of Harold Pinter's greatest plays. It's a brave, sexy, at times emotionally intense, bravura production.",

The use of superlatives suggests a rave review, despite the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"subtly fresh take\", \"brave, sexy, at times emotionally intense, bravura production\", and mentions a dynamically minimalist staging and an absurdly attractive cast, indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers strong praise ('bravura', 'brave', 'dynamically minimalist') without reservation, suggesting a clear recommendation, though the single-excerpt format warrants reduced confidence.",
