  "bwwExcerpt": "Betrayal is best when played as a teasing, slightly sinister comedy, as it was in a 2000 Broadway production in which then little-known John Slattery played Robert and made the most of it, stealing the show from his co-stars Juliette Binoche and Liev Schreiber. Hiddleston is a fine actor and gets some laughs out of the part as Robert toys with the other two, but he spends much of the play seeming forlorn where Slattery was impish, which is why this staging drags a bit even at an abbreviated 90 minutes. Cox, meanwhile, is more than adequate as the duplicitous friend, but Emma Ashton merely comes across as sweet and slightly passive. She hardly seems worth anyone's trouble, and I'm not sure the play does either.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic finds the production lacking compared to a superior 2000 version, criticizes the lead performance as 'forlorn' where it should be 'impish,' says the staging 'drags,' and concludes by questioning if the play is worth anyone's trouble. | GPT-4o: The review expresses disappointment with the current production compared to a previous one, mentioning that it 'drags a bit' and questioning the worth of the play. While there is some praise for the actors, the overall sentiment is negative. | Gemini: The review praises Hiddleston's acting but notes the staging drags and Ashton's performance is underwhelming. The overall sentiment is mixed, with some positives but significant reservations. | Kimi: The critic finds the production drags despite its brevity, compares it unfavorably to the 2000 revival, and explicitly questions whether the play is worth seeing, though acknowledging the actors are competent.",
