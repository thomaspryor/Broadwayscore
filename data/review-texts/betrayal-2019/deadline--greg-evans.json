  "bwwExcerpt": "Secret love shacks, or love flats as the case may be, notwithstanding, no affair is an island built for two - there's always at least a third person in the mix, typically considered the betrayed. In Jamie Lloyd's masterful revival of Harold Pinter's Betrayal - one is tempted to call it a reinvention, so deeply and definitely urgent is his take - three of the ever-shifting betrayers and betrayees occupy the stage at all times, one or another bearing silent witness as the other two enact an affair's all-too-familiar scenes of lies, transgressions, excitement and the love that, at least fleetingly, prompts it all.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls the revival 'masterful' and 'a reinvention' with 'deeply and definitely urgent' direction. However, confidence is low as this is only one excerpt from a longer review and may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as 'masterful revival' and 'deeply and definitely urgent,' suggesting a highly favorable view of the production. The lack of a full review text and single excerpt warning reduce confidence slightly, but the tone is clearly enthusiastic. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"masterful revival\" and \"deeply and definitely urgent,\" indicating a positive assessment. Given that this is a single excerpt, the confidence is low, but the strong positive language warrants a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the production as 'masterful' and a 'reinvention' that is 'deeply and definitely urgent,' indicating strong enthusiasm and recommendation. Confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
