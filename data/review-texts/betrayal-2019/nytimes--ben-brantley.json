  "bwwExcerpt": "Mr. Lloyd's interpretation balances surface elegance with an aching profundity, so that 'Betrayal' becomes less about the anguish of love than of life itself. Specifically, I mean life as lived among people whom we can never truly know. That includes those closest to us; it also includes our own, elusive selves.",
