However, with only one truncated excerpt available, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the director, describing his understanding of Pinter as unparalleled. This suggests a highly positive view of the production, fitting the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the director's work as a \"triumph,\" indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language warrants a high score within the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strong positive language ('triumph') praising the director's mastery of the material, indicating a clear recommendation. Confidence is low due to limited text availability and truncation.",
