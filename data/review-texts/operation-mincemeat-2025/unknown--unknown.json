However, with only a fragment available and 'Read more' suggesting truncation, the full verdict could lean more positive or negative. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some positive aspects like clever rhymes and comic staging but stops short of a strong recommendation, indicating a mixed impression. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights both positive and negative aspects, suggesting a mixed experience. The phrase \"clever rhyme here and there\" and \"rigorously silly comic staging\" indicate some enjoyable elements, but the lack of destined greatness keeps it from being a positive recommendation.",
