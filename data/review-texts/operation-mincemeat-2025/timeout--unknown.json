They don't stop nudging you with their elbows, and while moments of that can tickle-I smiled more than once at Hodgson's bluff obliviousness-two and a half hours of it gets a little exhausting.",

The tone is neither fully positive nor negative, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review presents a mixed opinion. While the critic acknowledges potential enjoyment for some, they also express feeling exhausted by the performance, indicating a 'hit or miss' experience.",
