  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "There's a real, beating heart at the center of the show that elevates it above mere farce. Beneath the spoofs and gags, there's an emotional depth that makes the comedy funnier and the satire sharper. While skewering the stuffy, educated British elite, SpitLip has done its due diligence by making room among the jokes to pay homage to the real man whose body was used as a pawn in a military operation.",

However, the single excerpt and lack of a clear overall verdict necessitate a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review highlights the show's emotional depth and elevates it, suggesting a positive experience, but the single excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation warrants a score in the lower end of the positive range.",
