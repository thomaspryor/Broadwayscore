  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "There's a real, beating heart at the center of the show that elevates it above mere farce. Beneath the spoofs and gags, there's an emotional depth that makes the comedy funnier and the satire sharper. While skewering the stuffy, educated British elite, SpitLip has done its due diligence by making room among the jokes to pay homage to the real man whose body was used as a pawn in a military operation.",
