However, with only one excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as a 'crowd-pleaser' with 'unexpected poignancy' that leaves the audience 'in tears', suggesting a strong positive reaction. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language used is indicative of a rave review. | Gemini: The review describes the show as a \"crowd-pleaser\" and mentions its high energy and poignancy, indicating a positive experience. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it in the middle of the positive range.",
