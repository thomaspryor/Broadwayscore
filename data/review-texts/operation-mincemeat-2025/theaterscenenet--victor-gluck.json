    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Single excerpt suggests cultural barriers prevent the show from fully connecting with its target audience. Limited text and potential for cherry-picking requires low confidence and conservative mixed score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the humor does not resonate with the target audience, indicating a negative reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt states that many jokes don't land for American audiences, indicating a negative experience for that demographic. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates core comedic content fails to connect with Broadway's primary audience, suggesting a fundamentally flawed theatrical experience despite possible authenticity.",
