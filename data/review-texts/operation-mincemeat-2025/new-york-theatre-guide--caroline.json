  "fullText": "Read our review of Operation Mincemeat on Broadway, an award-winning musical comedy from London centered on a real-life World War II deception operation. Historical retellings can be as reverent as they are irreverent. In Operation Mincemeat, named after the eponymous World War II mission, a British MI5 security team poses an anonymous corpse as a fallen British pilot with a loaded briefcase of false information to drive the German military out of Sicily. The musical comedy gives this story a Looney Tunes spirit through the twists and turns. Robert Hastie’s direction and Jenny Arnold’s frenetic choreography ensure a well-oiled engine of comedic and dramatic moving parts amid the music. Operation Mincemeat is indebted to its five-person English stars, who may be due for a Broadway breakthrough: David Cumming (as the charmingly meek Charles Cholmondeley), Claire-Marie Hall (as the spirited Jean Leslie), Natasha Hodgson (as the egotistical Ewen Montagu), Jak Malone (as the secretary Hester Leggat), Zoë Roberts (as the no-nonsense Colonel Johnny Bevan), also rotating through ensemble roles. They embody cartoonish characters yet don’t collapse into caricature. In particular, the ingenious cross-gender casting of Hodgson, parodying manly bluster as Montagu, pokes knowing fun at the man otherwise glorified in British history. Malone plays middle-aged secretary Hester with a hard-boiled seniority while dipping into her private pains. Malone’s song “Dear Bill” catches the audience’s hearts off guard. These characters best represent how this group find themselves — although they won’t admit it aloud — living vicariously through a dead man, as highlighted in the signature number “Making a Man.” Operation Mincemeat is a cup of British comedy, sometimes with drawn-out humor to a fault — not for every American. But it also captures the Hollywood hagiographic, the self-deprecating, the ironic, and the tragic that will make you gasp. \"How else do we make 100,000 German troops disappear?\" A transfer from London's West End with the original British cast, Operation Mincemeat follows a real-life slice of World War II history. A British MI5 team disguises a corpse as a British pilot, attaches it to a briefcase of false information, and arranges the dumping of the body at Spain shores to fool the German forces away from Sicily, so Britain can claim Sicily with reduced casualties and turn World War II in their favor. Each of the main MI5 team members harbors different motives for their involvement, from Montagu’s greed for renown to Leslie’s desire for respect in a world that ignores women to Cholmondeley’s drive to simply get the job done. Cumming, Hodgson, and Roberts co-wrote the musical with Felix Hagan; the four are collectively credited as the comedy troupe SpitLip. Ben Stones’ scenic military-grid backdrop may seem aesthetically modest — until the second half begins to deploy a succession of visual surprises and bonkers set pieces. As comedic and morbid as the premise sounds, the musical nods at the ethics of exploiting an anonymous person’s body (the corpse is wisely left as an invisible entity for the audience’s imagination). Much of my audience’s indignant gasping came from Montagu’s callous consideration of the body’s history. Operation Mincemeat can’t dive into World War II without taking stabs at Nazism in the vein of Mel Brooks humor. Act II opens with Nazis in the dubstep song “Das Übermensch,” followed by a character glaring at the American audience, breaking the fourth wall in reproach.

The four-time Tony Award-nominated Operation Mincemeat is the hilarious and unbelievable true story of the twisted secret mission that won the Allies World War II. That operation transforms into a musical in this five-star production, coming straight to Broadway from a lauded West End run. The original music in this new show tell the story of wartime, so audiences can expect brassy orchestrations, anthemic tunes, and plenty of clever and hilarious lyrics. While this is a fun comedy, children four and under are not allowed in Broadway shows. Well, the Allies directed the operation — but! The stage version is directed by Robert Hatsie. This is one of the most anticipated British exports in years, and for good reason: the show got dozens of five-star reviews and was the Olivier winner for Best New Musical. The musical comedy troupe SpitLip wrote this musical, and many of its amazing members also star in the show and will be coming with it to Broadway. Originally published on Mar 20, 202522:00",
