  "dtliExcerpt": "If this looks to you like actors having fun, there’s a good chance you’ll dig what Operation Mincemeat is grinding. To me, it looks like actors pushing too hard. They don’t stop nudging you with their elbows, and while moments of that can tickle—I misled more than once at Hodgson’s bluff obliviousness—two and a half hours of it gets a little exhausting.",

The single excerpt suggests a mixed experience overall. | Gemini: The review presents a mixed opinion. While some may enjoy the actors' energy, the reviewer finds it exhausting after a while, suggesting a middle-ground recommendation.",
