  "fullText": "Natasha Hodgson (center, in a chalk-stripe suit) plays Ewen Montagu — and many others — in Operation Mincemeat Photo by Julieta Cervantes By PJ Grisar March 20, 2025 In “Making a Man,” a much-reprised number in the West End musical Operation Mincemeat , the agents at MI5 gush over the attributes of their boy “Bill” — a corpse with a completely manufactured backstory. The fictional Royal Marine Major William Martin was able to wrestle lions and look smart in a suit, “a dependable dreamboat, a shining example of what humans can be.” His country needs him. Or, more accurately, his body, which a submarine will wash ashore to Spain, handcuffed to a suitcase stuffed with documents to convince the Nazis of Allied plans to invade Greece and Sardinia, when they are actually headed for Sicily. The scheme to acquire this cadaver and the subterfuge that followed are the thrust of the Olivier award-winning musical, newly arrived to Broadway with an unmissable canary-yellow marquee. Performed by a cast of five, playing dozens, it’s a glitzy, riotous affair with box-stepping, bedazzled blood splatter and a biplane with a swastika-shaped propeller in the finale. While the characters work overtime to flesh out Major Martin’s backstory, the show pays less attention to the actual qualities of a real-life man at its center, who the actors, writers and composers, a quartet called SpitLip, have determined will be decidedly less heroic. --> Related ‘Great British Bake Off’ Has Zero Jewish Friends One of the brains behind the operation, Ewen “Monty” Montagu, as played brilliantly by co-conceiver Natasha Hodgson, is a callow, inept, vainglorious, self-absorbed brinksman with a pedigree as vast as his entitlement. He is misogynistic, elitist and clueless about the Navy, in which he serves as Lieutenant Commander. One of his lines — that the body they’ve used, of a vagrant who ate rat poison, belongs to someone who “didn’t matter” — is so cruel as to draw an audible gasp from the crowd. You wouldn’t know — and you may not expect a true accounting of history from a farce that boasts a running joke about newt genitalia — that Montagu was a lawyer by profession and no dilettante when it came to intelligence work. You’d suspect even less that he was Jewish, as his onstage counterpart is primarily motivated by the promise of honors like a Victoria Cross over a desire to save his country, its conscripts and his coreligionists. As Michael Medved wrote in a Commentary article timed to the 2022 film of Operation Mincemeat (a quite good drama by John Madden with two Mr. Darcies — Colin Firth as Montagu, Matthew Macfadyen as his partner in deception Charles Cholmondeley) — the real Montagu was from a prominent Jewish family much involved in civic and religious life. Charles Cholmondeley (L) and Ewen Montagu (R), the real men who devised the operation. Photo by Wikimedia Commons His grandfather Samuel Montagu — born Montagu Samuel — was a Liverpool-born banker, philanthropist and liberal MP raised to the peerage as the first Baron Swaythling in 1907. He spoke Yiddish to his constituents and joined 51 congregations on London’s East End by launching the Federation of Synagogues. English through and through, Ewen’s father, Louis, helped found the League of British Jews, formed after the Balfour Declaration to resist the idea that Jews were a separate nationality in need of their own state away from the Isles. --> The Cambridge-educated Ewen — there is some truth to the musical’s MI5 being a kind of posh club for Oxbridge types, who sing “your father gave you courage, also ponies and that yacht” — would write a best-selling book about Mincemeat, The Man Who Never Was , and in the postwar serve as president of the United Synagogue. He also worked for restitution for Holocaust survivors as president of the Anglo-Jewish Association. (For all its absurdity, the musical somehow has no interest in Montagu’s other endeavors, which included codifying the rules of ping-pong and seeking “whale’s milk cheese” for his cheese-eaters’ club.) Related It’s Hitler in Yiddish as Mel Brooks Gem ‘The Producers’ Returns to Stage Montagu’s wealth did not insulate him from antisemitism, nor was he blind to what the Third Reich meant for him personally should England fall. As Ben Macintyre wrote in his 2010 history Operation Mincemeat , “as one of the country’s most prominent Jewish banking families, Ewen knew the Montagu clan faced special peril in the event of a Nazi invasion,” and so he sent his wife and two of his children to safety in the United States. Of his wartime operation, Montagu once quipped, “joy of joys to anyone, and particularly a Jew, the satisfaction of knowing they had directly and specifically fooled that monster.” But while Operation Mincemeat the musical has been likened to the oeuvre of Mel Brooks , it is not The Producers or even To Be or Not to Be . Mincemeat minces words when it comes to the Nazis and their ideology....",
