    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - production 'shines brilliantly' but only under certain conditions. The conditional nature ('when it takes itself more seriously') suggests reservations about other moments. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the production's serious moments, but without more context, it's unclear if this is a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt and caution, a lower positive score is appropriate. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a generally positive view, but with a caveat. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers qualified praise suggesting the production excels in serious moments but may falter elsewhere; scored cautiously at the lower end of Positive due to limited context and the conditional nature of the criticism.",
