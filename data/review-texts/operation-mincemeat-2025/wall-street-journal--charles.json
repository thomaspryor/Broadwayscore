Instead it’s a tender ballad in which the schoolmistressy secretary Hester Leggatt, played by Jak Malone, sings an imagined love letter to be planted on a corpse to add verisimilitude to the dead man’s manufactured life story. Intrigued yet?\n\nPerformed by Mr. Malone with a touching sincerity untainted by sentimentality, the song hints at a lost love in Hester’s past that reveals a beating heart just below the classic British stiff upper lip. Yet it’s not just the character but the musical, too, that in this moment takes a necessary breath, indicating a subtle emotional core beneath the sometimes exhaustingly antic comedy that drives this odd duck of a musical, now on Broadway.\n\nCopyright ©2025 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
