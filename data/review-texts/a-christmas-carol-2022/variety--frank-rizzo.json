  "bwwExcerpt": "Those expecting a traditional take on Charles Dickens' classic holiday perennial may be in for a shock at the new Broadway version of 'A Christmas Carol.' Or at least they might be terribly perplexed by this dour production, whose additions only subtract from the potency of the transformative tale. While there have been many adaptations - from solo shows to musicals to ghostly imaginings - most stick pretty close to the storyline and character arc of the tightly crafted original. But this import from London's Old Vic - here starring Campbell Scott - would certainly have Dickens scratching his noggin.",
