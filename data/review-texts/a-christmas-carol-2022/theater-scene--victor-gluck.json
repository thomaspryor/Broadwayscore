  "showScoreExcerpt": "Jefferson May who won the Tony Award for playing 40 characters in the solo play, \"I Am My Own Wife,\" as well as Tony nominated for his ten roles in \"A Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder,\" has now topped his own record with 50 characters in the visually spectacular new stage adaption of Charles Dickens’ \"A Christmas Carol.\" You may have seen it on stage before but the truly eye-popping scenic design by Dane Laffrey and the projection design by Lucy Mackinnon rivals that of the big musicals further north on Broadway. \n\nRead more",

However, this is only one curated quote and may not represent the full review verdict, warranting low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's visual elements and Jefferson May's performance, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the lead actor's performance and the visual spectacle of the production, suggesting a positive experience overall. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the visual spectacle ('eye-popping,' 'spectacular') and the lead performer's achievement, favorably comparing the production to major Broadway musicals. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
