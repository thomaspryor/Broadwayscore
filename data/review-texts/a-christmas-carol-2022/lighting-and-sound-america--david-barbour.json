    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic acknowledges skill but finds fundamental flaws in prioritizing spectacle over character development and emotional connection. However, this is only one excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the production for prioritizing style over substance, suggesting a lack of connection with the audience. This indicates a negative assessment, but the single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt criticizes the production for prioritizing spectacle over character and audience connection, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges technical skill but argues the production favors mise en scène and effects over character development and Scrooge's transformation. Given the text is truncated and only a single excerpt is available, the final verdict remains unclear.",
