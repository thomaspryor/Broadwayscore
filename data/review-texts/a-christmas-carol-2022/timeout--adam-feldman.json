    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own rating of 60 places this squarely in Mixed territory (55-69). Acknowledges positive qualities (charm, polish) but identifies significant shortcomings (lacks emotional depth, feels like pageant rather than profound theater). | GPT-4o: The critic acknowledges the show's charm and technical execution but criticizes its lack of emotional depth. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review, indicating some positive elements but overall reservations. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like charm and polish, but ultimately finds the production lacking in emotional depth, preventing a strong recommendation. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The review acknowledges the production's competence and polish but criticizes its lack of emotional depth and memorability, aligning with the critic's own 60/100 rating which falls squarely in the Mixed range.",
