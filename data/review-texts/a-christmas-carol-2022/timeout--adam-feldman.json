    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges positive qualities (charm, technical polish) but finds significant shortcomings (lacks emotional depth, feels like a pageant rather than profound theater). The original 60 rating confirms this as squarely Mixed. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges charm and polish but criticizes the lack of emotional depth, aligning with the critic's original rating of 60, which suggests a mixed review. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like charm and polish, but ultimately finds the production lacking in emotional depth, resulting in a mixed assessment. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The critic praises the show's charm and technical execution but criticizes its lack of emotional depth and memorability, resulting in a middle-of-the-road assessment that aligns with the provided 60/100 rating.",
