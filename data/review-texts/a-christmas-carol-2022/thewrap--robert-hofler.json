  "bwwExcerpt": "This \"Christmas Carol\" comes to an early climax - perhaps too early for the show's own good - when Scrooge is visited by the ghost of Marley, his old business partner in miserliness and nitpicking contempt for humanity. No two actors could achieve what Mays, Stanton and Arden offer up here: the suddenly meek and frightened Scrooge bathed in warm candle light one minute, the commanding and devouring Marley drenched in green stench only a second later. How can any \"Christmas Carol\" ever top that k",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes an exciting and positive start to the production, suggesting a positive tone. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is strongly positive, describing the start of the production as \"terrific\" and \"exciting.\" Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic language ('terrific,' 'exciting') to praise the production's opening, warranting a high-positive score per the single-excerpt guidelines, though confidence is low due to limited available text.",
