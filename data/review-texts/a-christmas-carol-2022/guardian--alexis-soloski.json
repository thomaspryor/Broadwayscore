    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise ('no turkey') but significant criticism of the adaptation being 'thin' and overly derivative of the playwright's other work. Limited text makes full assessment difficult. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive assessment with some reservations. The show is described as 'gleaming,' suggesting quality, but also hints at a lack of depth with 'thin psychological allegory.' The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The review states that the show is \"no turkey\" and \"as gleaming as a Christmas goose\", but also criticizes the adaptation as a \"thin psychological allegory\". Given the limited excerpt, I am scoring it as slightly positive. | Kimi: The review praises the production as 'gleaming' and 'no turkey' but criticizes the adaptation as 'thin' and overly focused on psychological allegory rather than the original ghost story elements. With only one excerpt available, the mixed signals suggest a middle-of-the-road assessment. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Positive, gemini=Positive, kimi=Mixed",

Photograph: Joan MarcusView image in fullscreenCampbell Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge and the cast of A Christmas Carol on Broadway. Photograph: Joan Marcus This article is more than 6 years oldReviewA Christmas Carol review – Dickens on Broadway is a festive tearjerkerThis article is more than 6 years oldLyceum Theatre, New York\n\nJack Thorne’s Broadway transfer of the Christmas classic is sentimental but moving and boasts a host of surprises\n\nCharles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol has always been a bizarre, Yule-scented mélange of art and faith and commerce. A Victorian Christmas yarn about a miser who discovers the reason for the season with the help of various ghosts and an angelic disabled child, it was written to garner sympathy for poor children and to lift its author out of debt. In that it succeeded only partially – it sold well, but Dickens had gone in for some very expensive bindings.\n\nRead moreIts current Broadway incarnation, adapted by Jack Thorne, directed by Matthew Warchus and embellished with a dozen carols, is as gleaming as a Christmas goose. Which is to say, it’s no turkey. But in readying the play for Broadway, Thorne has echoed his Harry Potter and the Cursed Child themes – the tension between fathers and sons, the ways we misunderstand the people we love – and borrowed a bit from Dickens’s own life, turning a weird ghost story into a thin psychological allegory about a man whose daddy didn’t love him enough.\n\nThe adaptation is about what you would expect of Thorne – some story theater, some sentiment, a few genuinely moving moments. Campbell Scott, a likable actor now moving from nebbishes to heels, stars as the parsimonious Scrooge. His father, George C Scott, played the same role in a beloved television adaptation, and the younger Scott’s interpretation is more contained, less blustery, in its way quite as persuasive. Andrea Martin plays the childlike Ghost of Christmas Past with LaChanze as the imperious (and blind? and possibly Jamaican?) Ghost of Christmas Present.\n\nIn this version two boys with cerebral palsy alternate in the role of Tiny Tim. At the performance I attended it was Sebastian Ortiz, unspeakably adorable. If I was troubled by the sight of a disabled child of color brought onstage to enable a wealthy white character’s spiritual growth, I was also too busy wiping away tears to give it my full attention.\n\nAt any point, you can opt out of the sale of all of your personal information by pressing",
