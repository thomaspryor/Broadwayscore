  "bwwExcerpt": "While retaining the jolliness and sentimentality associated with some 170 years' worth of stage versions (including a competitive flock that opened the year after its publication), Thorne and Warchus have polished the story's social conscience to a restored brightness. Be assured, though, that their 'Carol,' which stars Campbell Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge, never sings shrilly.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows measured praise for the creative team's work on the adaptation and reassures about tone, but with only one curated excerpt available, the full verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the production, highlighting the polished social conscience and avoiding negative extremes. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context necessitate a cautious approach with a low confidence level. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive take on the production, highlighting the restoration of the story's social conscience. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production for balancing traditional jolliness with a newly polished social conscience while avoiding preachiness ('never sings shrilly'), indicating a clear recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full verdict.",
