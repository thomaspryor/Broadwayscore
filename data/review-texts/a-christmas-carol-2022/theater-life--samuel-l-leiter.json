  "showScoreExcerpt": "If you’ve somehow managed never to see a stage version of A Christmas Carol before, or are unfamiliar with it, you may have a little trouble following this one, but not enough to warrant skipping it. The narrative is gripping, Mr. Mays’s storytelling talent is formidable, and the production values are sensational. Give yourself a holiday season gift from one that has kept on giving for at least 180 years. I doubt you’ll find any humbug here.\n\nRead more",

Praises storytelling, production values as 'sensational,' and ends with strong gift metaphor recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the narrative, performance, and production values, suggesting a positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning indicates potential cherry-picking, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review recommends seeing the show, but acknowledges potential difficulties for those unfamiliar with the story. The phrase \"not enough to warrant skipping it\" indicates a positive, but not enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: Enthusiastic praise using words like 'sensational' and 'formidable' with a clear recommendation to see the show ('Give yourself a holiday season gift'), though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
