    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance ('towering', 'astonishing', 'histrionic gusto') and production ('superior stagecraft'), but single excerpt warning means full verdict unclear - scored in upper Positive range due to enthusiastic tone. | GPT-4o: The excerpt offers high praise for Jefferson Mays' performance and the stagecraft, indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on Jefferson Mays' performance and the stagecraft, using strong positive language such as \"swift and astonishing\" and \"superior.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains superlative praise for the lead performance ('astonishing,' 'towering,' 'histrionic gusto') and production values ('superior stagecraft'), warranting a high-positive score, though confidence is reduced due to limited excerpt availability.",
