    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with highly positive language ('true miracle') praising both the production and lead performance (Mays). However, confidence is low due to limited text - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed overall review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as a 'miracle' with a transformative performance by Mays, suggesting a highly positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the production as feeling entirely new and honest, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language warrants a score on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise, calling the show a 'true miracle' that presents familiar material with fresh honesty and genuine impact, though the single-excerpt limitation requires caution.",
