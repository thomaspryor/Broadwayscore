  "bwwExcerpt": "The noir-like design for the show by Dane Laffrey, though, is really something, and its sudden visual tricks and life-affirming pleasures far exceed what most people would expect from a one-person show. Joshua D. Reid's sound offers as visceral and riveting a sonic affair as any show currently on Broadway.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows mild approval ('Nothing wrong with') but warns of nightmares for kids. Playful tone suggests qualified recommendation, but limited text prevents higher confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive tone, indicating that the show provides a thrilling experience suitable for the holiday season. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive, albeit cautious, recommendation. The phrase \"nothing wrong with a good shudder\" implies it's enjoyable, but the \"cautionary tale\" aspect suggests reservations. | Kimi: While issuing a playful warning about the show's intensity for children, the critic clearly endorses its frightening qualities as desirable holiday entertainment, framing the 'shudder' as a positive feature.",
