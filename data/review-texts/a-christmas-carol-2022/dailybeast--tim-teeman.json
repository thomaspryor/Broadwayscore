  "bwwExcerpt": "Playing both narrator and all the characters is no small feat-as reflected by the warm standing ovation for Mays the night this critic attended. But the magic of this production, adapted by Mays, Susan Lyons, and director Michael Arden, is down a lot to Laffrey's stupendous stage design, which is a riot of trickery and surprises, Ben Stanton's lighting, and Joshua D. Reid's sound design.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the lead performance (warm standing ovation), calls the production 'magic,' and enthusiastically describes the design as 'stupendous' and 'a riot of trickery and surprises.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked praise from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's design elements as 'stupendous' and mentions a 'warm standing ovation', indicating a strong positive reception. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review praises the stage design, lighting, and sound design, and mentions a warm standing ovation. Given the single excerpt and lack of a clear overall recommendation, the score is positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers strong praise for the production's 'stupendous' design and 'magic,' noting a standing ovation for the performance. As a clearly positive single excerpt, it warrants an upper Positive score.",
