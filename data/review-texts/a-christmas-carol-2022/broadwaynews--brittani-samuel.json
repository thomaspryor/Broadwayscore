  "bwwExcerpt": "Arden moves his subject forward through each of Dickens' staves, but the production arrives nowhere. There is no unique point of view or revelation from this solo \"Carol,\" which puts Mays' malleability to waste. The production skews gloomier than most modern retellings.

The word 'sadly' indicates disappointment rather than anger, suggesting mid-Negative range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a negative view, highlighting a lack of purpose despite some positive elements. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt states that the revival lacks purpose, which is a negative assessment. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a definitive negative verdict, acknowledging the production's luxurious aesthetics but condemning the revival for fundamentally lacking purpose. With only one excerpt available, confidence is reduced.",
