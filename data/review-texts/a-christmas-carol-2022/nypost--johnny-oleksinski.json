    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic overcomes their admitted skepticism about holiday shows to declare this 'succeeds as a strong piece of theater.' This represents a qualified but clear positive recommendation. Single excerpt warning applied - scoring in upper Positive range given the strong endorsement despite initial resistance. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a clear positive evaluation, describing the show as a 'strong piece of theater' even for those typically disinterested in holiday fare. The lack of full context and single excerpt warning suggests using the upper range of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The critic states that 'A Christmas Carol' succeeds as a strong piece of theater, even for someone who dislikes holiday fare. This suggests a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic admits to disliking holiday fare yet praises the show as a 'strong piece of theater' that succeeds, indicating a clear positive recommendation from a skeptical perspective.",
