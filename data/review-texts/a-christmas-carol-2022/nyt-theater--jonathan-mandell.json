The excerpt suggests qualified appreciation undermined by fundamental presentation issues. | GPT-4o: The review praises the adaptation and design but questions the suitability of the venue, suggesting mixed feelings. The text is an excerpt, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review praises the adaptation and design, but questions the suitability of the Broadway venue, suggesting a mixed experience. The truncated text and venue concerns lower confidence. | Kimi: The critic praises the adaptation as 'singular' and the performer's quick-change artistry as extraordinary, but expresses significant reservations about the Broadway venue being too large for the intimate staging, causing visibility issues.",
