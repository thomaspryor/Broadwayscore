However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"theatrical magic\" and \"never lets us down.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt features enthusiastic praise ('theatrical magic') and an urgent recommendation to see the show ('Climb on board'), placing it in the upper Positive range. Confidence is low due to reliance on a single curated excerpt.",
