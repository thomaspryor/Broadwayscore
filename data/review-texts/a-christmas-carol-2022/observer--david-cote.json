  "bwwExcerpt": "This being a holiday show for all ages, there's a broadly acted, crowd-pleasing vibe and frequent bits of audience interaction, especially after Scrooge's conversion. Carolers warble from every corner of the balconies; long sheets are unfurled to the stage to sluice apples, oranges and other treats into baskets for the Christmas feast; and stage snow drifts onto the audience. The kids at the matinee I attended squealed at the low-tech but delightful stage effects.",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes a broadly acted, crowd-pleasing show with delightful stage effects, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic experience. Given that it is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production's 'crowd-pleasing vibe' and 'delightful stage effects,' describing an enjoyable, interactive theatrical experience, though this assessment is based on limited curated text.",
