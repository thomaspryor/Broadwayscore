However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt ends with a strong recommendation to see the show, suggesting a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Despite noting a darker tone, the critic explicitly urges readers not to miss this production, indicating strong enthusiasm and a clear recommendation.",
