  "bwwExcerpt": "The most effective touch by far is the casting of two young actors with cerebral palsy, Sebastian Ortiz (at the performance I caught) and Jai Ram Srinivasan, in alternation as Tiny Tim. It's no stunt. Tootling along in his little walker to investigate Scrooge's bounty the next morning-sorry, can't reveal anything about that either-Ortiz placidly works within his body's limits with fortitude and grace, more movingly than any ordinarily-abled moppet ever could in that role. His encounters with Scrooge bring tears to Scott's eyes and to ours: not tears of pity, but of recognition that there are people all around us who merit our help and at the very least, our respect, and yet look how often we deny both.",
