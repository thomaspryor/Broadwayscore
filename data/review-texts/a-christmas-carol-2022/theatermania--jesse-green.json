    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows balanced assessment - acknowledges emotional strength but criticizes production choices. 'Even if' construction suggests reservations outweigh positives. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges the show's emotional core as a positive aspect but also notes that the production feels overstuffed with spectacle, indicating a mixed review. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a positive aspect (emotional core) but also points out a negative one (overstuffed spectacle). Due to the single excerpt and the slightly negative tone, I'm scoring it as a low positive. | Kimi: The excerpt validates the show's central emotional effectiveness while offering a significant caveat about excess spectacle, suggesting a qualified but genuine recommendation typical of the lower Positive range. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
