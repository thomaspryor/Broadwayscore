    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with measured praise for the script's wit and detail, but the 'lonelier affair' framing suggests some reservations. Limited text warrants cautious positive score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a neutral tone, describing the production as 'lonelier' and noting the script's adherence to Dickens' version with 'keen wit.' Without a clear recommendation or discouragement, it falls into the Mixed category. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic assessment, praising the script's wit and detail while noting a \"lonelier affair.\" Given the single excerpt and truncated nature, confidence is low, but the tone leans positive. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production's 'keen wit' and 'gimlet detail' while appreciating its avoidance of excessive sentimentality, indicating a positive though measured reception. As only one excerpt is available, confidence is low.",
