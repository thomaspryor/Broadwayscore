    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises the script's wit and detail while noting it's 'lonelier' - suggests thoughtful adaptation but cautious tone. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a neutral tone, noting the script's adherence to Dickens' original with a mix of sentimentality and wit. The lack of clear positive or negative language leads to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the script and its adherence to Dickens' original, highlighting its wit and detail. Given that it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the tone is positive enough for a low-end 'Positive' score. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
