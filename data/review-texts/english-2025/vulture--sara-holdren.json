    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clearly positive language praising multiple aspects (sensitivity, humor, intimacy, craft, ensemble). Given single excerpt warning and positive tone, scored at upper end of Positive range, but low confidence due to incomplete text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides positive descriptors ('sensitive, funny, and intimate') and praises the ensemble and craft, indicating a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is on the higher end of Positive. | Gemini: The single excerpt is very positive, praising the show's sensitivity, humor, intimacy, craft, and ensemble. Given the limited information, I am placing it in the upper range of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the show's tone and ensemble performances, indicating a solid recommendation in the upper Positive range, though the single-excerpt limitation requires caution.",
