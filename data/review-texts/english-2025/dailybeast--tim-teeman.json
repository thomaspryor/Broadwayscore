At this moment, with immigration—and attacks on immigrants’ rights—at the top of President Trump’s agenda, the play assumes a new, urgent precision.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Unqualified enthusiasm with direct action imperative ('Book a ticket right now') plus superlatives ('exquisitely written, beautifully acted'). The urgent recommendation combined with praise across all elements (writing, acting, production) clearly places this in Rave territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt strongly recommends booking a ticket immediately, highlighting the play's exquisite writing and beautiful acting. The urgency and praise suggest a rave review. | Gemini: The review excerpt gives a strong recommendation to see the show, calling it \"exquisitely written, beautifully acted and mounted.\" The phrase \"book a ticket right now\" indicates a very positive sentiment. | Kimi: The critic issues an explicit directive to book immediately, paired with superlatives ('exquisitely written,' 'beautifully acted'). However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced pending full review context. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
