    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong superlative praise calling it 'one of the best plays written in the last five years' indicates enthusiastic recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires caution about full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, calling it 'one of the best plays written in the last five years,' indicating a highly positive assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single quote available is extremely positive, indicating a strong recommendation. Given the limited information, confidence is low, but the strength of the quote pushes the score to the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers exceptionally high praise, calling the play one of the best in years. Per instructions for single clearly positive excerpts, it is scored at the upper end of the Positive bucket with low confidence due to the risk of cherry-picking. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
