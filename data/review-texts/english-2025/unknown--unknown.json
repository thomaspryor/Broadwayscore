However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the direction as having \"exceptional sensitivity\" and creating more drama than expected, suggesting a positive, though possibly qualified, recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring towards the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the director's 'exceptional sensitivity' and notes the production transcends its material by creating 'more drama than its ingredients would seem to permit,' indicating a clear recommendation despite the single-excerpt limitation.",
