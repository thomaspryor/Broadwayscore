    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls this a 'stunning Broadway debut' and praises it as 'precise' with sophisticated analysis of how it 'blooms into an evocation of grief and assimilation.' Strong positive language but limited to one excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('stunning', 'precise study') and highlights the play's depth and impact, suggesting a highly favorable view. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the word \"stunning\" to describe the play, which indicates a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt, I am placing the score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as 'stunning' and a 'precise study' that 'blooms into an evocation of grief and assimilation,' indicating strong praise for this Pulitzer-winning play, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence.",
