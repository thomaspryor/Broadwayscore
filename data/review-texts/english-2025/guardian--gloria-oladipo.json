Given the single excerpt, I am placing the score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as 'stunning' and a 'precise study' that 'blooms into an evocation of grief and assimilation,' indicating strong praise for this Pulitzer-winning play, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence.",

  "fullText": "Sanaz Toossi’s 2023 recipient makes an effortless transfer, focusing on Iranian students studying English, a play that brings both laughter and real emotion Immigrants moving to the west are forced to shed a layer of themselves for the sake of belonging. Traditional names are reconstructed and collapsed into digestible English versions. Accents from faraway countries are either buried for protection or wither away over time. English, as a language, becomes a mandatory mother tongue. English, Sanaz Toossi’s stunning Broadway debut, is a precise study of language’s significance. The 2023 Pulitzer prize winner slyly presents as a comedy about studying a foreign language, but eventually blooms into an evocation of grief and assimilation. Four Iranian students are studying for the TOEFL exam, a standardized test to measure English proficiency, under instructor Marjan (Marjan Neshat), who previous resided in England but has since returned to Iran. The stakes of English are clear as passing the TOEFL is a dire must for all students. A failed exam could be the final obstacle between a green card or a university admission. But despite being set in a foreign class, the play is almost spoken entirely in English, with actors only signifying the switch to Farsi based on their accent (English is spoken in starts and sputters). The technique is one of Toossi’s many triumphs in craft, alongside sublime direction from Knud Adams. The TOEFL class – simply a row of desks, a white board, and a projector – is set inside a box that rotates slowly, offering glimpses of various pupils set against Reza Behjat’s delicate lighting. Scene transitions are set to dolce piano music (sound design by Sinan Refik Zafar). Script wise, Toossi embraces the hijinks of a foreign language classroom: awkward oral exercises, all-too-proper English audio tapes, games to reinforce English vocabulary words. Goli (charmingly played by Ava Lalezarzadeh), the youngest, gives a presentation on the lyrics of Ricky Martin’s She Bangs, a hilarious scene buoyed by Lalezarzadeh’s comedic timing. But Toossi captures much more elusive hopes and fears of what conquering English means to each student. The English language is a pathway to promise, says Marijan. Speaking English, she says, “is one of the greatest things two people can do together”. Not everyone agrees. While competitive pupil Elham (Tala Ashe) wants to master English to be accepted into an Australian medical school, she openly despises the clunky language and her forced divorce from Farsi; she calls her English accent a “war crime”, warning Goli and others that native English speakers will find them stupid. Roya (Pooya Mohseni), the oldest TOEFL student, also de-boards the English express after initially wanting to connect with her expat son and grandchild. Even for Omid (Hadi Tabbal), having advanced English language skills doesn’t quite secure his feelings of belonging. “The only place I speak perfect English is here,” he tells his classmates. “You can hear the gap between not from here, not from there.” The play remains airy and expressive, even amid the beginning’s slow build, thanks to English’s all-around, exemplary cast. Ashe and Neshat, as individuals and in their joint scenes, deliver especially stirring performances in their often-opposing treatments of the English language. Neshat plays Marjan with a tenderness that reaffirms her legitimate desire to help her students succeed, even if it manifests as petty behavior. Meanwhile, Ashe’s Elham is fiery, determined and blunt, often to the irritation of her classmates. But, like Neshat’s Marjan, Ashe never makes Elham the villain, resisting the urge to pigeonhole her as a complete frustration. Instead, it is so evident that both women are stuck in “the gap”, as Omid describes, incapable of completely locating themselves given English’s demands to fit. That’s where the devastation lies. Why the laughter from the audience (in response to the ‘broken’ English) eventually peters out. The complicated grief of owning English means losing something: leaving behind beloved Iran, having less and less chances to speak with someone who completely, wholly, understands you. At the play’s end, a short scene spoken in Farsi between the two feels equal parts satisfying, sad, and cathartic. Farsi, with its “poetry” (as Goli calls it) is in full display, but something about the conversation feels increasingly rare. The woman will not always have chances to talk like this. New English words have been gained, but something is given too. We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could support the Guardian at this crucial time for journalism in the US. In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year into his second term, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one. From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump returned to office. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced. While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts. While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel. Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less. But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, we’ll show you far fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you for protecting the free press.",
