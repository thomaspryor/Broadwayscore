This is particularly impressive because all the actors played their roles in the play's off-Broadway debut, and yet the performances still have the bloom of freshness and discovery, in exploring both the characters' sympathies and antipathies.",

However, as this is only a curated excerpt without the full review context or final verdict, confidence is low.",
