  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Crucial to the play's appeal is the way the relationships between the characters, amiable but distant at first, evolve under the astutely detailed direction of Knud Adams. This is particularly impressive because all the actors played their roles in the play's off-Broadway debut, and yet the performances still have the bloom of freshness and discovery, in exploring both the characters' sympathies and antipathies."
