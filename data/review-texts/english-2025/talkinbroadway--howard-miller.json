    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with positive language ('compelling') but qualified ('never less than') suggests solid but not enthusiastic recommendation. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'never less than compelling', indicating a positive view. However, the lack of full context and the single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach, leading to a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt is positive, but the lack of context and truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. I'm placing it in the positive range, but towards the lower end. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers clear praise for the core content ('never less than compelling'), indicating a solid recommendation. Limited to one curated quote per text quality warnings, so scored at upper end of Positive bucket with reduced confidence.",
