Even more so than when it debuted Off Broadway in 2022, and won the Pulitzer Prize in Drama in 2023, it strikes me as a work of uncommon discipline despite its big and occasionally easy laughs. Without ever releasing a tight grip on its theme  or perhaps because of that tight grip  it suggests a world of small tragedies and smaller compensations.",

The positive assessment is clear despite being a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play's discipline and thematic grip, suggesting a positive view despite noting 'easy laughs'. The Pulitzer Prize mention implies quality. With only one excerpt, confidence is low, but the tone leans positive. | Gemini: The critic describes the play as a work of \"uncommon discipline\" and suggests a world of small tragedies and smaller compensations, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the Broadway transfer, deeming it superior to the Pulitzer-winning Off-Broadway production and highlighting its 'uncommon discipline' and thematic depth, though with minor reservations about 'easy laughs.'",
