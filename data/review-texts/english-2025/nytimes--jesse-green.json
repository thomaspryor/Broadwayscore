  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "The Broadway transfer of Sanaz Toossi's \"English,\" which opened on Thursday at the Todd Haimes Theater, is the consummate consomm. Even more so than when it debuted Off Broadway in 2022, and won the Pulitzer Prize in Drama in 2023, it strikes me as a work of uncommon discipline despite its big and occasionally easy laughs. Without ever releasing a tight grip on its theme  or perhaps because of that tight grip  it suggests a world of small tragedies and smaller compensations.",
