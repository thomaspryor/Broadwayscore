  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Deeply drawn characters and insightful storytelling…This is a raucous, fascinating musical based on a few chapters of 'War and Peace' and there is no chance of you falling asleep…I was not a Josh Groban fan going in, but he is perfectly cast as the introspective, corpulent Pierre and his singing and acting shine through on his journey of awakening…However, I would not recommend this show to anyone who only favors old-fashioned musicals. This is art. Sublime, delicious art.”\n\nRead more",
