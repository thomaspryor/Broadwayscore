  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Who would have guessed that Dave Malloy’s gorgeous pop opera would land on Broadway with all its signal virtues intact, and in some ways heightened?...The show remains a witty, inventive enchantment from rousing start to mournful finish...O.K., so it’s a little dense...Even if you get lost for a bit, the dazzling staging, the vivid performances and the richness of Mr. Malloy’s music will provide pleasures that go well beyond the narrative.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'gorgeous,' 'witty, inventive enchantment' with 'dazzling staging' and 'vivid performances.' Only caveat is density/complexity, but critic says pleasures 'go well beyond' any narrative confusion. Single excerpt warning suggests this could be cherry-picked, but language is consistently enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a 'witty, inventive enchantment' with 'dazzling staging' and 'vivid performances,' indicating a strong positive recommendation despite acknowledging some density in the narrative. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"gorgeous\", \"witty, inventive enchantment\", and \"dazzling staging\". Despite being an excerpt, the overall tone is clearly positive, justifying a score in the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt displays strong enthusiasm with 'gorgeous,' 'enchantment,' and 'dazzling staging,' placing it in the upper Positive range, though minor caveats about narrative density and the lack of superlatives like 'masterpiece' prevent a Rave classification.",
