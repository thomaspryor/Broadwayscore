  "bwwExcerpt": "The complicated narrative, with overwrought romantic plot, is kept in check by delightfully self-aware humour in the direction. Rousing ensemble numbers and delicate ballads sung by Groban and Benton are Malloy's strongest compositions, but many expository songs drag. Malloy's music often feels more coolly intellectual than gripping.",
