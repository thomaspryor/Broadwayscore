  "bwwExcerpt": "The clean-cut crooner looks thicker in the waist and more unkempt than usual. Fitting, since he's playing a 19th century Russian slacker. The padded pounds and scraggly hair can't conceal Groban's burly burnished singing. The show, like his voice, is a pop-opera-hybrid. And he shines bright like high beams in this richly imaginative work created by Dave Molloy.",
