  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A romantic and driving swirl of music and storytelling that is beyond exhilarating…A spectacular production…Even if you don’t know ‘War and Peace’ from Warren Beatty, you will miss nothing crucial to this rapturous theater experience…The theater piece never winks at itself.
