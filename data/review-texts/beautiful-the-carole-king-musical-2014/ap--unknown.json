This follows the pattern of acknowledging performer merit within an overall negative assessment. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show as 'insipid' and suggests it may not be worth seeing, despite praise for Jessie Mueller's performance. The excerpt suggests a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review excerpt calls the show \"insipid\" despite praising the lead actress, indicating a negative overall assessment. The truncated text and single excerpt lower confidence. | Kimi: While praising lead Jessie Mueller's performance, the critic calls the show 'insipid' and 'paint-by-numbers,' suggesting audiences may consider walking out. The single truncated excerpt indicates a clear negative verdict but warrants low confidence.",
