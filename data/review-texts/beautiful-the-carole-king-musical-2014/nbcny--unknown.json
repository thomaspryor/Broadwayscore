The phrase 'must-see' indicates a strong recommendation, though the context is limited to a single excerpt. | Gemini: The review excerpt calls the show a \"must-see\" for King fans and praises the lead actress's performance, indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I've placed it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains explicit recommendation language ('must-see') and enthusiastic praise for Jessie Mueller's lead performance ('elite of Broadway leading ladies'), warranting an upper Positive score. Confidence is low due to single-excerpt truncation.",
