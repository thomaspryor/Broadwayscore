    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as 'formulaic' (negative) but also 'friendly' (mildly positive). However, this appears to be setup text rather than a final verdict, and with only one curated quote available, the full review sentiment is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'friendly' but 'formulaic', suggesting a mixed reception. The single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence in the verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as \"friendly, formulaic,\" which suggests a mixed reaction. Given the limited text, a mixed score is appropriate. | Kimi: The critic labels the show 'formulaic,' suggesting a predictable, by-the-numbers bio-musical approach, while 'friendly' indicates it is pleasant but unremarkable. With only one curated excerpt available, the overall verdict remains ambiguous.",
