Originality is clearly not this show's strong suit. With one very important exception.

This suggests a solid recommendation with no major reservations. | Gemini: The review states the show \"succeeds\" and delivers a \"beautiful celebration\", but also notes it doesn't try to be profound or groundbreaking, indicating a qualified positive recommendation. | Kimi: The reviewer clearly recommends the show, praising it as a 'beautiful celebration' that succeeds in its goals, though the caveat that it 'doesn't try to be profound' keeps it from the Rave bucket.
