This suggests a solid recommendation with no major reservations. | Gemini: The review states the show \"succeeds\" and delivers a \"beautiful celebration\", but also notes it doesn't try to be profound or groundbreaking, indicating a qualified positive recommendation. | Kimi: The reviewer clearly recommends the show, praising it as a 'beautiful celebration' that succeeds in its goals, though the caveat that it 'doesn't try to be profound' keeps it from the Rave bucket. Confidence is low due to the brevity of the excerpt.",
