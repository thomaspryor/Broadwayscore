  "fullText": "ExpandJessie Mueller performs in ‘Beautiful — The Carole King Musical.’\n\nIt's hardly a surprise that the songs in \"Beautiful — The Carole King Musical\" are some kind of wonderful.\n\nKing made magic with her catalogue and it is an unqualified treat to hear her best-known hits — \"Some Kind of Wonderful,\" \"One Fine Day,\" \"So Far Away\" and so many others — performed live.\n\nEven if you haven't memorized the King songbook, you will leave the Stephen Sondheim Theatre humming.\n\nToo bad a great musical isn't only about the music. The book is crucial, too — and this show's connect-the-dots story line is so simplistic that the extravagantly talented King's life emerges as a mundane version of the long-suffering little woman.\n\nDouglas McGrath (\"Emma,\" \"Bullets Over Broadway\") frames the story with the 29-year-old King's solo concert at Carnegie Hall to celebrate her hit 1971 album, \"Tapestry.\"\n\nFrom left, Jessie Mueller, Anika Larsen, Jarrod Spector and Jake Epstein look for a hit in ‘Beautiful — The Carole King Musical’\n\nThe tale flashes back 12 years to show how King (Jessie Mueller) met and married lyricist Gerry Goffin (Jake Epstein). Their professional partnership is a huge success, but he romantically betrays her and breaks her heart. The setback, however, drives her toward a solo career as a writer and singer.\n\nThere's dramatic potential, but the King character is so weakly drawn that another songwriting couple, Barry Mann (Jarrod Spector) and Cynthia Weil (Anika Larsen), is given an outsized role in McGrath's script. The exchanges between the couples have about as much depth of the Ricardos and Mertzes on \"I Love Lucy.\"\n\nSo if you crave real insight, drama or context about the world of pop music and its dog-eat-dog ugliness, cherish your memories of \"Dreamgirls.\"\n\nBut on the plus side, songs flow naturally. After King begins singing \"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,\" the Shirelles in all their glam glory take over. The same pattern follows for the Drifters and the Righteous Brothers and others.\n\nJessie Mueller as Carole King and Jake Epstein as Gerry Goffin in ‘Beautiful — The Carole King Musical’ ( Joan Marcus)\n\nThe group numbers recall other jukebox shows, but they're energizing. And Derek McLane's gliding, multilevel set; Alejo Vietti's inspired costumes; and Peter Kaczorowski's gleaming lights add their own potent pizazz.\n\nUnder the direction of Marc Bruni, the whole cast delivers. Larsen brings breezy elegance as Weil; Spector lends levity as the hypochondriacal Mann, and Epstein makes Goffin believable and understandable.\n\nBest of all is Mueller, who's been on Broadway in \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" and \"Nice Work if You Can Get It.\"\n\nShe doesn't sound all that much like King, but brings lots of sweetness and some depth to the role. Now that's beautiful.",
