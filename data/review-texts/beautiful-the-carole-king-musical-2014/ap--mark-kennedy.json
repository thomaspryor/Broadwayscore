However, with only one truncated excerpt available, the full verdict is unclear, warranting low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a strongly negative view, describing the musical as 'insipid' and implying that audiences might consider leaving. The lack of full context and single excerpt warning lowers confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt calls the show \"insipid,\" which indicates a negative assessment. Due to the truncated nature of the text, confidence is low, but the available information points to a negative recommendation. | Kimi: The critic explicitly describes the show as 'insipid' and suggests audience members may consider leaving at intermission, indicating a clear negative verdict. With only a single excerpt available that is also truncated, confidence must remain low.",
