    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear praise for Mueller's performance with positive language ('delicate balance', 'impossible not to root for', 'inspired'). However, confidence is low due to very limited text - this appears to be a single sentence excerpt that may not represent the full review's verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Jessie Mueller's performance, suggesting a positive view of the show. However, due to the limited text and lack of a full verdict, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Jessie Mueller's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. However, due to the limited text, the overall recommendation strength is uncertain, hence the 'low' confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Jessie Mueller's performance, describing it as 'inspired' and emotionally engaging with the phrase 'impossible not to root for her,' indicating a clear recommendation based on the lead actor's work, though the limited excerpt prevents assessment of the full production.",
