    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review offers both criticism ('minimal context', 'cringe-worthy') and praise ('cast does not disappoint', acknowledges audience satisfaction). Single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked from a more negative or positive full review. | GPT-4o: The review highlights positive aspects like music and choreography but also notes issues with context and dated references. The single excerpt suggests a mix of strengths and weaknesses, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review praises the music, choreography, and cast but criticizes the minimal context and cringe-worthy elements. The reference to AARP card-toting audience members suggests a limited appeal. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the cast and Carole King's music while criticizing the minimal context and dated references, indicating a mild recommendation to fans of the songwriter.",
