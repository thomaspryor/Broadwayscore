  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Pretty much what I expected — a slick jukebox musical/biography of King’s early career...It is in very good shape. Although I had never heard of any of the present leads all were competent if not loaded with charisma...With 27 songs to squeeze in, there is no room in book for much more than connecting the dots...Bruni’s smooth direction keeps things moving...The singers were overamplified almost to the point of aural pain...If you like the music, you will probably have a good time.”\n\nRead more",
