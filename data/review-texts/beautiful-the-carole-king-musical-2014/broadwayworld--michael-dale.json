    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt reveals structural criticism of the show - it pushes its lead character aside and has more interesting supporting elements. The word 'Unfortunately' signals disappointment. However, this is truncated text with only one excerpt, making a full verdict assessment impossible. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, highlighting the supporting ensemble as more interesting than the central character. However, it acknowledges the talent of the cast, indicating some positive aspects. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the musical focuses too much on secondary characters, overshadowing the main character, Carole King. This implies a flaw in the show's structure and focus, leading to a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges entertaining moments and skilled performances from the supporting cast but criticizes the show's structure for sidelining the central character, suggesting a divided response. Single excerpt and truncation limit confidence.",
