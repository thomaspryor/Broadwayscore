However, confidence is low due to limited text availability. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the script, music, and direction, using strong positive language like 'snappier', 'quick and polished', and 'sounds dynamite'. Despite the limitations of a single excerpt, the tone suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the script, music, direction, and orchestrations, suggesting a positive experience overall. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the script ('snappier'), direction ('quick and polished'), and musical arrangements ('sounds dynamite'), indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited context of a single curated quote.",
