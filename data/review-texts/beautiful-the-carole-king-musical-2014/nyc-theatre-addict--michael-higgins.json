  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Abby’s opening moment at the piano did lack the spark and charisma of Jessie–but once the actual story began, Abby pulled way ahead with her acting chops. She acted her way through each and every moment. I knew I was going to love the music, but this time I really connected with the character and her struggle. This show is so much more than just a jukebox collection of great songs. There is a wonderful story full of wit and pathos.”\n\nRead more",
