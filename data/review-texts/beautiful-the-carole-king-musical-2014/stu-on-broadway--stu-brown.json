    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review acknowledges entertainment value and appeal to specific audiences but concludes the overall results are 'problematic.' Single excerpt warning applies - this balanced assessment suggests mixed feelings without clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the charm and nostalgia of the show but also mentions 'problematic' overall results, indicating a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights the show's entertainment value and charm, but also mentions problematic aspects of the book, suggesting a mixed but overall positive experience. Given the single excerpt and the mention of problems, I've scored it at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
