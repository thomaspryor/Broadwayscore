The focus on certain aspects working best suggests a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review highlights the show's strengths, indicating a positive, albeit qualified, recommendation. | Kimi: The 'works best when' construction implies the show succeeds in specific elements (character arc, musical numbers) but is inconsistent overall, suggesting a mixed reception.
