  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Mueller shows us a reluctant star, a woman who only really starting singing out of necessity and would always have been happier with a few hit songs, a nice home and a man she really could trust. At the end of \"Beautiful,\" she's not that different from how she is at the start. Most jukebox shows swing on that obscurity-fame-meltdown-comeback-maturity axis. \"Beautiful,\" in its best moments, manages to suggest that the life of our artist is really just small moments that fall together, unknowingl",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with qualified praise ('in its best moments') suggests positive assessment but with reservations. Text appears truncated mid-sentence, limiting confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a nuanced view of the show, highlighting a lack of significant character development and a deviation from typical jukebox musical arcs. The praise is mild and suggests a more subdued experience, leading to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic assessment of the show. The phrase \"in its best moments\" implies some reservations, and the description of the protagonist's journey suggests a more nuanced portrayal than a typical jukebox musical. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for Jessie Mueller's performance and the show's thematic approach ('in its best moments'), while noting the protagonist's lack of change. The single-excerpt format and truncated ending limit confidence, but the tone leans appreciative rather than negative.",
