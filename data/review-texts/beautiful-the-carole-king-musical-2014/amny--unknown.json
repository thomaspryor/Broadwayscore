  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Beautiful,\" a sentimental and sympathetic biography led by a poignant, extremely winning performance from breakout star Jessie Mueller, is slickly staged, genuinely touching and very enjoyable...It lacks the sin and sex appeal in \"Jersey Boys,\" or the restless momentum of \"Motown,\" and relies on feel-good nostalgia. Nevertheless, \"Beautiful\" is unusually coherent, character-driven and sincere for a jukebox musical. And who can resist those songs? So how can this not be a hit?\"",
