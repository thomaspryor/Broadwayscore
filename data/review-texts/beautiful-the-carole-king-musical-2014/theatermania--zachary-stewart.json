    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear praise for direction, script, and production elements with positive language like 'gift,' 'magic and fun.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the director's work and highlights the show's engaging and magical qualities, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the direction, script, and costume design, indicating a positive experience. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the direction, pacing, and design, using words like 'magic,' 'fun,' and 'smart' to describe a lively production. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the upper Positive range, though confidence is low given the limited context.",
