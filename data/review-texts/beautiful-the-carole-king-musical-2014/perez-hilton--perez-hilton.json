    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Unqualified praise calling it a 'non-stop hit parade' and 'perfect example' of the genre. Despite being only one excerpt, the superlative language ('then some!', 'perfect') indicates strong enthusiasm warranting Rave bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, calling the musical a 'non-stop hit parade' and 'a jukebox musical done right'. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly positive review. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, calling the show a \"non-stop hit parade\" and \"the perfect example of a jukebox musical done right!\" Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the language suggests a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise calling the show a 'non-stop hit parade' and 'perfect example of a jukebox musical done right,' indicating strong positive sentiment. However, as a single curated excerpt, it may not represent the full review's nuance. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
