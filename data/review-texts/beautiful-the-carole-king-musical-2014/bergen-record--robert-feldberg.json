  "bwwExcerpt": "\"The show's book, by Douglas McGrath, registers mostly as a series of interruptions. While not exactly amateurish, it aims very low, settling for the tried and trite. (\"You know what's so funny about life? Sometimes it goes the way you want and sometimes it doesn't.\") A big boost comes, though, from the warmly natural portrayal of King by Jesse Mueller, who also possesses a lovely, supple singing voice.\"",
