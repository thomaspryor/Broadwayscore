    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'one of the most entertaining Broadway shows in years' with consistent positive elements noted. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, calling the show 'one of the most entertaining Broadway shows in years' with a 'smart and witty book' and 'top-notch cast'. The positive language suggests a high recommendation, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review uses very positive language such as \"one of the most entertaining Broadway shows in years\", \"surprisingly smart and witty book\", and \"consistently top-notch cast\", indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified enthusiastic praise, calling the show 'one of the most entertaining Broadway shows in years' with comprehensive commendation of the book, direction, and cast, indicating a strong recommendation, though confidence is moderated by the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
