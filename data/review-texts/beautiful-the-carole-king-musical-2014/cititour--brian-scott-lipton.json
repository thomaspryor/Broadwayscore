  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'Beautiful' takes the early life story – and music – of the legendary singer-songwriter Carole King to create one of the most entertaining Broadway shows in years. All of the necessary elements have come together here, from a surprisingly smart and witty book by Douglas McGrath, smooth direction by Marc Bruni, and the work of a consistently top-notch cast.
