However, as only one curated quote, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction, choreography, and set design, and highlights Jessie Mueller's performance as a standout. The language suggests a strong recommendation, though the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the direction, choreography, set design, and Jessie Mueller's performance. The language suggests a positive experience, so I am placing it in the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the direction, choreography, design, and lead performance, using words like 'crisp,' 'precision,' and 'seamlessly,' though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
