Low confidence due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performance and music, suggesting a positive experience, but notes the story is primarily a vehicle for the songs, indicating some reservations. | Gemini: The review excerpt is positive, calling the show \"beautifully performed and tuneful.\" However, the excerpt also states that the story is just an \"efficient delivery system\" for the songs, suggesting a lack of depth. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive with reservations. | Kimi: Single excerpt praises the performances and Carole King's music as 'tuneful entertainment' but qualifies that the story serves merely as an 'efficient delivery system' for the hits, suggesting a qualified rather than enthusiastic recommendation.",
