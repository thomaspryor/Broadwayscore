  "showScoreExcerpt": "Leaning heavily on rhetorical flourishes, Taub's score is filled with lots of well-meaning exhortations to \"finish the fight,\" earnest appeals that quickly lose emotional resonance through a lack of lyrical variance and depth. The only song that strikes a deeper chord is the late-show \"I Wasn't There,\" a plaintive rejoinder to Lin-Manual Miranda's \"The Room Where It Happens'' from Hamilton, which acknowledges with bitter irony that none of the extraordinary women responsible for the 19th amendment were present when it was signed into law.",
