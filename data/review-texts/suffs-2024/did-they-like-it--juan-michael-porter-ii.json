Despite the comparatively concise final product, at nearly three hours in runtime, Suffs (shorthand for women who fought to win the right to vote) still feels too long to absorb in one sitting. Though well crafted by Taub―who wrote the book, music, and lyrics―beautifully performed by the cast of 20 women, and neatly directed by Leigh Silverman, the show could stand to jettison approximately 30 minutes of its repetitive slogans, anthems, chants, and “this is who I am” songs.",
