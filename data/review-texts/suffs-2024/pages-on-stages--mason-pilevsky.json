However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt is strongly positive, using words like \"boldness\", \"tenderness\", and \"haunts\", suggesting a powerful and impactful experience. Given the limited text, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strong positive descriptors (boldness, tenderness, timeliness) and suggests powerful emotional impact ('haunts'), indicating a clear recommendation despite limited context.",
