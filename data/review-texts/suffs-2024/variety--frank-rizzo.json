  "fullText": "A musical that captures the sweep of history in all its complexities without sacrifice of character or credibility is no easy feat.\n\nBut \"Suffs,\" which tells the story of the final push to achieve the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote in 1920, does just that with a singular vision and a collective collaboration that is smart, inspiring and thoroughly entertaining.",
  "bwwExcerpt": "As writer, Taub smartly avoids the facile men-against-women tropes and digs deeper into internal challenges within the movement and within the women as individuals. Thanks to the specificity of the writing, music and lyrics and a remarkable ensemble of women and nonbinary actors, the multitude of characters in this densely packed historic narrative are, if not deeply, then at least reasonably well-defined and relatable with their personal doubts, fears and triumphs.",

The critic's language is enthusiastic and highlights the production's strengths, indicating a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the show's intelligence, inspiration, and entertainment value.
