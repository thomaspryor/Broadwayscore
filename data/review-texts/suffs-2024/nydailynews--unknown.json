    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic explicitly states the show does what 'all of the best Broadway musicals do' and lists four positive qualities, indicating clear recommendation. However, with only one excerpt available, scoring conservatively within positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language, comparing 'Suffs' to the best Broadway musicals and highlighting its ability to humanize, empower, entertain, and move the audience. This suggests a very strong recommendation, though the single excerpt warning suggests scoring conservatively within the Rave range. | Gemini: The quote indicates a positive experience, highlighting the musical's ability to connect with the audience on multiple levels. However, without the full review, it's difficult to gauge the extent of the enthusiasm, so I'm scoring it in the middle of the positive range.",
