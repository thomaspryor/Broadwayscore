  "dtliExcerpt": "The score’s most successful numbers are the climactic protest songs that come at the end of each act: The shouts of “we won’t wait another day” and “the young are at the gates,” linking the suffragists of yore to the activists of today. These moments finally get your heart racing, just as Taub (an activist in her own right) has long proved capable of doing through her insightful and cathartic music. If only&nbsp;Suffs&nbsp;weren’t as splintered as the movement.",
