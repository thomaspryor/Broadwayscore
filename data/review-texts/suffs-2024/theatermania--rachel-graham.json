    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with faint praise ('admirable goal') suggests polite but unenthusiastic assessment. The qualifier 'aims to' implies the show tries but may not fully succeed. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive sentiment by highlighting an 'admirable goal'. However, the lack of detailed evaluative content and the single excerpt warning necessitate a low confidence and a lower score within the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The single excerpt is mildly positive, but the lack of full text and a clear recommendation necessitates a low confidence score and placement at the lower end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: Single curated excerpt offers only mild praise for the show's intentions rather than its execution; limited context and cherry-picking risk warrant a conservative lower-positive score.",
