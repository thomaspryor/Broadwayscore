  "dtliExcerpt": "For all the work this show does to illuminate the successes — and failures — of the women’s rights movement, and the constantly evolving nature of our politics, it focuses so much energy on seeming as timely as possible. But, as the suffs learn, movements transform; our government leaders change, as do the demands of the people on the picket line. It’s a lesson the musical should take to heart: You can’t live in the past, present and future of our nation’s politics all at once — at least not without losing your way.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"âSuffsâ has a hefty two-hour-and-45-minute running time, after all, and though the musical isnât guilty of scolding, it is guilty of stifling an impressive â though exhausting â breadth of U.S. history through its contemporary lens.\"",
