    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('something special', 'urgent and necessary', 'thoroughly entertaining') suggests enthusiastic recommendation. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the musical as 'special', 'urgent', 'necessary', and 'thoroughly entertaining', indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt is strongly positive, using words like \"special\", \"urgent\", \"necessary\", and \"thoroughly entertaining.\" Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a high score within the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise describing the show as 'special,' 'urgent,' and 'thoroughly entertaining,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, the full context of the review is unavailable.",
