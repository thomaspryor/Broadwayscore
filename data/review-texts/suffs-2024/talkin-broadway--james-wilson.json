  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The production features some of the finest musical theatre performers currently working, and director Leigh Silverman and choreographer Raja Feather Kelly give each woman in the 20-member company a chance to shine. Ultimately, though, this is a show that seems to try too hard, and although perhaps appropriate for the material, there is a relentlessness about the musical. In its breadth and expansiveness (here emphasized by Mimi Lien's grand scenic design, featuring an imposing Federal-style government building), there is not a chance to get to know the women as much more than mouthpieces and types. Tellingly, when a major character dies in the first act, it is hard to feel moved because she seems more of a device than a fully drawn character.\"",
