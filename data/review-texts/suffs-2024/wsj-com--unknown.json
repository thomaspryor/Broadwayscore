Photo: Joan MarcusNew York\n\n“Sisters are doin’ it for themselves,” Annie Lennox and Aretha Franklin memorably sang back in the 1980s. The musical “Suffs,” about the struggle for women’s right to vote in the U.S., provides a fresh example. With book, music and lyrics by Shaina Taub, who also plays a principal role among the all-female cast, and Leigh Silverman directing, the show highlights the talents of women, following in the admittedly more momentous footsteps—much marching was involved!—of the characters.\n\nCopyright ©2024 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
