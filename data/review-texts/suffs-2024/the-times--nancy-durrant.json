  "fullText": "Forget the world stage, what about Broadway? This is the route that Hillary Clinton has taken as the co-producer, with Malala Yousafzai, of Suffs, a thundering new musical by the singer and composer Shaina Taub about the American women’s suffrage movement.\n\nLike Lin-Manuel Miranda in Hamilton, Taub wrote the book, music and lyrics and stars, as the firebrand suffragist Alice Paul. She conceived the show while dreaming of performing it before America’s first female president. It lands on Broadway in another election year, when hard-won women’s rights across America are being enthusiastically rubbed out.\n\nSuffs begins in 1913, at the 65th annual luncheon of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. Its president, Carrie Chapman Catt (Jenn Colella), is addressing the gentlemen guests (us)",
