This is the route that Hillary Clinton has taken as the co-producer, with Malala Yousafzai, of Suffs, a thundering new musical by the singer and composer Shaina Taub about the American women’s suffrage movement. Like Lin-Manuel Miranda in Hamilton, Taub wrote the book, music and lyrics and stars, as the firebrand suffragist Alice Paul. She conceived the show while dreaming of performing it before America’s first female president.

Despite the 4/5 star rating suggesting positive reception, the available text provides no actual critical assessment to score reliably. | GPT-4o: The original rating of 4/5 stars suggests a positive review. The phrase 'a thundering new musical' indicates a strong, positive impression of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The 4/5 star rating and the phrase \"thundering new musical\" suggest a positive review. However, the limited excerpt and single quote warrant a score in the lower-middle of the positive range.",

This is the route that Hillary Clinton has taken as the co-producer, with Malala Yousafzai, of Suffs, a thundering new musical by the singer and composer Shaina Taub about the American women’s suffrage movement.\n\nLike Lin-Manuel Miranda in Hamilton, Taub wrote the book, music and lyrics and stars, as the firebrand suffragist Alice Paul. She conceived the show while dreaming of performing it before America’s first female president. It lands on Broadway in another election year, when hard-won women’s rights across America are being enthusiastically rubbed out.\n\nSuffs begins in 1913, at the 65th annual luncheon of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. Its president, Carrie Chapman Catt (Jenn Colella), is addressing the gentlemen guests (us) with the wheedling opening number, Let Mother Vote.\n\nIt neatly lays out NAWSA’s genteel, softly-softly strategy, which Paul kicks against — she wants action, to organise the first women’s march in Washington. Catt wants to stay “ladylike”, to keep the men onside.\n\nThese activist heroines are frustrated — a repeated refrain is “why are you fighting me, I am not the enemy?” And they’re flawed — Taub works hard to foreground the racism in the movement during this time (it took years: the constitutional amendment prohibiting sex discrimination on the right to vote was passed in 1920).\n\nThe white women leaders’ clumsy evasions spark furious rebuke in the number Wait My Turn from the campaigning black journalist Ida B Wells (Nikki M James, exerting icy compression on white-hot rage), also at tactical odds with her friend Mary Church Terrell (Anastaćia McCleskey).\n\nMost of the names will be unfamiliar — Inez Milholland (Hannah Cruz), the glamazon lawyer who fronted the campaign; Ruza Wenclawksa, a Polish socialist (Kim Blanck, with an accent you could use to stuff pierogi); and Lucy Burns (Ally Bonino), a considerably more radical suffrage leader than the amiable woman depicted here.\n\nTaub’s music is stirring and her lyrics clever, even if she does go in for that Mirandaish relentless forward gallop, which gets a bit exhausting. Although in the context of the fight for women’s rights, that is at least appropriate.\n\nBut what of the men? Leigh Silverman’s production, with its all-female-identifying cast and orchestra, suffers by mostly excising them. Grace McLean is superbly condescending as President Woodrow Wilson and I liked Tsilala Brock as his increasingly feminist chief of staff, Dudley Malone.\n\nYet to endlessly describe, instead of show, the way men vilified, attacked and, in prison, literally force-fed these women is to gloss over the very real danger they were often in. It lessens the impact.\n\nThe show is partnered with When We All Vote, a campaign to increase voter registration in America. Paul’s later-life ambition (she died aged 92 in 1977) was to get the Equal Rights Amendment added to the US constitution, which would explicitly prohibit sex discrimination. In 2024 that still hasn’t happened. Feeling angry yet?★★★★☆To September 1, suffsmusical.com\n\nFollow @timesculture to read the latest reviews",
