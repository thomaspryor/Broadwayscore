    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The phrase 'occasionally transcends its own worthiness' suggests the show is generally worthy but earnest in a pedestrian way, with only moments of elevation. This indicates mixed feelings rather than clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show is earnest and educational, but only occasionally transcends its worthiness, indicating a mixed reception. The single excerpt and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's earnestness and educational value, but also suggests it only occasionally rises above its own limitations. This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise using faintly positive language ('earnest,' 'educational') and notes the show only occasionally transcends its inherent worthiness, suggesting a reserved, mildly positive recommendation rather than enthusiasm.",
