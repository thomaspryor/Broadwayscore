However, with only one curated quote available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the musical for being both educational and entertaining, suggesting a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the musical as both educational and entertaining, indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I've placed the score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the show's successful balance of education and entertainment, warranting a score in the upper Positive range per the single-excerpt guidance, though confidence is reduced due to limited available text.",
