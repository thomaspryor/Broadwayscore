  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Suffs is enthralling, a smart, funny and beautifully sung musical that brings its chosen moment in history to life just as surely and confidently as Hamilton did for its. That the Suffs era is female-focused and so less known, in its details, to the general public than the doings of the Founding Fathers makes Shaina Taub's creation all the more potent.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Rave | Claude: The critic uses strong positive language like 'enthralling' and compares it favorably to Hamilton, calling Taub's creation 'all the more potent.' This is clearly enthusiastic praise. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt uses highly positive language, comparing the musical favorably to 'Hamilton', which is a strong endorsement. The terms 'enthralling', 'smart', 'funny', and 'beautifully sung' suggest a high level of praise, justifying a 'Rave' classification. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"enthralling\" and compares the show favorably to Hamilton, indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range.",
