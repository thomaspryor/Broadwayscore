Due to the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt is strongly positive, praising the musical's consistency and intelligence in achieving its goals. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers unqualified praise for the show's clarity of vision and execution, with 'remarkable' indicating strong approval, though the limited context necessitates low confidence.",
