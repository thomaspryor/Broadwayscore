  "fullText": "'Suffs' review — Broadway musical brings suffrage to the stageRead our review of Suffs on Broadway, a new musical by Shaina Taub about the pioneers of the women's suffrage movement playing at the Music Box Theatre.\n\nSuffs, now reworked for Broadway after a 2022 run at The Public Theater, features a cast full of newcomers all playing fictionalized versions of historical figures. The musical about the political infighting — between genders, generations, and races — on the long road to American women’s suffrage has memorable music, star-making performances, and an inspiring message with moments that tug at the heartstrings.\n\nIt also relies strictly on the work of composer, librettist, and star Shaina Taub, who plays suffragist Alice Paul. Occasionally, this choice leads to mischaracterizations that change the story — Paul’s racism against Black women, for example, was not an awkward byproduct of her obliviousness, but an ingrained view that reared its head throughout her career. Taub writes and plays Paul like a nervous, bookish Leslie Knope when by all accounts, the suffragist was a brazen militant. The Suffs did not wonder how to “do what’s never been done,” a repeated refrain goes – they trained with hardcore British activists and brought their tactics back home.\n\nPerhaps this makes the comparisons between Suffs and Hamilton, another product of the Public, even more suitable. A musical theme that pays homage to Lin-Manuel Miranda’s work runs through the first act. And not only does Suffs feature its creator as a protagonist who puts work ahead of their personal life, but it forgoes accuracy in favor of a fun time.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But as a tool for civic education – which the show seems to market itself as – it’s simplistic. Leigh Silverman’s production is beautiful, but beauty is skin-deep.\n\nSuffs follows suffragist Alice Paul (Taub) as she joins forces with Carrie Chapman Catt (Jenn Colella) and the National American Woman Suffrage Association for the right to vote. However, Paul’s desire for direct action clashes with the stoic Catt, who wants to keep women’s virtue at the center of the suffrage campaign to win over President Woodrow Wilson (a hilarious Grace McLean).\n\nPaul recruits other young suffragists like Inez Milholland (Hannah Cruz), the precocious Doris Stevens (Nadia Dandashi), socialist Ruza Wenclawska (Kim Blanck), and longtime friend Lucy Burns (Ally Bonino). They also debate partnering with Black suffragists (including the terrific Nikki M. James as Ida B. Wells) but fear alienating white Southern women. Their ultimate break with Catt and NAWSA’s messaging leads them to form a new campaign for the vote: the National Woman’s Party.\n\nSuffs discusses racist and misogynistic violence, including lynching and domestic assault. The show also provides details of the torture of political prisoners after Paul and others embarked on a hunger strike and the Wilson administration approved their force-feeding. However, Silverman does not graphically depict these events, instead relying on Mayte Natalio’s choreography to convey the terror.\n\nSuffs also features a pyrotechnic sequence.\n\nSuffs has a rating of 93 on Show-Score, marking it an \"audience acclaimed\" show as many users call it a must-see production.\n\nRead more audience reviews of Suffs on Show-Score.\n\nDespite some structural issues and meandering musical numbers, Suffs is a well-crafted piece that ends on a note of empowerment and marches a historical story into the present.\n\nLearn more and get Suffs tickets on New York Theatre Guide. Suffs is at the Music Box Theatre.\n\nPhoto credit: Suffs on Broadway. (Photos by Joan Marcus)\n\nOriginally published on Apr 19, 202401:30",
