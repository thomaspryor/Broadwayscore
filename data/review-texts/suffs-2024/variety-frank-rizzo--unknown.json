  "fullText": "A musical that captures the sweep of history in all its complexities without sacrifice of character or credibility is no easy feat.\n\nBut \"Suffs,\" which tells the story of the final push to achieve the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote in 1920, does just that with a singular vision and a collective collaboration that is smart, inspiring and thoroughly entertaining.\n\nSince its initial bow in 2022, \"Suffs,\" created by composer-lyricist-book writer-lead actor Shaina Taub, has been inevitably compared to another musical epic created by a multi-hyphenate that began at the same theater at The Public which offered fresh perspectives of the American experience — and then went on to be a theatrical sensation. \"Suffs\" may not elicit the same musical furor of \"Hamilton\" but it's sure to find a following not only of contemporary suffs, but musical fans, too.",
