  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"In entertainment, there is the assumption that womenâs stories are small, while menâs stories are universal. Just as the suffragists broke down the doors of the patriarchy, Suffs breaks down the doors of musical theatre, showing that a cast and creative team of mostly women can tell a story that is important, powerful, and about all of us. With Taub leading it, the future of musical theatre is female, and itâs about time.\"",
