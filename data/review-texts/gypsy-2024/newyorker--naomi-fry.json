    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with high praise for McDonald's performance using superlatives ('marvel'). However, low confidence due to limited text - unclear if this praise extends to overall production recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides high praise for Audra McDonald's performance, describing it as a 'marvel' and highlighting both depth and respect for the role's legacy. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Audra McDonald's performance as a \"marvel,\" indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I've placed it in the upper range of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong praise for McDonald's performance using superlatives like 'marvel,' warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts. However, the single-quote limitation prevents higher confidence or a Rave classification, as the excerpt focuses narrowly on one performance without assessing the full production.",
