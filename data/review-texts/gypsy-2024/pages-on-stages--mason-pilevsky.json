Given the warning about cherry-picked quotes and minimal text, scoring at lower end of Positive bucket with low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances as 'wonderful' and 'nuanced', suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low and the score is at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances as \"wonderful\" and \"nuanced,\" suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains clearly positive evaluative language ('wonderful', 'nuanced') regarding performances, but limited context and truncation warrant low confidence and upper-mid range score within Positive bucket.",
