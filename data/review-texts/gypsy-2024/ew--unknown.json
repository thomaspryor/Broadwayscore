    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performance with superlative language ('jaw-dropping', 'utterly seamless'), but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the lead performance, highlighting the seamless integration of vocals and character embodiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low as it may not reflect the entire review sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a very positive assessment of the performance, suggesting a recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers glowing praise for the central performance using superlatives like 'jaw-dropping' and 'embodies,' indicating strong enthusiasm, though limited context prevents definitive classification as a full rave.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "The trick seems to be that she doesn’t feel it… or, at least, show it. For the musical's three hour runtime, McDonald is singularly focused on her character’s objectives — making her daughters vaudeville stars. She doesn’t merely play Rose; she embodies her. The vocals — which are, of course, rich and operatic and often jaw-dropping — feel utterly seamless with Rose’s way of expressing herself. Onstage, McDonald isn’t a Broadway diva, but a storyteller. This is why she’ll most likely break her own record in the spring as the most Tony-nominated performer of all time with what would be her 11th nod. To put it in Rose’s terms: She’s got it.",
