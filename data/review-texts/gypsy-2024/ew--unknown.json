    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performance with superlative language ('jaw-dropping', 'utterly seamless'), but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the lead performance, highlighting the seamless integration of vocals and character embodiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low as it may not reflect the entire review sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a very positive assessment of the performance, suggesting a recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers glowing praise for the central performance using superlatives like 'jaw-dropping' and 'embodies,' indicating strong enthusiasm, though limited context prevents definitive classification as a full rave.",
