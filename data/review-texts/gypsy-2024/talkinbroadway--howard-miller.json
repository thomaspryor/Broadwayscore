    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising McDonald's exceptional performance with superlative language ('like no other'). However, confidence is low due to limited text - this could be cherry-picked from a mixed review that criticizes other elements. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Audra McDonald's performance, suggesting a positive view of her role. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment of the review is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is strong praise for Audra McDonald's performance, suggesting a positive recommendation. Given the limited context, confidence is low, but the strength of the quote pushes the score to the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic superlatives for the lead performance ('like no other'), indicating a clear recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt focused on one element, the score is placed in the upper Positive range per guidance rather than the Rave bucket.",
