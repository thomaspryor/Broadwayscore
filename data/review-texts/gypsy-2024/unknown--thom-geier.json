Given single excerpt warning and clearly positive language, scored at upper end of Positive bucket. Low confidence due to extremely limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Audra McDonald's performance as 'mesmerizingly original,' suggesting a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper range of Positive. | Gemini: The excerpt contains high praise for Audra McDonald's performance, suggesting a positive recommendation. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt provides superlative praise for McDonald's performance ('mesmerizingly original'), indicating a positive assessment, though limited context warrants low confidence.",
