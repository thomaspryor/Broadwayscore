  "bwwExcerpt": "At the end of, shall we say, a testing year, it seems perverse to cheer for a malignant narcissist, a thieving liar, a fake patriot and toxic parent who exploits their children in bitter pursuit of fame. But if the world has become a sad, sleazy circus, more reason to welcome the consolation of art. The miraculous Audra Mcdonald blooms as Rose in what may be the most heartstopping Gypsy you’ll ever see. The fifth Broadway revival of this shatterproof classic, and the third I’ve witnessed after those starring Bernadette Peters and Patti LuPone, the current version carries a thousand-volt electrical charge and lands at the Majestic with the force of a tornado. McDonald is the thunder-tossing center of that tempest, reminding us that the root of Audra means storm.",

However, given the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The quote is extremely positive, suggesting a must-see performance. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the statement warrants a high positive score. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise ('most heartstopping') indicating strong enthusiasm, though the single-excerpt limitation requires capping at the top of the Positive range rather than Rave. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
