  "bwwExcerpt": "Despite its indestructible book and score and several strong performances, the show Wolfe has built never quite hangs together. Its gestures at times feel stock, at other times scattered, and as in much of Wolfe’s work with Loquasto, there’s a sense of getting stuck somewhere between worlds. Is this a scrappy production, or isn’t it? Well, of course it isn’t, but one gets the sense that somewhere along the line, it might secretly have wanted to be.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises McDonald's performance with sophisticated language ('full manifestation', 'complex knot'), suggesting critical appreciation. However, low confidence due to limited text and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a significant and positive aspect of the production, focusing on McDonald's impactful performance. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Audra McDonald's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. Given the single excerpt and the warning, I'm scoring it as mildly positive with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Audra McDonald's performance, describing it as finding 'full manifestation' in a 'complex knot of hurt, defiance, and rage.' While clearly positive, the single-excerpt limitation prevents higher confidence or a Rave classification.",
