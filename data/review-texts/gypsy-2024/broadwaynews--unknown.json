Woods also has the nerve to be hilarious, all the while going head to head with the tornado force that is McDonald.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance with superlative 'sensational' and detailed appreciation of range and skill. Single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked from a mixed review, but the language is unqualifiedly positive about Woods' performance. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for Woods' performance, describing it as 'sensational' and highlighting her versatility and humor. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising Woods' performance as sensational and highlighting her range and comedic ability. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the lead performance using superlatives like 'sensational' and 'tornado force.' Per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, scored at the upper end of the Positive range (80-84) with low confidence due to limited text availability.",
