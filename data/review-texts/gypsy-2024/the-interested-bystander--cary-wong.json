    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a highly positive view, implying the show is a significant and memorable experience. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is strongly positive, suggesting a high level of recommendation. Given the limited information, confidence is low. | Kimi: While only a single excerpt is available, the language used ('witnessing Broadway history') represents superlative praise indicating a landmark production. Following the single-excerpt protocol for clearly positive quotes, this is scored at the upper end of the Positive bucket (80-84).",
