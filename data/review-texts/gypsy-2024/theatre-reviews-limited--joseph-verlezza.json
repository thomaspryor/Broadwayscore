    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising McDonald's 'performance of a lifetime' suggests strong positive assessment, but limited text requires low confidence and cautious scoring within positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Audra McDonald's performance as 'of a lifetime', indicating a strong positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low and the score is at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is overwhelmingly positive, praising Audra McDonald's performance as a 'performance of a lifetime.' Given the limited information, I am placing it in the positive bucket with a high score, but low confidence due to the lack of context. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers superlative praise for the lead performance ('performance of a lifetime'), indicating a strong positive verdict, though confidence is low given the limited excerpt availability.",
