However, confidence is low due to limited text from curated excerpt only. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production for showcasing a star in a role she was meant to play, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the star's performance and suggests the director has enabled a key aspect of the show. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the director's vision and the star's essential performance, using imperative language ('had to be seen') that signals strong enthusiasm. However, as a single curated excerpt, the confidence is reduced.",
