    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the director's work with McDonald and suggesting this is an essential pairing of star and role. However, confidence is low due to limited text from curated excerpt only. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production for showcasing a star in a role she was meant to play, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the star's performance and suggests the director has enabled a key aspect of the show. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the director's vision and the star's essential performance, using imperative language ('had to be seen') that signals strong enthusiasm. However, as a single curated excerpt, the confidence is reduced.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "That not all this revival’s choices will please everyone is probably a good thing. On occasion, I found myself recalling moments that moved or thrilled me more in earlier productions, just as I did when I saw those productions in the first place. “Gypsy,” like other great works of midcentury American drama — it opened the same season as Lorraine Hansberry’s “A Raisin in the Sun” — rewards a layering of lifetime impressions. Wolfe offers a rich new layer, sufficient in itself, and more so as part of history. Most important, he has given us a way of seeing a star who had to be seen in this role. As “Gypsy” suggests, and McDonald keeps proving, a pioneer woman needs a frontier.",
