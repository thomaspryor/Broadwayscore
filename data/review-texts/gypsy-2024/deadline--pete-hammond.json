Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Audra McDonald's performance, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the performance using unequivocal positive language ('works beautifully'), warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket per the single-excerpt guidelines, though confidence is reduced due to limited text availability.",
