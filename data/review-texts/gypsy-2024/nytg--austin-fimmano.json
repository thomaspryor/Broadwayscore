    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising lead performance as 'triumphant' suggests positive review, but extremely limited text makes full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises McDonald's performance as unique and triumphant, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The quote praises the performance of McDonald as Momma Rose, using the word \"triumphant,\" which suggests a strong positive sentiment. Given that it's the only excerpt, I'm scoring it as a strong positive, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly positive language ('triumphant') to praise the central performance, warranting an upper-range Positive score per the single-excerpt guidelines, though the limited context prevents higher confidence.",
