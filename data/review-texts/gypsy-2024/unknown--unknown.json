Single excerpt warning requires caution - this appears mildly positive with reservations. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises McDonald's performance as 'stupendously affecting' but notes the show is only 'intermittently' so. This suggests a positive view with some reservations. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the lead performance highly but then says the show is \"a bit intermittently\" good, suggesting a mixed but overall positive assessment. Due to the truncated nature of the review, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise for McDonald's performance ('stupendously affecting') while offering qualified praise for the show itself ('if a bit intermittently'), indicating a strong positive recommendation with minor reservations.",
