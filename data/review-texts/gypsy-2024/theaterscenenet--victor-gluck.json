    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong praise for the lead performance using vivid language ('devours the stage', 'born to play'). However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of positive quotes. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for McDonald's performance, suggesting a positive view of her role. However, without more context or a full review, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a lower confidence score. | Gemini: The single excerpt is overwhelmingly positive about Audra McDonald's performance, suggesting a strong recommendation. Given the limited context, confidence is low, but the strength of the quote warrants a high positive score. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers vivid, enthusiastic praise for the star's performance ('devours the stage'), indicating a strong recommendation, but limited text prevents assessment of overall production quality.",
