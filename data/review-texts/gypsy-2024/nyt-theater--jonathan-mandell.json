  "bwwExcerpt": "The marquee says it all: “AudraGypsy.” With less brass and more heart, Audra McDonald’s distinctive portrayal of Madam Rose, the mother of all stage mothers, is the reason to see this sixth Broadway production of the 1959 musical inspired by the memoir of Gypsy Rose Lee, the (s)mothered childhood vaudevillian turned famous adult stripper. Some people have called “Gypsy” the greatest musical ever written. “But some people ain’t me” — to quote a Stephen Sondheim lyric from one of Jule Styne’s many tuneful melodies in the show, which opened tonight at the Majestic.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Audra McDonald's performance, suggesting a positive view of her portrayal. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on Audra McDonald's performance, describing it as distinctive. Given the limited context, I'm placing it in the positive bucket and leaning towards the higher end due to the positive description of McDonald's performance. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance ('distinctive,' 'more heart'), indicating a clearly positive assessment. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this scores in the upper Positive range despite limited context.",
