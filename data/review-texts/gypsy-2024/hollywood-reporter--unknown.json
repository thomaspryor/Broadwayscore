Single excerpt limits full assessment, but the tone suggests strong positive recommendation for the lead performance. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises McDonald's performance as bold and startling, culminating in a 'rapturous standing ovation,' indicating a highly positive reception. | Gemini: The excerpt describes a \"startling display\" and \"rapturous standing ovation\", indicating a very positive reaction to the performance. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers effusive praise for Audra McDonald's performance, describing it as a 'startling display' earning a 'rapturous standing ovation,' indicating strong recommendation despite limited context.",
