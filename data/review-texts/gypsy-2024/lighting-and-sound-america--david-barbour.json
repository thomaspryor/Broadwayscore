    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the lead performance with vivid, enthusiastic language ('hair-raising, gooseflesh-producing'). However, confidence is low due to limited text - this could be cherry-picked from a mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a highly positive evaluation of the performance, using strong language like 'hair-raising' and 'gooseflesh-producing'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single quote available is overwhelmingly positive, using strong language like \"hair-raising\" and \"gooseflesh-producing.\" Given the limited information, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence due to the excerpted nature. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise for the lead performance using evocative language ('hair-raising,' 'gooseflesh-producing'). Following the single-excerpt protocol for clearly positive quotes, this scores at the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
