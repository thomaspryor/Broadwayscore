  "bwwExcerpt": "Aristophanes' \"Lysistrata\" transported to a contempo college setting, with boys called Cinesius and Xander and a cheerleader named Lysistrata Jones? Sounds academic, precious, or both. But librettist Douglas Carter Beane takes pinpoint aim, the jokes ricocheting across the commandeered basketball court at Judson Memorial Church on Washington Square. \"Lysistrata Jones\" is a slyly contrived \"High School Musical\" for adults, lubricated with gallons of Grecian formula.",
