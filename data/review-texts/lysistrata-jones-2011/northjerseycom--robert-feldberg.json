  "bwwExcerpt": "Beane is the author of such amusing, sophisticated comedies as 'The Little Dog Laughed' and 'As Bees in Honey Drown,' as well as the very funny book for the musical 'Sister Act.' With 'Lysistrata Jones,' which is in the vein of the book he provided for the wit-challenged 'Xanadu,' he seems to be slumming, writing condescendingly about characters for whom he has no affection or regard. In the second act, Beane tries to plant a message in the feeble goings-on: Strive for what you want. It's a lesson that few audience members, I think, would have picked up from the show on their own.",
