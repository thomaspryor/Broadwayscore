  "bwwExcerpt": "The show has its charms, particularly Lewis Flynn's surprisingly hook-filled score, the reliably hilarious one-liners by book writer Douglas Carter Beane, and some fine comic performances. But too much of the time, it plays like a slightly raunchier version of a Nickelodeon or Disney Channel sitcom, rife with predictable plotlines and broad cultural and racial stereotypes.",
