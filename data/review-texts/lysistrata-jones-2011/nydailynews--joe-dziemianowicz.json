On the winning side, director-choreographer Dan Knechtges surrounds “Lyssie J” in good-looking production and his high-impact dance numbers that make your heart rate climb just watching them. The plot is about not giving it up, but the cast always delivers 100%.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic acknowledges talented cast and clever book but delivers a damning verdict that the show 'feels more like a college production than a Broadway musical' - this is clearly dismissive of Broadway-level quality expectations. | GPT-4o: The critic acknowledges a talented cast and clever book but ultimately finds the production lacking the quality expected of a Broadway show, aligning with the original rating of 40. | Gemini: The review excerpt compares the show unfavorably to a college production, indicating a negative overall assessment despite acknowledging positive elements. | Kimi: The critic's original rating of 40/100 places this firmly in the Negative bucket. While acknowledging a talented cast and clever book, the verdict that the show 'feels more like a college production than a Broadway musical' signals clear disappointment and a recommendation against seeing it. Confidence is low due to availability of only a single excerpt.",
