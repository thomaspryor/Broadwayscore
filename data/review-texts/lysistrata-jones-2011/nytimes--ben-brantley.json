  "bwwExcerpt": "“Lysistrata Jones” has been dressed up (and scaled up) real pretty for Broadway, bringing a heightened touch of summer sun and silliness to what has been an exceptionally gray season for musicals...Lysistrata may at first seem deeply superficial. But it turns out there’s tasty substance beneath the froth, just enough to keep you hooked. The same may be said of the endearingly escapist show in which she appears.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic identifies a fundamental flaw - the production 'never finds the right tone' - which indicates failure at the most basic level of adaptation. The dismissive 'aggressively upbeat' suggests the tone problem undermines the entire show. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the musical for failing to find the right tone, suggesting a lack of recommendation. The tone is clearly negative with no redeeming qualities mentioned. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the musical 'never finds the right tone,' indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic clearly criticizes the show's tonal imbalance, finding the 'aggressively upbeat' approach mismatched with the source material, indicating a negative assessment despite acknowledging its energy.",
