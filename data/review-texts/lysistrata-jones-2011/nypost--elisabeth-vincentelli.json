  "bwwExcerpt": "A lot of people whine that Broadway doesn’t know how to make entertaining musicals anymore. Happily, it turns out that Broadway still knows how to make ’em. With its catchy pop score, charming cast, zippy staging and wickedly funny book, “Lysistrata Jones” is one of the season’s tastiest pieces of candy. Sadly, it’s also one of the most underbuzzed.",

Brief excerpt limits confidence but tone is clearly favorable. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'surprisingly sweet and funny' with a 'terrific cast', indicating a positive recommendation. However, the brevity of the review and lack of detailed evaluation suggests some reservations, leading to a mid-range Positive score. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as 'surprisingly sweet and funny' and 'terrific cast,' indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: Clear positive recommendation praising the show as sweet and funny with a terrific cast, though the brevity suggests this may be an excerpt.",
