  "bwwExcerpt": "Apart from a few new jokes and some heightened production values, 'Lysistrata Jones' remains unchanged and is as sharp and sassy as ever. The premise sounds paper-thin, but ook writer Douglas Carter Beane, who worked similar wonders with the stage version of the cult junk film 'Xanadu,' transforms this slender idea into a fully fleshed-out, stereotype-shattering comedy.",
