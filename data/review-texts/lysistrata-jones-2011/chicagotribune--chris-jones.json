  "bwwExcerpt": "The original play combined subversive comedic antics with hefty stakes. The derivative combines campy comedic antics with no stakes whatsoever, unless some joker has given you Athens U. in the March Madness pool. Without some viable equivalent of something big to play for, 'Lysistrata Jones,' its amusements and imagination aside, plays very thin and contrived — albeit with thick Broadway prices.",
