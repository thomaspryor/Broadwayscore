  "bwwExcerpt": "One must pay attention to a man even as inattentive as the loutishly bewildered Willy Loman, whom Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays so effectively in director Mike Nichols's steel-girded Broadway revival of \"Death of a Salesman,\" which officially opened Thursday night at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre.

However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review praises Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance and the direction, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the lead performance ('so effectively') and direction ('steel-girded'), indicating a clear recommendation.
