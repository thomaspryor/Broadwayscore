    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt criticizes the direction as 'uneven, uninflected' lacking 'dramatic solidity' while acknowledging Hoffman as 'capable' with 'impressive scenes.' Text appears cut off mid-sentence, limiting confidence in the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt describes the production as 'uneven' and lacking 'dramatic solidity,' indicating a mixed reception. While Hoffman's performance is noted as 'capable,' the overall tone suggests neither a strong recommendation nor a clear discouragement. | Gemini: The review excerpt notes an \"uneven\" quality and lack of dramatic solidity, suggesting a mixed assessment. However, it also mentions Hoffman's capability and impressive scenes, preventing a fully negative classification. The single excerpt and truncated nature lower confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production as 'uneven' and 'uninflected' lacking dramatic solidity, while acknowledging Hoffman is 'capable' with 'impressive scenes.' This balance of production criticism and performer praise indicates a mixed reception. Single excerpt and truncation warrant low confidence.",
