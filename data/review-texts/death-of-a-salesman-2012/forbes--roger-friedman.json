  "bwwExcerpt": "\"PHS and Garfield are stunning. Emonds and Witttock are exceptional. All the supporting players are top notch. Nichols has given \"Death\" a new life, illuminating its intricacies and sophisticated architecture. There isn't a false note played. Rudin will now have the top grossing musical (\"Book of Mormon\") and play at the same time.\"",
