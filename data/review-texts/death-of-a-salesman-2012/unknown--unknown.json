Given this is a curated excerpt that may not represent the full verdict, scoring at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the revival as 'notably rich and mostly successful,' indicating a positive evaluation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, and the score is placed in the upper range of Positive. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a \"mostly successful approach,\" suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic review. Given that it is only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates clear praise ('notably rich') with slight qualification ('mostly successful'), placing it in the upper Positive range. Low confidence due to limited text availability.",
