    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for cast ('impeccably cast') and production ('emotionally wrenching'), with critic noting unprecedented impact. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and text appearing cut off mid-sentence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the casting and emotional impact of the production, suggesting a strong positive response. The language used ('impeccably cast', 'emotionally wrenching') indicates a high level of enthusiasm, placing it in the Rave category despite the limited context. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the casting, ensemble, and emotional impact of the production, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. The phrase \"overwhelming impact\" indicates a high level of praise. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise ('impeccably cast,' 'emotionally wrenching,' 'overwhelming impact'), indicating clear enthusiasm for the production. However, confidence is low due to the single curated excerpt format, which may not capture the full review's nuance.",
