  "bwwExcerpt": "Cromwell, however, treats the play as though it were carved entirely in air. The scenic design by Anna Fleischle allows only the barest minimum of set pieces to swoop in from above and sketch the various settings. Incorporating live music as a theatrical emollient, the staging risks turning 'Death of a Salesman' into a funhouse with an array of expressionistic effects that only the great De Shields is able to stylishly pull off.",
