  "bwwExcerpt": "\"This play, like most of Miller's early work, exerts its will on an audience in an extraordinary way. It's like a freight train that slowly picks up speed, and before you know it, it is hurtling down the tracks, in danger of derailing at any moment. Put this material in the hands of a smart director and gifted actors, and the results can be breathtaking. And that's certainly the case with this show.\"",
