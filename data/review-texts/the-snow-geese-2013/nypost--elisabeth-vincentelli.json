  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Daniel Sullivan smoothly handles White's melodramatic story, which also includes Elizabeth's religious sister, Clarissa, and her German husband, Max. The reliably wonderful Victoria Clark and Danny Burstein (doing a rather odd accent) act the hell out of tacked-on parts. You actually would like to know more about Clarissa, whose forbidding manner hides a kind spirit.",
