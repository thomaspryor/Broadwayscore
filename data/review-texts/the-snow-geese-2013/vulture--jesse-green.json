  "bwwExcerpt": "The Snow Geeselacks two qualities whose absence can't be finessed. One is freshness. Whereas Christopher Durang's Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike, another Chekhov gloss, successfully put the master's archetypes in amusingly new situations, White gives us a play we feel like we've already seen...The actors do what they can, but here, too, there is a mismatch. On one team you have Mary-Louise Parker as Elizabeth, looking lovely in her widow's weeds. Parker can be extraordinarily compelling when playing contemporary characters; her thinking process, with all its starts and stops and pauses and reversals, is unusually legible and honest. (She'd be excellent in White's terrific play The Other Place, recently on Broadway.) Characters who are less modern pose a problem for her though, because they are usually written to think withthe lines, not between them. Parker just doesn't gravitate that way, and because her pull is so powerful the audience gets dragged into her style instead of the play's, and so do some of the young actors playing her sons.",
