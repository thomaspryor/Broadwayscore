  "bwwExcerpt": "'The Snow Geese' characters share Chekhov's thematic constant - boredom. The challenge is how to write about it without becoming it. Chekhov masterfully avoided that dramatic pitfall. Not quite Sharr White. And if his first act is slow to take off, he's got the ideal company to ensure a heartfelt landing.",
