  "bwwExcerpt": "Sharr White's World War I-era drama, 'The Snow Geese,' is a low-flying work. Presented by Manhattan Theatre Club and MCC Theater, the play is interesting, but too diffuse to satisfy fully. Some compensation comes from a fine-tuned cast led by Mary-Louise Parker, who's at her signature idiosyncratic best...White raises lots of ideas - about parental favoritism, culture clashes and sibling rivalries. He doesn't fully develop any of these notions. And Arnold's 11th-hour solution to money woes should have been obvious to the whole family from the get-go. But the play is less about action and more about developing a group portrait. Another draft could have brought things into better focus.",
