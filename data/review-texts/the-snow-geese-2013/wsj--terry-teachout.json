  "bwwExcerpt": "I had trouble with the first act, which never seemed to take wing, and though the second act was more involving, I felt at play's end that the last word had been spoken an hour and a half earlier by one of the unhappy characters: 'God knows what would happen if we ever stopped talking and actually did something around here.' Any show whose cast includes Danny Burstein, Victoria Clark and Mary-Louise Parker is worth seeing by definition, but 'The Snow Geese' failed to get me on board.",
