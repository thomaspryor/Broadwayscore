  "bwwExcerpt": "While The Snow Geese inherits some of the less appealing aspects of 19th-century dramas-lengthy exposition, laborious bird metaphors-it does not share those works' depth of feeling or insight. And the play, intent on modern resonance, often feels jarringly, unevenly contemporary. (Someone calls the Great War 'a bloody shit show.') It's a pretty but unsatisfying meal, undercooked and overstuffed.",
