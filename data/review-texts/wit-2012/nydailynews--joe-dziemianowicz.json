  "bwwExcerpt": "Nixon brings the cool, detached demeanor familiar from her portrayal of Miranda Hobbes on “Sex and the City” as well as the grieving mother in “Rabbit Hole,” for which she won a Tony Award in 2006. She gives a commanding performance, one in which hard, sharp edges subtly soften. She’s particularly fine when Vivian interacts with family, students and healthcare pros.",
