  "bwwExcerpt": "The actress, last onstage here in her Tony-winning portrayal as the inconsolable mother of a dead child in the 2006 'Rabbit Hole,' is virtuosic at looking as fragile as a girl, almost at the same time she withdraws into a distant and forbidding beauty. Here, with her shaved head covered by a red baseball cap, she is still most convincing in the flashbacks to the childhood moment when she learned she loved words and to the character-forming lesson from her tough mentor (played with beautiful restraint by Suzanne Bertish).",
