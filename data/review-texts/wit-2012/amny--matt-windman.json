  "bwwExcerpt": "It took more than a decade for 'Wit,' school teacher Margaret Edson's insightful medical drama, to make it to Broadway. But as demonstrated by Manhattan Theatre Club's elegant and intimate revival starring 'Sex and the City's' Cynthia Nixon, 'Wit' was well worth the wait...Nixon deserves a lot of credit for taking on such an unglamorous role. She nails the play's humor and captures Vivian's journey, which ends with her finally breaking down emotionally when she is no longer able to hide behind her 'wit.'",
