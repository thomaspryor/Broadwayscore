  "bwwExcerpt": "Cate Blanchett is the attraction. Richard Roxburgh is the revelation. That overly brief assessment does not detract from Blanchett's considerable achievement in Andrew Upton's new play, 'The Present,' which opened Sunday at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. Upton and Blanchett would probably agree that the play, freely adapted and updated from Anton Chekhov's 'Platonov,' is all about that title character, Mikhail Platonov, a middle-aged schoolteacher who is as much adored by women and he is disgusted by himself.",
