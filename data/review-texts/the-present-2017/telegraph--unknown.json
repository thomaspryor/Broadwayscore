  "bwwExcerpt": ": Few actors can juggle successful film and theatre careers simultaneously. But Cate Blanchett has made it look astonishingly easy, winning two Oscars while also starring in Sydney Theatre Company productions of Hedda Gabler, A Streetcar Named Desire and The Maids, among others. For her Broadway debut in The Present, at the Barrymore Theatre, she shares top billing with fellow Aussie Richard Roxburgh, and the fireworks set up to mark her character's 40th birthday at the end of the first act of this adaptation of Chekhov's Platonov aren't the only sparks igniting in this intense, invigorating three-hour show.",
