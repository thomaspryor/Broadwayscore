  "bwwExcerpt": "It would be possible - and extremely pleasurable - to spend most of the three hours at 'The Present' just watching Cate Blanchett. Here she is playing the seemingly confident widow Anna on the eve of her 40th birthday. She stares out from her late husband's Russian country estate wearing a filmy summer dress. She lounges unselfconsciously in the laps of her party guests, enjoying a foot massage from her grown stepson.",
