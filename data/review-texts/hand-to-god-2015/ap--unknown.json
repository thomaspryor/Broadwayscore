  "bwwExcerpt": "Playwright Robert Askins' bracing comedy, mixes violence, swearing, brutal honesty, parental failure, church hypocrisy, and plenty of sex - of both human and puppet varieties. But beware: It's a show for those who consider 'Avenue Q' too tame, for folks who think Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog, is too neutered...The cast is great, made up of Boyer, Michael Oberholtzer and Sarah Stiles playing three teens - and the adults played by Geneva Carr, who portrays Boyer's character's mom, and the gravelly voiced Marc Kudisch as the righteous but horny church pastor...Moritz von Stuelpnagel directs with a flair for allowing the play's little absurdities to reveal themselves naturally and a skill with onstage physicalit...Beowulf Boritt's set is spot-on...Askins at times seems to fumble for a deeper meaning about the individual getting lost in the collective, but while he comes close to profundity, it's really his cast that leaves an impression. Especially Tyrone. He'll keep you up at night.",
