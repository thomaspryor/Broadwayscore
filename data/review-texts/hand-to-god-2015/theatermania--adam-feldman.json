The tone is enthusiastically recommending. | GPT-4o: The review praises the show as both 'deeply offensive and deeply moving,' indicating a strong emotional impact and insightful comedy. This suggests a highly positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"deeply offensive and deeply moving\" and a \"comedy that earns its laughs through genuine insight.\" This indicates a positive, but not rave, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers strong praise, calling the show 'deeply moving' with 'genuine insight' and noting it 'earns its laughs,' indicating a clear recommendation. Confidence is low due to the brevity of the provided excerpt.",
