  "bwwExcerpt": "God may have created the heavens and the earth and all living things -- but the Devil surely created Tyrone, the filthy-minded, foul-mouthed sock puppet that has audiences howling at 'Hand to God.' Robert Askins' furiously funny comedy about adolescent rebellion against religious cant has made a smooth passage from workshop (at Ensemble Studio Theater) to Off Broadway (in an MCC production) to Broadway. Moritz von Stuelpnagel hasn't touched a hair on the head of his clever production and the original cast is still golden. At 800 seats, the intimate Booth proves extremely hospitable to this fiendish little satire of all things holy.",
