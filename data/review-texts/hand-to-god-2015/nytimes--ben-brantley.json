A more formidable villain now stalks the Broadway boards, one who makes you seem about as frightening as a French pastry. His name, Tyrone, is not the scariest handle, but he’s as ruthless as any dedicated evildoer, with a spectacularly foul mouth and a thirst for young flesh.\n\nOh, and he’s also made of a gray sock, some felt and a fringe of fake fur. The terrible Tyrone is, in short, a hand puppet.\n\nIf you imagine that to be merely a punch line, forget it. The fearsome critter, who takes possession of a troubled teenager’s left arm in Robert Askins’s darkly delightful play “Hand to God,” really inspires goose bumps as he unleashes a reign of terror on that teenager, Jason, and everyone in his orbit. But unlike the grim Javert, he’s also flat-out hilarious, spewing forth acid commentary that will turn those goose bumps into guffaws.\n\n“Hand to God” popped open on Tuesday at the Booth Theater like a cackling jack-in-the-box, scaring away (really) a couple of audience members at the performance I caught, but bringing peals of joy to most everyone else. In a Broadway season dominated by the usual fodder — musicals new and old, and a healthy serving of Important British Dramas — Mr. Askins’s black comedy about the divided human soul, previously seen in two separate Off Broadway runs, stands out as a misfit both merry and scary, and very welcome.\n\nThe innocuous setting is a church basement in suburban Texas, where posters on the walls chirp cheery thoughts about Jesus. Here Jason, played by the sensational Steven Boyer, sits glumly, trying (and failing) not to look mortified as his mother, Margery (Geneva Carr), prepares a small group of volunteers for a Christian puppet show.\n\nJoining Jason are the sullen Timothy (Michael Oberholtzer), his body curved into a perma-slouch and a sneer of contempt fixed on his face (he’s been parked here while his mother attends her rehab meetings), and the mildly enthusiastic Jessica (Sarah Stiles). “I’m really more into Balinese shadow puppetry,” she sniffs, sounding like a junior Julie Taymor. “But I’ll take what I can get.”\n\nMargery, whose anxiety flashes from her bright eyes like signal flares, desperately needs to keep this minor job. Her husband, Jason’s father, died recently, leaving them both in financial and emotional distress. Just how violently their psyches have been disrupted becomes clear when they are each bedeviled by furtive and embarrassing impulses.\n\nJason’s manifest themselves most outlandishly. His budding kinship with Jessica becomes strained when Tyrone, heretofore a quiet fellow with a festive red mop of hair, begins spouting lewd insinuations about Jason’s attraction to her. Jason tries to quiet him, blushing down to his toes as Jessica squirms uncomfortably. But Tyrone, the impish embodiment of Jason’s unmoored id, soon becomes the dominant force, imposing his evil will on Jason to disastrous — and explosively funny — effect.\n\nIt’s hard to describe just how convincingly Mr. Boyer makes Tyrone’s rude volleys seem to be coming from another character entirely, although we can see his lips moving. (In truth, when Tyrone is on a tear, your eyes are unlikely to stray from his braying red mouth.) Jason speaks in a gentle hush, his every other utterance seemingly a plea to not be noticed. Tyrone, on the other hand, rips forth a guttural snarl that would have you leaping out of your shoes if it caught you off guard on a lonely street. He’s not just in your face but down your throat. And, as Timothy learns, he’s got a bite every bit as bad as his bark.\n\nMr. Boyer’s performance as Jason is tender and touching, his performance as Tyrone outlandish and hilarious; put them together and you have that rarely seen (although often hailed) acting achievement: a true tour de force.\n\nThe surrounding performances, under the finely honed direction of Moritz von Stuelpnagel, are less dazzling but no less sharp, either touching, funny or both. Ms. Carr renders Margery’s uncertainty and uneasiness with painful clarity. Moving with less-than-tactful dispatch, the church’s pastor, Greg (Marc Kudisch), has begun slathering on suggestive consolation. Mr. Kudisch, exuding manly goodness, speaks Greg’s comforting words in a silken voice that doesn’t mask the sexual aggression underneath.\n\nMargery’s gentle attempts to discourage Pastor Greg without offending him gradually grow firmer, but her nerves are rattled when he becomes riled and storms out of the basement. By unhappy coincidence, Timothy, who has made his crush on Margery known, enters as she bursts into a fit of anger. Soon they are tearing the place apart — and tearing off each other’s clothes, with Mr. Oberholtzer’s exhilaration and terror combining to riotous effect.\n\nAs Jason’s battle with Tyrone escalates — a scene in which Tyrone paws at Jason violently as they fight in bed is outrageously funny, as is a passage of wild puppet sex during which Jessica volunteers her own arm for therapy — the suspicion arises that Jason’s arm has been colonized by the devil. Perhaps an exorcism is in order, suggests Pastor Greg. “Isn’t there supposed to be a young priest and an old priest?” Jason asks wanly.\n\nBut “Hand to God” is not a horror story, or at least not a horror story in which the forces of evil are supernatural. What makes the play so sneakily resonant is how Mr. Askins exposes the base impulses, the sexual, self-destructive, potentially violent ones, that just about everyone harbors to some small degree.\n\nWith the exception of Jessica, played with submerged warmth by Ms. Stiles, all the characters are struggling against unhealthy urges released by the pressures bearing down on them: Margery and Jason’s grief; Timothy’s abandonment by his mother; Pastor Greg’s loneliness and wounded pride.\n\nYou can enjoy “Hand to God” merely as a festival of filthy hilarity, like “The Book of Mormon.” But as I watched the play this year, for the third time, I found myself peering more closely into its psychological depths, and finding in it a weird mirror of our unsettling times. Pick up a newspaper and you read another grim report about men and women little older than Jason succumbing to far more destructive passions. Maybe if more of the world’s troubled youth discharged their demons with the help of sock puppets, things might not look so grim.\n\nAn earlier version of the headline with this review misstated the play’s title. As the review correctly notes, it is “Hand to God,” not “Hand of God.”\n\nWhen we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.
