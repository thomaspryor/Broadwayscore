  "bwwExcerpt": "Don't let his big eyes, tuft of red hair and argyle sweater fool you: Tyrone is a profane, horny, violent little psycho - and funny as hell, too. He's found his match in actor Steven Boyer, who plays Tyrone, the star of Broadway's bonkers new comedy 'Hand to God,' with manic, demented intensity...But it's Boyer's virtuosic performance that defines 'Hand to God,' as he seamlessly toggles between Jason and Tyrone - and if the actor doesn't win a Tony for this, there's no justice in this world. Boyer endows a sock puppet with fabulous expressiveness. Just watch how the little fellow's arms shake with rage when he reaches out to strangle someone - it's simultaneously hilarious and scary, like the play itself.",
