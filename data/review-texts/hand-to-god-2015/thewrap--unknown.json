  "bwwExcerpt": "Since Askins possesses such a warped sense of humor, he'll probably take this as a compliment, but by far the most interesting characters in 'Hand to God' are the puppets, not the humans. Except for Timothy, they aren't that vivid, although Stiles is outrageously droll when it comes to having her hand puppet Jolene service Tyrone...'Hand to God' is a good night in the theater, but it does not offer the consistently inspired insanity of Christopher Durang's 'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike,' wherein all the characters rivet us with their individual madness. The big difference, of course, is that Durang is a veteran and Askins, at age 34, is making his Broadway debut. The theater of the absurd (or the ridiculous, the bizarre, or whatever it's being called today) is in good hands, and the mantle has been passed to very capable hands.",
