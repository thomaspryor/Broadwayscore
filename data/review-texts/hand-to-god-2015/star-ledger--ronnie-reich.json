  "bwwExcerpt": "The story of a teenager who may or may not have a possessed puppet on his arm, Robert Askins' 'Hand to God' is a rare truly communal dramatic experience, with the power to make an audience collectively shake with laughter, gasp in shock and rise to a giddy ovation...But the gleefully profane piece has already proven itself as a hit, and it lives up to its reputation...Boyer, who recently played the Fool in 'King Lear' at the Public Theater, is a virtuosic puppeteer as well as a sensitive actor. He's sympathetic as the broken, painfully shy Jason and spot-on as the tough-talking Tyrone. The wild energy and precision with which he switches between the two personalities is stunning.",
