  "bwwExcerpt": "Last spring Off-Broadway, 'Hand to God' was a wicked little church satire about a small-town Texas teen whose sock puppet is possessed by the devil. Improbably pumped up for Broadway, with a lot more yelling and joke-pounding, the offbeat reverence shrinks in charm and impact. Robert Askins' gory yet sweet-natured spoof feels more like a drawn-out sketch, and the gleeful dirty-talk gets childish when hammered by good actors encouraged to shriek. Despite the bible ripping and the 'have-a-blessed-day' pieties, however, 'Hand to God' is as much about religion as 'Avenue Q' is about Sesame Street. Both are just diving boards to bounce dangerous thoughts into safe water.",
