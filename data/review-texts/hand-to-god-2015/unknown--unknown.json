    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('stands out', 'very welcome') with praise for both entertainment value and psychological depth. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but tone is clearly appreciative and recommending. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as a standout in the Broadway season, highlighting its unique and engaging qualities. The critic's repeated viewings and deeper appreciation suggest a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive reception, describing the play as \"very welcome\" and highlighting its unique qualities. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language warrants a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise, calling the show 'very welcome' and a 'festival of filthy hilarity,' though limited context warrants low confidence.",
