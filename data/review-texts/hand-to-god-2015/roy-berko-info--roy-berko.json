  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A compelling tale of two lost people, caught up in their own lack of ability to cope with the death of a major person in their lives, who are losing their fight to chart a course of healthy reality and turn to escapism to get through the angst. The production is well conceived and performed and makes for a fascinating theatrical experience in which laughter acts as an escape from pain.\"\n\nRead more",
