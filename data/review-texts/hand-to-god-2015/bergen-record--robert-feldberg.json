  "bwwExcerpt": "If you're religious, you might see Tyrone as the Devil; if you're psychologically inclined, you'll regard him as the uncorking of Jason's repressed id, an escape hatch for sorrow and confusion. Either way, Boyer's performance - remarkable both for his acting and his dexterity - is a sight to behold. Under the direction again of Moritz von Stuelpnagel, 'Hand to God' seemed to me better than it was off-Broadway - faster, rowdier and more assured. If its message of human folly doesn't register as profoundly as playwright Askins seems to have intended, it's still a very clever, extremely entertaining show.",
