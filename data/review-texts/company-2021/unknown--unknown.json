And truth be told, I was never less than riveted — if usually in the way Bobby is, eyeballing messy marriages. Nor is the chance to hear the great score live with a 14-piece orchestra to be taken lightly; is there a more exciting opening number than the title song?\n\nSo I guess I’m sorry-grateful. Sorry for not liking this version of “Company” better — and grateful to Sondheim for providing the chance to find out.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The critic expresses mixed feelings, being 'riveted' but also 'sorry' for not liking this version better. The excerpt suggests a mix of engagement and disappointment. | Gemini: The review expresses mixed feelings, using phrases like \"sorry-grateful\" and \"never less than riveted\" while also stating a preference for other versions. The truncated nature lowers confidence. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges being 'riveted' and praises the orchestration and score, but the final verdict explicitly apologizes for not liking this production better, indicating significant reservations. The 'sorry-grateful' framing signals genuine ambivalence.",
