  "bwwExcerpt": "The modern setting and gender switches help; with a woman as Bobbie, and the sexes of several couples swapped around, the text plays out in exciting new ways. (The sequence for the instrumental 'Tick Tock,' for instance, now evokes the notion of a biological clock.) The comedy of the modernized book scenes is squeezed to the hilt by a cast that includes musical-theater überdiva Patti LuPone, harnessing her imperious earthiness to outstanding effect, and Broadway pros like Jennifer Simard-who can make any line a laugh line-Nikki Renée Daniels and the Christophers Sieber and Fitzgerald. The show's surreal aspects are realized in designer Bunny Christie's fantastical urban set: a constantly shifting wow of claustrophobic frame-lit boxes, monochromatic interiors, elevators going up and down, Alice in Wonderland-style shifts of scale.",
