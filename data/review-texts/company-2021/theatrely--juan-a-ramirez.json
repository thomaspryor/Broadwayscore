  "bwwExcerpt": "A miscast Bobbie aside, there is very little to complain about in this excellent production of one of Sondheim's most dynamic works, created at a time when the writer-composer was transitioning from the Golden Age that raised him into the postmodern theatre he helped create. The gender swap is ingeniously, thoughtfully implemented and, after a year in isolation, the story's ruminations on the necessity for aloneness, and the importance of connection hit harder than ever. I'll drink to that.",
