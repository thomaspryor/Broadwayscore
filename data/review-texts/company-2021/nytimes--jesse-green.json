Nor is the chance to hear the great score live with a 14-piece orchestra to be taken lightly; is there a more exciting opening number than the title song? So I guess I'm sorry-grateful. Sorry for not liking this version of 'Company' better - and grateful to Sondheim for providing the chance to find out.",
