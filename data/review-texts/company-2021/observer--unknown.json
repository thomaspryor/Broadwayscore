  "bwwExcerpt": "Should directors flip gender on other Sondheim classics? I don't know how much we'd gain from a Ms. Sweeney Todd or a male-model Dot. In Company, human properties of trust, love, and loneliness are transitive across male, female, straight, and gay lines. One thing I am certain of: Company is the most sophisticated fun I've had in a theater in ages. It's sexy, hilarious, and hits home in a way that's honest and shockingly resonant. Sondheim fanatics already know what a genius score it is, an explosion of wit and insight and addictive melodies. I can't wait to go again and tear up as Lenk bares her soul in 'Being Alive' or the phenomenal ensemble slays the house in the maniacal razzle-dazzle of 'Side By Side by Side.' The great man passed away two weeks ago; there is no more fitting tribute than a breakthrough work given a whole new life.",
