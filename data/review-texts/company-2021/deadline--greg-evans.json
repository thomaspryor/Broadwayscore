  "bwwExcerpt": "If there's a better, more vital way to honor the late, incomparable Stephen Sondheim than Marianne Elliott's superb production of Company, Broadway hasn't invented it. This gorgeous revival of the Sondheim-George Furth masterwork at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre, is, from across-the-board excellent performances and thoughtful revisions to the visual delight of a lovely and ingeniously clever set design, a gift both to and from the genius we lost last month.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, this contains overwhelming praise: 'superb production', 'gorgeous revival', 'masterwork', 'across-the-board excellent', calling it 'a gift'. The language is unqualified and reverential, clearly indicating a rave review. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt is filled with superlatives ('superb production', 'gorgeous revival', 'excellent performances') and praises the production as a fitting tribute to Sondheim, indicating a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses superlatives like \"superb\" and \"gorgeous\" and states that Broadway hasn't invented a better way to honor Sondheim, indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified superlative praise ('superb,' 'gorgeous,' 'masterwork') and explicitly positions the production as the definitive way to honor Sondheim, warranting a Rave classification. However, confidence is low as this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's nuance.",
