  "bwwExcerpt": "Which brings us to LuPone. Her visceral, showstopping, rendition of 'The Ladies Who Lunch,' performed as her character, Joanne, sits perched in a grinding nightclub, is simply extraordinary, filled with angst, hope, cynicism, possibility, vulnerability and all of the qualities you typically and traditionally look for in 'Company.' Unlike Lenk, who is perfectly charming and perfectly consistent throughout the entire production, LuPone's Joanne actually changes over the course of the number, journeying toward some kind of love (or at least human communion) as people typically do in musicals.",
