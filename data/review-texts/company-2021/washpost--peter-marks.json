  "bwwExcerpt": "The highs are so high in director Marianne Elliott's gender-reversed 'Company' that a Sondheim freak like me can live with aspects that don't quite hit those lofty heights. We'll get to those, but first, let's dwell for a spell on the joys of a Broadway revival that had its official opening Thursday at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre - pleasures that make this production a moving, and deeply funny, living memorial to the late Stephen Sondheim.",
