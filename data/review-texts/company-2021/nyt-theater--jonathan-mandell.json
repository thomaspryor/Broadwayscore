However, the praise is qualified, indicating a barely positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review states the revival \"works better than it should\", indicating a positive view, but the qualification \"thanks largely to Katrina Lenk's compelling performance\" suggests reservations. | Kimi: The critic offers a solid endorsement that the production exceeds expectations, though the qualification 'largely thanks to' the lead performance indicates some reservations about the show overall.",
