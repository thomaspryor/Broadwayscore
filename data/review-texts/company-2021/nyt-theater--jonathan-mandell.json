  "bwwExcerpt": "The production, an import from England directed by Marianne Elliott, cannot be called definitive. Its most attention-getting feature is the switching of the genders of several of the characters, which at its best feels like an interesting thought experiment about the difference in our attitudes towards men and women. Even when the gender switching feels less than completely thought out, the musical proves to be sturdy enough to allow for such noodling around without undermining the essence of the show. It helps that this 'Company' also showcases a company of some of the finest actors on Broadway, and several must-see performances - Patti LuPone, yes of course, but also Christopher Fitzgerald and Matt Doyle.",

However, the praise is qualified, indicating a barely positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review states the revival \"works better than it should\", indicating a positive view, but the qualification \"thanks largely to Katrina Lenk's compelling performance\" suggests reservations. | Kimi: The critic offers a solid endorsement that the production exceeds expectations, though the qualification 'largely thanks to' the lead performance indicates some reservations about the show overall.",
