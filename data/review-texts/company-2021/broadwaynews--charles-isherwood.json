  "bwwExcerpt": "The production, directed by Marianne Elliott - or rather thoroughly reimagined by Marianne Elliott - scrubs away the date-stamps on this 1970 musical, with a book by George Furth, so thoroughly that the show seems as if it was written yesterday. While maintaining the original's eternally relevant themes, of emotional uncertainty and the risks and rewards of the married state, the production refreshes them for a new century and a society that has changed radically in the past 50 years.",
