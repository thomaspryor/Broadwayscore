  "bwwExcerpt": "The lighting gave the show an extra layer of depth. It added an extra touch of magic, making the junkyard of the Jellicle Cats look like a fantasy wonderland. The lights themselves were a show, but they worked in perfect unison with the movement of the dancers and with the emotions of each scene. I'm sure the woman with the binoculars sitting three rows in front of me would agree when I say that \"CATS\" has amazing choreography, magical lighting, powerful voices, and goosebump performances, provi",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for multiple production elements (choreography, lighting, voices, performances) with enthusiastic language like 'amazing', 'magical', and 'goosebump'. However, confidence is low due to truncated text - the sentence cuts off mid-word and full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for multiple elements of the production, including lighting, choreography, and performances, suggesting an enthusiastic recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the choreography, lighting, voices, and performances. Given the single excerpt and truncated nature, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's technical and performance elements, describing 'goosebump performances' and 'magical lighting,' though the limited excerpt availability warrants caution.",
