    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lighting design calling it 'exquisite' and 'visual knockout' suggests positive reception, but with only one excerpt available and text cut off mid-sentence, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the lighting as 'exquisite' and describes the ending as a 'visual knockout,' suggesting a positive impression. However, the focus on lighting implies reservations about other aspects, and the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the positive aspects of the lighting and the visual impact of the ending. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt provides strong praise for lighting and staging (\"exquisite\", \"visual knockout\"), placing it in the upper Positive range per scoring instructions, though confidence is low due to limited context.",
