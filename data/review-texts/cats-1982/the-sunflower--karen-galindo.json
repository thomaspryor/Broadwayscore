    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows strong praise for lighting design ('extra layer of depth', 'magic', 'perfect unison'). However, this is only one technical element and may be cherry-picked, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the lighting and its integration with the performance, describing it as magical and transformative. Given the single excerpt warning, the review is likely positive, but the confidence is low due to the limited context. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the lighting design, indicating a positive aspect of the show. Given the limited text, a score in the lower-middle range of the 'Positive' bucket is appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lighting and staging, describing them as 'magic' and working in 'perfect unison' with the performances. While clearly positive, the single-curated-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
