Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a positive turnaround from the critic's previous experience, praising the score, choreography, and entertainment value. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic admits to disliking the original but enjoyed this production, praising the score, choreography, and cast. The phrase \"pleasing entertainment\" indicates a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: The critic, who disliked the original production, praises this revival for its score, choreography, and committed cast, calling it a 'pleasing entertainment' that 'doesn't deserve a spaying'—a clear recommendation despite the limited excerpt available.",
