  "showScoreExcerpt": "“There’s no disputing Andrew Lloyd Webber knows how to write popular melodies that stick to your brain...I can tell you that the dancing is dazzling...I’m glad to tell you that this revival isn’t a tired re-run. It’s as fresh and lively as if it had been newly created. The lyrics are charming, and it doesn’t require much thought to enjoy them as a musical stage presentation. Overall, ‘Cats’ is a lighthearted, entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. Sometimes that’s all you want.”\n\nRead more",
