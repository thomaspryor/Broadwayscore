  "bwwExcerpt": "The blend of design and the performances changed my mind about Cats. It's aged well, and this tour is vibrant on every level. Director Trevor Nunn has tweaked the show, all for the best. Cats runs through Sunday, February 3. For those who have never seen a stage version, a visit to The Bushnell will give you the opportunity to understand why Cats is landmark. For those on a repeat visit, let the memory live again.",
