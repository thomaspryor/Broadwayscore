  "fullText": "It was no mild threat when the original poster for Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Cats” warned that the musical is “now and forever.”\n\nIt’s baaaack, and the new incarnation proves only one thing: gay and trans people of color have just as bad taste in show tunes as all the white people who turned the original “Cats” into one of the longest running shows in Broadway history.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Pan | Claude: The review is a complete dismissal that mocks the show's existence and questions the taste of its audience. The critic presents the revival as proof of bad taste rather than offering any theatrical merits. | GPT-4o: The review is strongly negative, mocking the show's appeal and suggesting poor taste in its audience. There are no redeeming qualities mentioned. | Gemini: The review is clearly negative, mocking the show's appeal and suggesting it has bad taste. It does not recommend seeing it. | Kimi: The review delivers a concise, sarcastic dismissal of the revival, equating the show with 'bad taste' and offering no redeeming artistic qualities. The extremely brief length suggests this may be an excerpt or truncated text.",
