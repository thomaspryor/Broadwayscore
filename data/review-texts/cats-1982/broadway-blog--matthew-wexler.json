    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed elements - praise for choreography and 'stellar ensemble' but criticism of lead performer and uncertainty about longevity. Overall tone leans positive but qualified. | GPT-4o: The review praises the choreography and ensemble but criticizes Leona Lewis' performance. The excerpt suggests a mixed reception with both positive and negative elements, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the choreography but criticizes Leona Lewis' performance. The overall tone is mixed, and the excerpt ends with uncertainty about the show's staying power. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows strong praise for the reimagined choreography ('brilliantly') and ensemble ('stellar'), but significant criticism of Leona Lewis as a 'weak link' and uncertain conclusion about staying power. Scored conservatively at the lower end of Positive due to single-excerpt warning. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
