    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Single excerpt shows harsh criticism calling the revival 'lifeless' and questioning the source material's quality. However, confidence is low due to limited text - the full review context could modify this assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is strongly negative, describing the revival as 'lifeless' and questioning the original show's quality. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses a negative sentiment, describing the revival as \"lifeless\" and questioning the show's original quality. This suggests a negative review. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers a damning assessment of the production as 'lifeless' and questions the fundamental quality of the source material, indicating a strong negative verdict. As a single curated excerpt, the confidence is reduced, but the language clearly falls in the negative range.",
