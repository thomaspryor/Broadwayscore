Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: While acknowledging the visual appeal ('handsome'), the critic delivers a fundamentally negative verdict citing 'dramatically inert' direction, a 'creaky' book, and poorly integrated songs that 'stop the action cold.' Confidence is low due to single-excerpt limitation.",
