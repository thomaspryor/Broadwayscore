  "fullText": "Merlyn and his magic tricks aren’t the only things that Aaron Sorkin cuts in his revival of Alan Jay Lerner’s book for the 1960 musical “Camelot.” Gone, too, is almost any sense of romance. This new incarnation of the classic but problematic tuner by Lerner and Frederick Loewe opened Thursday at LCT’s Vivian Beaumont Theater.",
