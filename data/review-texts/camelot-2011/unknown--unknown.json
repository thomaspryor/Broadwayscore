    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed evaluation - acknowledges craft ('clever', 'profoundly polished') but criticizes the mismatch between style and ambition, reducing sophisticated music to 'charming tea party tunes'. Low confidence due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a clash between the dialogue style and the show's ambition, suggesting a mixed reception. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt points out a clash between the dialogue/lyrics and the ambition of the show, suggesting a negative assessment. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single excerpt presents a mixed assessment, praising Loewe's music as 'profoundly polished' but criticizing Lerner's lyrics as 'show-off' and noting a fundamental 'clash' between the lightweight style and the show's ambition. With only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low.",
