    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Balanced critique praising music and performances but finding the overall production 'detached and uninvolving.' The 'but' structure indicates significant reservation that undermines the positive elements. Single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the music and some performances but criticizes the production as 'detached and uninvolving.' The lack of engagement suggests a mixed verdict. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review mentions both positive aspects (glorious music, strong performances) and negative aspects (detached and uninvolving production), indicating a mixed reception. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises specific elements (music, performances) but criticizes the overall production as emotionally disengaged, suggesting the show has merits but fails to cohere into a compelling theatrical experience.",
