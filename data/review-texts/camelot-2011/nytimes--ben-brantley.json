    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges positive qualities ('handsome, well-intentioned') but ultimately finds it lacking in the passion and enchantment that would make it recommendable. 'Dutiful' suggests competent but uninspiring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a production that is visually appealing and well-meaning but lacks the magic to truly captivate audiences. The tone is balanced, neither strongly recommending nor discouraging attendance, which fits the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review describes the production as \"handsome\" and \"well-intentioned\" but lacking passion and enchantment, suggesting a mixed or lukewarm reception. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the production is well-intentioned and handsome but finds it emotionally hollow, noting it fails to inspire passion and feels dutiful rather than magical.",
