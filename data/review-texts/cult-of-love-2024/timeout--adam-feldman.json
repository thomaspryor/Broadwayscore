However, with only one excerpt, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the actors and their seamless blending, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt and lack of overall context, the confidence is low, but the positive sentiment warrants a score on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt provides unambiguous praise for the cast's performances and chemistry. Following guidance for clearly positive excerpts, scoring at upper end of Positive bucket, though confidence is low due to limited context.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Larger themes notwithstanding, Cult of Love is mostly concerned with exploring just such complicated smallness. With an analytic precision that is tempered by sympathy and humor, Headland expertly renders the shifting dynamics and allegiances within the family and the couples: the gang-ups and ambushes, the protective measures and defensive thrusts. And Trip Cullman’s Second Stage production captures that complexity beautifully. It’s there in every inch of John Lee Beatty’s detailed farmhouse set and in Sophia Choi’s perfectly chosen costumes, and especially in the first-rate work of the large cast. Whether singing or sniping or merely stewing, these ten actors don’t hit a false note, and they blend together seamlessly. It's ensemble acting at a shared high level. They do themselves proud.",
