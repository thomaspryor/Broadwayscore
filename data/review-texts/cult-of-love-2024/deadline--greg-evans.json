Its that kind of play.\n\nA Second Stage Theater production steered like a fast-moving sleigh by director Trip Cullman, Cult Of Love boasts an excellent cast (headed by Zachary Quinto, Mare Winningham, David Rasche and, in an impressive Broadway debut, Star Wars: The Acolytes Rebecca Henderson) that pulls off a familiar scenario with unexpected freshness.\n\nThe place is a beautiful Connecticut farmhouse decorated to a Christmas fare-thee-well (John Lee Beatty designed the gorgeous set, with Heather Gilbert contributing the festive lighting), the time is Christmas Eve and the Dahl family is of the variety that comes together grudgingly and toting more animosity than gifts.\n\n1/1\n\nSkip Ad\n \nContinue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nPart of a series of Headland plays devoted to the seven deadly sins, Cult Of Love gets the honor of pridefulness, and that particular transgression makes itself known in every deliciously holier-than-thou attitude each member of this raised-Christian family brings to the party.\n\nFor starters, theres mom Ginny (Winningham) and dad Bill (Rasche), who have raised their four kids in a strict, socially isolated suburban Christian home. Bill is the more easygoing of the two, to the point of being detached (and, it is suspected, experiencing early signs of dementia). Ginny is controlling, demanding of surface perfection and not-so-subtly judgmental (think Mary Tyler Moore in Ordinary People via August: Osage County.)\n\nAnd Ginny has lots to hang her judgements on. Eldest son Mark (Quinto) has been a black sheep ever since ditching plans of the priesthood for law school (and atheism). Hes married to Rachel (Molly Bernard), formerly of the Jewish faith, now converted to Christianity but no more a true believer than her husband. Her go-along-to-get-along demeanor has settled into a boiling resentment at the familys barely disguised anti-semitism.\n\nNext up is Evie (Henderson) and her (secretly) pregnant wife Pippa (Roberta Colindrez). Mom Ginny chooses to believe that Evie isnt really gay, despite all evidence to the contrary, but the overt homophobia is left to youngest Dahl daughter Diana (Shailene Woodley) and her preacher husband James (Christopher Lowell), neither of whom can resist talk of hellfire and damnation couched in loving concern.\n\nFinally, theres the late-to-the-party Johnny (Christopher Sears), a free-spirited recovering heroin addict who brings along his fellow 12-stepper Loren (Barbie Ferreira), the outsider and truth-teller whose appalled at the hateful religious vitriol spewed by Diana.\n\nIndeed, the tongues-speaking, self-proclaimed prophet Diana is the primary pot-stirrer of the family, even as it becomes all too clear that her religiosity masks some serious (though, in the writing, not altogether convincing) psychosis.\n\nHeadland, the Russian Doll co-creator and Star Wars: The Acolyte creator making her Broadway debut with Cult Of Love, is adept at keeping the dialogue crisp, funny and fast-moving, even if the pile-up of personalities, crises, conflicts and very hard feelings grows schematic and a bit predictable. While Cult Of Love lacks the awesome power of, say, last seasons family reunion drama Appropriate, it certainly has the strength of its convictions (and occasional compassions), and maintains our interest from start to finish.\n\nOnly in the well-performed musical interludes this is a family that never met an instrument it couldnt strum or drum does Cult Of Love feel in need of some editing. The familys Christmas carol harmonizing makes for a lovely metaphor for the familial perfection so desired by mom and dad (and the inclusion of songs by Fleet Foxes and Sufjan Stevens is a nice touch) but the grudging participation by some of the clan might reflect some impatience among at least part of the audience. As captivating as Cult Of Love can be, it can also feel as insistent as a picture-perfect mother.\n\nTitle: Cult Of LoveVenue: Broadways Helen Hayes TheaterWritten By: Leslye HeadlandDirected By: Trip CullmanCast: Molly Bernard, Roberta Colindrez, Barbie Ferreira, Rebecca Henderson, Christopher Lowell, Zachary Quinto, David Rasche, Christopher Sears, Mare Winningham, Shailene WoodleyRunning time: 1 hr 45 min (no intermission)\n\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\n\nDeadline is a part of Penske Media Corporation. � 2026 Deadline Hollywood, LLC.",
