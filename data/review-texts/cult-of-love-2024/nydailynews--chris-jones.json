  "bwwExcerpt": "That’s in play here, too, and there are times in Trip Cullman’s very present and very savvy production when it feels like you are actually watching a Judeo-Christian Christmas ghost story with the Baby Jesus or an Old Testament prophet about to make an appearance, or at least some Ghost of Christmas Past showing up with sawdust to sprinkle to promote the belated acceptance of personal difference. The play actually discusses Christianity quite specifically and in a very nuanced way. That’s unusual in Broadway satires, and the play is all the better for having the guts to do so.",
