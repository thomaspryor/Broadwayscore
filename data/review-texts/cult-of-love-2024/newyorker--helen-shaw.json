    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a critique of the narrative being overloaded, which implies a mixed reception. However, due to the limited information, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a mixed review. The phrase \"overload the table with narrative\" indicates a potential flaw, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the overall sentiment. I'm placing it in the Mixed category with low confidence due to the limited information. | Kimi: The single excerpt provides a specific criticism about excessive narrative density, suggesting the production suffers from uneven pacing or overstuffing. Without additional context to indicate broader praise or condemnation, this qualifies as Mixed.",
