Despite being an excerpt, the language ('delightfully messy', 'I'm convinced it's here') shows enthusiasm and endorsement. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt describes the show as 'delightfully messy' and gives it a B+ grade, indicating a positive recommendation with enthusiasm. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic gives the show a B+ grade and calls it a \"delightfully messy family holiday,\" indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The B+ grade and phrase 'delightfully messy' indicate a solid, upbeat recommendation that appreciates the show's chaotic charm, placing it in the strong-positive range.",
