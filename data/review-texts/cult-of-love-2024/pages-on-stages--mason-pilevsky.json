    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a complex emotional experience without clear positive or negative evaluation. The lack of a definitive recommendation or critique leads to a mixed classification. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt and lack of full context. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a positive emotional connection with the show, but the lack of context and potential for cherry-picking lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates the production created a powerful emotional connection and immersive experience for the audience, suggesting a clearly positive response, though the single curated quote warrants caution.",
