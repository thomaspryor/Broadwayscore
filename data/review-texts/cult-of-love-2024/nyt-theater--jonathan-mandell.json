    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a shift in formula but does not clearly indicate a positive or negative recommendation. With only one excerpt and no clear verdict, the review is classified as mixed with low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a subversion of expectations, which is neither explicitly positive nor negative. It implies a change in genre, which could be seen as a mixed bag depending on audience preferences. | Kimi: Single truncated excerpt suggests the show merely swaps one formulaic structure for another rather than offering genuine innovation. The tone is observational rather than enthusiastic, and the use of 'formula' twice implies unoriginality, but without the full review context, the overall verdict remains unclear.",
