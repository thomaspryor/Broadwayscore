    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a shift in formula but does not clearly indicate a positive or negative recommendation. With only one excerpt and no clear verdict, the review is classified as mixed with low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a subversion of expectations, which is neither explicitly positive nor negative. It implies a change in genre, which could be seen as a mixed bag depending on audience preferences. | Kimi: Single truncated excerpt suggests the show merely swaps one formulaic structure for another rather than offering genuine innovation. The tone is observational rather than enthusiastic, and the use of 'formula' twice implies unoriginality, but without the full review context, the overall verdict remains unclear.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "There is no such clear resolution in “Cult of Love,” and no unambiguous message, although Mark gets a near-sermon towards the end that spells out a possible point to the play. If anything, despite the Christmas carols sung from beginning to end, the playwright seems intent on subverting the formula of the Christmas story. But she replaces it with another formula, that of the dysfunctional family drama. This genre at its best can generate shattering moments and fresh insights, and I kept on expecting “Cult of Love” to deliver them. This is thanks to the one undeniable strength of the production: the fine ensemble acting of the cast, six of whose ten members are making their Broadway debuts.",
