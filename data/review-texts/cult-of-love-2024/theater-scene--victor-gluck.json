    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'searing,' which suggests intensity and engagement, but lacks detailed evaluative language. Given the single excerpt and potential cherry-picking, a cautious low-end Positive score is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the play as a \"searing comedy-drama,\" which suggests a positive, though possibly intense, experience. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The single available excerpt employs the strongly positive descriptor 'searing,' indicating a clear recommendation, though confidence is reduced to 'low' per instructions for single-excerpt evaluations.",
