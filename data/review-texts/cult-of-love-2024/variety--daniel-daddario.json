  "bwwExcerpt": "The play then moves into a protracted endgame; at 100 minutes without an intermission, “Cult of Love” feels, for lack of a better word, long. Part of it, yes, is that, for a while, the escalating revelations about the family dynamics come to make us feel pleasurably trapped. But once the drama comes to a head, there is a long journey toward Christmas morning, one in which serial one-on-one conversations come to feel, eventually, like what had been a sure-footed piece of writing is suddenly dithering toward meaning in the midst of human messiness.",
