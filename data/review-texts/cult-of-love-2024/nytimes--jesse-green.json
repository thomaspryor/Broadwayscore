    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Pan) - using median score | Claude: Clear negative assessment with harsh descriptors ('marathon of misery', 'overwrought and undercooked') from Jesse Green, indicating the critic does not recommend the show. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong negative language ('marathon of misery', 'overwrought and undercooked') indicating a strongly negative assessment with no redeeming qualities mentioned. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the play is a 'marathon of misery' and both 'overwrought and undercooked,' indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic describes the production as torturous to sit through ('marathon of misery') and fundamentally flawed in execution ('both overwrought and undercooked'), indicating a strong rejection. Confidence is low due to the brevity of the provided text. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Pan",
