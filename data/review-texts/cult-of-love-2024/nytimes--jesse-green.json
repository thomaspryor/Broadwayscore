  "fullText": "Though figgy pudding is on the menu, Evie Dahl has a different Yuletide horror in mind. “Christmas is exactly the time to talk about the things we never talk about,” she tells her reluctant siblings.\n\nAlas, despite the happy presence of stars including Zachary Quinto, Shailene Woodley and Mare Winningham, the annual ritual dinner of the Dahls is doomed from the start of Leslye Headland’s “Cult of Love,” a rip-roaring home-for-the-holidays dramedy that opened on Thursday at the Helen Hayes Theater. What begins as a cheery reunion in a New England farmhouse decked out like Santa’s workshop ends as a collective meltdown with carols.\n\nBecause Evie, even if she’s bossy, is right. The four Dahl children, now in their late 20s through early 40s, have plenty of grudges that urgently need airing. But how? Ginny, their passive-aggressive control freak of a mother, will not admit into her home any problems, doubts or identities that violate her sense of upbeat Christian propriety. So what if her husband, Bill, is hovering on the edge of the abyss of Alzheimer’s? Ignore it, excuse it; it will go away.\n\nThe same applies to the couple’s firstborn, Mark, a divinity student turned lawyer who has lost his faith in both callings. (When he says he’s no longer a Christian, Ginny responds, “That’s not true.”) Evie, their second, a chef, is a lesbian. (“Or not,” Ginny adds.) Johnny, their third, of no known profession, is a recovering drug addict. (“If you all say so,” Ginny allows.) And Diana, the youngest? She’s either a Christmas miracle, complete with baby on board, or just psychotic, espying the devil and speaking in tongues.\n\nIf that setup doesn’t exactly sound funny, there’s a reason. Though “Cult of Love,” like many unhappy family reunion plays, draws big buckets of humor from the toxic brew of religion and repression, those buckets also draw blood.\n\nHeadland knows just how to get there, suggesting deep familiarity with the territory. But she also has a gift for complication and construction, as was already evident in “Bachelorette,” her Bridezillas Gone Wild breakthrough play of 2010. (That play, like this one, was a Second Stage Theater production, and later became a movie.) Loading pattern on pattern — a holiday-season design don’t for most — is for her an opportunity to dizzy us down to hell.\n\n“Cult of Love” offers carols and Christmas-adjacent folk songs to relieve the pressure of the plot while subtly exploring its themes, our critic writes.Credit...Sara Krulwich/The New York TimesHell is famously other people, and they are prominent here. Perhaps a tad too neatly, the Dahl siblings are accompanied by outliers to serve as witnesses, resisters and accelerants. Mark’s semi-estranged wife, Rachel, is furious by the first drink and ready to leave by the fourth. Diana’s husband, James, is an unchurched priest who preaches love and practices intolerance. Evie’s wife, Pippa, newer to the family, is more astounded than appalled by the ambient homophobia. And Johnny, as wiggly as a worm caught on a hook, has brought Loren, a friend from recovery who seems saner than everyone else.\n\nThey are all at war, in every possible permutation, but Headland and her director, Trip Cullman, make sure we have no trouble mapping the minefield. All 10 characters are immediately distinct, perhaps overly so, especially at the start when we feel the shove of a shoehorn inserting back story into the plot. Still, if “Cult of Love” sometimes has the texture of television — Headland was a creator of the Netflix series “Russian Doll” — that’s no insult these days, and Cullman consistently keeps the story stage-worthy through expert pacing and movement.\n\nAnd music. From its charming first moment to its killer last, and at many points in between, “Cult of Love” offers carols (“When Joseph Was an Old Man”) and Christmas-adjacent folk songs (“Oh Shenandoah”) to relieve the pressure of the plot while subtly exploring its themes. Everyone sings, reluctantly or not, and surprise instruments pop up everywhere: Is that a melodeon on the window seat? In any case, under Jacinth Greywoode’s superb music supervision, the bond that glues even the most shattered families, a factor often missing from reunion plays, is convincingly dramatized in beautiful harmony.\n\nFrom left, Barbie Ferreira, David Rasche, Mare Winningham, Quinto, Henderson and Woodley in the Second Stage Theater production.Credit...Sara Krulwich/The New York TimesBut so is the false promise of that harmony. Troublingly, none of the siblings can do anything more with their grudges than hold them. Singing together is an emblem of belief in invisible things they would probably be better off disbelieving. By the end of the play, Headland seems to be asking us whether any faith is worth having, if only because losing it is so heartbreaking. She calls it, or perhaps she means family, a “cult” for a reason.\n\nThat parents burden their children with what they advertise as blessings is the play’s slipperiest mystery. You catch its tail in the way David Rasche, as Bill, performs the forgetfulness of dementia as a kind of liberation. You catch it more fully in the way Winningham’s subtly riveting Ginny legislates reality and, when she can’t, kills it with a pocket veto. Also useful to Ginny is alcohol, a vice she celebrates instead of criticizes because it is her own. As a second course to the pre-dinner wine, she emerges from the kitchen triumphant with a punch bowl of Manhattans.\n\nThe rest of the cast is excellent too, in both the showier roles — Quinto as Mark, plunged into despair; Woodley as Diana, devolving into derangement — and the quieter ones. (As Pippa, Roberta Colindrez offers a marvelously tart contrast to the family’s figgy pudding stickiness.) The technical elements are top-notch, intensifying naturalism until it grazes the surreal. (Set by John Lee Beatty, costumes by Sophia Choi, lighting by Heather Gilbert, sound by Darron L West.)\n\nBut like Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s “Appropriate,” which was last Christmas’s gift from Second Stage and likewise appeared at the Hayes, “Cult of Love” is so strong because it is built from grievance up. It is also the last of Headland’s Seven Deadly Plays series, the first of which, “Bachelorette,” was naturally about gluttony. This one, since faith is not traditionally considered a sin, is assigned pride as its problem, a pairing I find useful to contemplate. Ginny is proud of the way she has raised her family, no matter that they are all wrecks now. Bill, admitting to his own traumatic past, believes he is stronger than what has happened to him because he has love — and “love will right all wrongs.”\n\nMaybe so. Still, Headland leaves you, wrung out with laughter and horror, wondering: Should it? Should it have to?\n\nCult of LoveThrough Feb. 2 at the Helen Hayes Theater, Manhattan; 2st.com.
