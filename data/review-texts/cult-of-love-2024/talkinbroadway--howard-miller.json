However, with only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment of the review is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The single excerpt praises a performance, suggesting a positive but limited view. Given the limited text, a score in the lower-middle of the positive range seems appropriate. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains clearly positive evaluative language ('incomparable', 'real standout') regarding the lead performance, indicating a positive reception, though the limited context warrants low confidence.",
