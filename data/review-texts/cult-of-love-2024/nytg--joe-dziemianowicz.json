    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise ('nearly makes for a happy ending') suggesting the show has positive elements but falls short of full satisfaction. The word 'nearly' indicates it doesn't quite achieve what it's reaching for. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed sentiment with 'nearly makes for a happy ending,' indicating some positive elements but not a strong recommendation. Given the limited context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a mixed reaction, with a positive element ('harmonious quartet') but not a fully positive conclusion ('nearly makes for a happy ending'). | Kimi: Single excerpt offers qualified praise for the show's finale; 'harmonious' and 'happy ending' indicate mild approval, while 'nearly' suggests reservations. Scored at lower end of Positive range per instructions for mildly positive isolated excerpts.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Known for the play-turned-movie Bachelorette and the TV series Russian Doll, Headland can take pride in her smarts, sensitivity, and sharp wit. But she juggles too many hot topics – love, religion, homophobia, sibling rivalry, aging parents, mental illness, addiction, dementia, and denial — without tying up the threads. Director Trip Cullman’s fine-tuned ensemble and the ear-tickling musical interludes are saving graces. A last-minute harmonious quartet nearly makes for a happy ending. Only almost, mind you. But it’s quite the theatrical Hail Mary.",
