However, 'lightweight' suggests minor reservations, placing it in solid positive range rather than rave territory. | GPT-4o: The review praises the performances and describes the play as 'charming,' indicating a positive recommendation despite acknowledging it as 'lightweight.' | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"delightful\" and \"charming,\" indicating a recommendation, although it also notes the play is \"lightweight,\" suggesting some reservations. | Kimi: The critic offers warm praise for the performances ('delightful') and finds the play 'charming,' with only minor reservation about it being 'lightweight.' The tone is clearly recommendatory.",
