    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls the play 'timeless' which is clear praise, but this appears to be just an excerpt or opening line rather than a full review, limiting confidence in the overall assessment. | Gemini: The review states the play is \"timeless\" which indicates a positive recommendation. The lack of further detail suggests a slightly reserved positive. | Kimi: The critic offers unqualified praise by declaring the play 'timeless,' suggesting the revival successfully demonstrates the work's enduring quality and relevance, though the extreme brevity of the excerpt limits assessment of enthusiasm level.",
