  "bwwExcerpt": "When Ashford enters the elegant Manhattan apartment of Broderick's Greg and his English teacher wife Kate (a miscast Julie White), it's impossible not to be charmed by the anthropomorphized pooch. She bounds around and over furniture, gamboling with uncontainable delight in her new home, sniffing every inch of the place and dragging her butt across the carpet while panting with the urgency of finding adequate ways to express her unquestioning adoration. The writing, direction and performance could only have come from years of doggy devotion...But once the rambunctious dog impersonation has worked its initial magic, it soon becomes apparent that the play is a very shallow bowl of kibble.",

However, the term 'trifle' suggests some reservations, resulting in a mid-range Positive score. | Gemini: The review calls the play a \"charming trifle\" and praises the performances, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic dismisses the material as a 'charming trifle,' the praise for 'terrific performances' that successfully mine both comedy and genuine emotion indicates a solid recommendation based on execution.",
