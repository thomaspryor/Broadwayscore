Gurney’s comedy, on Broadway at the Cort Theater.\n\nA new revival of “Sylvia,” A. R. Gurney’s dark drama about a psychopath with tendencies toward bestiality, opened at the Cort Theater on Broadway Tuesday night, with Matthew Broderick playing the nut job, Greg, and Annaleigh Ashford as the title character, a pert little mutt who becomes the object of his obsessive devotion.\n\nWait, what’s that? You heard it was a comedy?\n\nTechnically, I suppose it is, as the jolly laughter of those around me attested. Maybe, as a cat person — moreover, one who finds having to watch people pick up dog feces on a daily basis one of the more distasteful (albeit necessary) aspects of city living — I am a touch biased.\n\nBut in my defense, I will cite the views of Greg’s wife, Kate, played by Julie White, who begins to fear for his sanity when he comes home from Central Park one day with a stray and as the days go by proceeds to shower more affection on the dog than he does on Kate. She implores him to see a therapist, and eventually he accedes to her request. Once in the office he proceeds to rhapsodize about Sylvia’s “great little butt.”\n\nThe much-maddened therapist’s ultimate advice to Kate: Get a divorce, then shoot the dog. (Fear not, dog devotees: This does not come to pass.)\n\nThe gimmick of “Sylvia,” which is indeed a comedy — albeit a trifling one — resides in the casting of an actor as Sylvia. (Sort of fun fact: Sarah Jessica Parker, Mr. Broderick’s wife, played the role in the original 1995 Off Broadway production.) Ms. Ashford, fresh from her Tony win for “You Can’t Take It With You,” makes for an exceptionally comely and understandably appealing pet, with her long blond locks and winsome way of slinking onto the furniture she’s supposed to steer clear of.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",

While Ashford's performance is praised, the overall assessment is lukewarm. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges audience laughter but calls the comedy 'trifling' and a 'gimmick,' while praising Annaleigh Ashford's performance.
