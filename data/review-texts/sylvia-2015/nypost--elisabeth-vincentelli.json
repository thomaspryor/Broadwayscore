  "bwwExcerpt": "You've got to hand it to Matthew Broderick: He's a reliable actor. You can always count on him being either wooden or downright lifeless. When his performance is merely serviceable -- as it is in the new Broadway revival of \"Sylvia\" -- it counts as a triumph. Of course it helps that the show pairs him with the inimitable Annaleigh Ashford, who gives a wonderfully zany performance as the titular dog...Ashford makes whomever she's performing with look good.",
