  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"How can anyone not fall in love with Sylvia? Especially as portrayed by Annaleigh Ashford who is well on her way to fetching another Tony for her full immersion in doggy behavior and brilliant comedic timing…'Sylvia' is extremely funny…Daniel Sullivan has directed with a steady leash…As they say 'Every dog has its day' and Sylvia is the mutt of the moment. Highly recommended.\"\n\nRead more",
