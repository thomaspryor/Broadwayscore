  "bwwExcerpt": "\"The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess,\" which trims the show's length to two and a half hours and adds new dialogue by avant-garde playwright Suzan Lori-Parks, both preserves the integrity of the original piece and makes for absolutely thrilling musical theater. It is directed by Diane Paulus, who staged the recent \"Hair\" revival.",
