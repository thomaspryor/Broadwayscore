  "bwwExcerpt": "It ought to be good news that \"Porgy and Bess\" is back on Broadway for the first time in 35 years. Sad to say, the new version, which is billed by express order of the Gershwin brothers' estates as \"The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess,\" is a sanitized, heavily cut rewrite that strips away the show's essence so as to render it suitable for consumption by 21st-century prigs. If you've never seen or heard \"Porgy,\" you might well find this version blandly pleasing. Otherwise, you'll be appalled.",
