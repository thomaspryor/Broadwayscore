  "fullText": "The newest play from August: Osage County Tony and Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts, The Minutes lasts only 90. And in that hour and a half, it tackles local politics, revisionist history, and quite possibly murder.\n\nBut first, the men of the Big Cherry city council—Mr. Blake (K. Todd Freeman) and Mr. Hanratty (Danny McCarthy, recently seen as Bridget Everett’s shifty brother-in-law on HBO’s Somebody Somewhere), to be specific—must debate the words impaired versus disabled versus handicapped. Then they need to discuss the meaning of semantics versus nomenclature.\n\nThe 39-year council veteran, Mr. Oldfield—played by actor, director, and ever-so-sly scene stealer Austin Pendleton—announces that he’d like to talk about parking. Wait! Everyone needs to weigh in on whether or not this actually qualifies as an announcement. “Announcing what you’d like to talk about is not an announcement, any more than announcing that you’re going to the bathroom,” Mayor Superba (played by Letts), uh, announces.\n\nThen Ms. Innes (Blair Brown) wants to read a statement, essentially a rah-rah declaration of support for the annual Big Cherry Heritage Festival. (Don’t miss this almost throwaway line: “Sure, over the years, we’ve had our dust-ups and differences, tete-a-tetes over policy, clashes of personalities, to say nothing of a certain rape and subsequent abortion, but that’s all water under the bridge.”)\n\nSmall minds continue to clash over assorted small-town issues: Hanratty is proposing an accessible redesign of the city’s central fountain. Sniffs Mr. Breeding (Cliff Chamberlain): “I don’t know that normal people should have to suffer an onerous tax burden just so your sister can wheel up to a fountain.” Unfortunately, the project’s only other supporter is newcomer Mr. Peel (Schitt’s Creek’s Noah Reid). Far more popular—believe it or not—is Blake’s “Lincoln Smackdown” idea, which involves a cage match between a challenger and a mixed martial artist dressed as the 16th president. Gushes Innes: “I love Abraham Lincoln. And violence.”\n\nThe Minutes seems to comprise nothing more than a collection of quirky characters—the heavily medicated Ms. Matz (Sally Murphy), who hand-squeezes her own grapefruit juice mid-meeting, might be the nuttiest of the mixed nuts—until Peel keeps picking at the topic of last week’s missing minutes like the proverbial scab. Then Letts spins his satire into something of a black comedy—involving Big Cherry’s lavishly embroidered origin story, which the council members reenact with great gusto—and The Minutes spins entirely out of control.\n\nUltimately, Letts is making a statement about whitewashing American history, but he hauls out an entirely new character—the heretofore absent but much-discussed Mr. Carp (Linda Vista’s Ian Barford)—to do it, yielding less a moment of enlightenment and more of a screed. As for the mystifying ritualistic ending…perhaps Oldfield says it best. “Now friends, I fully expect you’re going to throw me on the floor and kick me in the face,” he says, “but I assure you I have no idea what is happening.” The feeling, regrettably, is mutual.\n\nThe Minutes opened April 17, 2022, at Studio 54 and runs through July 24.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The 2/5 star rating indicates a negative review. The critic praises individual performances but finds the play structurally flawed, particularly criticizing the ending as 'mystifying' and expressing confusion about the overall experience. The truncation warning requires medium confidence, but the negative trajectory is clear. | GPT-4o: The review highlights confusion and dissatisfaction with the play's execution, describing it as spinning out of control and ending in a mystifying manner. The original rating of 2/5 stars supports a negative classification, but the truncated text warning suggests caution in scoring too low. | Gemini: The review is mostly negative, describing the play as comprising quirky characters and spinning out of control. The critic gives it 2/5 stars, and the text is truncated, so I'm scoring it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: Despite praising individual performances as 'first-rate' and acknowledging moments of 'great gusto,' the critic awards 2/5 stars and delivers a negative verdict criticizing the play's chaotic structure, 'mystifying' ritualistic ending, and heavy-handed delivery of its themes.",
