I won't believe it. You can't just leave your satire lying around for two years; you have to measure it down to the minute.",

In that play, the house (synecdoche for the country) has a literal Indian in the attic, and the housekeeper character Johnna only reminds and presides. But in 'The Minutes,' Letts isn’t content simply to point at history: He wants to impart its horror. This tonal shift requires a huge stylistic swing, and 'The Minutes' — so fine and deft and wicked for its first 60 minutes — can’t take it.\"\n\nRead more"
