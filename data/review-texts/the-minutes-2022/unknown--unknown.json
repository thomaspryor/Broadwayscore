  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Ultimately, I came to feel that if it is the theater’s main business to mirror who we are — to act, like the minutes of a meeting, as an absolute record of what we say and how we behave — then “The Minutes” does what a play aimed mostly at white people must. It shows us how we are starting to understand, but still mostly failing to accept, that our privileges are tied to a history of denying them to others. \"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies - this is analytical/contextual commentary about what the play accomplishes thematically rather than a clear recommendation. The phrase 'does what a play aimed mostly at white people must' suggests functional success but with significant qualification about audience limitations. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a thematic focus on societal reflection but indicates a failure to fully accept or address the issues presented. This implies a mixed reception, acknowledging the play's attempt to mirror societal issues but critiquing its effectiveness. | Gemini: The review seems to be recommending the play as a mirror to society, but the excerpt is limited and the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the play's success as a mirror of contemporary privilege, stating it achieves what such a play 'must,' indicating strong approval of its thematic execution despite the limitation of having only a single curated quote. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
