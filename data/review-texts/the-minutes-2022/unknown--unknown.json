  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Ultimately, I came to feel that if it is the theater’s main business to mirror who we are — to act, like the minutes of a meeting, as an absolute record of what we say and how we behave — then “The Minutes” does what a play aimed mostly at white people must. It shows us how we are starting to understand, but still mostly failing to accept, that our privileges are tied to a history of denying them to others. \"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt presents intellectual appreciation for the play's thematic purpose but lacks clear recommendation language. The critic acknowledges the show 'does what it must' but frames this as addressing audience limitations rather than praising theatrical achievement. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a reflective and critical view of the play's themes, acknowledging its attempt to mirror societal issues but also highlighting its shortcomings. The lack of a clear recommendation or strong praise places it in the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review suggests the play fulfills its purpose, but the limited excerpt and aggregator context make it difficult to determine the overall enthusiasm. I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic affirms the play successfully fulfills theater's duty to mirror society, praising its handling of privilege and historical accountability. The clearly appreciative tone warrants a high Positive score, though single-excerpt format limits confidence. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
