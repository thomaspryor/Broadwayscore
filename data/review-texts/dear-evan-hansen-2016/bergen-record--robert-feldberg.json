  "bwwExcerpt": "Viewing 'Dear Evan Hansen' a second time, at Broadway's Music Box Theatre, where it opened Sunday, I found I had much firmer feelings than when I first saw it. When I attended the off-Broadway production in May, it seemed a musical of many parts, some good, others shaky, and I don't think I fully digested the whole. In my repeat visit, I felt, first, that I had vastly understated Ben Platt's performance by calling it 'affecting.' He's remarkable.",
