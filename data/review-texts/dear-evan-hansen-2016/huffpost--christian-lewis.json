  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Although the show presents an ambiguously-disabled Evan Hansen, the character remains incredibly sympathetic...The score, while beautiful and full of belting and ballads, often falls flat, with all the songs sounding similar...A must-see. Go for the amazingly powerful and emotional acting performances or the beautiful ballads, stay for the poignant critique about technology and sympathy in the modern age.\"\n\nRead more",
