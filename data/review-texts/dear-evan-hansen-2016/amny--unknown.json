  "bwwExcerpt": "Benj Pasek and Justin Paul ('Dog Fight,' 'A Christmas Story'), a young and extremely promising songwriting duo, have crafted a haunting soft rock score that is neatly integrated into Steven Levenson's captivating book. Michael Greif, director of 'Rent' and 'Next to Normal,' presents a tight and compelling production built around finely-textured ensemble acting and a seamless visual design of shifting panels and floating video imagery. Platt is giving one of the most vulnerable and shaded performances you've ever seen. He is terrified, enigmatic and completely believable.",
