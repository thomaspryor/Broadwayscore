The language indicates this is a standout production deserving highest recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides high praise for both the actor and the production, describing it as a 'gorgeous heartbreaker' with 'emotional potency'. The direction and performances are highlighted as superb and refined, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising Ben Platt's performance, the musical's emotional potency, and Michael Greif's direction. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it high in the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains rave-level praise for the lead performance and direction, describing the show as a 'gorgeous heartbreaker,' but is scored conservatively at the upper end of the Positive bucket per single-excerpt guidelines. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
