  "bwwExcerpt": "How thrilling it is that Broadway, a place largely turned into a destination to make money not art, is still capable of producing shows that are genuinely bold, daring and confrontational. With Hamilton and the recent arrival of Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812, there's plenty to challenge and provoke already. Dear Evan Hansen adds to New York's impressive musical slate.",
