  "bwwExcerpt": "How thrilling it is that Broadway, a place largely turned into a destination to make money not art, is still capable of producing shows that are genuinely bold, daring and confrontational. With Hamilton and the recent arrival of Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812, there's plenty to challenge and provoke already. Dear Evan Hansen adds to New York's impressive musical slate.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear positive assessment, grouping the show with acclaimed Broadway successes like Hamilton and Great Comet as 'bold, daring and confrontational.' However, confidence is low due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as part of an 'impressive musical slate' and describes it as 'bold, daring and confrontational', indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses excitement and praises the show for being bold and daring, adding to New York's impressive musical slate. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with a higher score due to the enthusiastic tone. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise, calling the show 'genuinely bold, daring and confrontational' and comparing it favorably to Hamilton. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning that the quote may not represent the full verdict.",
