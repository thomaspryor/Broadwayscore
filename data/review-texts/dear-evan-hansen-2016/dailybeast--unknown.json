  "bwwExcerpt": "Given how it loads its dramatic and moral dice, and the swings of tone between comedy and terrible tragedy, the question is what will collapse when the truths are revealed in Dear Evan Hansen. Well, it doesn't supply what you might expect from some musicals and dramas about teen suicide, our truth-dissembling online worlds, and an extreme case of fabulism. Dear Evan Hansen is beautiful to look at it, slickly directed, and moving, but also biting and subversive-and so may have more to say about teen suicide, parenting, and internet lunacy than the most finely worded op-ed column.",

However, this is only one excerpt and may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for its direction, visual appeal, and emotional impact, while also highlighting its subversive qualities. Despite the text quality warning, the positive language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review states that the show is \"beautiful to look at it, slickly directed, and moving, but also biting and subversive.\" This indicates a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the production's direction, visual design, and emotional impact while highlighting its intelligent handling of dark themes. However, confidence is low given only one curated excerpt is available.",
