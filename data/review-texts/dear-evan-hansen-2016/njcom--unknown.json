  "bwwExcerpt": "Allow me to be a dissenting voice: Having seen 'Dear Evan Hansen' twice now -- with its wildly implausible storyline and its repetitive pop-rock score -- I am mystified by the enthusiasm for it. Maybe the show's celebrants are responding to the creators' willingness to tackle such dark themes, or the admittedly hard-working performance of star Ben Platt (Benji in the 'Pitch Perfect' movies), who plays the neurotic title character. But laudable ambitions can't disguise the fact that nothing about 'Dear Evan Hansen' makes very much sense.",
