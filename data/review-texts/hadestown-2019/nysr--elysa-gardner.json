  "bwwExcerpt": ": For starters, Mitchell is a gifted tunesmith, and lyricist, who approaches musical theater with a clear, infectious sense of wonder. Her melodic savvy, if not entirely consistent over a run time of nearly two and a half hours with little spoken dialogue, is buttressed by an ear for piercing, haunting harmonies, abetted here by musical director and vocal arranger Liam Robinson. Moreover, Mitchell and, to her credit, Chavkin have mined a beautiful and theatrically resonant tale from their source",
