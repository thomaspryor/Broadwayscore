  "bwwExcerpt": ": Hadestown has so much fun telling, as it puts it, this \"sad tale\" that even though this retelling of a well-trodden Greek myth feels slight, it also makes for a joyful performance. Ana&iuml;s Mitchell's musical, which opens on Broadway tonight at the Walter Kerr Theatre (to September 1), is delicious to look at and listen to-truly, my new earworm is \"Way Down Hadestown\"-even if its story is as wan as its central couple.",
