  "fullText": "On Broadway, as Off, Hadestown is a hell of a musical. But it’s changed. When it opened Off-Broadway three years ago, Anais Mitchell’s concept album had been turned into an inventively staged, soulful sung-through musical, with a uniformly terrific eight-member cast reenacting the Greek myth of Orpheus, who descends into the underworld to try to bring his dead wife Eurydice back to life….\n\nHadestown is now opening on Broadway, after a run at The National Theatre in London, with a slightly longer running time and a cast expanded to 13; there is now a five member “Workers Chorus” added to the three “Fates,” a larger ensemble that backs up the principals with rich harmonies and extended dance moves. Broadway’s Walter Kerr Theater has not been completely redesigned; the show plays out on a conventional proscenium stage, Rachel Hauck’s new set more concretely evoking a jazz club in New Orleans.\n\nWhat made Hadestown most thrilling remains – the delightful score, which mixes sweet and sexy folk, rocking jazz, and exquisite blues. And there are some improvements. There is now a sharper clarity to the tale,\n\nFull review on DC Theatre Scene.\n\nClick on any photograph by Matthew Murphy to see it enlarged",
