  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It’s immediately clear that ‘Hadestown’, a haunting gut-punch of a new musical...breathes the same air we do. This imaginative spin on Orpheus and Eurydice speaks with a bleeding heart to the here and now. It is both the most original and breathtaking musical of the season and a trenchant piece of political art...For all its chilling resonance, ‘Hadestown’ is also a hoot...It’s further proof we’re witnessing a new dawn for American musicals.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Exceptional praise with superlatives like 'most original and breathtaking musical of the season' and 'new dawn for American musicals' indicates a rave review despite being a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise with superlatives like 'most original' and 'breathtaking', indicating a highly positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"haunting gut-punch\", \"breathtaking\", and \"most original\", indicating a rave review. Despite being a single excerpt, the language is overwhelmingly positive. | Kimi: The single available excerpt contains superlative praise calling the show the most original and breathtaking of the season, but per the single-excerpt guidance, scores in the upper Positive range (80-84) rather than Rave.",
