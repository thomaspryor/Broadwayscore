  "bwwExcerpt": "by Broadway standards. Many of the songs are reflective in nature, which leads to some slow points, especially in Act Two. But, more often than not, \"Hadestown\" is exciting, compelling and beautiful. David Cote, The Observer : Silver fox André De Shields lends his funky-grandpa vibe to the narration-heavy role of Hermes. Big-voiced Eva Noblezada is pluck personified as a waifish Eurydice. Fitting for the god of the underworld, Patrick Page's basso profundo seems to issue from the lower basement. And, as Persephone, Amber Grey dials her devil-may-care hootchie-mama routine to 11, ensuring her eventual transfiguration as Eartha Kitt on Broadway one day. Less fruitful is Reeve Carney's Orpheus, conceived as a socially awkward art savant. Laying on the Dear Evan Hansen too thick, Carney's neurodiverse Orpheus (lots of gaping, arms hanging limply, fingers twitching) is a misfire. The survivor of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark remains a bit generic, despite sweet looks and a pretty pop",

Single excerpt warning requires caution - this appears to be from a longer mixed-positive review. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some slow points and a misfire in casting, but overall describes the show as 'exciting, compelling and beautiful.' The positive aspects outweigh the negatives, leading to a positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review is mostly positive, highlighting the exciting and beautiful aspects of the show. However, it also mentions some slow points and a misfire in the casting of Orpheus, indicating reservations. | Kimi: The critic delivers an overall positive verdict describing the show as 'exciting, compelling and beautiful' while noting significant reservations including slow points in Act Two and a 'misfire' lead performance by Reeve Carney.",
