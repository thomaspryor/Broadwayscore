  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Hadestown” isn’t perfect, but it’s so fresh that you’ll gladly look past its forgivable flaws and savor the kaleidoscopic stylistic variety of Ms. Mitchell’s score...Mitchell’s down-home score is the incontestable star of the show...Mitchell’s songs are beautiful but undramatic...Chavkin’s endlessly varied direction and Neumann’s dances help to keep things on the move...Would that ‘Hadestown’ were a bit shorter, too, but there’s no point in fussing over a show as rich as this one.”\n\nRead more",
