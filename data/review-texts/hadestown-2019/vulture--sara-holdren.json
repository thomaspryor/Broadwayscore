  "showScoreExcerpt": "“’Hadestown’ has arrived...And its current manifestation feels lush, vigorous, and formally exciting, not to mention witchily prescient...As an intricate and gorgeous feat of songwriting, as a vehicle for dynamite performances, as a visionary long-term collaboration and a courageous experiment with form, ‘Hadestown’ is cause for celebration...Mitchell’s lyrics are image-rich and clever, her tunes exhilarating...Page and Gray are the twin sensations of the show.”"
