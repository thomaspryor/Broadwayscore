  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The production superbly showcases both Mitchell’s work and a superlative cast, accompanied by an orchestra so seamlessly integrated into the production that the evening is at once a vibrant theatrical reimagining of the classical doomed-love story and a rollicking pop-rock concert that keeps scaling new musical heights....The power of the show resides in the variegated beauty of Mitchell’s score and the heat-generating intensity with which the uniformly terrific cast delivers it.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Consistent superlatives throughout: 'superbly showcases', 'superlative cast', 'uniformly terrific cast', 'rollicking', 'scaling new musical heights'. Clear enthusiasm warrants Rave bucket despite being only an excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the production, cast, and musical integration, indicating a highly positive review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses superlatives like \"superbly\", \"superlative\", \"vibrant\", and \"terrific\", indicating a strong positive assessment. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing the score at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise with superlatives like 'superbly,' 'superlative,' and 'terrific,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
