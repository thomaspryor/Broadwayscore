Low confidence due to truncated text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests improvements and a positive shift in the production, but the phrase 'if not yet ideally warm' indicates some reservations. Given the single excerpt and the caution about cherry-picking, a lower positive score is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive change and improvement in the show, suggesting a recommendation, but the phrase \"if not yet ideally warm\" implies reservations. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic praises significant improvements from previous productions ('saved', 'clearer', 'more directly') while noting lingering imperfections ('not yet ideally warm'). As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced, but the tone indicates a solid recommendation.",
