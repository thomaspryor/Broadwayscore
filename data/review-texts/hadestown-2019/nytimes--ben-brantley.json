  "fullText": "“It’s a sad song, but we sing it anyway.” We certainly do. The words refer to the classic myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, which has been told and retold — sung and resung, danced and filmed — over the centuries in many genres and styles. Now it has become a folk opera, “Hadestown,” by the gifted singer-songwriter Anaïs Mitchell, which opened on Monday at New York Theater Workshop in a gorgeously sung, elementally spare production directed by and developed with Rachel Chavkin (“Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812”).\n\nNew York Theater Workshop is rare among the city’s major theaters in bringing fresh imagination even to the regular reconfiguring of its auditorium. For “Hadestown,” the audience almost surrounds the stage, sitting on an assortment of wooden chairs placed on a series of tiers. (Thankfully, cushions are provided.)\n\nWhile the action primarily takes place in a circular playing area, with the excellent band tucked in the back, the performers intermittently move through aisles in the audience, bringing an inviting intimacy to the production. It’s a smart tactic, because while its score is continually beguiling, “Hadestown” might feel static were it not for Ms. Chavkin’s simple but inventive staging, which is enhanced by the fluid lighting design of Bradley King. (“Hadestown” began as a concept album Ms. Mitchell released in 2010, and at times those roots show.)\n\nThe setting for this particular reworking of the myth remains unspecified. The minimal props include antique lanterns, and the performers sometimes sing into old-fashioned-looking microphones. We might be in the Depression, but then again we might not. (The costumes, by Michael Krass, are mostly contemporary.) In any case, as the tale begins, hardship and natural disasters have come upon the land: “Flood’ll get ya if the fire don’t,” sing the Fates, portrayed by Lulu Fall, Jessie Shelton and Shaina Taub, harmonizing wonderfully.\n\nIt is in this barren environment that Orpheus (Damon Daunno), with a guitar strapped to his back, locks eyes with Eurydice (Nabiyah Be) and becomes instantly entranced, immediately promising to shield her from want through the magic of his music.\n\nIn a duet shaded with anxiety, Eurydice asks, “Lover, tell me if you’re able, who’s gonna set the wedding table?” Orpheus’s swaggering answer:\n\nLover, when I sing my songAll the trees gonna sing alongAnd bend their branches down to meTo lay their fruit around my feet.\n\nHermes, the tale’s narrator, portrayed with a nifty sense of been-there-seen-that-sung-it-before wisdom by Chris Sullivan, sums up Orpheus’s powers of persuasion nicely: “He could make you see how the world could be, in spite of the way it was.”\n\nMs. Be’s Eurydice has a luminous beauty that makes Orpheus’s quick fall quite believable, and her singing is equally spellbinding. She also imbues the character with a transparent innocence that makes Eurydice’s susceptibility to doubt and seduction palpably believable.\n\nFor, while the details remain vague — there is little in “Hadestown” that qualifies as specific action — Eurydice quickly becomes disenchanted when Orpheus’s sunny promises are not immediately kept. He might sing of a world where want and need are banished — and Mr. Daunno’s handsome, high-lying tenor matches his sunny ardor nicely — but his absorption in song-making apparently doesn’t bring much manna from heaven.\n\nEnter Hades, played with an air both sinister and suave by Patrick Page. He’s the ruler of Hadestown, an underworld hell where workers toil in his foundries and factories. Mr. Page’s charcoal baritone seductively wraps itself around Ms. Mitchell’s songs as he hymns the comforts that await Eurydice down below, and mocks Orpheus’s promises:\n\nHey little songbird, let me guessHe’s some kind of poet, and he’s pennilessGive him your handHe’ll give you his hand-to-mouthHe’ll write you a poem when the power’s out.\n\nMs. Mitchell’s lovely music and well-turned lyrics are tightly bound together, and recall traditional folk music with a distinctive Southern flavor (although she hails from Vermont). While most of the words, and for that matter the melodies, feel as if they could have been written in the 1930s (or at least the 1960s), there are witty contemporary touches, as when Persephone, Hades’s wife, portrayed with a polished glamour by Amber Gray, refers to “pay-per-view” at one point. The orchestrations, by Michael Chorney and Todd Sickafoose, are simultaneously rich and spare, deftly echoing the sounds of traditional folk music while also having an indie-pop flair.\n\nJust why Hades takes a shine to Eurydice is among the details left vague in “Hadestown” — perhaps during the six months when Persephone is allowed to roam the earth he grows a little restive. In any case, as in the myth, down she goes, and — nonspoiler alert — Orpheus soon follows, determined to win her back. I probably don’t need to tell you how things turn out, either. As Hermes also says, “It’s an old tale from way back when.”\n\nAnd yet, at least at one startling point, the musical resonates in a shivery-funny way with today’s America. It’s pure coincidence. Ms. Mitchell began work on “Hadestown” even before she released it as an album, but the first act concludes with Hades leading one of the more rousing songs, a gospel-tinged anthem entitled “Why We Build the Wall.” With the company portraying his masses of workers, Hades leads them through a song celebrating the importance of a nonporous border.\n\n“Why do we build the wall?” the chorus sings. “We build the wall to keep us free.” They continue: “How does the wall keep us free? The wall keeps out the enemy.” The enemy, put simply, is the people up above who lack what those in Hadestown have — a superficial prosperity, or at least work to do — and desperately want it.\n\nOne more thing I probably don’t need to tell you: Why this song made me sit up in my chair, and wrap my jacket around me a little tightly to shake off the goose bumps.\n\nA theater review on Tuesday about “Hadestown,” at New York Theater Workshop in Manhattan, misspelled the given name of the actress who plays Eurydice. As the listing of credits correctly noted, she is Nabiyah Be, not Nabiya. (The error was repeated in a picture caption.)\n\nWhen we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.

  "bwwExcerpt": "The gods, or more likely Ms. Chavkin and her creative team, have saved \"Hadestown\" on its way uptown - via Edmonton and London - by turning it into something very much warmer, if not yet ideally warm. The story is clearer, the songs express that story more directly and the larger themes arise from it naturally rather than demanding immediate attention like overeager undergraduates.",

  "dtliExcerpt": "All your favorite Greeks are heading somewhere in “Hadestown,” the sumptuous, hypnotic and somewhat hyperactive musical that opened on Wednesday night after its own twisty 13-year road to Broadway.\r\n\r\nEurydice descends to the underworld; Orpheus follows to retrieve her. Persephone spends six months aboveground living the good life of summer and song before returning for six months below with Hades. (He’s her husband.) Hermes, of course, has wings on his feet. And the Fates (at least in this version) are always darting about, minding everyone’s business.\r\n\r\nBut watching “Hadestown” unfold so gorgeously at the Walter Kerr Theater, I found myself thinking of other Greek characters: those lucky few saved from heartbreak by radical metamorphoses.",
