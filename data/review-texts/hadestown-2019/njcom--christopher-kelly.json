Mitchell and director Rachel Chavkin (\"Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812\") do an impressive job updating an oft-recounted myth; in this telling, Orpheus (Reeve Carney) falls in love with Eurydice (Eva No...",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "“If the show as a whole let me a little cold, it is probably a matter of elevated expectations...The dark story and bluesy orchestrations can’t really support the various dance sequences...And one major casting change from the original feels misjudged...Still, if this is your first visit to ‘Hadestown’, it’s likely to be a satisfying one...While the story sometimes drags, Mitchell’s magnificent music holds us rapt.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt suggests a qualified recommendation (\"satisfying\") with praise for the creative team's work (\"impressive job\"), but the conditional phrasing and single excerpt availability warrant lower confidence and score within positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive experience for first-time viewers, highlighting the impressive job by the creators. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive experience, particularly for first-time viewers, but the limited text and lack of a clear, enthusiastic recommendation lead to a score in the lower-middle of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, describing the production as \"satisfying\" and the director's work as \"impressive,\" though the caveat about \"first visit\" suggests some reservations for repeat viewers.",
