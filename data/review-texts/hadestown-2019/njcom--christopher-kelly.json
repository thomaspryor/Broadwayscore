    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt suggests a qualified recommendation (\"satisfying\") with praise for the creative team's work (\"impressive job\"), but the conditional phrasing and single excerpt availability warrant lower confidence and score within positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive experience for first-time viewers, highlighting the impressive job by the creators. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive experience, particularly for first-time viewers, but the limited text and lack of a clear, enthusiastic recommendation lead to a score in the lower-middle of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, describing the production as \"satisfying\" and the director's work as \"impressive,\" though the caveat about \"first visit\" suggests some reservations for repeat viewers.",
