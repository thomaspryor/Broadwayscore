    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the show's emotional impact and theatrical craft, but confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's ability to connect with audiences and effectively use theatrical elements, indicating a strong positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses a positive sentiment about the show's ability to connect with the audience and its effective use of Broadway elements. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I've placed it in the upper end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the show's emotional impact and comprehensive theatrical excellence, placing it in the upper Positive range. However, confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's verdict.",
