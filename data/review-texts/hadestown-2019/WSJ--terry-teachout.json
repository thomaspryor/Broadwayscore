Even at its frequent best, \"Hadestown\" plays more like a song cycle than a stage show. I won't pretend that this isn't a problem, but Rachel Chavkin's endlessly varied direction and David Neumann's dances, all of them fully integrated into the staging, help to keep things on the move, as does Rachel Hauck's turntable-and-trap-door set.
