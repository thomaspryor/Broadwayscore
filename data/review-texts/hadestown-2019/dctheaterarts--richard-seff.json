  "showScoreExcerpt": "A rich plum cake of a folk opera showcasing Anais Mitchell's original songwork transformed into theatrical form. Director Rachel Chavkin's innovative staging utilizes multiple levels and walkways, along with Bradley King's lighting design. Innocence and honesty radiate from the lovely Nabiyah Be as Eurydice. Patrick Page's commanding presence as Hades and Amber Gray's nuanced performance as Persephone are highlights. At two hours and ten minutes, it's only slightly overweight, with occasional moments of being overly explicit and repetitive. A rare treat well worth a visit for those interested in contemporary musical theater.",
