    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong superlative praise calling it 'most exciting' and 'most-improved' with acclaim for the creative conception. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the language is clearly enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt contains strong praise, calling it 'the most exciting new musical' and 'most-improved', indicating a highly positive assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt contains very positive language, calling it the \"most exciting new musical\" and praising its improvement. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive tone warrants a score on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic superlatives ('most exciting,' 'central genius') indicating clear admiration, though the single-quote limitation prevents a higher confidence Rave designation.",
