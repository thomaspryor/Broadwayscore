  "bwwExcerpt": ": This chilling scene remains the centerpiece of Hadestown, a love story and class-struggle parable based on the Orpheus myth that arrives on the same Broadway stage Bruce Springsteen worked for 14 months prior. The cast has changed from Mitchell's original LP (where Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, The Low Anthem's Ben Knox Miller and activist folk hero Ani DiFranco joined Mitchell and Brown in the leads). But the work's musical integrity and proletariat spirit remains largely intact.",
