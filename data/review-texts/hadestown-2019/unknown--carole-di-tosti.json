    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Extremely superlative language ('breathtaking', 'unparalleled', 'divine work for the ages') indicates a rave, but confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlative language ('breathtaking', 'unparalleled', 'divine work for the ages') indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses superlatives like \"breathtaking,\" \"superbly realized,\" \"unparalleled, thrilling, coherent,\" and \"divine work for the ages,\" indicating a rave review. Despite being a single excerpt, the language is overwhelmingly positive. | Kimi: The single excerpt contains effusive praise with superlatives like 'divine work for the ages,' 'unparalleled,' and 'breathtaking,' warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket. Confidence is low due to the limited context of a single curated quote.",
