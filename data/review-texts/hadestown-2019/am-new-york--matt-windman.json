  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Proves to be smart and romantic but dramatically underwhelming...In Mitchell’s hands, the sensitive Orpheus is too focused on playing the guitar to provide for Eurydice’s real-world needs, so she independently ventures down to an industrialized underworld...The cast is excellent and songs are either gently touching or catchy, but ‘Hadestown’ does come off as slow, undercooked and choppy, more reminiscent of a concert than a theatrical work.”",
