  "showScoreExcerpt": "A stunningly visceral, exquisitely original production. The theatre gods should be smiling. A collaborative tour de force highlighting director Rachel Chavkin's ability to unify diverse creative elements. Chavkin transformed Mitchell's original album into a singularly visceral stage experience. The ensemble cast is praised, particularly Andre De Shields, Reeve Carney, Eva Noblezada, Amber Gray, and Patrick Page for their performances. The reimagined Orpheus myth addresses contemporary themes, including economic inequality and environmental concerns. Amber Gray's Persephone will bring to mind a young Eartha Kitt, bubbling with attitude and an outrageously infectious sense of abandon.",
