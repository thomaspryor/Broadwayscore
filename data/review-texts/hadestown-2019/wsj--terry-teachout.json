  "bwwExcerpt": "t to remarkable life by director Rachel Chavkin, who does for the Quarter and hell what she did for Tolstoy's Russia with 2016's equally fine Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812. Terry Teachout, The Wall Street Journal : While the stage version of \"Hadestown\" is longer and considerably more elaborate than the 2010 concept album, it still bears the mark of its origins, and therein lies its chief flaw. Ms. Mitchell's songs are beautiful but undramatic-the score runs mainly to slow and medium tempos-which means that the overall narrative pace can feel a bit sluggish, enthralling though it is from moment to moment. Even at its frequent best, \"Hadestown\" plays more like a song cycle than a stage show. I won't pretend that this isn't a problem, but Rachel Chavkin's endlessly varied direction and David Neumann's dances, all of them fully integrated into the staging, help to keep things on the move, as does Rachel Hauck's turntable-and-trap-door set.

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Hadestown” isn’t perfect, but it’s so fresh that you’ll gladly look past its forgivable flaws and savor the kaleidoscopic stylistic variety of Ms. Mitchell’s score...Mitchell’s down-home score is the incontestable star of the show...Mitchell’s songs are beautiful but undramatic...Chavkin’s endlessly varied direction and Neumann’s dances help to keep things on the move...Would that ‘Hadestown’ were a bit shorter, too, but there’s no point in fussing over a show as rich as this one.”"
