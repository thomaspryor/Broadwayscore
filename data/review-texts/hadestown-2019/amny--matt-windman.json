  "fullText": "Directed by Rachel Chavkin (\"Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812\"), \"Hadestown\" contains a stunning visual design evoking both a New Orleans barroom scene and a smoldering mechanical underworld, complemented by the motion of turntables, a rollicking band, bold performances and expressive dance choreography. Whereas the previous Off-Broadway production was performed in the round, no impact has been lost in the transition to a traditional proscenium theater. The score - which contains airy folk-pop for the lovers and a livelier jazz idiom for the denizens of the underworld - comes off as distinctive and authentic by Broadway standards. Many of the songs are reflective in nature, which leads to some slow points, especially in Act Two. But, more often than not, \"Hadestown\" is exciting, compelling and beautiful.",
