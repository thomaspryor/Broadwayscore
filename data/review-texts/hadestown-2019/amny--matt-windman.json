  "bwwExcerpt": "Directed by Rachel Chavkin (\"Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812\"), \"Hadestown\" contains a stunning visual design evoking both a New Orleans barroom scene and a smoldering mechanical underworld, complemented by the motion of turntables, a rollicking band, bold performances and expressive dance...",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The Act One finale of the stunning musical romance contains the most memorable, eerie and politically relevant moment of the entire Broadway season...A stunning visual design...Bold performances and expressive choreography...Many of the songs are reflective in nature, which leads to some slow points...But, more often than not, ‘Hadestown' is exciting, compelling and beautiful...’Hadestown’ may very well become the next risk-taking, genre-defying new musical.”\n\nRead more",
