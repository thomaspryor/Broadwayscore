    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clear praise for visual design, direction, performances and production elements. However, as only one curated quote, confidence is low and may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the visual design, band, performances, and dance, indicating a strong recommendation. However, given the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the direction, visual design, music, performances, and dance. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I'm placing it in the upper end of the 'Positive' bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's visual design, performances, and staging with words like 'stunning' and 'rollicking,' indicating a strong recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
