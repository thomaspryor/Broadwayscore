    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with consistent praise for multiple elements (stunning design, bold performances, expressive dance). However, confidence is low due to limited text availability - this could be cherry-picked positive elements from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('stunning visual design', 'bold performances') indicating a highly favorable view of the production. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a rave review. | Gemini: The excerpt is very positive, praising the direction, visual design, band, performances, and dance. Given that it is only one excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range but with low confidence. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
