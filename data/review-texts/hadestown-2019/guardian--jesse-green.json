  "fullText": "Olivier, LondonThere are some cracking songs in Rachel Chavkin and Anaïs Mitchell’s haunting journey through the underworld This is a show that escapes easy definition. With music, lyrics and book by Anaïs Mitchell, it began life as a touring concert in 2006, was turned into a cult album and then, with the aid of director Rachel Chavkin, into an off-Broadway production. Whether you call it a folk opera, a hip oratorio or a musicalised myth, it boasts some cracking songs that far outweigh its dramatic shortcomings. What strikes me most is its tendency, like its hero, to look backwards as well as forwards. Hadestown’s starting point is the classical legend of the poet-musican Orpheus, who descends into the underworld to rescue his beloved Eurydice. Watching it, I was reminded of the preoccupation of French playwrights and film-makers with the same story: Jean Anouilh wrote Eurydice in 1941 and Jean Cocteau directed Orphée in 1950. There is also more than a touch of 1920s American expressionism. When Mitchell’s Eurydice finds herself in a Hades filled with industrialised slaves, Eugene O’Neill’s The Hairy Ape, with its vision of dehumanised stokers, leapt to mind. Mitchell, however, clearly intends Hadestown to be a fable for today. Persephone emerges from the underworld to celebrate spring and summer but in this version there is a seasonal chaos that suggests the impact of climate change. The show even gains a chilling topicality when Hades, the underworld boss, and his workers explain why they have built a protective wall around their kingdom: “The enemy is poverty / And the wall keeps out the enemy / And we build the wall to keep us free.” Pre-dating the Trump administration, the song reminds us of those societies that erect barriers out of fear and insecurity. I am still puzzled as to Mitchell’s final intention. Is she saying that, with willpower, we can overturn the patterns of the past? Is she yearning for a cleaner, purer, preindustrial world? Whatever her mission, she has written exhilarating songs that have elements of trad jazz and folk. The narrator Hermes sets the ball rolling with a number that has the railroad rhythms of so much American popular music. Mitchell maintains that train-type momentum in Way Down Hadestown, which haunts you long after you have left the theatre, and in When the Chips Are Down, where the Fates stompingly assert their power. Chavkin’s production, even in a large space, preserves the rough theatre elements that are part of the show’s charm. Rachel Hauck’s design suggests some decrepit New Orleans dive, and the band, with Nathaniel Cross prominent on trombone, is vividly present. The performers, headed by Reeve Carney and Eva Noblezada as the young lovers, are all good, even if Orpheus’s song that wins him an underworld reprieve can’t stand comparison with Gluck or Offenbach. The standout performance comes from Patrick Page who, as Hades, has a voice that seems to issue, appropriately, from the depths. He is excellently partnered by Amber Gray as a half-pissed Persephone and well supported by André de Shields as a Hermes who periodically sports the kind of fringed umbrella you’d see at a funeral in the deep south. I’m not sure if Mitchell’s classical update imparts a palpable message, but her beguiling melodies linger on. At the National’s Olivier theatre, London, until 26 January. We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could support the Guardian at this crucial time for journalism in the US. In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one. From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced. While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts. While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel. Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less. But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you. Now seen and absolutely loved. Performed with real energy and commitment (although my wife didn't care for Orpheus) that more than did justice to the album, and was alive with just so many great moments, great tunes and visual coups that I had a big, beaming grin on my face throughout. The packed Olivier theatre gave it a well-deserved standing ovation, and I'd see it again in a heartbeat. Loved the way Orpheus spent most of the first half side stage supposedly writing a number of unsurpassable beauty and still came out with a turgid indie strummer b-side...",
