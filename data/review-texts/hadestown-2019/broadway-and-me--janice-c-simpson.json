  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Chavkin has created a hip and wholly inventive production that combines the contemporary and the timeless...She’s restaged it for a proscenium instead of it playing it in the round as she did downtown...She’s also added an ensemble of dancers to fill out her imaginary world and, most importantly, she’s recast some of the principal roles and allowed the new actors to bring their distinctive flavors to her still-savory stew...The show remains pretty close to perfect too.”\n\nRead more",
