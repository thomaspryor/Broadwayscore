  "fullText": "April 17, 2019 by Jonathan Mandell On Broadway, as Off, Hadestown is a hell of a musical. But it’s changed. When it opened Off-Broadway three years ago, Anais Mitchell’s concept album had been turned into an inventively staged, soulful sung-through musical, with a uniformly terrific eight-member cast reenacting the Greek myth of Orpheus, who descends into the underworld to try to bring his dead wife Eurydice back to life. All photos are on NewYorkTheater.me Director Rachel Chavkin, who would be nominated for a Tony the following year for Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812, had completely reconfigured the downtown New York Theatre Workshop into a kind of stadium seating in the round, which evoked the rings of Hell. Hadestown is now opening on Broadway, after a run at The National Theatre in London, with a slightly longer running time and a cast expanded to 13; there is now a five member “Workers Chorus” added to the three “Fates,” a larger ensemble that backs up the principals with rich harmonies and extended dance moves. Only two of the 13 performers were in the original Off-Broadway production. Broadway’s Walter Kerr Theater has not been completely redesigned; the show plays out on a conventional proscenium stage, Rachel Hauck’s new set more concretely evoking a jazz club in New Orleans (the band members in porkpie hats are visible on stage throughout.) There are now all sorts of stage effects, from stage smoke to a working steam whistle to a few surprise alterations of the set that are obviously the fruit of a bigger Broadway budget. What made Hadestown most thrilling remains – the delightful score, which mixes sweet and sexy folk, rocking jazz, and exquisite blues. And there are some improvements. There is now a sharper clarity to the tale, in large part because of the expansion of the role of Hermes as narrator, now performed to perfection by the great André De Shields. (There is also a note in the program explaining, “Who’s Who in Greek Mythology,” which is helpful in a show that still focuses more on atmosphere than plot.) De Shields commands the stage from the get-go. The show begins in complete silence as the rest of the cast watches Hermes, in his elegant, grey silk suit, slide across the stage, pause, and open a button to show a loud and splendid vest, before trombone player Briane Drye lets out a blast from jazz heaven and De Shields launches into the get-down “Road to Hell.” In the song, Hermes introduces the three Fates, the five members of the “Workers Chorus,” and Orpheus, and announces we’re about to witness a love story. Reeve Carney’s Orpheus plays country bumpkin to Eva Noblezada’s tough street chick Eurydice. When they first meet, Orpheus blurts out “Come Home With Me” (the name of the song) and sings he wants to marry her. “Who are you?” Eurydice talks back. “Your name is like a melody,” Orpheus sings “A singer? Is that what you are?” “I also play the lyre.” “Ooh, a liar, and a player too! I’ve met too many men like you.” This is both performers’ sophomore effort on Broadway, each of them making splashy debuts — Carney as the lead in Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, Noblezada in Miss Saigon. Hers is the more impressive transformation. (It doesn’t help that the role of Orpheus was originally played by Damon Daunno, full-out heartthrob, who is now busy a couple of blocks away starring as Curly McLain in the Broadway revival of Oklahoma. ) They do wind up marrying, of course. Then Eurydice descends into Hadestown. In the standard versions of the myth, it’s because she died. In this retelling, she makes a deal with the devil in order to fill her hungry stomach. Hadestown wouldn’t be quite as splendid if it were not for the parallel (and cleverly intersecting) love story of Hades and Persephone – in large measure because of the performers who portray them, Patrick Page and Amber Gray. They are the two who’ve been with the show since Off-Broadway, and no wonder: They are beyond extraordinary. Page in his deep, deep voice ends Act I with his show-stopping and strikingly relevant “Why We Build The Wall” (which Mitchell wrote for the album, released in 2010, long before Trump’s campaign.): “Why do we build the wall? My children, my children why do we build the wall? …We build the wall to keep us free. How does the wall keep us free?…. …The wall keeps out the enemy Hadestown is on stage at the Walter Kerr Theater (219 W. 48th St. between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10036) Tickets and details Filed Under: NY Theatre Buzz, Our Reviews Jonathan Mandell is a third-generation New York City journalist and a digital native, who has written about the theater for a range of publications, including Playbill, American Theatre Magazine, the New York Times, Newsday, Backstage, NPR.com and CNN.com.

  "showScoreExcerpt": "A hell of a musical. The show has evolved since its Off-Broadway debut three years prior, now featuring an expanded 13-member cast and more elaborate staging at the Walter Kerr Theater. The score is delightful, blending folk, jazz, and blues elements. Andre De Shields' performance as Hermes receives particular acclaim for commanding the stage and providing narrative clarity. Patrick Page and Amber Gray deliver show-stopping performances. The Broadway version maintains theatrical impact despite abandoning the original's intimate in-the-round staging. Overall assessment: devilishly good and feeling like a full-fledged musical.",
