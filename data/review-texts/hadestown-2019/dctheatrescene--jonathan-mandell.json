  "showScoreExcerpt": "A hell of a musical. The show has evolved since its Off-Broadway debut three years prior, now featuring an expanded 13-member cast and more elaborate staging at the Walter Kerr Theater. The score is delightful, blending folk, jazz, and blues elements. Andre De Shields' performance as Hermes receives particular acclaim for commanding the stage and providing narrative clarity. Patrick Page and Amber Gray deliver show-stopping performances. The Broadway version maintains theatrical impact despite abandoning the original's intimate in-the-round staging. Overall assessment: devilishly good and feeling like a full-fledged musical.",
