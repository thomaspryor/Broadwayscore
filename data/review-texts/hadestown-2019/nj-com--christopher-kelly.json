  "bwwExcerpt": "Still, if this is your first visit to \"Hadestown,\" it's likely to be a satisfying one. Mitchell and director Rachel Chavkin (\"Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812\") do an impressive job updating an oft-recounted myth; in this telling, Orpheus (Reeve Carney) falls in love with Eurydice (Eva Noblezada), who in turn flees to Hadestown after its ruler Hades (Patrick Page, whose basso profundo is the stuff of nightmares and/or action movie trailers) promises to end her hunger. The actors are all excellent, with one standing slightly above the rest: In the role of Hades' queen Persephone, the extraordinary Amber Grey (who originated the role off Broadway) gives us a kind of Hellenistic Age Real Housewife, both garishly funny and romantically yearning.",
