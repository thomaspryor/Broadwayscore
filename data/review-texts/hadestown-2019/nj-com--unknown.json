  "fullText": "Amber Gray plays Persephone in \"Hadestown,\" a new musical based on the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, now playing on Broadway (Photo by Matthew Murphy)\n\nFor those who complain that most modern musicals — save the occasional “Hamilton” — offer little in the way of memorable music, consider “Hadestown,” Anaïs Mitchell’s jazz-infused reimagining of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.\n\nThe show, which opened on Broadway on Wednesday night and which is considered the front-runner for this year’s Best Musical Tony, contains any number of earworms that work their way into your brain and expand there, by way of infectious hooks and playful rhymes. Mitchell is also the rare lyricist who can balance the trenchant and the timeless, such as in “Why We Build the Wall” — a chilling dissection of isolationism and xenophobia written well before the Trump era that nonetheless sounds ripped from today’s headlines.\n\nIf the show as a whole let me a little cold, it is probably a matter of elevated expectations. I first saw “Hadestown” in the spring of 2016, in a smaller-scaled production at New York Theatre Workshop, and it’s hard not to feel as if something has been lost in the trip uptown. (The show was expanded and refined in productions in Canada and London.) What previously felt otherworldly and jarring — a journey from a sweaty, smoky Southern bar straight into the bowels of hell — now comes across as overly Broadway-ified and occasionally pandering.\n\nThe dark story and bluesy orchestrations can’t really support the various dance sequences, performed by the five-person chorus, that have been pasted into the proceedings. (The choreography is by David Neumann.) And one major casting change from the original feels misjudged: Previously the narrator Hermes was played by the gravel-voiced, fedora-wearing Chris Sullivan — a kind of jazz joint answer to Joel Grey’s emcee in “Cabaret.” Here, the character is played as a more traditional showman-in-a-shiny-suit by the veteran André De Shields. It’s a perfectly respectable performance, but there’s no menace, no sense that this storyteller is leading us to potentially very dangerous places.\n\n‘What the Constitution Mean to Me’ and ‘Lehman Trilogy’ are two thrilling history lessons: reviews\n\nHeidi Schreck's \"What the Constitution Means to Me\" is brainy and touching, while the Sam Mendes-directed \"The Lehman Trilogy\" is utterly enthralling. Reviews; how to get tickets; running time.\n\nStill, if this is your first visit to “Hadestown,” it’s likely to be a satisfying one. Mitchell and director Rachel Chavkin (“Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812”) do an impressive job updating an oft-recounted myth; in this telling, Orpheus (Reeve Carney) falls in love with Eurydice (Eva Noblezada), who in turn flees to Hadestown after its ruler Hades (Patrick Page, whose basso profundo is the stuff of nightmares and/or action movie trailers) promises to end her hunger. The actors are all excellent, with one standing slightly above the rest: In the role of Hades’ queen Persephone, the extraordinary Amber Gray (who originated the role off Broadway) gives us a kind of Hellenistic Age Real Housewife, both garishly funny and romantically yearning.\n\nThe set, designed by Rachel Hauck in somber shades of bronze and grey, with occasional pops of very bright color, looks fantastic, especially when the rear walls split and the characters descend into the underworld. And while the story sometimes drags, especially in Act Two as Orpheus and Eurydice attempt to make their way out of Hadestown, Mitchell’s magnificent music — which began its life as a folk music song cycle, recorded by the likes of Bon Iver and Ani DiFranco —holds us rapt. If you don’t walk out of the theater singing the choruses of such songs as “Way Down Hadestown” and “When the Chips Are Down,” your will is much stronger than mine.\n\nTickets: $79-$159; available at www.ticketmaster.com.
