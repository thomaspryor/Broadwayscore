  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The lugubrious new Broadway musical that takes us to hell and back, via a jazz and blues-fueled account of the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice...The embellishing of the myth, through an assembly line of sound-alike songs and mechanistic dance sequences, rambles on...and, only occasionally, with any inspirational joy, or heart...The plot comes across as an accessory to the production’s style rather than the other way around. It’s not a winning formula.”\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning noted but language is unambiguously negative. | GPT-4o: The review describes the musical as 'lugubrious' with 'sound-alike songs' and 'mechanistic dance sequences' that only occasionally inspire. The verdict 'not a winning formula' suggests a negative assessment. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"lugubrious\", \"rambles on\", and \"not a winning formula\", indicating a negative assessment of the musical. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as lugubrious and tedious, criticizing the repetitive 'sound-alike songs' and 'mechanistic' dances while concluding it lacks heart and is 'not a winning formula.'",
