  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The lugubrious new Broadway musical that takes us to hell and back, via a jazz and blues-fueled account of the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice...The embellishing of the myth, through an assembly line of sound-alike songs and mechanistic dance sequences, rambles on...and, only occasionally, with any inspirational joy, or heart...The plot comes across as an accessory to the production’s style rather than the other way around. It’s not a winning formula.”\n\nRead more",
