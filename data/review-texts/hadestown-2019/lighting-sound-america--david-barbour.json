  "showScoreExcerpt": "“What's most engaging about ‘Hadestown’ isn't the story it tells but the way it tells it -- with a barrelhouse sense of rhythm and plenty of blue notes. Under Chavkin's direction, the entire cast is in synch with the music's sassy, cynically upbeat mood, delivering each lyric with a lazy vibrato and a shrugging acknowledgement of the world's wicked ways...‘Hadestown’ delivers its tragic tale with a wink and a snap in its step.\"",
