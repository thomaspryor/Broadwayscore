  "fullText": "'Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812' director Rachel Chavkin delivers a similarly immersive staging of Anais Mitchell's acclaimed concept album based on the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. The new folk opera by Anais Mitchell at the New York Theatre Workshop is a retelling of the ancient Greek tale about Orpheus and Eurydice. But don’t be fooled. The real romantic sparks in Hadestown are generated by the love affair between Hades, the Lord of the Underworld, and his wife Persephone. How could that not be the case, considering they’re played by the sublimely menacing Patrick Page and the gorgeous-voiced Amber Gray? The music is the thing in this show adapted from Mitchell’s critically acclaimed concept album, released in 2010 and featuring the voices of not only its composer but also such guest stars as Ani DiFranco, the Haden triplets and Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon. The material has been given an enthralling environmental staging by Rachel Chavkin (Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812), which should draw hordes of younger theatergoers to the venue that recently enjoyed a sell-out smash with the David Bowie musical Lazarus. The theater has been dramatically reconfigured for this production, transformed into a wooden amphitheater with the audience seated on mismatched wooden chairs (cushions are thoughtfully provided) on three sides of the circular stage. Rachel Hauck’s scenery consists largely of a giant, gnarly tree at the back, ominously looming over the action. The tale is familiar thanks to myriad film, theater, music and dance adaptations, including, of course, Gluck’s oft-performed 1762 opera. Orpheus (Damon Daunno), a young poet/musician, or in this case, cute singer/songwriter, must descend into the underworld to rescue his beautiful wife Eurydice (Nabiyah Be) from the clutches of Hades (Page). The proceedings are narrated by Hermes (Chris Sullivan), here seen as a rakish hipster, with the three Fates, played by Lulu Fall, Jessie Shelton and Shaina Taub, serving as a musical Greek chorus. It’s all accompanied by a seven-piece band whose members, befitting the concert-style nature of the show, are introduced to the audience. And spoiler alert: The story doesn’t end happily. Entirely sung-through, the evening consists of nearly three dozen songs featuring a wide variety of musical genres, the most infectiously enjoyable of them being New Orleans-style jazz. Energetically sung by the powerful-voiced ensemble, the music is terrific — endlessly inventive and eclectic, as melodic as it is funky and folksy. The action is set in an industrial underworld society beset by class differences and economic injustice, lorded over by robber baron Hades who, in one of the score’s most powerful songs, informs us “Why We Build the Wall.” (The music predates Trump’s political campaign, but feel free to draw the appropriate parallels.) Truth be told, the familiar story seems attenuated and thin over the course of an evening running more than two hours. The lyrics aren’t as scintillating as the music, and the action, which spills out into the walkways winding through the audience, feels overly busy at times. The dialogue, as little of it as there is, can be wince-inducing. “Are you always this confident?” Eurydice asks Orpheus upon their first meeting. “When I look at you, I am,” he replies. Just in case we didn’t get it, the exchange is repeated later on. But it hardly matters, thanks to the music’s relentless energy and inventiveness as delivered by the crack band and terrific ensemble. Daunno and Be are sexy and sweet as the ill-fated young lovers; Sullivan’s charismatic, gravelly voiced Hermes resembles a young Dr. John; Gray makes for a lustrous Persephone; the impossibly deep, bass-voiced Page, wearing a black suit and sunglasses, is deliciously sinister as Hades; and the talented trio of Fall, Shelton and Taub play instruments as well as sing. All together, they make Hadestown an unlikely desirable destination.

  "dtliExcerpt": "In \"Road to Hell,\" the exhilarating opening number of the utterly fabulous Hadestown, Hermes, the conductor of souls into the afterlife, invites us to \"Ride that train to the end of the line.\" He's played with seductive authority and knowing humor by the eternally elegant Andre De Shields, outfitted like a superfly pimp in a flashy silver suit, and it's hard to imagine anyone resisting his call. He sells a ticket to a bewitching journey that pays off at every turn. Spun out of a 2010 concept album by singer-songwriter Anais Mitchell and developed together with director Rachel Chavkin as a seamless theatrical experience, this beguiling, virtually sung-through musical is notable for the expressive beauty of its score, the dark imagination of its stage pictures and the clarity of its storytelling. Performed by a first-rate cast and played with spirited feeling by seven onstage musicians, it arrives on Broadway with a furnace-like blast of creativity.",
