It’s a smart tactic, because while its score is continually beguiling, ‘Hadestown’ might feel static were it not for Ms. Chavkin’s simple but inventive staging...Ms. Mitchell’s lovely music and well-turned lyrics are tightly bound together, and recall traditional folk music with a distinctive Southern flavor.”",
