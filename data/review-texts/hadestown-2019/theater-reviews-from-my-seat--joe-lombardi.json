The strong statement about it being the best musical this season indicates a rave review, though confidence is medium due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review uses extremely positive language like \"rejoicing in originality, soulfulness and luminescence\" and \"brilliant direction.\" The final sentence is a strong indication of a rave review.",
