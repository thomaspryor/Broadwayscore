    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Unqualified superlatives ('brilliant', 'enthralling') and declares it likely the season's best musical. Despite being a single excerpt, the language is so emphatically positive it clearly represents a rave review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise with superlatives like 'brilliant direction' and 'visual wonders are enthralling.' The statement about it being the best musical this season indicates a rave review. | Gemini: The review uses superlatives like \"brilliant\" and states that it cannot imagine a better Broadway musical this season, indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The critic declares this potentially the best musical of the season and praises the direction as 'brilliant' with 'enthrolling' visual wonders, indicating an unqualified rave recommendation. Score is conservative within the Rave range due to single-excerpt limitation.",
