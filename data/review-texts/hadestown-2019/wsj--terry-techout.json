  "bwwExcerpt": "While the stage version of \"Hadestown\" is longer and considerably more elaborate than the 2010 concept album, it still bears the mark of its origins, and therein lies its chief flaw. Ms. Mitchell's songs are beautiful but undramatic-the score runs mainly to slow and medium tempos-which means that the overall narrative pace can feel a bit sluggish, enthralling though it is from moment to moment. Even at its frequent best, \"Hadestown\" plays more like a song cycle than a stage show. I won't pretend that this isn't a problem, but Rachel Chavkin's endlessly varied direction and David Neumann's dances, all of them fully integrated into the staging, help to keep things on the move, as does Rachel Hauck's turntable-and-trap-door set.",
