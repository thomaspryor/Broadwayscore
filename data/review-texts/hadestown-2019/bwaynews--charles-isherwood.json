  "bwwExcerpt": "The exuberant, exhilarating new musical that stands tall among a season of mostly (so far) lackluster Broadway competition. The show features a book and score by the singer-songwriter Anais Mitchell that ranks among the most adventurous and accomplished to be heard on Broadway in recent years. The production, developed and directed by Rachel Chavkin, superbly showcases both Mitchell's work and a superlative cast, accompanied by an orchestra so seamlessly integrated into the production that the evening is at once a vibrant theatrical reimagining of the classical doomed-love story and a rollicking pop-rock concert that keeps scaling new musical heights.",
