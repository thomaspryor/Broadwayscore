  "showScoreExcerpt": "Defiantly original. With its emphasis on mood rather than action, this is the sort of show that risks being labelled portentous. But it's tightly choreographed and genuinely inventive. Sometimes operatic and sometimes bluesy, it manages to sound seductively hushed one moment and rollicking the next. Musically it's a feast - full of folksy melancholy and heartache, yet also packed with gospel, dirty funk and New Orleans jazz.",
