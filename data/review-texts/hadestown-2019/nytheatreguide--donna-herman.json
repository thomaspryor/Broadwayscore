  "showScoreExcerpt": "Going to hell has never been as much fun as experiencing this production. The musical makes ancient Greek myths accessible through its narrator character. Herman explains the dual mythological storylines woven together - the tragic romance of Orpheus and Eurydice alongside Hades and Persephone's relationship. The show successfully balances classical themes with contemporary entertainment value.",
