Scored high in Positive range due to clearly positive tone, but low confidence due to single curated excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('thrilling', 'reinvents', 'vivid') suggesting a highly favorable view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"thrilling\" to describe the musical, which indicates a positive recommendation. Given that it is only one excerpt, the confidence is low, but the language suggests a strong positive score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('thrilling,' 'vivid'), indicating a clear recommendation for this Broadway production, though limited context warrants reduced confidence.",
