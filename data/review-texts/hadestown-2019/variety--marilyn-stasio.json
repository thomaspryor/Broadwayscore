  "fullText": "Anaïs Mitchell’s seductive musical about the enchantments of Hell has finally made it to Broadway.\n\n\"Hadestown\" triggered a lot of buzz when this wholly American show (which came to the stage by way of a concept album) premiered at Off Broadway‘s New York Theatre Workshop in 2016. Arriving on Broadway with its earthly delights more or less intact, this perfectly heavenly musical — with book, music and lyrics by Ana&iuml;s Mitchell — should stick around for a while.\n\nAlthough the production has lost some of the electricity that goes with playing in the round, director Rachel Chavkin (\"Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812\"), who also helped with the show's development, has done a super job of adapting this pretty thing for a proscenium stage. What it loses scenically — namely, a visual sense of the arduous nature of the hero's journeys to and from the underworld — it makes up for in other ways.",
