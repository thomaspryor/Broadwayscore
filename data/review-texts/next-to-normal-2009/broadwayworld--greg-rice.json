  "bwwExcerpt": "I can say that upon listening to most of it again, after seeing the show, I can appreciate it a bit more. A most wonderful thing to see at the performance I attended was the Denver audience. This show, without any special effects or \"anthem\" songs, had the audience in the palm of its hand. You could feel it in the theater.",
