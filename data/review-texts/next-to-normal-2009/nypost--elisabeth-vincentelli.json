  "bwwExcerpt": "Marin Mazzie and Jason Danieley, married in real life, now play Diana and her long-suffering husband, Dan (previously J. Robert Spencer). This Diana has a caustic, self-aware edge absent from Ripley's portrayal. Ripley exteriorized the character's mental anguish; the poised, lion-maned Mazzie plays things closer to the vest.\nWhile the impact of Diana's illness on her loved ones was always an integral part of the show, Mazzie's contained turn helps shift focus to the family dynamics.",
