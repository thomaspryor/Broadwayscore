  "bwwExcerpt": "next to normal will challenge you to think and will bring up some very tough issues. Not many musicals deal with topics such as depression, bipolar disorder, loss, psychiatric ethics, drug abuse and suicide. However, just because these are tough themes doesn't mean they can't get the rock musical treatment. next to normal is well deserving of your time, you won't \"enjoy\" it exactly - but you will be glad you went.",
