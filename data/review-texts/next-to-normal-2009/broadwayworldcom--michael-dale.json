  "bwwExcerpt": "And while I'll admit the loud, raucous and darkly-humored Feeling Electric was more to my personal taste ('Taking a semi-automatic and shooting as many popular kids as possible is really the only sane response to high school.'), the latest incarnation of Next To Normal - which has turned a 180 from being a musical about depression to one about a family's efforts to keep the disease from tearing them apart - is a far better musical. In fact, it's only the existence of a Broadway revival of Guys and Dolls that keeps Next To Normal from being the best written musical currently on Broadway; and having West Side Story around is all that keeps it from being the most daring.",
