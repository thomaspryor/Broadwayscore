  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Like the best mimics, Leguizamo administers large but precisely calibrated doses of exaggeration to make his impersonations pop...At their best, his jokes get at something deep...If only the character at the center of this frenetic one-man show were as convincing...The physical comedy, often verging on dance, is priceless...But the family drama remains, rickety and unconvincing...’Latin History for Morons’ would be richer if he didn’t try so hard to make something so awful so funny.”\n\nRead more",
