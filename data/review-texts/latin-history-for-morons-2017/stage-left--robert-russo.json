  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Delivered with his singular, wise-ass charmer persona...‘Latin History’ succeeds at conveying its message because it is infused with humor, even if bawdy. This play is no jeremiad or strident screed, but, despite its comedy, Leguizamo is dead serious...A hilarious and piercing take on the conquest of invisibility that plagues Latin American history; with his singular voice, he teaches some good lessons...serving low-brow comedy alongside meaningful, and necessary, social commentary.”\n\nRead more",
