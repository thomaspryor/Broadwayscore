  "bwwExcerpt": "That sets the show, directed by Tony Taccone in near-nonstop motion. Leguizamo zips around the stage of Studio 54, where books are stacked and a two-sided blackboard stands ready for a workout. When the chalk dust settles 95 minutes later, Leguizamo has cannily surveyed the Aztecs, Mayans, Incas, plus the role of Hispanic soldiers the Revolutionary War - and a lot more.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The show is fast-paced, funny, foul-mouthed, insightful and, on the down side, occasionally cringe-worthy...Amid the commentary Leguizamo slips in and out of Spanish, busts out dance moves and apes accents of friends, family, and famous figures. Leguizamo is a terrific mimic..Still, doing voices of a deaf relative and scientist Stephen Hawking...turned out to be buzzkill. But the same lines would work simply in his own voice — it’s an easy edit.”\n\nRead more"
