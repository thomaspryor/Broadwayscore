  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The raw, bawdy monologue was born from the frustration Leguizamo encountered trying to help his son find a Latin hero to write about for a school project...The presentation is raw and filled with vulgar language...Leguizamo is an engaging performer...but this show just didn't strike me as very funny.
