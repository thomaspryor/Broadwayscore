  "bwwExcerpt": "The history lesson slightly struggles to be the prime object of attention, as Leguizamo's teaching methods emerge as the true star. Morons is the most high-energy and comic history lesson you have ever sat through: a riot of figures, facts, invective, and scrawling on the chalk-board, mashed up with Leguizamo's own passions for sex and dance, and memories of his own life. Leguizamo plays himself and everyone else, from his son to his wife and daughter, to characters like the bully's father and Moctezuma.",
