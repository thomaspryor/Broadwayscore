  "bwwExcerpt": "Not every success story gets a sequel. The Great Society, Robert Schenkkan's follow-up to his Tony-winning play All the Way, renders President Lyndon B Johnson's second term an overstuffed yet still somewhat tedious office drama. It is less an illuminating history play with fully drawn characters than a dense and particularly animated lesson in facts and figures.",
