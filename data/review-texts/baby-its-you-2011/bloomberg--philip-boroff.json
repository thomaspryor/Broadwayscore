  "bwwExcerpt": "The \"Baby\" players make the most of their threadbare parts. Leavel elevates the enterprise with pitch-perfect singing, acting and bouffant, her Florence blowzy and vulnerable. Near the end, Greenberg concedes that the Shirelles sound needs updating. The women record the resplendent title number, co-written by the then-up-and-coming Burt Bacharach. For a fleeting instant, the first major girl group of the rock era and the show about them seem to be going somewhere new.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: This excerpt praises individual performances (Leavel's 'pitch-perfect' work) but describes parts as 'threadbare' and suggests the show only briefly achieves its potential. The final line implies promise that isn't fully realized. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises individual performances, particularly Leavel, but suggests limitations in the material ('threadbare parts'). The mention of a 'fleeting instant' of novelty implies mixed feelings about the show's overall impact. | Gemini: The review praises Leavel's performance and notes a resplendent title number, but the overall tone suggests a qualified recommendation due to the 'threadbare parts' and fleeting moment of novelty. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While praising Beth Leavel's performance as 'pitch-perfect' and the title number as 'resplendent,' the critic describes the material as 'threadbare' and suggests the show only fleetingly succeeds.",
