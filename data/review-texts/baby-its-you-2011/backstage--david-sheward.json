  "bwwExcerpt": "If your show is in trouble, be sure to get Beth Leavel in your cast...With subtle humor, expert timing, and knockout pipes, Leavel strives mightily to bring this mishmash of a rock tuner up to her level, but she can't perform miracles.  There is an audience for this kind of show...but if you crave a well-written story with your nostalgic score, walk on by.",
