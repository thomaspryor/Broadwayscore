  "bwwExcerpt": "If your show is in trouble, be sure to get Beth Leavel in your cast...With subtle humor, expert timing, and knockout pipes, Leavel strives mightily to bring this mishmash of a rock tuner up to her level, but she can't perform miracles.  There is an audience for this kind of show...but if you crave a well-written story with your nostalgic score, walk on by.",

Praises Leavel's performance but calls the show a 'mishmash' that she 'can't perform miracles' to save. Single excerpt limits confidence but tone is clearly discouraging. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges Beth Leavel's strong performance but ultimately suggests the show is a 'mishmash' and not well-written, recommending to 'walk on by' for those seeking a good story. This indicates a negative assessment despite some positive elements. | Gemini: The review praises Beth Leavel's performance but ultimately recommends that audiences \"walk on by\" if they want a well-written story, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: While the critic praises Beth Leavel's committed performance, they call the show a 'mishmash' and explicitly advise audiences seeking a well-written story to 'walk on by,' constituting a clear recommendation against seeing the production.",
