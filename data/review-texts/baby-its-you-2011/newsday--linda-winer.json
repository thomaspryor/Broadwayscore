However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be cherry-picked from a longer, more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a lack of enthusiasm by calling it 'just another jukebox musical,' which implies it doesn't stand out. However, without a full review, the sentiment is unclear, leading to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a negative sentiment, labeling the show as \"just another jukebox musical.\" Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the tone suggests a negative assessment. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
