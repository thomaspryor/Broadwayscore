Toward the end, it really has become a jukebox musical, adding songs for atmosphere rather than consistency.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic finds fundamental structural problems with the musical - the story can't sustain the show, random song additions, and devolution into atmosphere over consistency. However, this is only one excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates significant issues with the musical's structure and coherence, suggesting it cannot sustain itself. The mention of songs being added for atmosphere rather than consistency further implies a lack of cohesion. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so a conservative score within the Negative range is appropriate. | Gemini: The review states the story cannot sustain the musical and that it becomes a jukebox musical, indicating a negative assessment. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to medium confidence. | Kimi: The critic identifies fatal structural flaws, noting the story cannot sustain the musical format and devolves into inconsistent jukebox formatting by the second act. Single excerpt limits confidence.",
