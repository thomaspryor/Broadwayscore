  "bwwExcerpt": "Flo herself is a Strong Sassy Lady so plainly traced from type, you can practically see the outline perforations. Leavel bears up and sings well, but there's little to rescue here. The real Flo Greenberg was, in her own words, \"a white woman who was in a black business and who couldn't carry a tune.\" Whereas the stage version sings her heart out - only, whoops! There's nothing in it.",
