    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt with neutral language - 'competently crafted' suggests adequate but uninspiring execution. This reads as factual description rather than recommendation, placing it in mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'competently crafted,' which suggests adequacy but not strong praise. The lack of superlatives or strong recommendations indicates a mixed review. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt limitation. | Gemini: The phrase \"competently crafted\" suggests a mildly positive assessment. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the lower end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers faint praise describing the show as 'competently crafted,' suggesting adequate professional execution but lacking the enthusiasm of a full recommendation, consistent with a barely positive, qualified verdict. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
