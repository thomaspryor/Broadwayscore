  "bwwExcerpt": "The show opened Wednesday night at the Broadhurst and boasts nearly three dozen hit songs. Among them, \"I Met Him on a Sunday,\" \"He's So Fine,\" \"Dedicated to the One I Love\" and \"Walk on By.\" The title of that last hit is my advice for this production, considering that the songs are so blandly performed they don't make an impression.",
