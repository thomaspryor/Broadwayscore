  "bwwExcerpt": "Mutrux and Sheldon Epps' in-and-out staging is like a glorified revue, an impression reinforced by the book's bullet-point approach. The biographical elements dig barely deeper than the superfluous historical markers (\"As 1960 passes, 'Bonanza' is TV's best\"). With more ambition and focus, \"Baby It's You!\" could have been \"Jersey Girls\" -- the female answer to the juggernaut musical about the Four Seasons.",
