The B- rating indicates a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review suggests the show is \"easy on the ear and the brain,\" but also notes thin characters and glancingly touched-upon themes, indicating a mixed recommendation. The B- grade also suggests a mixed assessment. | Kimi: B- grade and qualified recommendation for audiences seeking undemanding fare, though critic notes substantial flaws including thin characters and superficial thematic treatment. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
