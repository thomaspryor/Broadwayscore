  "bwwExcerpt": "Tomei knows from Italian-flavored portraiture. (She won an Oscar playing a character named Mona Lisa Vito in 'My Cousin Vinny.') If, in the closefitting 1950s slips and dresses the costume designer Clint Ramos has provided, her affect is more cuddly pixie than temperamental colossus, she is nonetheless a bold and inventive comic performer. Unfortunately, she is in hard-fought competition with her environment. It's not that she's operating in a vacuum, which might be easier. Cullman has populated the stage with an ever-present chorus of singing Italian women and frantic children.",

This indicates a positive, though not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: Brief excerpt offers clear, warm praise for Tomei's performance with no negative caveats visible, though truncated length prevents assessment of full show verdict.",
