The Italian-Americans living along the Gulf Coast in the Roundabout Theater Company’s untethered revival of Tennessee Williams’s “The Rose Tattoo” are really up against the elements, and so are the actors playing them.\n\nBut it’s nothing as palpable as a hurricane that keeps knocking them off balance and making them flail like sandpipers in a heavy wind. To understand what’s sweeping through this production, which opened at the American Airlines Theater on Tuesday with a cast led by a valiant Marisa Tomei, listen to the words of Assunta, a wise old Sicilian signora.\n\n“There is something wild in the air,” says Assunta (Carolyn Mignini), in the play’s opening moments, to Serafina (Tomei), the ecstatically married wife of a virile truck driver. “No wind but everything is moving.” She adds that she can hear the noises of the stars.\n\nA skeptical Serafina, who says she sees “nothing moving,” ascribes the noise to termites. But Trip Cullman, the imaginative but erratic director here, appears to have taken Assunta’s emotional weather report to heart.\n\nJust look at Mark Wendland’s wide-open set (lushly lighted by Ben Stanton), which conjures a world without walls. Pieces of furniture, door frames, a sewing machine and a candle-laden shrine to the Virgin Mary seem to float against a video backdrop of waves lapping against a shore. (Lucy Mackinnon did the projection design). And huddled beneath the power lines that stretch above the stage is a thick congregation of pink flamingos.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Tomei knows from Italian-flavored portraiture. (She won an Oscar playing a character named Mona Lisa Vito in 'My Cousin Vinny.') If, in the closefitting 1950s slips and dresses the costume designer Clint Ramos has provided, her affect is more cuddly pixie than temperamental colossus, she is nonetheless a bold and inventive comic performer. Unfortunately, she is in hard-fought competition with her environment. It's not that she's operating in a vacuum, which might be easier. Cullman has populated the stage with an ever-present chorus of singing Italian women and frantic children.",
