  "fullText": "There are many cues to what’s wrong with this overly broad third Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams’ dated play, starring Marisa Tomei as Serafina Delle Rose, a Sicilian immigrant seamstress who turns from besotted wife to grieving widow to betrayed widow (because her husband had a mistress) to hopeful new lover…a dance of romance between two that is meant to be funny and charming and heartwarming but presents these Italian-Americans as something less than the fully human characters for which Williams is justly lauded….The Roundabout production of The Rose Tattoo is most useful in letting us understand why there have been so relatively few Broadway revivals of this play. It will surely come as a surprise – and a comment on changing tastes and values? — that The Rose Tattoo is the only work by Williams to have won the Tony Award for Best Play.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Calls the revival 'overly broad' and the play 'dated,' criticizes fundamental character work. Despite single excerpt warning, the criticism of core dramatic elements indicates negative assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the revival for being 'overly broad' and failing to present fully human characters, indicating a negative view. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so a low confidence score is appropriate. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the revival as \"overly broad\" and the characters as \"something less than fully human,\" indicating a negative assessment. The limited text and the warning about curated excerpts reduce confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production as overly broad, the source material as dated, and faults the characterization as lacking full humanity. With only one curated excerpt available, the full verdict may differ, but the provided text clearly discourages attendance.",
