  "fullText": "There are many cues to what’s wrong with this overly broad third Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams’ dated play, starring Marisa Tomei as Serafina Delle Rose, a Sicilian immigrant seamstress who turns from besotted wife to grieving widow to betrayed widow (because her husband had a mistress) to hopeful new lover…a dance of romance between two that is meant to be funny and charming and heartwarming but presents these Italian-Americans as something less than the fully human characters for which Williams is justly lauded….The Roundabout production of The Rose Tattoo is most useful in letting us understand why there have been so relatively few Broadway revivals of this play. It will surely come as a surprise – and a comment on changing tastes and values? — that The Rose Tattoo is the only work by Williams to have won the Tony Award for Best Play.
