  "bwwExcerpt": "The unceasingly creative force of nature called Twyla Tharp returns to town importuning audiences to 'Come Fly Away,' but her third Broadway dance revue only intermittently gets off the ground. This despite an impressive dance corps, a handsome production, a fine swing band and Ol' Blue Eyes croonin' away from limboland. Sinatra's seductive voice and Tharp's sexy moves are well matched, building to some impressively climactic peaks. General audiences, though, might well run out of stamina before the dancers do.",
