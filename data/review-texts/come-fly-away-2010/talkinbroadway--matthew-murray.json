This suggests a positive recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review states the show is \"gorgeous\" and \"thrilling\", but not \"transcendent\", indicating a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: The critic offers strong praise for the visual beauty and thrilling experience but qualifies the recommendation by noting the production falls short of transcendent greatness.",
