  "bwwExcerpt": "'Come Fly Away,' Twyla Tharp's new dance musical inspired by the vocal recordings and nightclub style of Frank Sinatra, would probably make ideal cruise ship entertainment. But if you are looking for an engaging story and not simply an overproduced, two-hour dance recital, you had better look elsewhere.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative recommendation telling audiences to 'look elsewhere' and dismissing it as 'cruise ship entertainment' and an 'overproduced dance recital' rather than engaging theater. | GPT-4o: The review suggests the show lacks an engaging story and is more suited to a cruise ship, implying it does not meet expectations for a Broadway production. The single excerpt indicates a negative view, but the limited text reduces confidence. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that if you're looking for a story, you should look elsewhere, indicating a negative recommendation. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the show as suitable only for cruise ship entertainment, lacking an engaging story, and explicitly advises audiences seeking substance to look elsewhere.",
