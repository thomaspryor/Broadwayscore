  "bwwExcerpt": "Fly me to the moon\nLet me play among the stars\nLet me see what spring is like\nOn Jupiter and Mars\nBart Howard's words are as good as any to conjure the euphoric, elating spirit of Twyla Tharp's newest contribution to Broadway. Come Fly Away invites its audience to do just that, and then delivers: it's a joyous, beauteous, magic-carpet ride of a musical, celebrating the rhythms of love and the human body. If spring on Jupiter is anything like this, I want to go there for my next vacation.",
