  "bwwExcerpt": "Because the nine main dancers are remarkable -- the women extremely “ballon” (i.e., floating on air) and the men robustly intense (a double tour en l’air is child’s play to them) -- one can live with a certain amount of repetitiousness. We are duly tickled, fascinated and stunned by what we see, but almost never moved, for excitement is not tantamount to beauty. With Balanchine, say, the music dictates the choreography; with Tharp, the choreography lords it over the music.",
