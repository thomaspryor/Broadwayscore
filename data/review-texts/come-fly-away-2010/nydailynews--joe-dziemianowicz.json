    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges significant flaws ('more style than substance') but concludes with a rhetorical question suggesting acceptance of those flaws given the production values. The 60 rating confirms mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The critic acknowledges the show's aesthetic appeal but criticizes its lack of substance. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review, indicating a balance of positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's visual and auditory appeal but notes a lack of substance, resulting in a mixed assessment. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60/100 rating places this firmly in the Mixed range, with praise for visual and auditory elements offset by criticism of shallow content, resulting in a qualified endorsement.",
