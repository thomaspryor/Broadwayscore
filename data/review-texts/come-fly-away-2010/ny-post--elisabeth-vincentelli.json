  "bwwExcerpt": "\" Tharp doesn't illustrate the lyrics, going instead for mood  inspired by the music itself. The upside is that this avoids  heavy-handed (or is that heavy-footed?) mimicry. Many of the most  compelling moments occur when seduction is coated in ferocity, as in  \"That's Life,\" which feels true to Sinatra's less savory side.\"",
