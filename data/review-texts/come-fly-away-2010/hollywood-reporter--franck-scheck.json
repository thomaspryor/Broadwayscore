  "bwwExcerpt": "Tharp's choreography is consistently striking and inventive, taking a more abstract, sensual tone in the second act, when the performers shed a good deal of their clothing.\nBut despite the sensational dancing on display, the show inevitably loses impact over the course of its two-hour running time, though the inevitable finale of 'New York, New York' manages to end things on a properly buoyant note.",

The structure 'But despite...' signals that the negatives outweigh the positives. With only one excerpt available, this could represent a broader mixed-to-negative assessment. | GPT-4o: The review praises the choreography as 'striking and inventive' but notes that the show 'loses impact' over time, suggesting a mixed experience with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review praises the choreography and dancing but notes that the show loses impact over time. The ending is described as 'properly buoyant,' suggesting a somewhat positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic conclusion. | Kimi: While praising Tharp's choreography as 'sensational' and 'striking,' the critic notes the production 'inevitably loses impact' over its runtime, offering a balanced assessment with both significant praise and criticism.",
