  "bwwExcerpt": "Tharp's choreography is consistently striking and inventive, taking a more abstract, sensual tone in the second act, when the performers shed a good deal of their clothing.\nBut despite the sensational dancing on display, the show inevitably loses impact over the course of its two-hour running time, though the inevitable finale of 'New York, New York' manages to end things on a properly buoyant note.",
