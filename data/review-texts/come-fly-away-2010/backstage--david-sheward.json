  "bwwExcerpt": "After hitting a home run with Billy Joel ('Movin' Out') and striking out with Bob Dylan ('The Times They Are A-Changin' '), Twyla Tharp is back on her A game, this time with Frank Sinatra as a collaborator. 'Come Fly Away,' her tribute to the classic romanticism of one of the 20th century's greatest pop stylists, is a jazz, a gas, a cuckoo-cuckoo, ring-a-ding fling, man! There's not much of a plot, but I didn't miss one as 15 sexy, athletic dancers coupled and uncoupled to the Chairman of the Board's recorded voice combined with a rich live orchestra and augmented by the sweet crooning of featured vocalist Hilary Gardner. Kudos to sound designer Peter McBoyle for making it seem as if Sinatra were still alive and duetting with Gardner.",
