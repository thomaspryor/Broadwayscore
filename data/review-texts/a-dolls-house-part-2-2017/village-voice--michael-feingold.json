Ideas seem to shoot off in all directions...Ibsen might well applaud…Hnath, deconstructing both Nora’s arguments and her opponents’ layer by layer, has reawakened the clash between her psychology and her premises. Ibsen painstakingly planted the seed that flowers, in ‘A Doll’s House, Part 2,’ bearing bitter, complexly flavored fruit that, 138 years later, we still need to learn how to swallow.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with sophisticated praise ('powerfully dense and elegantly sparse', 'Ibsen might well applaud') suggests strong appreciation for the playwright's craft, but limited text warrants low confidence and upper-positive range scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides high praise for the play's intellectual depth and execution, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is very positive, using phrases like \"powerfully dense and elegantly sparse\" and suggesting Ibsen would applaud. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strong evaluative language ('powerfully,' 'elegantly,' 'Ibsen might well applaud') to praise the play's construction and thematic complexity, indicating a strong positive recommendation despite the limited available text.",
