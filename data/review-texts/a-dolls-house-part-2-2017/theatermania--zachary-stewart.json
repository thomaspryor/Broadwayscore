Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone suggests a strong positive recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"delightful\", \"hilarious\", \"thoughtful\", and \"revelatory\", indicating a positive review. Given the single excerpt, I am placing it on the higher end of the positive scale. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the writing, direction, and performances, describing the production as delightful, hilarious, and revelatory without any noted reservations.",
