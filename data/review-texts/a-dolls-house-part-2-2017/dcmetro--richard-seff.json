    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'fascinating and often funny' with 'gifted actors' and ranking it 'amongst the best of the season.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the play, highlighting its fascinating and funny nature, and the gifted performances. The phrase 'ranks high amongst the best of the season' indicates a highly positive view, fitting the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"fascinating,\" \"funny,\" \"surprise and delight,\" and concludes that the play \"ranks high amongst the best of the season.\" Given the single excerpt, I am scoring it on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise, calling the play 'fascinating and often funny' with 'gifted actors' who 'surprise and delight,' and explicitly ranks it amongst the season's best productions.",
