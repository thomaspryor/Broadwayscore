    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Consistently positive language throughout: 'superb production', 'spectacular acting', 'Metcalf dazzles', 'very smart play'. However, single excerpt warning requires caution - scored at upper end of Positive bucket given unqualified praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'superb' and highlights 'spectacular acting' and 'provocative questions,' indicating a strong positive impression. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is at the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"superb production\", \"spectacular acting\", and \"dazzles\", indicating a strong recommendation. The phrase \"very smart play\" further reinforces this positive assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strong praise ('superb production,' 'spectacular acting,' 'Metcalf dazzles') indicating a clear recommendation, though as a single curated excerpt it may not capture the full review's nuance.",
