    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it the playwright's 'best work to date' and 'compact and provocative,' with enthusiastic description of lead performance. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears cherry-picked positive content, so scoring upper end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as Hnath's best work to date and highlights intriguing presentation of themes, suggesting a strong positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt contains strong praise such as \"best work to date\" and \"intriguing ways\", suggesting a positive recommendation. The limited text makes confidence medium. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise calling the play Hnath's best work to date with intriguing presentation and an excellent lead performance, meriting the upper end of the Positive bucket per the single-excerpt guideline for clearly positive quotes.",
