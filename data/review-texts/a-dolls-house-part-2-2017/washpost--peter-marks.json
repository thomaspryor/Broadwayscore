This never occurs...This is due in part to a playwright’s provocative, funny and, ultimately, generous consideration of the implications of Nora’s actions and to a director, Sam Gold, who has helped each of the actors home in with psychological marksmanship on the core motivations of their characters.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it a 'breakthrough play' with compliments for playwright, director, and actors. Single excerpt warning suggests caution, but language is clearly enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as a 'breakthrough' and praises the playwright and director for their work, suggesting a highly positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the play as a \"breakthrough\" and highlights the playwright's and director's contributions, indicating a positive assessment. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise calling the work a 'breakthrough' that avoids superficiality, highlighting the playwright's provocative and generous writing alongside precise direction, though as a single curated quote the overall verdict may not be fully represented.",
