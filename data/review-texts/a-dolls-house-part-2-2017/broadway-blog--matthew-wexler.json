    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with superlatives ('tour de force', 'precision of a surgeon', 'nothing short of electric') and acknowledgment of Tony nominations suggests enthusiastic recommendation. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('tour de force', 'exquisitely directed', 'nothing short of electric') and mentions Tony nominations for all ensemble members, indicating high praise. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"nimbly written\", \"exquisitely directed\", and \"tour de force\". Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt features strongly positive evaluative language including 'tour de force,' 'exquisitely directed,' and 'electric,' warranting an upper-range Positive score per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts. Confidence is low given the availability of only one curated quote that may not represent the full review's verdict.",
