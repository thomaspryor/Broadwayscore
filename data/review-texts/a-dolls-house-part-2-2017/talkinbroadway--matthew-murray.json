    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for the play ('funny and insightful'), director ('ideal', 'done what he does best'), and cast ('excellent'). However, single excerpt warning requires low confidence as this may not represent the full review's verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as 'funny and insightful' and highlights the creative approach of the playwright and director. Despite the limited excerpt, the positive language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the play as \"funny and insightful\" and highlights the director's and cast's excellent work, indicating a positive recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the play's writing, direction, and performances, calling it 'funny and insightful' with an 'excellent cast', indicating a clear positive recommendation despite limited context.",
