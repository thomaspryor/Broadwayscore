Under Jennifer Tipton's lighting, the characters are as if put under the microscope. Although the facts deal with the 19th century, the issues being raised could be today. Nor does the play take a strictly feminist view point: Hnath has considered the situation from all sides.\"\n\nRead more",

However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the play's engrossing debate and relevant issues, suggesting a positive, though not ecstatic, recommendation. The lack of a clear, direct recommendation and the single excerpt available reduce confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the play's consistent engagement and surprising debate, with no negative caveats present in the available text.",
