  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"An entertaining if not especially revelatory evening in the theater...Directed with uncharacteristic obviousness by the usually understated Sam Gold, the starry cast spends most of the time facing us, delivering set pieces. Especially surprising in this blatantness is Laurie Metcalf hamming it up in her liberated Nora...Cooper’s Torvald is the clever surprise...The show is fun in its wink-wink, nudge-nudge references to the original play and the gaps among various verbal styles.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review calls it 'entertaining' and 'fun' but criticizes the direction as 'obvious' and 'blatant.' Single excerpt warning applies - this appears barely positive with reservations. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as entertaining but not particularly insightful, with some criticism of the direction and performances. The tone suggests a mixed experience, with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review calls the show \"entertaining\" but also notes that it is not especially revelatory. The direction is criticized as being uncharacteristically obvious. Given the single excerpt and the mixed signals, I'm scoring it as a low-end positive. | Kimi: While the critic finds the production 'entertaining' and 'fun,' the praise is qualified by 'not especially revelatory' and significant criticism of the direction as 'obvious' and Metcalf's performance as 'hamming it up,' indicating a mild recommendation with reservations.",
