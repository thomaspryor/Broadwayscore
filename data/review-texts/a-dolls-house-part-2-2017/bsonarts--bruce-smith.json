The production is near perfect. Laurie Metcalf gives a fully dimensioned performance...Sam Gold’s direction is clear and smart...But the real star of this production is Hnath’s script. Rarely is something from the past made so present.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for script ('real star'), direction ('clear and smart'), and lead performance, with 'near perfect' production assessment. Single excerpt warning suggests this is cherry-picked positive content, so scoring in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the production, performances, and script, indicating an enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt and potential cherry-picking, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the script, direction, and performances. Despite being a single excerpt, the language suggests a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers strong praise ('near perfect', 'rarely is something...made so present') for the production, performances, and script, suggesting a clear recommendation, though confidence is reduced due to limited available text.",
