  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"It quickly becomes evident that 'A Doll’s House, Part 2,' the musing of playwright Lucas Hnath, is refreshingly creative...The dialogue is very much in contemporary vernacular, and that is a wise choice, avoiding making the play seem like faux Ibsen. A further plus is a superb cast and clever plotting...The play leaves me with uneasy questions about the take on Nora...Her trajectory is interesting to ponder, which makes the play all the more fascinating.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for creativity, cast, and plotting, with intellectual engagement ('fascinating') despite some reservations about characterization. Single excerpt from positive review warrants upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as 'refreshingly creative' with 'superb cast and clever plotting,' indicating a strong positive recommendation. The mention of 'uneasy questions' adds depth rather than detracting from the praise. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"refreshingly creative\", \"wise choice\", \"superb cast\", and \"clever plotting\", indicating a positive recommendation. Due to the limited text, confidence is low, but the language suggests a strong positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the creative writing, superb cast, and clever plotting, ultimately finding the play 'fascinating' despite raising questions about the protagonist's trajectory.",
