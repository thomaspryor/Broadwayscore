There are times it produces the impression of having been forged by a playwright noting the choices made by a gathering of four gifted actors who've been asked to improvise plausible backstories...It's occasionally hoist by its own cleverness…Anything with Laurie Metcalf is worth seeing; to have her onstage throughout this play's…90 minutes is alone worth the price of admission.”\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning applies - this appears to be a qualified positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review praises the show as entertaining and thoughtful, with Laurie Metcalf's performance highlighted as a major draw. However, it also notes that the play is often unconvincing and occasionally too clever, indicating some reservations. | Gemini: The review states the play is \"entertaining, frequently funny, and quite thoughtful\" and that Laurie Metcalf's presence is \"worth the price of admission,\" indicating a positive recommendation despite reservations about its believability. | Kimi: The critic explicitly recommends the show ('worth the price of admission') based on Laurie Metcalf's performance, despite significant criticisms that the writing is 'unconvincing' and occasionally 'hoist by its own cleverness.'",
