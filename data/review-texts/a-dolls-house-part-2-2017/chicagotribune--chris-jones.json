  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Hnath has created a fascinating and frequently very funny little play that is less about the issues raised in 'A Doll's House,' and more about returning to greet your former responsibilities...The other takeaway of this quite compelling little exercise is that acts of revolution can flow from privilege...This really is a multilayered performance: you can see Ibsen's Nora herein, plus the woman Nora became and the compassionate cracks in her armor. And Rashad rises up to meet her.\"  \n\nRead more",
