  "fullText": "Theater review by Adam FeldmanWith Lucas Hnath's lucid and absorbing A Doll's House, Part 2, the Broadway season goes out with a bang. It is not the same kind of bang, mind you, that ended Henrik Ibsen's 1879 social drama, A Doll's House, in which bourgeois Norwegian wife Nora Helmer walked out on her doting husband and young children with a decisive (and divisive) slam of the door. In Hnath's taut sequel, set 15 years later, the runaway bride—played by the great Laurie Metcalf, with magnificent grit and frustration—returns to confront the people she left behind: her husband, Torvald (a sympathetic Chris Cooper); her now-grown daughter, Emmy (Condola Rashad, poised and glinting); and the family servant, Anne Marie (the uncommonly sensible Jayne Houdyshell).If Ibsen's play is about suffocation, Hnath's is about airing things out. Modern in its language, mordant in its humor and suspenseful in its plotting—Nora, now a scandalous writer, needs Torvald's help to avoid being blackmailed by a judge—the play judiciously balances conflicting ideas about freedom, love and responsibility. And Sam Gold's exemplary direction keeps you hanging on each turn of argument and twist of knife. Everything about the production works. It's a slam dunk. John Golden Theatre (Broadway). By Lucas Hnath. Directed by Sam Gold. With Laurie Metcalf, Chris Cooper, Jayne Houdyshell, Condola Rashad. Running time: 1hr 25mins. No intermission. Through July 23.",

The review praises the play's balance of ideas, direction, and performances, particularly Metcalf's, indicating a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly positive, calling the play a \"worthy successor\" and Metcalf's performance \"nothing short of magnificent.\" The critic also uses phrases like \"lucid and absorbing\" and \"slam dunk,\" indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers unreserved praise for the writing, direction, and performances—particularly Metcalf's 'magnificent' turn—calling the production a 'slam dunk' and 'worthy successor to Ibsen's masterpiece,' while the explicit 80 rating anchors it in the strong positive range.",
