  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A bright (in all senses of the word), albeit slight 90-minute play that cleverly follows up on some of Ibsen’s themes about marriage and equality. Better yet, the seemingly tireless Sam Gold has directed a beautifully chosen four-person cast that brings out both the work’s layers and its levity...It’s partly Metcalf’s generosity to her fellow performers that makes the production work as well as it does; she’s a star who has no interest in a star turn.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Review praises the direction as 'beautifully chosen' and notes the production 'works as well as it does,' but calls the play 'slight.' Single excerpt warning applies - this appears to be a solid positive recommendation but confidence is low due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the play's cleverness and the director's work, with a positive mention of the cast's performance. However, it notes the play is 'slight', indicating some reservation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of Positive. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses positive language such as \"bright,\" \"cleverly,\" and \"beautifully chosen.\" Given the single excerpt, I am scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the direction and performances, calling the play 'bright' and 'clever,' though the 'slight' qualifier keeps it from Rave territory. The tone is clearly appreciative and recommendatory.",
