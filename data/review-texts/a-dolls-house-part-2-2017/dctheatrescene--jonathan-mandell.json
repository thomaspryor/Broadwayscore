    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('clever,' 'surprisingly amusing,' 'winning effect,' 'first-rate actors') but single excerpt warning requires caution. Upper end of Positive bucket due to unqualified praise, low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as 'clever,' 'amusing,' and 'thought-provoking,' with 'first-rate actors.' The tone is clearly positive, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the play as clever, amusing, and thought-provoking, highlighting the excellent performances of the actors. This suggests a positive recommendation, especially for those interested in strong acting. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for both the play's writing ('clever,' 'thought-provoking') and the performances ('first-rate,' 'winning effect'), indicating a solid recommendation. Confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
