Which for the record never feels like a debate, such is the emotional commitment of the cast and the immediacy of Mr. Gold’s fine, sensitive production.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong superlatives throughout ('magnificent', 'one of the best casts in town', 'utterly engrossing') with praise for writing, performances, and direction. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the play, highlighting its intelligence, humor, and engrossing nature, as well as the exceptional performance of Laurie Metcalf and the cast. The language used is highly positive, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language such as 'smart, funny, utterly engrossing', 'magnificent', and 'best casts in town'. Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unambiguously enthusiastic praise ('utterly engrossing', 'magnificent', 'one of the best casts'), warranting the upper end of the Positive range. Confidence is low due to the single-excerpt format risking cherry-picked positivity. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
