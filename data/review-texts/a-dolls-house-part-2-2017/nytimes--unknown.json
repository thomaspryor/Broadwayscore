    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong superlatives throughout ('magnificent', 'one of the best casts in town', 'utterly engrossing') with praise for writing, performances, and direction. Despite being a single excerpt, the language is unqualifiedly enthusiastic, placing it in Rave territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the play, highlighting its intelligence, humor, and engrossing nature, as well as the exceptional performance of Laurie Metcalf and the cast. The language used suggests a highly positive reception. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language such as \"smart, funny and utterly engrossing\" and \"magnificent Laurie Metcalf.\" Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unambiguously enthusiastic praise ('utterly engrossing,' 'magnificent,' 'best casts,' 'fine, sensitive production'), warranting the upper end of the Positive range per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
