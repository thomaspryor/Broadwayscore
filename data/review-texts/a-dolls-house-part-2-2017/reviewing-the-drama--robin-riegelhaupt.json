  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The young and promising Hnath wrote an incredibly compelling play, bringing a modern sensibility and vernacular to this dusty classic. Much of the funny and persuasive dialogue is delivered in speeches, not unlike in Ibsen's play, yet this small but mighty cast palpably reacts to and connects with one another...The play belongs, though, to three-time Tony nominee Laurie Metcalf, who absolutely commands the stage.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the playwright's work ('incredibly compelling') and lead performance ('absolutely commands the stage'), but only one excerpt available limits confidence in overall verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as 'incredibly compelling' and highlights strong performances, particularly by Laurie Metcalf. The positive language suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the play as \"incredibly compelling\" and highlights Laurie Metcalf's commanding performance, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt uses strongly positive language ('incredibly compelling', 'absolutely commands the stage', 'mighty cast'), indicating an enthusiastic recommendation, though limited context requires conservative confidence.",
