    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt acknowledges contemporary resonance and staging but criticizes the script for lack of originality and artifice. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears genuinely mixed rather than cherry-picked negative from positive review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the play for lacking originality and running out of ideas, with a sense of artifice that doesn't match Ibsen's integration of ideas. This suggests a negative assessment, though the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges contemporary resonance but also criticizes the lack of originality and integration of ideas, suggesting a mixed assessment. The truncated nature of the text lowers the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the script's contemporary resonance and staging but delivers significant criticism regarding the play's lack of originality, artificial speechifying, and failure to sustain its ideas, suggesting a mixed assessment.",
