  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"My first thought as I experienced this brilliant play is that it is too good for Broadway, which is sadder for Broadway than for the play...One of the fascinating aspects of the play and the simple but effective production by the ubiquitous Sam Gold is the confluence of past and present...Unlike 'Sweat,' which will probably win all the awards, 'A Doll's House, Part 2,' is never preachy. It never falls into melodrama. It deserved the cheering it got at the performance I attended.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Calls the play 'brilliant' and says it 'deserved the cheering.' Despite being only an excerpt, the language is clearly enthusiastic with superlatives. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('brilliant', 'deserved the cheering') and contrasts it favorably to another play, indicating a high level of enthusiasm. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is set at the lower end of the Rave range. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, calling the play 'brilliant' and praising the production. The critic also notes that it 'deserved the cheering it got.' | Kimi: The excerpt contains unambiguous superlatives ('brilliant,' 'too good for Broadway') and strong praise for the production, though confidence is limited to 'low' due to availability of only a single curated excerpt. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
