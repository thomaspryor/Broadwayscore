  "bwwExcerpt": "Now with Julie White, another Best Actress Tony winner, taking over the role of Nora, joined by Obie winner Stephen McKinley Henderson, Erin Wilhelmi and remaining original cast member Jayne Houdyshell (another Tony winner), the dynamics of the evening have shifted a bit, with the play, and director Sam Gold's production, remaining as fascinating as ever.",

However, this is only a single curated excerpt about cast changes, so confidence is low and the positive assessment may not represent the full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'fascinating as ever' with a strong cast, suggesting a positive view. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low, but the tone is clearly positive. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates the play and production remain \"fascinating,\" suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited text and single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt clearly praises the production as 'fascinating as ever' despite cast changes, indicating a positive recommendation. However, confidence is low given only one curated excerpt is available.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Gold's invigorating production showcases four stellar performances. Metcalf is a master of drawing out comedy that's firmly anchored in realism...Houdyshell's Anne Marie is a dry and stoic presence that deflates Nora's pride in her accomplishments by pointing out the reality she never sees, and Rashad effectively conveys the maturity of a young woman forced to grow up early...This is a play that will no doubt provoke discussion.\" \n\nRead more"
