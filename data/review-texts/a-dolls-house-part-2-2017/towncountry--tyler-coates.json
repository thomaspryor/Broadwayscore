  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'A Doll’s House Part 2' is an ingenious post-modern comedy that showcases a brilliantly manic star turn from Laurie Metcalf...By changing the script—quite literally, by adding an epilogue to Ibsen’s text—Hnath has made Nora Hemler much more human: she’s still heroic, she’s still bold and brash. But she’s also flawed, erratic, and, through Metcalf’s revelatory comic timing, truly funny.\"\n\nRead more",

Despite the limited text, the language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the play as \"ingenious\" and Metcalf's performance as a \"brilliantly manic star turn,\" indicating a strong positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt contains enthusiastic praise ('ingenious', 'brilliantly', 'revelatory') indicating a strong recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
