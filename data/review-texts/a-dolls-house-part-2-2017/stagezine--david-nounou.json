    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Exceptional praise with superlatives ('thrill ride of the season', 'monumental', 'best play of the year'), but confidence is low due to single curated excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives like 'thrill ride', 'monumental', and 'best play of the year', indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"thrill ride\", \"absolutely astounding\", \"monumental\", and predicts it will be named best play of the year, indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers superlative praise including predictions of 'best play of the year' honors and declares it the 'thrill ride of the theatrical season,' warranting a high-positive score despite limited context.",
