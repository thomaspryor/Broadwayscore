  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The thrill ride of the theatrical season...What is absolutely astounding is how Mr. Hnath has taken Ibsen’s characters and given them new and far more complicated lives than Ibsen would have ever imagined...The performances are among the best you will see this season…Laurie Metcalf is monumental and a force to be reckoned with…With expert writing and excellent performances, I can easily see 'The Doll’s House, Part 2' being named the best play of the year.”\n\nRead more",
