  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The incomparable Laurie Metcalfe is Nora…Metcalfe mines humor in Nora’s accounts of her life. She’s expressive and looms large onstage…Directed by Sam Gold, the talented cast of four is rounded out by Chris Cooper as Torvald, seemingly gentle, chastened and sincere, and, as grown daughter Emmy, Condola Rashad is absolutely adorable, speaking quickly and dispassionately with a touch of naïveté. The cast is wonderful and all four have been nominated for theater awards.”\n\nRead more",

However, low confidence due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of positive quotes. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances, particularly Laurie Metcalfe, and notes award nominations for the entire cast, suggesting a strong positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Laurie Metcalfe's performance and the cast in general, indicating a positive experience. The limited text and excerpt-only warning reduce confidence. | Kimi: The single excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the entire ensemble, describing Laurie Metcalf as incomparable and Condola Rashad as absolutely adorable, with clear positive evaluative language throughout.",
