  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The incomparable Laurie Metcalfe is Nora…Metcalfe mines humor in Nora’s accounts of her life. She’s expressive and looms large onstage…Directed by Sam Gold, the talented cast of four is rounded out by Chris Cooper as Torvald, seemingly gentle, chastened and sincere, and, as grown daughter Emmy, Condola Rashad is absolutely adorable, speaking quickly and dispassionately with a touch of naïveté. The cast is wonderful and all four have been nominated for theater awards.”\n\nRead more",
