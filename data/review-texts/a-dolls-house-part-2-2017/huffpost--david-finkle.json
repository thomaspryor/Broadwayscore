No comparisons are necessary. Suffice it to say that had Julie White opened when the play did, it could very well have been she who won this year’s Tony.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the playwright's skill, director's work, and lead performance with Tony-worthy comparison. However, single excerpt warning requires caution - this appears genuinely positive but may not represent full review scope. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play's direction and the cast's performance, indicating a strong recommendation. The mention of potential Tony recognition for Julie White suggests high praise. However, the confidence is low due to the single excerpt limitation. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the play's direction and the characters, indicating a positive experience. The phrase \"No comparisons are necessary\" suggests a strong endorsement of the current production. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the playwright's character work, the director's skill in maintaining quality through cast changes, and implies a Tony-worthy performance by Julie White. As a single curated excerpt, it presents a clearly positive assessment favoring the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
