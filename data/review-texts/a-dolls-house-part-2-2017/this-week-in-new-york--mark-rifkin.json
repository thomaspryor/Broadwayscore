    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, the language is unqualifiedly positive with superlatives ('divinely exquisite', 'sparkling', 'razor-sharp') and strong praise for writing, direction, and cast. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt contains unqualified praise with strong positive language such as 'extremely intelligent,' 'very, very funny,' 'razor-sharp,' and 'divinely exquisite.' Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone suggests a highly enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using phrases like \"extremely intelligent\", \"very, very funny\", \"razor-sharp\", \"illuminating\", \"wholly believable\", and \"divinely exquisite\". The director is praised as one of the theater's most inventive. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains effusive praise with superlatives like 'divinely exquisite' and 'razor-sharp,' indicating strong enthusiasm for the production. Given the cherry-picking risk with only one excerpt available, scoring at the upper end of the Positive bucket rather than Rave. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
