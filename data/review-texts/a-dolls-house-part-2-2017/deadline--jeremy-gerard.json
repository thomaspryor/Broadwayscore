  "bwwExcerpt": "The new cast members include Julie White as Nora, Stephen McKinley Henderson as Torvald, and Erin Wilhelmi as their dauughter (sic) Emmy, joining Jayne Houydeshell as the housekeeper Anne Marie. They're brilliant. White has a light touch and game business as Nora, bringing out the comic shadings in contrast to the darker woman played by Metcalf.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Unqualified praise for the cast as 'brilliant' and 'magisterial,' but this is only a single curated excerpt focusing on performances, making it difficult to assess the overall production verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of the cast members, particularly highlighting Julie White and Stephen McKinley Henderson. The language used ('brilliant', 'magisterial') suggests a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the performances of the new cast members.
