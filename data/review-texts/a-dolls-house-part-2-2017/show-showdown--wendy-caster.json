  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It's as good as everyone says…Author Lucas Hnath tells his story with humor and compassion; Sam Gold directs smoothly and smartly. The cast is excellent: Julie White is snappy yet vulnerable as Nora; Stephen McKinley Henderson is a surprisingly human Torvald; Jayne Houdyshell is her usual wonderful self as the maid who brought up Nora (and is quick to point out that she brought up Nora's kids as well); and Erin Wilhelmi is close to perfect as Nora's sweetly passive-aggressive daughter.”\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning requires caution, but tone is consistently enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show with strong positive language, highlighting the quality of the writing, direction, and performances. The phrase 'as good as everyone says' suggests a strong endorsement. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the author, director, and cast. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
