  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Hnath has now found himself by parsing and filling in a story he didn’t write...To go from dreaming about Nora’s life to writing it required a leap of faith—an author’s faith in his own imagination—and that’s the kind of energy that jumps out at you from Hnath’s play, his strongest yet...It was thrilling to feel that the writer and the director weren’t condescending to us and assumed we’d keep up. We do, because Nora matters to us and will always matter to us.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it Hnath's 'strongest yet' and describing the experience as 'thrilling,' but single excerpt warning requires caution about full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as Hnath's strongest yet and describes the experience as 'thrilling,' indicating a highly positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses phrases like \"strongest yet\" and \"thrilling to feel\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise, calling the play Hnath's 'strongest yet' and describing the production as 'thrilling' with palpable creative energy, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
