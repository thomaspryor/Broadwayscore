Single excerpt warning applies - this appears qualified positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and dialogue, indicating a positive view of the production's potential. However, it also notes some disappointment and imbalance in the cast, suggesting reservations. The single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the performances of Metcalf and Houdyshell and the dialogue, but notes that Torvald is not an equal partner and Cooper seems overwhelmed. The direction is also praised, but the review mentions that it begins to disappoint, indicating a mixed but overall positive assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt praises Metcalf and Houdyshell's performances and Gold's direction while noting that Cooper is overwhelmed and the play ultimately disappoints, suggesting a mixed verdict with notable strengths and weaknesses.",
