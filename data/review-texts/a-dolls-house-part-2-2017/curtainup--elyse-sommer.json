  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'A Doll House, Part 2' is a completely original work that can entertain and stimulate on its own...For all the talk, there's nothing talky or boring here. The talk is sharp, funny and ripe for exploding into high drama...As portrayed by Laurie Metcalf, Nora is a riveting character...While this breezy one-acter won't topple 'A Doll's House' from the list of great twentieth century plays, it's as amusing and thought-provoking as any sequel can get.\" \n\nRead more",

Despite the lack of a full review, the positive language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the script, performances, and overall entertainment value. The phrase \"amusing and thought-provoking as any sequel can get\" suggests a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the sharp, funny writing and riveting lead performance, clearly recommending the show as entertaining and stimulating despite noting it doesn't surpass the original play.",
