Metcalf and Houdyshell simply steamrolled over the play’s weaknesses, while Cooper could not resolve them with his process...The play simply did not know what it wanted to be.\"\n\nRead more",

Praises Metcalf and Houdyshell but finds major script problems and criticizes Cooper's performance. | GPT-4o: The review describes the play as a 'mixed bag' with strong performances by Metcalf and Houdyshell, but significant issues with the script and Cooper's performance. The single excerpt suggests a mixed verdict, with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review praises Metcalf and Houdyshell's performances but criticizes the script and Cooper's performance, indicating a mixed experience overall. The play 'did not know what it wanted to be' further supports a mixed classification. | Kimi: The critic explicitly labels the show a 'mixed bag,' praising lead performances (Metcalf, Houdyshell, Rashad) while criticizing Cooper's direction and the script's lack of coherent identity. Confidence is low due to single excerpt availability.",
