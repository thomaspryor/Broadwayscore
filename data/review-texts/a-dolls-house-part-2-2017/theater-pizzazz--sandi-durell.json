    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Excerpt shows strong praise for dialogue ('sharp and intelligent'), direction ('brings it to sizzling life'), and especially lead performance ('thrilling to watch'). However, single excerpt warning requires caution - setting confidence to low due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the dialogue, direction, and especially Laurie Metcalf's performance, using strong positive language. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is on the higher end of Positive but not Rave. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"thrilling\", \"limitless proportions\", and \"sizzling life\", indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performance ('thrilling', 'limitless proportions') and direction ('sizzling life'), warranting a high Positive score, though confidence is reduced due to the single-excerpt limitation.",
