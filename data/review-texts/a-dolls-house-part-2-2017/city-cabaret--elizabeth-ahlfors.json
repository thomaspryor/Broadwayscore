    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear recommendation ('worth seeing') but qualified tone and emphasis on ambiguity ('no concrete answers', outcome 'totally up to you') suggests mild positive. Single excerpt warning requires caution - this appears genuinely qualified positive rather than cherry-picked enthusiasm. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive recommendation ('worth seeing') with praise for performances and dialogue. However, the lack of concrete answers and the open-ended nature of the play suggest some reservations. Given the single excerpt and text quality warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review states the play is \"worth seeing\" but notes that the audience's feelings about the character are subjective, indicating a recommendation with reservations. Given the single excerpt, confidence is medium. | Kimi: The excerpt provides a clear recommendation ('worth seeing') along with strong praise for the performances ('zest and authority,' 'winning') and writing ('crisp dialogue'), though it notes the ambiguous ending. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
