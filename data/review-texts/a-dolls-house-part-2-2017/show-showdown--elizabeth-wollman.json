His writing is fluid and smart and often very funny...It's beginning to occur to me that Hnath works with more or less the same blueprint for every play of his...The characters in 'A Doll's House' are richer and more three-dimensional than some of those in his earlier works, which makes me hopeful that he's growing and developing as he writes.\"\n\nRead more",

Despite concerns about formulaic approach, the overall tone is appreciative and hopeful. Single excerpt warning applied - scoring upper end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast and the playwright's work, highlighting fluid and smart writing. Despite the limited context, the positive language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the cast and writing, but also notes a repetitive blueprint and expresses hope for further growth. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low, but the overall tone leans positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the cast ('slam-dunk') and writing ('fluid and smart and often very funny'), with only a mild caveat about the playwright's repetitive tendencies while noting richer character development in this work.",
