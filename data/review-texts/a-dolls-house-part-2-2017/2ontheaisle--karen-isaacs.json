    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic praises performances but criticizes the playwright's choices and expresses disappointment that the show 'could have been so much more.' This signals enjoyable but flawed, placing it in Mixed range. Low confidence due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The review praises the performances but criticizes the play's direction and missed potential. The excerpt suggests enjoyment but with significant reservations about the writing, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review states it is an \"enjoyable evening\" due to the acting, but expresses disappointment with the play's direction, indicating a positive but not rave review. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: The critic praises the acting as thrilling and calls the show an enjoyable evening, but criticizes the playwright's choices and unfulfilled potential, indicating a qualified recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
