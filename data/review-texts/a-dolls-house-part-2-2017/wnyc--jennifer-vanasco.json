  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Deeply satisfying (and very funny)…The four characters battle over what makes a marriage and whether marriage can ever be part of a happy life. But in Hnath and director Sam Gold's telling, none of them are straw men (or women). Each has a perfectly reasonable explanation for why they feel like they do. We are left with the bleak idea that some chasms are too deep to ever be bridged, no matter how well-meaning the intentions.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Opens with strong positive language ('Deeply satisfying') and praises the nuanced character work, but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'deeply satisfying' and 'very funny', indicating a positive reception. The mention of 'perfectly reasonable explanation' suggests well-developed characters. Despite the mention of a 'bleak idea', the overall tone is positive. | Gemini: The excerpt calls the show \"deeply satisfying and very funny\", which indicates a positive recommendation. However, since it's a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise ('deeply satisfying,' 'very funny') and commends the nuanced characterization and direction. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this scores at the upper end of the Positive bucket, though confidence remains low due to limited available text.",
