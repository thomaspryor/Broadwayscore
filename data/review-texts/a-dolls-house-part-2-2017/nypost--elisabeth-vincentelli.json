However, the brevity of the text limits the depth of evaluation, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review calls the play a 'worthy sequel,' indicating a positive assessment and recommendation, but not with overwhelming enthusiasm. | Kimi: The critic offers clear praise calling the play a 'worthy sequel' with 'surprising and inevitable' answers, though the brevity of the excerpt limits confidence.",
