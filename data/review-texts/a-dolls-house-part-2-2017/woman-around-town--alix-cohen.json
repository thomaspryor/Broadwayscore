  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Playwright Lucas Hnath has utilized the Henrik Ibsen’s 'A Doll’s House' as a starting point/inspiration and spun it into an entertaining tale with social context in two contrasting eras…Characters have no filters. What they think and feel comes out of their mouths with directness that belies the period, but makes whopping good theater. Everyone is multidimensional. Allegiances are complicated. Unpredictable changes become seismic before our eyes. The ending is a shock.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clearly positive language ('entertaining tale', 'whopping good theater', 'shock' ending as positive surprise). However, confidence is low due to limited text from curated excerpt that may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as 'entertaining' with 'whopping good theater' and 'unpredictable changes', suggesting a positive experience. However, only one excerpt is available, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"entertaining tale,\" \"makes whopping good theater,\" and \"unpredictable changes become seismic.\" Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I scored it on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the play's theatrical vitality and character complexity, describing it as 'whopping good theater' with a shocking ending, though the single-excerpt limitation necessitates low confidence.",
