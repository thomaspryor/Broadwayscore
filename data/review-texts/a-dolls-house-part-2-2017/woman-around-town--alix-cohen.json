  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Playwright Lucas Hnath has utilized the Henrik Ibsen’s 'A Doll’s House' as a starting point/inspiration and spun it into an entertaining tale with social context in two contrasting eras…Characters have no filters.

Unpredictable changes become seismic before our eyes. The ending is a shock.”\n\nRead more",
