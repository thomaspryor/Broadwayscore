His elegantly provocative script has been given an immaculate production, appreciatively directed by Gold and performed by a quartet of illustrious actors...It’s a gabfest revealing character, prompting laughter and piquing the intellect, with an incisiveness and wit worthy of Shaw...Revivifies the old-timey concept of a play of ideas, the sort of thing Ibsen himself used to do, and does it with vivacity and smarts.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong praise throughout with superlatives ('auspicious', 'immaculate', 'illustrious') and comparisons to Shaw and Ibsen. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is highly positive, praising the script, production, direction, and performances with strong language. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"auspicious\", \"immaculate\", \"illustrious\", \"incisiveness and wit\", and \"vivacity and smarts\", indicating a strong recommendation. The comparison to Ibsen further reinforces this. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the playwright's debut, the production quality, direction, and acting, comparing the work favorably to Shaw and Ibsen. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced regarding the full review's overall verdict. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
