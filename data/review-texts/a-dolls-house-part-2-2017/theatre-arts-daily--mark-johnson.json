Single excerpt requires caution but tone is clearly positive. | GPT-4o: Despite acknowledging a weak conclusion, the review praises the show as a needed antidote to over-produced theater, highlighting Metcalf's performance and the show's broad appeal. The excerpt suggests strong positive sentiment. | Gemini: Despite a minor criticism about the ending, the review is overwhelmingly positive, calling it an 'antivenin' and a 'crowd-pleaser' that Broadway needs more of. Metcalf's performance is also highlighted as a 'true star turn.' | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production and lead performance, calling it 'thrilling' and a 'crowd-pleaser,' with only a minor reservation about the ending that the critic dismisses as insignificant.",
