However, this appears to be a very brief excerpt, so confidence is low due to limited evaluative content. | GPT-4o: The review praises Bertie Carvel's performance as superb and describes the drama as gripping, indicating a positive recommendation. However, the brevity of the text limits the confidence in the overall assessment. | Gemini: The review uses the word \"superb\" to describe the performance and \"gripping\" to describe the drama, indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers unqualified praise for both the lead performance ('superb') and the production itself ('gripping drama'), indicating strong enthusiasm for the show despite the brevity of the excerpt.",
