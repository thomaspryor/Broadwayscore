  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Carvel's fictional Murdoch is irresistibly outrageous...Miller is just as good, bulldozing his way through his scenes with knockdown energy, and the rest of the ensemble cast charges after the two of them like gung-ho soldiers bound for glory, egged on by Mr. Goold and his superb design team.
