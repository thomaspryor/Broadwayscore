  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The first act is a worthy successor to 'The Front Page' as a love letter to the lost heyday of newspaper publishing...As Lamb assembles his staff, the cast suddenly bursts into song and dance. The segment works so well that I found myself wishing that the creators had gone all the way and written a musical...Goold masterfully keeps everything moving along smoothly. The play is a highly theatrical and quite entertaining work. What it is not is a deep exploration of Murdoch and his agenda.”\n\nRead more",
