  "showScoreExcerpt": "“’Ink’ is blessed with a look and feel that give it a burst of newsroom energy without it being drab...But Goold’s staging is often awkward, with prolonged darkened breaks...or odd dance numbers that didn’t make sense...There were scenes that could have been trimmed...The play is ultimately rescued by Graham’s sharp, crisp dialog performed by a terrific cast...Overall, it makes for a compelling and entertaining night...that may or may not teach you a thing or two.”\n\nRead more",
