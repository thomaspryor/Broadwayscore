  "bwwExcerpt": "If you don't already appreciate 'Citizen Kane,' the unnecessary first act of 'Ink' will make you marvel at Orson Welles' economy and wit. Kane's creation of a tabloid is fun, insightful and, most important, Welles tells the story quickly. Graham, on the other hand, shows Lamb handpicking each staff member, and each portrait of these hardened journos is a cliché.",
