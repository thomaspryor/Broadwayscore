  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Performed with oily charm by the outstanding Carvel, Murdoch is all business and all revenge...Unfortunately, the play stumbles somewhat in the second act...The narrative gets bogged down with a bit too much moralizing about the risks associated with exploiting sensational crime stories...Aside from these heavy-handed moments, ‘Ink’ is crackling good theatre. It is a smart, expertly constructed play and infused with rapid-fire dialogue...The production is stunningly theatrical.”\n\nRead more",
