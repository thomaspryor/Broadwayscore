  "bwwExcerpt": "Media mogul Rupert Murdoch is synonymous with conservative news. There are of course many who would use the word notorious to refer to his right leaning populist approach to journalism. Love him or hate him, he's quite the character and for that reason, a new play about his earliest days as a wannabe newspaper publisher makes for a fascinating study. With the simple title 'Ink,' it's a sprawling, heady, hilarious David and Goliath story that may just make you root for the giant.",
