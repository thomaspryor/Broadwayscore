  "bwwExcerpt": "Leaving Lincoln Center on a beautiful spring Sunday afternoon after a performance of 'Oslo,' I was surprisingly engulfed by an uneasy disquiet. My reaction, I should hasten to make clear, is not one that will likely be shared by many who go to see Bartlett Sher's crystalline production of a fine new American play by J.T. Rogers - though I expect other minds will be similarly concentrated by the issues the play raises. Is the fault in myself, I mused, or in the stars? (Here I decidedly am not referring to the ones on the stage but rather those through which fifty-nine U.S. missiles cruised toward a single target in Syria last week.)",
