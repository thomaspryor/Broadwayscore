  "bwwExcerpt": "Some of us may be easy marks for any hint of humanity in a story of the indelible tragedy of the Middle East. 'Oslo,' in its account of intractable foes finding common ground, is irresistible and, ultimately, deeply moving. Jokes are related at the negotiating table, at the expense of the string-pulling leaders behind the scenes, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin; memories are shared about the suffering of warring peoples, the devotion to loved ones at home. The small acts of soul-bearing indeed bind the characters to one another - and an audience to them. Around Rogers's captivating table, gradualism is a triumph for everyone.",
