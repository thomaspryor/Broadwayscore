  "bwwExcerpt": "Now comes the extraordinary Oslo, Rogers' riveting dramatization of another complex political tarantella that unfolded in secret before, in September 1993, stunning the world. That was when Bill Clinton presided at a Rose Garden ceremony in which Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the Palestine Liberation Organization's chairman Yasser Arafat shook hands after signing a historic peace accord. Oslo opened last summer in Lincoln Center Theater's Mitzi E. Newhouse; it's moved upstairs to the Tony-eligible Vivian Beaumont, where it opened tonight. It's even better the second time around.",
