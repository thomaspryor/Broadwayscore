Despite acknowledging it's 'earnest,' the overall verdict is clearly against recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review describes the musical as 'dramatically inert' with 'bland songs,' indicating a lack of recommendation. The tone is clearly negative, focusing on the shortcomings of the material. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the musical is \"dramatically inert\" with \"bland songs\" and \"pedestrian material,\" indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as dramatically lifeless with bland songs and pedestrian writing, offering no reason to see it despite its earnestness.",
