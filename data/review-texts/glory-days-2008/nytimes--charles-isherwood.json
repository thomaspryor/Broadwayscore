    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic finds the characters so one-dimensionally likable that they wish for conflict to create interest, indicating the show lacks essential dramatic elements and fails to engage. | GPT-4o: The review implies a lack of dramatic tension and suggests that the likability of the characters is a flaw, leading to a negative impression. However, the tone is not strongly negative, so it falls in the higher range of the Negative bucket. | Gemini: The review suggests the show lacks dramatic tension, implying it's not particularly engaging, but the likability of the characters keeps it from being outright negative. | Kimi: The critic offers genuine praise for the cast's likability but identifies a significant flaw in the show's lack of dramatic tension or conflict. As an excerpt, the full verdict is unclear, but the balanced praise and criticism suggests a middle-ground assessment. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Mixed",
