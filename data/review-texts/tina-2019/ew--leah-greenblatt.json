  "bwwExcerpt": "But as director Phyllida Lloyd (who helmed Mamma Mia! in both its stage and film versions) careens through the play's paces - from a pint-size Anna Mae Bullock's beginnings in Nutbush, Tennessee to her fateful meeting as a teenager in St. Louis with the man who would mold and rename her, on through their tumultuous union and her unlikely break into solo stardom in her mid-40s - pretty much every note of nuance is lost in the razzle-dazzle rush.",
