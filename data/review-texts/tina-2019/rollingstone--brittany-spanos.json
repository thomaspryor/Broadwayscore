  "bwwExcerpt": "The musical leans a little too heavily on the \"charm\" part of Ike; one of rock's greatest villains feels more like a cartoonish Sixties eccentric in this light, and Watts seems to be doing an impression of Eddie Murphy doing an impression of Ike Turner throughout his performance. While we get a firm sense of Ike's ego - the fear of being forgotten by everyone is never lost in the fabric of his story - his id feels not only superficial but paper thin.",
