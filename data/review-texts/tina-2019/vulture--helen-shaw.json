  "bwwExcerpt": "The impersonation itself isn't perfect. After a run of scenes speaking in Turner's distinctive voice, Warren sometimes sounds like she's lapsing into \"cartoon old lady\" instead of Turner's sandy rasp. But who cares?

Warren doesn't bear up under them-she rises up and smashes down too",
