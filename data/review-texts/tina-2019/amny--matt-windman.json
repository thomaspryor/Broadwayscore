  "bwwExcerpt": "Directed by Phyllida Lloyd, who more or less launched the jukebox musical phenomenon with \"Mamma Mia!\", the production is related muted, with emphasis placed on the character drama. The ensemble does little besides adding back-up singing and functions like window dressing. The full expanse of the stage is also concealed until the very end.",
