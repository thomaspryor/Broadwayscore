  "bwwExcerpt": "'Rock of Ages' is a moderately amusing jukebox musical whose ear-shredding score consists of a compilation of the greater and lesser hits of such noted arena rockers of the '80s as Pat Benatar, Bon Jovi, Foreigner, Journey, Styx and Twisted Sister, all of which I loathed when I first heard them on the radio a quarter-century ago. It would be the grossest of understatements to say that I expected nothing out of 'Rock of Ages,' so I'm pleased -- sort of -- to report that it could have been a whole lot worse.",
