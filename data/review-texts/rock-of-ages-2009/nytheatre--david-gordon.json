  "bwwExcerpt": "What Rock of Ages proves is that Damn Yankees' 'High Enough' and REO Speedwagon's 'Can't Fight this Feeling' can sizzle with chemistry (yeah, chemistry!) just as much as 'I'll Know.' Chris D'Arienzo has crafted an old-fashioned musical with '80s music. While the script never even comes close to reaching the heights of Guys and Dolls or Gypsy, as far as jukebox musicals go, it has more heart and wit and is far more genuine than its jukebox predecessors, Lennon and Good Vibrations.",
