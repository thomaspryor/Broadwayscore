  "bwwExcerpt": "Forget the silly plot, which has to do with a rock club threatened with being turned into a strip mall by a greedy German real estate developer (Paul Schoeffler). There's also a romantic triangle between a sexy waitress/struggling actress (Amy Spangler), a sweet busboy/struggling musician (Constantine Maroulis, of 'American Idol' fame) and a debauched glam rock star (James Carpinello). Instead, just wait for the less than subtle cues for such instantly recognizable songs as 'I Want to Know What Love Is,' 'Every Rose Has Its Thorn,' 'Here I Go Again,' 'Hit Me With Your Best Shot' and others, performed at deafening volume by the hard rocking, five-piece onstage band.",
