  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Doug Hughes and his designers provide an extremely glossy production that undoubtedly is meant to frame Odets' trashy story and its dubious protagonist in the most flattering light possible...Some viewers may well fall for the great charm that Bobby Cannavale sympathetically lends Charlie...But Richard Kind is slyly humorous as a folksy meltdown of Sam Goldwyn and Louis B. Mayer...With the exception of Marin Ireland, who simply seems uncomfortable in the ambivalent character of Charlie's semi-estranged wife, the remainder of the capable company handles their roles very well...Roundabout subscribers already booked for 'The Big Knife' should be in the mood to swallow a big helping of stale cheese that is being served with the utmost skill.",
