  "bwwExcerpt": "Cursed with the moral fire of Arthur Miller but not Miller's poetry, Odets's morality tales are pretty lumpish and heavy-handed. Keen ears will hear in the 1949 'Big Knife' the voices and themes that will find sharper and even more acrid form in 'Sweet Smell of Success,' his ferocious indictment of Hollywood that would set the bar for an industry's self- contempt. Director Doug Hughes and his fine cast haven't been able to unstack the cards Odets sets against Charlie. They include Charlie's involvement in a violent death for which one of the toadies took the rap; the threat of retribution from Richard Kind's brutal, vulgar studio chief; infidelity and abortion...None of this realism seems, well, real.",
