  "bwwExcerpt": "In 2013, the old Hollywood studio system is dead. In the age of spin and image control at the speed of Internet, the gossip-columnist power nexus is dead, too, with its ability to 'kill' a career dead in its tracks. The reason to watch The Big Knife now may be to appreciate the personal meaning it held for its author (Odets died in 1963); or to take a nostalgia-infused whiff of the sweet smell of success (Odets worked on the screenplay for that 1957 movie beaut of the same name, too) with its acrid undertones of the era; or to think big thoughts about how to square a purity of artistic impulse with the seductiveness of luxury and celebrity. Or, never mind that, to see Richard Kind steal the picture. B+",
