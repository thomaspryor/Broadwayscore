  "bwwExcerpt": "The Big Knife's first Broadway revival is muscular, moody and stylish, with a mostly solid cast under Doug Hughes's shrewd direction. Cannavale has an air of whiskey-soaked Bogart about him and his line readings capture the snap and brassy bawl of Odetsian banter. (What a year it's been for the sinewy lug-first Ricky Roma, now this.) As Castle's estranged wife, Marion, Marin Ireland seems overly recessive and wan, but she has fiery moments. Fleshly and venomous Richard Kind devours his grandiloquent speeches as a thuggish, sanctimonious movie mogul...In general, the production strikes the right fevered, grisly tone.",
