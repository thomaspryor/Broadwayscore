  "bwwExcerpt": "..ultimately this Roundabout Theater Company production, which marks the first Broadway revival of 'The Big Knife,' doesn't argue persuasively for its enduring merits. Even Mr. Cannavale cannot make Charlie's overblown speechifying sound like anything other than what it is: Odets in soapbox mode, chewing away with gusto on the Hollywood hand that had been feeding him for some time.",
