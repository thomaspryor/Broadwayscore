No positive elements offered to balance the critique. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the lack of 'theatrical magic' and describes the score as 'workmanlike,' indicating disappointment. However, the tone is not strongly negative, hence a mid-range Negative score. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the show is missing 'theatrical magic' and criticizes the score and characters, leading to a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic identifies fundamental deficiencies in the production, criticizing the score as merely workmanlike and noting that characters remain trapped in shallow conceits without the necessary theatrical magic to compensate.",
