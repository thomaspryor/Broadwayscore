  "bwwExcerpt": "Thankfully, Amélie is worth seeing if for no other reason than Phillipa Soo. We first encountered her in 2013 when we saw her off-Broadway in The Great Comet. In this review, we called her \"stunning\". A little show called Hamilton happened since then and she is now a bonafide leading lady of the great white way.",
