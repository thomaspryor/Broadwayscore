  "bwwExcerpt": "True, the movie was not a musical, but prepare to enjoy ditties from Daniel Messé, Nathan Tysen, and a book by Craig Lucas. If you dug the flick but long for an added dimension of sound and story, the on-stage spectacular could be just the whipped cream you've longed for to top this dessert-like story. But \"dessert-like story\" shouldn't imply that \"Amélie, a New Musical\" is frothy with no nutritional value.

However, text is truncated mid-sentence and may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests an enthusiastic recommendation, highlighting the added dimension of sound and story as a positive enhancement to the original movie. The use of 'spectacular' and 'whipped cream' implies a delightful experience. | Gemini: The review suggests that the musical enhances the original movie and offers a meaningful message, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. The phrase \"dessert-like story\" implies it's enjoyable but not necessarily profound, suggesting a reservation. | Kimi: Despite the limitation of a single curated excerpt, the language is clearly positive ('prepare to enjoy', 'whipped cream you've longed for', 'spectacular') with an enthusiastic recommendation to see the musical adaptation.",
