    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic finds the show forced and trying too hard ('precious', 'works overtime', 'the effort shows'), indicating a clear negative assessment despite acknowledging the attempt to charm. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that while the musical tries hard to be charming, it ultimately feels forced. This indicates a mixed reception, as the effort is noted but not fully successful. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"works overtime\" and \"the effort shows\", indicating a negative assessment of the musical. | Kimi: The critic finds the show's attempt at charm labored and obvious, suggesting the production fails to achieve its goals naturally, though the limited text prevents a stronger condemnation.",
