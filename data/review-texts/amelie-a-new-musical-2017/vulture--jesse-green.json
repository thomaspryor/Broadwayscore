However, this appears to be a truncated excerpt which limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the musical's attempt to be enchanting fails, resulting in an exhausting experience. This indicates a negative recommendation. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the show is \"exhausting\" due to its overzealous attempt to be enchanting, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic finds the show's effort to be enchanting backfires, resulting in an exhausting experience that fails to delight, clearly advising against seeing it.",
