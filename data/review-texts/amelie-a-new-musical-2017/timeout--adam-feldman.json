    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. Acknowledges positive qualities ('sweetness that is hard to resist') but notes flaws ('crosses the line into preciousness'). | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 suggests a mixed review. The quote reflects this by acknowledging the show's charm while noting a tendency towards excessive whimsy. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a positive quality (sweetness) but also points out a potential drawback (preciousness), suggesting a mixed overall experience. The 60 rating aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The review acknowledges the show's appealing sweetness while criticizing its occasional preciousness, resulting in a balanced, qualified assessment that aligns with the critic's 60/100 rating.",
