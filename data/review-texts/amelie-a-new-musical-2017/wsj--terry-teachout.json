This suggests a deep pan with no redeeming qualities. | Gemini: The critic explicitly compares the musical to a bad theme-park ride, indicating a negative assessment and a lack of recommendation. | Kimi: The critic delivers an unambiguous negative verdict by unfavorably comparing the show to a subpar theme-park ride, with no redeeming qualities mentioned.",
