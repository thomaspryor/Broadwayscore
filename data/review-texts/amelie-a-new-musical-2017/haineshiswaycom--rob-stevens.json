Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the production for failing to capture the charm of the film and suggests that the creators haven't fully committed to the whimsical style needed. This indicates a negative view of the production's execution. | Gemini: The review states that the production fails to capture the charm of the film and that plot items that were charming in the film mostly don't work on stage. Due to the truncated text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt clearly states the stage adaptation failed to capture the whimsical charm of the source film, with specific elements that worked on screen falling flat on stage. The critic acknowledges the creators' dedication but finds the execution lacking.",
