  "bwwExcerpt": "Thankfully, Amélie is worth seeing if for no other reason than Phillipa Soo. We first encountered her in 2013 when we saw her off-Broadway in The Great Comet. In this review, we called her \"stunning\". A little show called Hamilton happened since then and she is now a bonafide leading lady of the great white way.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear recommendation ('worth seeing') but qualified - only for the lead performance. Single excerpt warning suggests this may be cherry-picked positive moment from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt suggests the show is worth seeing primarily for Phillipa Soo's performance, indicating a positive but qualified recommendation. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning lowers confidence. | Gemini: The review states that the show is \"worth seeing\" because of Phillipa Soo. Since this is the only excerpt available, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic explicitly recommends the show as 'worth seeing' but heavily qualifies this by attributing the value solely to Phillipa Soo's performance, indicating a barely positive, qualified recommendation.",
