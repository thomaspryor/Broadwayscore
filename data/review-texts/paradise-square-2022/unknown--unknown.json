  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The uplifting, star-making, overwrought new musical...turns history on its head. Racism becomes an individual character flaw instead of a systemic evil; resistance, the solitary moral genius of a hero...Most of the characters — and there are 10 major roles — seem less like people than ideas with human masks...'Paradise Square' feels almost authorless despite its many contributors, and the direction of Moisés Kaufman, known for a strong hand and conceptual coherence, does little to erase the impression of anonymity...The other source of coherence in 'Paradise Square' is Kalukango, who somehow alchemizes the remarkable difficulties of the role into her characterization, making it incredible in the good way instead of the bad.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review criticizes the musical's treatment of history, character development, and direction as problematic or anonymous, but praises Kalukango's performance as transformative. The mixed elements and single-excerpt warning suggest cautious scoring within Mixed range. | GPT-4o: The review highlights significant issues with the show's coherence and characterization, but praises Kalukango's performance. The excerpt suggests a mixed reception with notable strengths and weaknesses. | Gemini: The review is mixed, criticizing the musical's historical inaccuracies and character development, but praising Kalukango's performance. The single excerpt and negative tone suggest a mixed to slightly negative assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt praises star Joaquina Kalukango's performance highly but heavily criticizes the show's book and direction as 'overwrought' and 'authorless', creating a mixed overall assessment.",
