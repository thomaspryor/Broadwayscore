  "bwwExcerpt": "The body can sometimes say more than words, but even the most expressive moves cannot make a coherent case for 'Paradise Square.' The blunt and belabored history lesson of a new musical set in Manhattan's Five Points, and produced by Garth Drabinsky, purports to be a fable of American race relations. But while conflicts between the neighborhood's Black and Irish residents at times come thrillingly to life through dance, 'Paradise Square' is wrong-footed from the jump. For all its spring-loaded set-up, 'Paradise Square' quickly runs out of steam, sputtering through a reprise-heavy second act that somehow feels both bloated and rushed. A near-total lack of characterization beyond their historical circumstance invites little emotional investment in the numerous people on stage.",
