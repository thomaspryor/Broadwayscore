The 60 rating confirms mixed reception. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review, and the text indicates both positive intentions and significant struggles, suggesting a balanced view. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (noble intentions, worthy subject) but also points out significant flaws (struggles under its own ambitions), indicating a mixed or neutral recommendation. The original rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's rating of 60/100 falls squarely in the Mixed range, and the text acknowledges worthy intentions while criticizing the show's execution and ambition.",
