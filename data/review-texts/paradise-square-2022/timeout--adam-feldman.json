  "bwwExcerpt": "It's a handsome production, with a talented and notably large cast; the exciting dance sequences, choreographed by Bill T. Jones, are among the show's highlights [...] The problem is that the writing doesn't support the spectacle, yielding a ponderous hash of good intentions that often feels like a training-wheels version of Ragtime. The disjointed script hops among scenes and tones, and while one understands the impetus behind ditching Foster's catchy but plantation-flavored songs, the score that has replaced them-by Jason Howland, Nathan Tysen and Masi Asare-is mostly unmemorable.",

Acknowledges positive elements ('noble intentions', 'worthy subject') but expresses clear problems with execution ('struggles under the weight of its own ambitions'). | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 suggests a mixed review. The key quote acknowledges the show's positive intentions but highlights its struggles, aligning with a mixed assessment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (noble intentions, worthy subject) but also points out significant flaws (struggles under its own ambitions). This indicates a mixed or neutral recommendation. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show's worthy subject and noble intentions but notes it fails to execute properly due to overambition. The explicit rating of 60 confirms a Mixed classification.",
