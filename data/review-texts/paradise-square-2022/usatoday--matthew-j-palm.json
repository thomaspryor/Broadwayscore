The 'but' construction clearly signals mixed-to-negative assessment without a recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's ambitions and heart but criticizes its lack of focus and struggles with earnestness, indicating a mixed assessment without a clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like ambition and heart, but criticizes the lack of focus and the weight of earnestness, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show's ambition and emotional core but emphasizes significant structural flaws and a lack of narrative focus, resulting in a balanced, non-committal assessment.",
