  "bwwExcerpt": "The musical features a talented ensemble led by the powerhouse Joaquina Kalukango (as Nellie, the owner of the tavern where the majority of the action takes place) and the nimble A. J. Shively (as Owen, a masterful dancer Irish immigrant terrified of getting drafted). It is chock-full of impressive dance numbers that pair the percussive rhythmic step dances of the Irish and Black communities. The score is catchy (especially the title song), compelling, and feels period-specific (heavily featuring the fiddle) while appealing to a modern musical theater ear. The highlight of the show is without a doubt 'Let it Burn,' Kalukango's 11 o'clock number, which receives a standing ovation and will be canonized alongside the greats like 'I'm Here,' 'Lot's Wife,' and 'Rose's Turn.'",
