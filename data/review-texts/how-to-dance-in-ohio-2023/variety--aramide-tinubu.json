  "fullText": "Going (or not going) to the big dance has been an irresistible storyline for musicals from \"Oklahoma!\" to \"The Prom.\" The set-up inherently inspires social stress, romantic anxiety, comic potential and, of course, dancing.\n\nThe new musical \"How to Dance in Ohio\" tells that story too, but from a different, heightened perspective. The show, which premiered at Syracuse Stage last year, is based on Alexandra Shiva's 2015 HBO documentary about a group counseling center in Columbus, Ohio, where autistic young adults prepare for a spring formal.",
