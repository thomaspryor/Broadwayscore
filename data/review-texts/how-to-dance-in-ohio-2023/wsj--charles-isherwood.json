However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review mentions the production has 'earned plaudits' and highlights the confident debut and superb cast, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. The single excerpt and aggregator context suggest a positive leaning.",
