    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear positive evaluation ('sensitivity and warmth'), but limited text prevents assessment of full recommendation strength. Lower end of Positive range due to excerpt limitation and measured tone. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation, highlighting the show's sensitivity and warmth. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, indicating the possibility of cherry-picking. Thus, the score reflects a mildly positive sentiment with low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive portrayal of the subject matter, suggesting a generally positive review. However, due to the limited text, the score is placed at the lower end of the 'Positive' bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers mild, unqualified praise for the show's handling of its subject matter, suggesting a gentle positive recommendation, though the limited context prevents a more definitive assessment.",
