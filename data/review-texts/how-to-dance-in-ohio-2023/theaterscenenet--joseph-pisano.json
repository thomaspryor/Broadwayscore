  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Director Sammi Cannold mostly guides the musical with pep-rally verve on Robert Brill's conceptually messy set, an energy that is occasionally deflated by Mayte Natalio's poetically somber choreography. But everyone is on the same page for the spring formal whose charm derives from looking like one, with a mélange of awkward dancing styles that suggest nothing but joy. It's too bad, though, that Melocik didn't give us the thoughtful and empathetic Dr. Amigo from the documentary, who reminds us that the goal of fully including autistic people in society also means welcoming them to new disappointments and pain. That sort of complexity will have to wait for a different musical.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed assessment - praises director's energy and spring formal scene's joy, but criticizes set design as 'conceptually messy' and expresses disappointment that the musical lacks the documentary's complexity. The 'too bad' and 'will have to wait for a different musical' suggest unfulfilled potential. | GPT-4o: The review notes both positive elements, like the 'pep-rally verve' and 'joy' in the spring formal, and negative aspects, such as the 'conceptually messy set' and lack of complexity in character portrayal. The mixed tone suggests a balanced view. | Gemini: The review highlights some positive aspects like the energy and charm of the spring formal scene, but also criticizes the lack of depth in the portrayal of certain characters and the conceptually messy set. The overall tone is mixed, not strongly recommending or discouraging. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the spring formal's 'joy' and 'charm' but criticizes the 'conceptually messy' set, uneven choreography, and especially the book's failure to capture the documentary's complexity and empathy, ending with the dismissive suggestion that such depth will have to wait for 'a different musical.'",
