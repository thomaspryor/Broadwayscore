  "fullText": "It’s a commendable achievement, though I wish the rest of the show was similarly strong. How to Dance in Ohio is hurt by a generic, bland score by Jacob Yandura, with otherwise forgettable lyrics from Yandura and Rebekah Greer Melocik. Many of the songs are reminiscent of other contemporary pop-inflected musicals like Heathers, Dear Evan Hansen, Be More Chill, Billy Elliot, Kimberly Akimbo, and The Prom.",
