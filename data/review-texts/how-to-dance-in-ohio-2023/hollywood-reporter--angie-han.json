However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive portrayal of the subject matter, highlighting \"genuine warmth and respect.\" While limited, the positive tone suggests a recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the adaptation's success and emotional resonance, warranting a strong positive score within the 70-84 range, though confidence is reduced due to limited text availability.",
