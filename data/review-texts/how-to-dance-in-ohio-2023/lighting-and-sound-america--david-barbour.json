  "showScoreExcerpt": "“How to Dance in Ohio puts its best foot forward, bringing its young lead performers onstage for a quick pre-show talk and, instantly, you grasp the show's rationale: They're the most winning bunch of talents you're likely to see all year, and at least one of them looks to be a breakout star…[the show] struggles with a multiplicity of characters and plot lines, often seeming unsure of where to place its focus...It is, in many ways, a touching, even groundbreaking, piece of work, but it would have benefited from another round of workshops or an additional out-of-town tryout.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic praises the performers as 'winning' and calls the work 'touching' and 'groundbreaking,' but identifies significant structural problems with focus and development, suggesting it needed more work before Broadway. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's touching and groundbreaking aspects, especially highlighting the young performers. However, it notes issues with focus and suggests further development was needed, indicating a mildly positive but not unqualified recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the performers and calls the show \"touching\" and \"groundbreaking,\" but also notes that it \"struggles\" and \"would have benefited\" from further development. This suggests a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The critic praises the young performers as 'the most winning bunch of talents' and calls the show 'groundbreaking,' but criticizes the unfocused structure and suggests it needed more development time.",
