    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive recommendation despite single excerpt limitation. Critic explicitly states buying a ticket is 'not a risk' and promises 'feel-good moments for everyone,' indicating solid endorsement. Upper positive range due to unambiguous recommendation language, but low confidence due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive recommendation, highlighting the show's feel-good moments and the authentic representation of autistic people. The lack of full context and single excerpt warning necessitates a low confidence level, but the tone is clearly positive. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive recommendation, highlighting the show's feel-good moments and suggesting it's worth seeing. The phrase \"not a risk\" implies a safe and enjoyable experience. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly recommends the show, stating it is 'not a risk' with 'enough feel-good moments for everyone,' while praising its authentic casting of autistic performers. Confidence is low due to single excerpt availability.",
