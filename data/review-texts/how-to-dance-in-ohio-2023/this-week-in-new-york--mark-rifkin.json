  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Will I be totally humiliated if I mess it up?” Remy asks in the Broadway premiere of How to Dance in Ohio. It’s a question that we’ve all asked ourselves, and it’s a central theme of the musical, which focuses on seven autistic young adults, portrayed by seven autistic actors, trying to make connections while preparing for a spring formal, dealing with the same types of emotions as neurotypical people but facing a world that was not built with them in mind. It gets to the heart of so much of what makes us all human, as we progress from children to teenagers to young adults.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt expresses appreciation for the show's thematic depth and universal human connection, but with only one curated quote available, the full critical verdict is unclear. The positive framing suggests recommendation but confidence must remain low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the show's central theme and its ability to connect with universal human experiences. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows clear appreciation for the show's authentic autistic casting and universal emotional themes, warranting upper Positive range per guidance, though limited context prevents higher confidence.",
