    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Classic mixed review language - acknowledges good intentions but criticizes execution. Single excerpt warning noted, but this clearly balanced positive/negative statement suggests middle of Mixed range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a mixed review, noting positive intentions but flawed execution. With only one excerpt, the full sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review acknowledges good intentions but criticizes the execution, suggesting a mixed or lukewarm reception. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers genuine praise for the show's intentions and heart, but the decisive 'but' clause indicates the production fails to fully achieve its goals, suggesting a middling assessment rather than a clear recommendation.",
