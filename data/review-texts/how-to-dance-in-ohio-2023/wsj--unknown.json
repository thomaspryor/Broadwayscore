  "showScoreExcerpt": "“ ‘How to Dance in Ohio’ is certainly less raw and dispassionately observed than the movie. But this is not a documentary but a Broadway musical comedy, and as such engineered to meet the requirements of most popular entries in the genre today: uplift, sweetness, rainbow endings for all.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt suggests the musical follows formulaic Broadway conventions rather than the documentary's authenticity, but with only one curated quote and 'Read more' indicating truncation, the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the show is less raw and more engineered for a feel-good experience, which implies it may lack depth but still offers the typical uplifting qualities of a Broadway musical. This indicates a mixed reception, focusing on its conventional appeal rather than originality. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show is engineered for popular appeal, suggesting a positive but perhaps not groundbreaking experience. The phrase \"uplift, sweetness, rainbow endings\" implies an enjoyable, if somewhat predictable, experience.",
