  "showScoreExcerpt": "“ ‘How to Dance in Ohio’ is certainly less raw and dispassionately observed than the movie. But this is not a documentary but a Broadway musical comedy, and as such engineered to meet the requirements of most popular entries in the genre today: uplift, sweetness, rainbow endings for all.”\n\nRead more",

The tone suggests competent but predictable work without strong recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the show is crafted to provide a feel-good experience typical of popular musicals, indicating a positive reception despite some reservations about its depth compared to the movie. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the musical is engineered for popular appeal, implying it's enjoyable and worth seeing, but possibly lacks depth compared to the source material. The phrase 'uplift, sweetness, rainbow endings' suggests a positive but perhaps formulaic experience.",
