But it is unclear as to the intent of the show, which lacks much by way of character development, dramatic tension, or insight...But even as we cheer them on and take delight in their triumphs, there is not enough here to make this a successful film-to-stage translation.”\n\nRead more",

The verdict is mixed, with positive elements in the performances but overall reservations about the show's success. | Gemini: The review praises the performers but states that the show lacks character development, dramatic tension, or insight, and ultimately isn't a successful translation. | Kimi: While the critic praises the autistic actors' grace and skill, they find the show lacks character development, dramatic tension, and insight, ultimately judging it a failed film-to-stage translation.",
