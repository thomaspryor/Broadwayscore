    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a discrepancy between the show's promotion and its actual presentation, indicating a mixed reception. The critic's personal sensitivity to the production's sensory elements adds subjectivity, leading to a cautious mixed classification. | Gemini: The critic expresses disappointment that the show does not live up to its sensory-friendly promotion, suggesting a negative experience. Given the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates the production does not fully deliver on its sensory-friendly promises, though the critic acknowledges personal sensitivity may affect this perception. Without additional context, the overall recommendation direction is ambiguous.",
