  "bwwExcerpt": "And - oh, break, break my heart - the director of this \"Hedda\" is Ian Rickson, who this season delivered a nigh-perfect \"Seagull\" on Broadway, one of the best revivals I have ever, ever seen. That he is now responsible for one of the worst revivals I have ever, ever seen has me flummoxed. Mr. Rickson's \"Seagull\" was a fluidly integrated production in which everyone seemed to exist in the same moment and in the same universe. With this \"Hedda\" it's not just that ever",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for Parker's performance with sophisticated analysis ('feline grace', 'inevitable and tragic'). However, this is only one excerpt focusing on the lead - the full review verdict is unknown, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Parker's performance, suggesting a strong portrayal of the character. However, without the full context of the review, it's unclear if the production as a whole is recommended. Given the single excerpt warning, a cautious score at the lower end of Positive is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a positive assessment of the lead actress's performance, suggesting a recommendation, but the limited text and lack of broader context warrant a lower confidence and a score on the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers strong praise for Sarah Jessica Parker's performance using evocative language ('feline grace', 'sensual restlessness'), but provides no assessment of the overall production, direction, or script, warranting low confidence and a score at the upper end of the Positive range per instructions for clearly positive isolated quotes.",
