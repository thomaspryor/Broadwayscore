  "bwwExcerpt": "\"There was reason to expect more from Mary-Louise Parker, the latest A-list actress to tackle a character who, like Macbeth or Mama Rose, seems destined to pop up on Broadway every few years. But Parker's intelligence and range are wasted on this performance, which reduces Hedda to a petulant, if glamorous, brat.\"",
