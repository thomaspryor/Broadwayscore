However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt strongly praises Mary-Louise Parker's performance and the overall energy of the revival, suggesting a positive recommendation. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance and overall production energy ('crackle with dangerous energy'), warranting a score in the upper Positive range. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence remains low regarding the complete review's final verdict.",
