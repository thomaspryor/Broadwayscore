  "bwwExcerpt": "Did you hear the one about the woman who lived a life? She had ups, downs, outlived some around her, was survived by others. In case you forgot the basic trajectory of human existence, a self-satisfied little play called Birthday Candles opened tonight at the American Airlines Theatre. The Broadway debut of playwright Noah Haidle, it has almost nothing to say about the grand existential themes it barks throughout its brisk 90 minutes. It's hard to imagine why Messing took on this role, which only plays into her strengths as an actor a handful of times, when the script offers up sitcom-style setups.",

Clear negative assessment despite acknowledging some performer strengths. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt criticizes the play for lacking substance and questions the lead actor's choice to participate, indicating a negative impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review is negative, criticizing the play for having nothing to say and questioning Messing's choice to take on the role. The excerpt suggests a disappointing experience. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the play as 'self-satisfied' and lacking substance ('almost nothing to say'), criticizing the sitcom-quality script and misuse of the lead actor's talents, indicating a clear recommendation against seeing the show.",
