    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The review uses strong, positive language to describe Metcalf's performance as 'extraordinary' and highlights the emotional impact of the journey. This suggests a highly favorable view of the production. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"extraordinary\" to describe the performance, indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: This is a brief excerpt praising a lead performance with superlatives ('nothing short of extraordinary'), but it's only one sentence with no broader verdict on the show itself. The high praise for Metcalf suggests a positive recommendation, but the truncated nature and lack of full context limits confidence.",
