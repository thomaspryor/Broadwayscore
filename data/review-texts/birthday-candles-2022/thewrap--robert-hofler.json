For his play “Smokefall,” he told the story of four generations of one family, and even took us inside the womb to explore the development of two characters.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Haidle is big on concepts. For his play 'Smokefall,' he told the story of four generations of one family, and even took us inside the womb to explore the development of two characters. In 'Birthday Candles,' he visits the character of Ernestine (Messing) on several of her birthdays, from age 17 to well into old age. Since 'Birthday Candles' is a one-act play clocking in at around 100 minutes, Haidle's writing involves major compression of time. Some of those birthdays last 10 minutes; others are covered in seconds.",
