  "bwwExcerpt": "The impressive acting, practical set and tailored direction blend well to tell a story that could easily feel flat and predictable. Vivienne Benesch's direction readily elevates Haidle's script, exploring the emotional and unpredictable time-lapse tale of Ernestine's birthdays over the course of 90 years.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise for performances and direction, noting the production elevates potentially problematic source material. However, confidence is low due to limited text from curated excerpt only. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the acting, set, and direction, suggesting a strong production that elevates the material. The positive tone and lack of reservations suggest a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the acting, set, and direction, indicating a positive experience. However, the single excerpt and lack of an explicit recommendation lead to a 'medium' confidence level. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the acting, set design, and direction, specifically noting how they elevate material that could otherwise feel predictable. As a clearly positive single excerpt, it scores in the upper range of Positive, though confidence is reduced due to limited text availability.",
