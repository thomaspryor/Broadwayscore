  "bwwExcerpt": "The impressive acting, practical set and tailored direction blend well to tell a story that could easily feel flat and predictable. Vivienne Benesch's direction readily elevates Haidle's script, exploring the emotional and unpredictable time-lapse tale of Ernestine's birthdays over the course of 90 years.",
