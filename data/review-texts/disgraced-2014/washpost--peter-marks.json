  "bwwExcerpt": "The brisk and bristling 'Disgraced' confers on Broadway a quality in far too short supply: topicality. Ayad Akhtar's spiky drama...grapples with a subject as rich in dramatic possibility as it is juicy fodder for Sunday morning talk shows. Akhtar's concern here is Islam in America...As directed by Kimberly Senior, the 85-minute play...is all rhetorical sharp edges, honed by a solid cast headed by Hari Dhillon, Gretchen Mol and Josh Radnor...It's an admirably taut evening, marred slightly by a few instances of overeager performance: some shouting and gesticulating encouraged in the pumping up of the play's fireworks. Otherwise, 'Disgraced' is just what a serious theatergoer craves these days: a tough-minded inquiry that finds urgent dramatic connections in things that divide us.",
