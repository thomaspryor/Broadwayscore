  "bwwExcerpt": "Akhtar's blistering 'Disgraced' opened Thursday on Broadway at the Lyceum Theatre with a punch and power that won it a Pulitzer Prize. Few playwrights are examining what Akhtar does, certainly not with his insightfulness, and his play is breathtaking -- and not a little uncomfortable -- to watch. In the best of ways. An excellent five-person cast led by Hari Dhillon -- and beautifully directed by Kimberly Senior -- starts the play with swagger and confidence, building to horrific exchanges in which they are at each other's throats...Dhillon nails the master-of-the-universe strut and moves across the stage almost like a boxer when his anger is fueled, making his fall all the more painful, while Mol skillfully lets a silent gulf slowly emerge between her and her husband. But perhaps the best performances are turned in by Radnor (TV's 'How I Met Your Mother') and Pittman (Broadway's 'Good People'), two natural stage actors who get to be funny, outraged, needy, broken and feisty -- and manage to do it all in the 90-minute work.",
