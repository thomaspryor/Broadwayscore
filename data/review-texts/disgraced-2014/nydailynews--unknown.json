  "fullText": "ExpandGretchen Mol and Hari Dhillon in \"Disgraced\" (Joan Marcus)\n\n\"Disgraced\" debuts on Broadway aglow with a Pulitzer Prize and awash in the same pros and cons of its 2012 Off-Broadway run.\n\nOn the plus side, the play is lean and timely. Ayad Akhtar, a Pakistani-American writer, delivers a claustrophobic drama by mixing the urgency and unease of post-9/11 life with universal marital anxiety. Every spouse wonders, Who is this person I married?\n\nOn the downside, conveniences stack up. And Akhtar relies on the hoariest devices around. They include an unlocked door (in an apartment where $600 shirts hang in the closet, no less) and plying lips with liquor to loosen the truth.\n\nEven with flaws, \"Disgraced\" is observant and smart. Kimberly Senior, who directed the New York premiere at Lincoln Center, guides a good-looking and handsomely acted production.\n\nIn 2011, cool, confident and dashing Amir Kapoor (Hari Dhillon) is a Muslim-American who's rejected his Islamic past. He's a star at his largely Jewish law firm and the master of an artfully constructed universe. His Upper East Side home is a looker. His blond wife, Emily (Gretchen Mol), an artist, is too. Life and work are easy, breezy.\n\nThen there's a change in the air. Emily, turned on by Islamic art, and Amir's nephew Abe (Danny Ashok) persuade Amir to help an imam with possible terrorist ties. Altruism backfires. Amir is shaken as truths about his personal history emerge.\n\nThat's the show's first hour. In the last 25 minutes, the pulse quickens at a dinner party at Amir and Em's. Their guests are Isaac (Josh Radnor), a Jewish curator who's given Em a show, and his African-American wife, Jory (Karen Pittman), who works with Amir.\n\nFrom left, Mol, Dhillon, Karen Pittman and Josh Radnor\n\nThe party begins with tasty fennel salad and smart, chatty conversation and ends with a racist crumble. Booze flows. Then talk turns to don't-go-there topics: religion, politics, sex. The evening becomes a bitter showdown of rage, hatred and violence.\n\nLike sports cars, the actors hug their characters' curves. Dhillon, who played his role in London, nails Amir's glossy arrogance and sense of loss. Emily is sympathetic, as played by a low-key and quiet Mol, while Radnor is convincing and natural. Pittman, an Off-Broadway holdover, again delivers a precise turn as pointed as Jory's sexy stilettos.\n\nBlunted by contrivances, the impact of \"Disgraced\" isn't as sharp — or as potentially dangerous — as it could be.",
