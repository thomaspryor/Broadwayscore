    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear enthusiasm with 'joyful romp' and praise for capturing Python's spirit. However, confidence is low due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'joyful' and 'silly,' capturing the 'anarchic spirit' while being updated for contemporary audiences, indicating a strong positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"joyful\" and \"anarchic spirit,\" indicating a favorable review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt expresses clear enthusiasm for the production's spirit and contemporary update, placing it in the upper Positive range, though limited context prevents higher confidence.",
