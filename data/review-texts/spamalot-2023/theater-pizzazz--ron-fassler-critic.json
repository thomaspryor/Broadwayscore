It’s a wonderful ensemble effort and Rhodes’s work here is first-rate...But, like this new ‘Spamalot’, it’s irresistible and sends the audience out on a cloud of comedy.”\n\nRead more",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction and ensemble, calling the show 'irresistible' and 'first-rate'. Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone suggests a strong positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the direction and choreography, calling it \"first-rate\" and \"irresistible\", indicating a positive recommendation. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt contains enthusiastic praise ('wonderful', 'first-rate', 'irresistible') and a clear recommendation, though as a single curated quote it may not capture the full review's nuance.",
