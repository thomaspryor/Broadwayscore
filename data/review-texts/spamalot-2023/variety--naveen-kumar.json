  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The production’s overdesign is a symptom of the broader problem, which is a lack of ingenuity in favor of sheer excess. It is a paradox of throwing money onstage that it can easily come at the expense of creativity. There may be a way to reanimate ‘Spamalot,’ and for Monty Python’s random surrealism to infect a new generation and confront the current moment. But that grail is not to be found here.”",
