  "fullText": "It may be appropriate for a musical with \"spam\" in the title to feel canned. But it's a shame that the first Broadway revival of \"Monty Python's Spamalot,” now playing at the St. James Theatre, struggles to find anything fresh about material covered in a half-century of dust.\n\nA comedy broader than a bowling alley, \"Spamalot\" premiered on Broadway in 2005, 30 years after the movie \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\" from which the creators say it is \"lovingly ripped off.\" The British troupe's devotion to wordplay, absurdity and bodily function was vintage even then. Like a pile of corpses that bursts into song, some tenants of comedy never die. But they do lose their vigor.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The production’s overdesign is a symptom of the broader problem, which is a lack of ingenuity in favor of sheer excess. It is a paradox of throwing money onstage that it can easily come at the expense of creativity. There may be a way to reanimate ‘Spamalot,’ and for Monty Python’s random surrealism to infect a new generation and confront the current moment. But that grail is not to be found here.”",
