However, with only one excerpt available, this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review, so scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the director's ability to maximize the talent of the cast, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of a full review, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the director and cast, suggesting a positive experience, but the lack of full text and the single excerpt warning necessitates a score in the middle of the positive range.",
