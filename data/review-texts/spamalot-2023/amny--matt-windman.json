    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('wonderful time', 'rejuvenated', 'we need') with personal endorsement and broader cultural recommendation. Single excerpt warning suggests this represents a clearly positive stance, scoring in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses strong enthusiasm and personal enjoyment, describing the show as a needed cathartic release. The language suggests a highly positive experience, fitting a Rave classification. | Gemini: The critic states they had a wonderful time and felt rejuvenated, indicating a strong positive experience and recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I've leaned towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt expresses clear enthusiasm ('wonderful time', 'rejuvenated') and explicitly states 'we need Spamalot', indicating a strong recommendation. Single excerpt limitations require low confidence.",
