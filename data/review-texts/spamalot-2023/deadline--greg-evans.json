Most of the actors play multiple roles, but some randomly chosen standouts: Christopher Fitzgerald as a lovable, smarter than he looks squire; Ethan Slater as a dewey-eyed dude in distress; Michael Urie as cowardly Sir Robin, who&#8217;d rather be singing; Nik Walker as the intellectual peasant turned vain knight Sir Galahad; James Monroe Iglehart as a stalwart, slow-burn King Arthur; Jimmy Smagula as Sir Bedevere and, more hilariously, Dennis&#8217; Mother; and maybe best of all, Leslie Rodriguez Kritzer (who similarly stole Beetlejuice) as both The Lady of the Lake and herself, breaking the fourth wall to complain (in song, of course) about those long stretches when she isn&#8217;t on stage.\n\nAlso of note: An excellent Taran Killam, filling in till January for Alex Brightman, who played the role at the Kennedy Center but is currently occupied by Broadway&#8217;s The Shark is Broken. Killam&#8217;s years on Saturday Night Live make him a natural for the Python escapades, and he delivers each of his characters beautifully, from the sexually confused Lancelot to the Knight of Ni and the taunting Frenchman.\n\nWhile the musical sticks pretty close to the film, Idle and Du Prez wisely decided to let the Spamalot characters in on the joke: They know they&#8217;re in a Broadway musical. The song &#8220;The Song That Goes Like This&#8221; has great fun poking at Broadway musical conventions, and Kritzer stops the show, literally and figuratively, with &#8220;Diva&#8217;s Lament,&#8221; the one in which she bemoans her skimpy role (and calls out Michael Urie for hogging the time).\n\nUrie has his own meta moment with the rousing production number &#8220;You Won&#8217;t Succeed On Broadway,&#8221; in which his musical theater-loving Sir Robin advises the King of an essential element for Broadway success: &#8220;You just don&#8217;t succeed on Broadway if you don&#8217;t have any Jews.&#8221; Providing something of a crash course in Broadway history, and the essential role played in that history by Jewish creatives, Urie leads the cast through some Fiddler moments and shout-outs to Streisand, Midler, Sondheim and, well, I won&#8217;t spoil the punchline except to note it drew both a gasp and howls of laughters at the reviewed performance.\n\nAll the dancing, singing and questing unfolds on a clever, attractive set designed by Paul Tate dePoo III, whose projections &#8211; many seemingly inspired by Terry Gilliam&#8217;s instantly recognizable Python style of animation &#8211; play a crucial role in the production. Some of the effects are of a decidedly (and intentionally) DIY nature, like the catapulted (or, really, just tossed) cow or the bloodthirsty bunny, but all work terrifically within the show&#8217;s self-aware approach.\n\nAlso worth praise are Jen Caprio&#8217;s colorful costumes, Cory Pattak&#8217;s playful lighting and a sound design by Kai Harada & Haley Parcher that uses volume to prompt some jump in your seat moments. (And by the way, that voice of God recording is none other than Steve Martin, in good company).\n\nPerhaps most satisfying about Spamalot is how it differs from other movie-to-stage adaptations in landing every punchline even for those who know what&#8217;s coming. Recent adaptations like Almost Famous and the better Back To The Future approach their familiar jokes like a checklist to get through. Not so with Spamalot, when even that long-ago Python catchphrase &#8220;&#8216;Tis but a scratch&#8221; gets a round of applause and, more importantly, a  big, bloody laugh.\n\nTitle: SpamalotVenue: Broadway's St. James TheatreDirector & Choreographer: Josh RhodesBook & Lyrics: Eric IdleMusic: John Du Prez and Eric IdlePrincipal Cast:  Christopher Fitzgerald, James Monroe Iglehart, Taran Killam, Leslie Rodriguez Kritzer, Ethan Slater, Jimmy Smagula, Michael Urie, and Nik Walker.Running time: 2 hr 20 min (including intermission)\n\nDeadline is a part of Penske Media Corporation. &copy; 2024 Deadline Hollywood, LLC.
