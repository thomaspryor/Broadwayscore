    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises cast and funny bits but notes significant issues with aging humor. Single excerpt with 'Read more' suggests incomplete text, making full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast's performance and the show's comedic elements, likening it to successful productions like 'The Book of Mormon.' However, it notes that some humor feels dated, indicating some reservations. Given the single excerpt and potential cherry-picking, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review praises the cast and compares the show favorably to \"The Book of Mormon,\" but notes that some of the humor hasn't aged well. Given the limited excerpt, a score in the lower end of the positive range seems appropriate. | Kimi: Strong praise for performances and concept, comparing the show favorably to The Book of Mormon, though with a significant reservation that some humor hasn't aged well.",
