  "bwwExcerpt": "For a lesson in playing brittle and brilliant farce, head to the American Airlines Theatre for a near-perfect staging of 'The Importance of Being Earnest,' Oscar Wilde's whimsical 1895 classic. Director Brian Bedford, who is also starring in drag as Lady Bracknell, remembers that Wilde originally subtitled his play 'A Serious Comedy for Trivial People.' Bedford has his company play the shallow objectives of the upper-crust Victorian characters with complete seriousness, rather than going for the obvious laughs. Highly stylized and sleekly staged, this is probably the funniest and sharpest production of the comedy, a favorite on regional and community stages, I've ever seen.",
