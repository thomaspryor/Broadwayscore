  "bwwExcerpt": "An optimal revival of The Importance of Being Earnest ought to be an utter waste of time, and therefore wholly delightful. Forgive the sub-Wildean quippery, but who wouldn’t want to fritter away hours, ignorantly, due to narcotizing joy? If our lives must dribble away on a temporal plane, let it be a high-flying plane, one that zooms off and leaves us transported. By that standard, the Roundabout Theatre Company’s semi-import (two of its actors and half of its design originated in Canada’s Stratford Shakespeare Festival) is stuck somewhere between strolling and soaring. It’s pleasant, but doesn’t waste one’s time quite well enough.",
