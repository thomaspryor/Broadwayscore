  "bwwExcerpt": "Bedford is purse-lipped and aloof as Lady Bracknell, a gorgon of mock-scandalized calm floating through Desmond Heeley’s sensuous sets. A profusion of roses spills like raindrops in the garden scene and the young ladies-in-waiting (for marriage) are dollishly trussed by Heeley in white and pink. The uneven cast is brightened by two other fine veterans, Dana Ivey and Paxton Whitehead, as the dour Miss Prism and the befuddled Reverend Chasuble. They add the dose of satire the production otherwise lacks.",
