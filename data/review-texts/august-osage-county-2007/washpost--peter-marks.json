However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"ferocious,\" \"entertaining,\" and \"remarkable finesse,\" suggesting a positive recommendation. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for both the writing ('ferocious and entertaining') and direction ('remarkable finesse'), indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited context of a single curated quote.",
