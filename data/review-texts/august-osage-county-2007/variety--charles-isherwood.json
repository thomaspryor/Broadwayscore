    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'magnificent' with vivid positive language ('crackles', 'seethes with emotional truth'), but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('magnificent', 'crackles', 'seethes') indicating a highly favorable view. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so a low confidence is assigned. | Gemini: The excerpt contains very strong positive language (\"magnificent\", \"crackles with verbal wit\", \"seethes with emotional truth\"), suggesting a highly favorable review. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unambiguously enthusiastic praise ('magnificent,' 'crackles with verbal wit'), warranting a score at the upper end of the Positive bucket. However, as a single potentially cherry-picked excerpt with no broader context, confidence is low per scoring guidelines.",
