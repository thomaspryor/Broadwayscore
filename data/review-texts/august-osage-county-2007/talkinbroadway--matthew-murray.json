    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Uses superlative language 'towering achievement' and 'finest contemporary American playwrights' - clear rave territory. Medium confidence due to single excerpt warning, but language is unambiguously enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, calling the play a 'towering achievement' and highlighting both the playwright and director's excellence. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"towering achievement\" and praises both the playwright and director, indicating a strong recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the limited text available. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers superlative praise calling the show a 'towering achievement' with commendations for both playwright and director, warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket; confidence is low given only one curated excerpt is available. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
