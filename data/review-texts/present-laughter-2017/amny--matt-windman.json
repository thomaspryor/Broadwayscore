  "bwwExcerpt": "With all due respect to Noel Coward's classic English comedies of the 1920s through 1940s, do they really merit being revived so regularly? Sure, they're witty, classy and charming, but also insubstantial and tame by today's standards, and not especially relevant anymore. I suspect that we run into the plays so often because they contain great roles for actors, like the kooky medium Madame Arcati in 'Blithe Spirit,' the sparring couple Amanda and Elyot in 'Private Lives' and the vain stage actor Garry Essendine in 'Present Laughter.'",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "With all due respect to Noel Coward’s classic English comedies, do they really merit being revived so regularly?...Directed with a gentle hand by Moritz von Stuelpnagel, the production is pleasant but not especially interesting. There seems to have been no point in reviving the play other than to provide Kline with a star vehicle. Admittedly, the role fits Kline like a glove, especially given his knack for hammy personalities.”\n\nRead more"
