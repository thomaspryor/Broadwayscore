    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: This appears to be an excerpt focusing solely on praise for Kevin Kline's performance. The critic's own 80 rating confirms positive territory, but the truncated nature limits confidence in the overall assessment. | Gemini: The review praises Kline's performance as a 'master class' and describes it as 'vivid, entertaining life,' indicating a positive recommendation. The original rating of 80 aligns with this assessment. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 80 places this in the Positive bucket, and the text offers strong praise for the lead performance as a 'master class' with 'theatrical charisma,' indicating a firm recommendation.",
