  "bwwExcerpt": "I've just learned what it takes to create an absolutely splendid revival of Noël Coward's Present Laughter: Step 1: Cast Kevin Kline; Step 2: Hire a director whose name sounds like a punch line Coward might have considered-Moritz von Stuelpnagel. But not any Moritz will do. Find the one who helmed the equally hilarious but tonally rather different demon-possessed-sock-puppet satire Hand to God. There are further details (inviting design, surrounding Kline with a smashing cast), but the simple act of handing America's greatest exemplar of comic suavity a role he was born to play is half the battle.",

The original rating of 80 aligns with this assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the lead performance ('master class', 'theatrical charisma'), and the original rating of 80 confirms a strong positive recommendation in the upper range of the Positive bucket.",
