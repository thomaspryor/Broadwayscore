    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic directly criticizes the lead performance as irritating rather than charming, calling it 'a problem' for a show where the character dominates stage time. This suggests the production fails due to its central element. | GPT-4o: The review highlights a significant issue with the main character's portrayal, suggesting a negative impact on the show. The tone is critical, but the review is brief, leading to medium confidence. | Gemini: The review focuses on the negative portrayal of the main character, which significantly impacts the overall experience, leading to a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic finds the central performance irritating rather than endearing, which they explicitly identify as a significant problem given the actor's constant presence onstage, indicating a negative recommendation.",
