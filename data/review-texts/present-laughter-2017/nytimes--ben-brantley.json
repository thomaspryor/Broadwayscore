Playing an aging matinee idol in the bouncy new revival of Noël Coward’s “Present Laughter,” Mr. Kline blissfully plies the witty athleticism and derring-do that won him two Tony Awards (“On the 20th Century,” “The Pirates of Penzance”) and an Oscar (“A Fish Called Wanda”) in his youth.\n\nIn the uneven but enjoyable production, which opened on Wednesday at the St. James Theater, directed by Moritz von Stuelpnagel, Mr. Kline makes his entrance in a state of soigné disarray. His character, the stage star Garry Essendine, is suffering yet another stormy morning-after.\n\nAs he descends the staircase from his bedroom, Garry somehow manages to drape his leg over the banister. Seconds later, his dressing gown catches on the newel at the bottom. It seems the entire world, including his own lavishly appointed apartment, is out to get Garry Essendine.\n\nYet this man’s clumsiness is grace itself. And he wears his air of aggrieved martyrdom as if it were a new pocket square from Charvet.\n\nWe are in the presence of a singular anatomy, one that combines the calculated haplessness of Charlie Chaplin and the swashbuckling brio of Douglas Fairbanks.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",
