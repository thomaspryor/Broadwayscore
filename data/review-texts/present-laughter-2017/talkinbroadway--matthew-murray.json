The tone suggests a middle-of-the-road experience. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"perfectly pleasant\" but also \"perfectly safe,\" indicating a positive but not enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers faint praise ('pleasant') immediately undercut by criticism ('safe'), suggesting the production lacks excitement or ambition without being actively bad, resulting in a tepid, non-committal assessment.",
