  "bwwExcerpt": "The 100-minute musical - really, a collection of songs about mostly unrelated people in career and romantic transition - is meant to be inspired by the rhythms of the subway. This comes through best with the rumbling beats and virtuosic sound effects made by Boxman, a wise subway eccentric and one-man band played by beatbox artist Steven 'HeaveN' Cantor. Otherwise, it's a stretch to find the subway-rhythm idea as more than a pretext for getting together 11 actors to portray 40 very sincere and familiar characters - the struggling actress/office temp (Margo Seibert); the obsessed dumped girlfriend (Erin Mackey); the engaged gay guys (Justin Guarini and Telly Leung), one of whom is in the closet to his pious but kindly Texas mother (Moya Angela); and the former Wall Street guy (James Snyder) fired for pressing 'send all' on an indiscreet email and now, unbelievably, left without enough to take the subway.",
