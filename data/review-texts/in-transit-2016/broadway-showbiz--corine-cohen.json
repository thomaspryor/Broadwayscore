  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"An upbeat musical that will cheer you up as it is made up of fantastic music…The choreography by Kathleen Marshall is very uplifting and energetic...The energetic and talented company made the show a joy to watch. The sets were simple but worked and made you believe you were on a train with rats included. This show is a lot of fun and the music, all made by the human voice, is stunning…Go and see ‘In Transit,’ a show that is positive, upbeat and fun.\"\n\nRead more",
