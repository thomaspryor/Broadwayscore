    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic dismisses the show as full of 'peppy clichés' and compares praising it to admiring 'a sentimental picture of a rainbow.' While acknowledging the cast's vocal skills, they find the amplification 'abrasive' and at odds with a cappella style. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the cast's vocal skills but criticizes the show's clichés and sound issues. The excerpt suggests a mixed impression without a clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the cast's skill but also criticizes the show's reliance on clichés and the amplification of the singers' voices, leading to a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the cast's 'marvels of vocal synchronicity' but criticizes the material as 'peppy cliché' and 'sentimental,' while noting technical flaws with abrasive amplification that undermines the a cappella concept. The dismissive tone toward the show's artistic achievement suggests significant reservations.",
