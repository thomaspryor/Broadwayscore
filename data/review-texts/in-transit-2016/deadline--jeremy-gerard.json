  "bwwExcerpt": "The songs are as generic as those descriptions suggest, and - notwithstanding the efforts of the talented ensemble - nothing in Marshall's uninspired staging on Donyale Werle's highly romanticized and sanitized subway station set makes them of even passing interest while, say, waiting for the train. It's hard to imagine how this show made it to Broadway, but I suspect it will be on the express train to the next station.",
