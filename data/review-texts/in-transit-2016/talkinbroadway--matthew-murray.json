Credits ambition and talent but implies emotional distance from the material. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges ambition and talent but lacks enthusiasm, suggesting admiration without strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review states that the show is easier to admire than to love, indicating a mixed reaction. While acknowledging the show's ambition and the performers' talents, it doesn't offer a strong recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic praises the show's ambition and performers, the 'easier to admire than to love' framing indicates respect without enthusiasm, placing it in mixed territory.",
