  "bwwExcerpt": "Yet however gimmicky and commercially cynical as it might sound, 'In Transit' very quickly wears down your defenses. This is a modest show created and performed with palpable affection and infectious enthusiasm; the show's creators -- Kristen Anderson-Lopez, Russ Kaplan, James-Allen Ford and Sara Wordsworth -- wants us to love a cappella as much as they so evidently do.",
