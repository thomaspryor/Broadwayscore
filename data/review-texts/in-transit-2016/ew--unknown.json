  "bwwExcerpt": "Comedy also abounds, and the jokes are plentiful, even if they don't all land. Sure, everyone gets the pizza rat quip - that video went viral around the world - but are non-New Yorkers going to appreciate references to Dr. Zizmor, manspreading, or the dreaded empty car? The laughter for these was sparse, making it clear who in the audience was a tourist and who were the locals. Some of the more well-known pop culture references, including name-checking Lin-Manuel Miranda, Pippa Middleton, and Duck Dynasty, elicited a stronger reaction.",
