  "bwwExcerpt": "Subways are for singing, at least in the world of 'In Transit,' the charming a cappella musical of metropolitan life that's rapturously harmonious, even when the times aren't. The likable, lightweight tuner, which had a run in 2010 at 59E59 - and an even earlier version as 'Along the Way' at 2003's New York Fringe Festival - evokes musicals and revues that celebrate the buzz of being young, hopeful and ever-striving in New York. Okay, so the storylines go back to the days when you still used tokens. But what gives 'In Transit' its new swipe is what's not there - the orchestra - and what is - glorious, pitch-perfect voices, set to Deke Sharon's rich and expressive arrangements.",

All the performers bring a high degree of likability to otherwise plaintive roles...It’s a surprisingly moving experience.\"\n\nRead more",
