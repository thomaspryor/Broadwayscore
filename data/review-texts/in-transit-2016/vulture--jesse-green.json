    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The phrase 'works best' suggests recommendation, and 'heartbreakingly ordinary' reads as appreciative of realistic storytelling, but the extremely brief excerpt and emphasis on messiness prevents higher confidence or score. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the musical has qualities that are both relatable and ordinary, but does not provide a clear recommendation or discouragement. The tone is neutral, indicating a mixed assessment. | Gemini: The review suggests the musical is enjoyable when it embraces the messiness of life, implying a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the show's realism and emotional authenticity ('heartbreakingly ordinary') but implies uneven quality by noting it only 'works best' under specific conditions. The single-sentence length lacks clear recommendation language. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Mixed",
