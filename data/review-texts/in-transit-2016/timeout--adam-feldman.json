Review acknowledges positive elements but identifies significant structural flaws that prevent full endorsement. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some touching moments but criticizes the show for lacking a cohesive story. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (\"touching moments\") but ultimately finds the show lacking in narrative cohesion, aligning with a mixed assessment. The original rating of 60 supports this classification. | Kimi: The critic assigns a 60/100 rating and offers a balanced assessment acknowledging genuine emotional moments while criticizing the show's structural limitations as a series of vignettes rather than a cohesive narrative.",
