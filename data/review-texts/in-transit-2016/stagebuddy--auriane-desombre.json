  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The musical relies entirely on acappella, which fits into the interweaving of its characters well. This creates a great sound that supports the story’s themes of interconnection. Those themes, however, feel a little light...Where it lacks in thematic profundity, the show shines with its humor, delivering a charming and witty love letter to life in the city. Directed by Kathleen Marshall, the wonderful performances bring out the show’s many brilliant comedic moments.\"\n\nRead more",
