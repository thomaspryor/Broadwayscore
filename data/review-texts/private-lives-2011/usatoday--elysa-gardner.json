  "bwwExcerpt": "It helps that esteemed director Richard Eyre applies a light, sure hand, and the actors show a similar ease and dexterity. Cattrall's Amanda is adorably feminine, with a breezy, un-self-conscious energy that mitigates the character's narcissism. As the equally narcissistic Elyot, Canadian actor Paul Gross is less endearing but just as entertaining.",
