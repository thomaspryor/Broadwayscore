  "bwwExcerpt": "The show mostly steers clear of sourness because of our awareness of a redeeming self-consciousness in Amanda and Elyot. Even when these two are going at it hammer and tongs, you have the sense of their watching themselves, on some level, and being elegantly amused by their inelegant behavior. In this version of Coward's soignée world, pratfalls are at least as important as poses.",

This indicates a negative verdict. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that even good dialogue can't save the show due to the actors' performances, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: While the critic praises the 'scintillating dialogue,' the verdict that it 'can't save' the show and the criticism that the stars seem to be 'performing in different plays' indicates a clear recommendation against seeing this production.",
