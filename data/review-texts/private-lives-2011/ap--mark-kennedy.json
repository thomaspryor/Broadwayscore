  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Richard Eyre and the cast succeed in a tricky balancing act for a play written in 1930: Keep the humor, but lose much of the affected, mannered performances - all those 'darlings' and 'splendids' and Coward bon mots - that often make his plays seem frothy and insubstantial. The result, which opened Thursday at the Music Box Theatre, is funny and insightful in its attempt to reconcile the notion of marriage and sexual attraction, and yet also doesn't shy away from exploring the link between lust and violence.",
