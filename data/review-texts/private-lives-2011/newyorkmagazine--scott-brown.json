  "bwwExcerpt": "Gross is the evening's highlight, with his flawless lacquer of disdain broken only by eruptions of mania. (His third-act face-off with Day's fusty, fuming Victor is particularly zippy and unpredictable.) He's in close touch with the anarchist, the sociopath and the romantic struggling to burst from Elyot's crisp English outer-chrysalid. Cattrall is all poise and perfect timing as Amanda, Elyot's double and opposite-number.",
