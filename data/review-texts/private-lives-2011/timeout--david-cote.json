  "bwwExcerpt": "Eyre's production-handsomely designed by Rob Howell (set and costumes) and dreamily lit by David Howe-exudes intelligence and style, but misses the necessary balance of musicality and silliness, of brittleness and bluff-without which Coward comes across as arch, empty fluff. Exquisitely contrived and capriciously sustained, Private Lives is one of his vintage almost-farces, a comedy of marital manners in which the divorced Amanda and Elyot find themselves in adjoining honeymoon suites in the South of France on second marriages. In short order they reunite in shock, feign apathy, fall in love again and adulterously elope, leaving their killjoy spouses (Simon Paisley Day, Anna Madeley) to track them down in Paris.",
