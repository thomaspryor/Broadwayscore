  "bwwExcerpt": "Ms. Cattrall, to be sure, looks gorgeous, but she doesn't look 30, and the fact that the play has been recast to accommodate her age—Mr. Gross is 52—distorts it still further...Between Mr. Day's stiff-upper-lip Victor and Mr. Gross's urbanely exasperated Elyot, this 'Private Lives' is quite good enough to be worth seeing. But Ms. Cattrall's earthbound performance keeps it from taking wing, and a production of 'Private Lives' that fails to soar can't help but disappoint.",
