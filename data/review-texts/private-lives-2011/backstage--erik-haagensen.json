  "bwwExcerpt": "The reason for this revival is Kim Cattrall, a fine stage actor whose 'Sex and the City' TV and film gigs have made her bankable. Cattrall, in her mid-50s, looks great and handles an English accent effortlessly, but she has trouble locating Amanda's dryness and mercurial whimsy. Gross, also 50ish, a top Canadian star known here for his wonderful work on the TV series 'Slings and Arrows,' looks just as great and brings a commanding presence to the stage.",
