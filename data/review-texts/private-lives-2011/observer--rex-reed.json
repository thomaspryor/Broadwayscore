However, this appears to be just an opening line, so confidence is medium due to the brief excerpt. | GPT-4o: The review expresses clear enthusiasm for the revival, highlighting its sophistication and implying a strong recommendation to see it. | Gemini: The review states that the revival is a \"welcome reminder\", indicating a positive sentiment and recommendation, though not an overwhelmingly enthusiastic one. | Kimi: The critic offers an unqualified recommendation, praising the revival as a 'welcome reminder' of sophisticated comedy without any expressed reservations, though the brevity of the text limits confidence.",
