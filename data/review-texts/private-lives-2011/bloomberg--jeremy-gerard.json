  "bwwExcerpt": "Cattrall, an experienced stage actress, is easier to admire than adore as Amanda...until, that is, she starts to bellow like a shrew, which is all too often, given the explosive nature of Amanda and Elyot's love. The sophistication yields to coarseness. Quite the same is true of Gross, who never manages the suavity Elyot must wear like a dinner jacket if his easy brutishness is to be at all tolerable.",
