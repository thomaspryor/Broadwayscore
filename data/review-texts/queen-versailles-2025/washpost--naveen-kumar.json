The language used suggests a negative assessment, recommending potential ticket buyers to escape these 'horrors of capitalism.' | Gemini: The review is mixed, describing the show as \"overdone and undercooked\" and lacking a coherent point of view. The final sentence suggests that it's escapable, implying it's not a must-see, but not a complete disaster either.",

Kristin Chenoweth’s Jackie Siegel, an unduly naive “Real Housewives” type, waves off whether the crowd is laughing with her or at her. “Doesn’t matter!” she chirps. “We’re a hit.”\n\n24 CommentsMost ReadOpinionMichael ShermerI’ve reported on UFO sightings for decades — and come to this conclusionJanuary 29, 2026Salvador RizzoDOJ misconduct complaint against D.C. federal judge dismissedEarlier todayOpinionEditorial BoardTrump’s tariffs can’t cover a bill this staggeringJanuary 26, 2026NewsletterFridaysBook ClubOur weekly selection of book reviews and recommendations from Book World editor Ron Charles.Sign up\n\nAs a California consumer, you have the right to opt-out from the sale or sharing of your personal information at any time across business platform, services, businesses and devices.
