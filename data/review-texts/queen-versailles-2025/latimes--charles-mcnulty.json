  "dtliExcerpt": "“The Queen of Versailles” is designed to bring out all of Chenoweth’s Broadway shine. She never looks less than perfectly photoshopped, but the production ultimately overtaxes her strengths. New musicals are impossible dreams, and this is a whopper of a show, daunting in scale and jaw-dropping in ambition. If only Chenoweth’s dazzling star power didn’t have to do so much of the heavy lifting.",

The single excerpt and aggregator context suggest a balanced view with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review highlights Chenoweth's star power but suggests the production overtaxes her and is overly ambitious. This indicates a mixed assessment, not fully recommending or discouraging.",
