  "bwwExcerpt": "the play’s positive components do not make up for its faults. Broadway is the wrong medium for this story. Musicalizing the story does little to ground the audience in Jackie’s world and instead pulls and stretches the tale, when the themes alone could speak for themselves.

However, it also points out some reservations about the musical's execution and thematic elements. The overall tone suggests a positive recommendation, albeit with noted flaws. | Gemini: Despite some criticisms about the show's length and score, the critic states that these issues did not detract from their enjoyment, particularly praising the lead performers. The truncated text makes it difficult to assess the overall strength of the recommendation, but the positive sentiment is clear.",
