  "dtliExcerpt": "But the new show from “Wicked” composer Stephen Schwartz and playwright Lindsey Ferrentino is both overdone and undercooked: Rather than decide whether to romanticize or satirize its subjects, the musical ventures a gaudy and confused mix of both without a coherent point of view.",
  "bwwExcerpt": "In a way, “The Queen of Versailles” suitably mirrors Jackie’s extravagant unfinished estate: It, too, is an ostentatious token of excess that ultimately proves hollow. At least these particular horrors of capitalism potential ticket buyers have the option to escape.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Rather than eat the rich, the musical settles for nipping them on the nose with all the ferocity of Jackieâs cuddly white Pomeranian.\"",
