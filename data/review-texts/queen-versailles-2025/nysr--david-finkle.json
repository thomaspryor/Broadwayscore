  "dtliExcerpt": "Significantly, there’s nothing wrong with the cast Chenoweth heads like Lady Liberty raising her lamp. Though Abraham disappears for such long periods of time he’s often all but forgotten, he’s his imposing self when present. Others contributing strongly (many members taking on multiple roles) include Melody Butiu as a steadfast Siegel household staffer, Cassondra James as a regal Marie Antoinette, and Stephen DeRosa and Isabel Keating as Jackie’s concerned parents.",
