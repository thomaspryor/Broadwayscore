  "dtliExcerpt": "Significantly, there’s nothing wrong with the cast Chenoweth heads like Lady Liberty raising her lamp. Though Abraham disappears for such long periods of time he’s often all but forgotten, he’s his imposing self when present. Others contributing strongly (many members taking on multiple roles) include Melody Butiu as a steadfast Siegel household staffer, Cassondra James as a regal Marie Antoinette, and Stephen DeRosa and Isabel Keating as Jackie’s concerned parents.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Final observation: At a point in the 1970s, Schwartz had three shows running on and off-Broadway: Godspell, Pippin, and The Magic Show. (There might even have been a fourth—The Baker’s Wife.) Right now, he’s matched the three-record with Wicked showing no signs of ever closing on Broadway, this one also on Broadway, and The Baker’s Wife currently revived off-Broadway. Congrats to him for that kind of rare happenstance. Imagine the personal pleasure as well as the weekly royalties.",
