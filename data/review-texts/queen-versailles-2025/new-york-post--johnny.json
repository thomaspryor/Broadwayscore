  "dtliExcerpt": "I hoped the tag-team of Chenoweth and Arden would have magic to do. No such luck. The actress is a theatrical force, as everybody knows, but Simone Biles can’t do a back handspring on a toothpick, either. With skin-deep material to work with, Chenoweth transparently leans into broad yuks like she’s serving donuts for dinner. If only her long-anticipated return could be returned.",
