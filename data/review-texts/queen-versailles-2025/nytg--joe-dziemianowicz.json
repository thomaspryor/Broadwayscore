  "fullText": "Read our review of The Queen of Versailles on Broadway, starring Tony Award winner Kristin Chenoweth and adapted from the 2012 documentary of the same name. Mentions of mirrors pop up throughout The Queen of Versailles. It's a neat irony, since Jacqueline “Jackie” Siegel — the real-life socialite played with relentless, amped-up fervor by Kristin Chenoweth — seems incapable on stage of true self-reflection. Self-indulgence, self-deception, and self-entitlement? Yes, yes, and yes. So, spending nearly 3 hours with her and her billionaire timeshare-tycoon husband, David (F. Murray Abraham), in this busy but only fitfully engaging new Broadway musical is a long sit. Creators Stephen Schwartz (music and lyrics) and Lindsey Ferrentino (book) drew on Lauren Greenfield’s same-named 2012 documentary, and events that came after its release, to turn Jackie’s life into a musical. In Orlando, Florida, the Siegels are years, and millions, into building America’s largest private home (dubbed Versailles) when the 2008 financial crisis hits. Ouch. In Act 1 of the Broadway show, the documentary unfolds in real time, with the camera crew following the family. Jackie reflects on her middle-class upbringing, pageant history, and a failed first marriage that produced daughter Victoria (Nina White). The family includes nanny Sofia (Melody Butiu), six other kids we don’t meet, and a niece, Jonquil (Tatum Grace Hopkins), whom we do. The act closes with the upended home construction. In Act 2, tragedy and chaos escalate with the deaths of unfed lizards, the passing of loved ones, and more reveals about Versailles. But is it a story that sings? The argument on stage at the St. James Theatre isn’t very persuasive. Schwartz is famous for expressive, tuneful, and character-rich songs, as heard in Wicked, Pippin, and Godspell. Victoria’s solos “Pretty Wins” and “The Book of Random” are quirky and summon deep pain. Jackie’s big numbers, meanwhile, get flattened by workmanlike lyrics — about her “Caviar Dreams,” a mom’s love growing “Each and Every Day,” and dreams materializing “This Time Next Year.” Make no mistake, diminutive Tony-winning dynamo Chenoweth works overtime. In short skirts and plunging tops, she showcases her comic chops while fully deploying her voice: big belt, soaring soprano, and warm, mellow middle tones. Like a timeshare broker, she’s up there selling her character and the show. (It's a contrast from the documentary, where the real Jackie appears more low-key, not exaggerated or overtly performing.) But as directed by Michael Arden, the show isn’t clear on what it’s pitching. Even with its nods to the French Revolution — namely, a guillotine — it falters as a cutting satire of the self-serving rich who build gilded palaces with ballrooms “Because We Can.” The show isn’t weird or inventive enough to delight as camp. So, it sits there, like an unfinished building. In the script, the show’s subtitle is “an American fable,” but the lesson of The Queen of Versailles is unclear. Crown it a royal mishmash. The Broadway musical The Queen of Versailles is based on the 2012 documentary of the same name, which follows real-life couple Jackie and David Siegel as they attempted to build a Florida megamansion called Versailles and were hit by the 2008 financial crisis that brought the collapse of their fortune. The musical incorporates events that occurred after the movie came out in 2012 and also invents some fictional incidents. The show previously premiered in Boston, Massachusetts in July 2024. The musical brings the eagerly anticipated reunion of Chenoweth and Schwartz, whose collaboration on the still-running Wicked is part of the Broadway record books. The Queen of Versailles also reunites Arden with set designer Dane Laffrey, following their Tony Award wins this past June for Maybe Happy Ending. Work by Laffrey, who also handled projections, impresses. The set reveals the show’s biggest transformation — from construction site to palace. On the review aggregator site Show-Score, the musical has a 62% audience approval rating. Read more audience reviews of The Queen of Versailles on Show-Score. Despite the show's shortcomings, Kristin Chenoweth is a one-of-a-kind stage performer whose work leaves deep impact. Learn more and get The Queen of Versailles tickets on New York Theatre Guide.

She's the embodiment of the American Dream, and to show you how far she’s come, she’s inviting you into her home, Versailles, under construction as the largest private home in the US. But with a recession looming, her dreams may be shattered. Academy Award winner Stephen Schwartz wrote the music and lyrics, and as he has shown in shows like Wicked, Pippin, and Godpsell, they will feature fun ensemble numbers, soaring solos, and music tinged with a pop flair. Michael Arden, a 2 time Tony winner for directing Maybe Happy Ending and the revival of Parade, directs this new musical. Playwright Lindsey Ferrentino, a finalist for the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize, wrote the book and Stephen Schwartz (Wicked) wrote the music and lyrics. The Boston production was met with rave reviews. Variety wrote that star \"Kristin Chenoweth shines in a lavish new musical with a social satire bite.\" This new musical does not have an age recommendation yet but audiences must be ages four and up to enter Broadway theatres.
