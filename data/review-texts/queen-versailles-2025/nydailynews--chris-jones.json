  "dtliExcerpt": "Never mind Glinda. Here, Chenoweth drives the new musical from Stephen Schwartz and Lindsey Ferrentino with a singular combo of raw determination and a beguilingly empathetic commitment to veracity. Chenoweth, with the help of the director Michael Arden, gets Jackie Siegel exactly right. The star refuses the temptation to ironically detach herself from the pile-driving, poor-born woman who watches “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,” marries rich and old, and then tries to build Versailles in Central Florida, only to find in the end that it’s no fun alone. Instead, Chenoweth just plays her as a complex human. Like the rest of us.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "I suspect some will want far more blue state judgment with their big Broadway night out. Not I. I’m all for a huge, morally complicated show that sends your head spinning through the mirrored funhouse of Versailles in Central Florida, musing on all-American achievement and aspiration and realizing family and friends are the only way to happiness.",
