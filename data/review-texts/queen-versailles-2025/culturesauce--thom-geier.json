  "fullText": "Jackie Siegel, the buxom pageant queen turned billionaire's wife who was the subject of Lauren Greenfield's 2012 documentary The Queen of Versailles, was present at the performance of the Broadway musical adaptation when I attended — with her fluffy white lap dog as an accessory and a full entourage calling out her name during the overlong pre-show and intermission periods. She and her late husband, David, a Florida real estate developer who overextended himself in the 2000s on subprime mortgages on his vast network of time-share vacation properties, are also credited in the Playbill as investors. And therein lies the uncomfortable truth at the center of The Queen of Versailles, a tone-deaf celebration of all-American affluenza that can never resolve how we should feel about the vain, misguided woman at its center.\n\nJackie is portrayed by that human spitfire, Kristin Chenoweth, bringing just the right amount of sex appeal to the role of the gold-digging uber-mom who raises eight kids in the lap of luxury and sets her sights on building the largest private home in America, a 90,000-square-foot monstrosity modeled on the Palace in Versailles (and which remains unfinished to this day). The desire for creature comforts is the heart of Jackie's big Act 1 \"I wish\" song, a countryish ballad called \"Caviar Dreams\" that evokes Robin Leach's catchphrase from the syndicated 1980s series Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. It's easily the best song in the new score by Stephen Schwartz, which is full of pleasant but mostly unmemorable tunes that lack a distinctive point of view despite a strong melodic line and a musical button (\"American royalty\") that recalls his repeated \"Unlimited\" phrasing in Wicked.\n\nBut why should anyone in 2025 America care about a woman of admittedly modest means who suddenly marries into a great (if precarious) fortune and wants to flaunt it for all the world to see? There are moments when Lindsey Ferrentino's book hints at satire, and even tiptoes around depicting Jackie's hubris as a cautionary tale, but time and again the creative team seems to get cold feet and opts to revel in the Siegels' flair for excess. The main problem here is Ferrentino's book, which lifts a lot of material from Greenfield's documentary but fails to really dramatize any of it.\n\nThey also share a certain callous disregard for the feelings of those around them. For David, it's a junior business partner who also happens to be his son from a previous marriage (Greg Hildreth) — as well as the thousands of employees laid off when the 2008 financial crisis hits. For Jackie, it's everyone from her housekeeper/nanny (Melody Butiu), who's ignored her own children back home in the Philippines to raise a bunch of spoiled brats, to her insecure eldest daughter, Victoria (Nina White), to her teenage niece, Jonquil (Tatum Grace Hopkins), whom Jackie generously takes in when her parents abandon her and then just as quickly ignores.\n\nYou don't have to build a musical around characters that the audience wants to root for, but it certainly helps. The most human-shaped figure on stage is Sofia, the devoted servant who keeps the household running and spends a lot of her free time in the luxurious playhouse that the Siegel offspring stopped using years ago. Butiu gives Sofia some genuine dimensions as a woman who backburnered her own family to raise other people's kids, but she never gets a song of her own to make her more than an accessory. (Stephen DeRosa and Isabel Keating, meanwhile, are wasted as Jackie's salt-of-the-earth parents.)\n\nArden brings a gilded Mar-a-Lago-worthy polish to the proceedings, but there's a hollowness to this enterprise that's inescapable. Nobody here is storming the barricades — or holding Jackie or anyone else accountable for their selfishness. Should we admire Jackie? Pity her? This ill-timed trudge of a show seems content to watch her eat cake — with a supersize side of McDonald's fries.",
