  "fullText": "The production is impressively designed and wonderfully acted; the show has a pleasant enough new score by a high-profile composer who’s on a roll (his 1976 musical “The Baker’s Wife” is opening later this week Off-Broadway, and “Wicked: For Good” is being released later this month.) But it doesn’t adequately answer for me Sondheim’s essential question: Why should this be a musical?",
