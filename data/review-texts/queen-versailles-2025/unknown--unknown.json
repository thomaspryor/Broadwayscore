  "fullText": "In 2012, award-winning documentarian Lauren Greenfield’s film, “The Queen of Versailles,” became a Sundance darling. The documentary followed Jackie and David Siegel, billionaires and owners of Westgate Resorts, as they began building a replica of Versailles in Orlando, Florida. The property was touted as the largest private home in the United States. However, amid their massive build, the 2008 stock market crash drastically altered the couple’s financial status. Now, with a script written by Olivier Award nominee Lindsey Ferrentino, songs by Academy Award–winning songwriter Stephen Schwartz and directed by Tony Award winner Michael Arden, Kristin Chenoweth is stepping into Jackie Siegel’s sparkling pink stilettos and bringing her story to Broadway. Unfortunately, Greenfield’s dazzling assessment of greed, consumption and the American dream doesn’t translate on the stage.",
