At the St. James Theatre, 246 W. 44th St.\n\nAt the center of the Broadway musical “The Queen of Versailles” is an unfinished, 90,000-square-foot house in Florida — one of the biggest private homes in America.\n\nMisguided, over-the-top, well-intended and seemingly beyond repair, the mega-manse is meant to act as a metaphor for the American Dream.\n\nInstead, and within minutes, the Orlando-area colossus comes to represent the criminally bad show it’s in &#8212; a wrecking ball to good taste that opened Sunday night at the St. James Theatre.\n\nBoth Versailles, a very real property in Windermere, Florida, and “The Queen of Versailles” ultimately beg an identical question: Why on Earth did they do this?\n\nThe real Jackie Siegel wanted to leave behind her low-class upbringing with a Sunshine State palace inspired by the French one she visited on her honeymoon.\n\nOn the stage, perhaps “Wicked” composer Stephen Schwartz and book writer Lindsey Ferrentino sought to make a bold statement on economic disparity in a nation where extreme wealth is a hot topic.\n\nThe musical, after all, is based on a popular documentary made in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nOr maybe the creatives wished to hand star Kristin Chenoweth a meaty, campy diva role for her first Broadway musical in a decade.\n\nBut the answer more likely shares the same verbiage as one of the rough songs in the worst score of Schwartz’s long career: “Because we can.”\n\nThe end result is far too careless to believe anything otherwise.\n\nFor starters, the foundation is rotted. Even if the team won a lifetime supply of Wite-Out and started over from scratch, I don’t see the story of “The Queen of Versailles” ever being turned into a satisfying musical.\n\nThat’s clear from the undeniable fact that the composer, writer and director Michael Arden have no clue what to do with their ostentatious main character, the rags-to-riches pageant queen-turned-billionaire&#8217;s spouse Jackie Siegel.\n\nAre we supposed to love her? Are we supposed to loathe her? At the very least, should we want the best for her? The writers would probably tell you she’s complex. However, complexity is exciting. This slog is not.\n\nJackie settles for being a flirty, giggly black hole of emotion whose story isn’t served whatsoever by singing.\n\nShe is neither judged nor celebrated. She&#8217;s barely even explored as the show tries and fails to make her relatable. The woman just sort of peacocks around all night to bland songs, which could be because Siegel is involved with the production.\n\nAt the beginning, Siegel&#8217;s youthful aspirations are familiar.\n\nAs an upstate New York teen — and Chenoweth plays her at every age, too presentationally — she’s depicted as being obsessed with the TV series “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous” and host Robin Leach’s catchphrase “Champagne wishes and caviar dreams.”\n\nBut there is a squirmy cheesiness to her “I want” number called, erm, “Caviar Dreams,” in which she longs to be &#8220;far from the auto lots, chain restaurants and pool room bars.” She wants to be &#8220;American royalty.&#8221;\n\nIt was then in the St. James that I began to silently pray to Saint James for strength and guidance.\n\nAfter doing odd jobs, getting in a failed marriage and winning the Mrs. Florida pageant, Jackie reaches her goal when she marries the founder of the timeshare company Westgate, David Siegel.\n\nDavid, a milquetoast “Sure, honey” tracksuit tycoon, is played with a half-smirk by Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham, who must be madder at his agent than Salieri was at Mozart.\n\nHe enters in a dumb Wild West theme-park number called “The Ballad of the Timeshare King” that serves as a useful reminder that Schwartz’s specialty has never been comedy.\n\nOnce the couple get started on Versailles, and Act 2 attempts to confront serious family dramas among Jackie, her disapproving daughter Victoria (Nina White) and the niece she adopts, Jonquil (Tatum Grace Hopkins), prepare ye the way of the yawn. It’s defying brevity.\n\nThe terrible second part can best be summed up by two scenes: A perplexing requiem sung about a dead lizard is immediately followed by a trip to the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nI hoped the tag team of Chenoweth and Arden would have magic to do. No such luck. The actress is a theatrical force, as everybody knows, but Simone Biles can’t do a back handspring on a toothpick, either.\n\nWith skin-deep material to work with, Chenoweth transparently leans into broad yuks like she’s serving donuts for dinner. If only her long-anticipated return could be returned.\n\nAnd Arden, who delivered a brilliant new musical with “Maybe Happy Ending” last season, drops the ball by juggling too many. The sub-Zoom call live-videos as the documentary filmmakers shoot, an intellectually lazy 1661 frame story at the French court of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette that should’ve gotten the guillotine in early development, and unappealing staging on a drab construction site all come to naught.\n\nSiegel’s house in Florida remains under construction, and she claims it could be finished soon.\n\nThe Broadway musical about it? Scheduled for demolition.",
