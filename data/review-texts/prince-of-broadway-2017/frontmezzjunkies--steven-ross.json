  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A 'best of' revue performed by a cast of pros following Prince's over sixty years of work. It’s a jukebox musical of some sort that focuses on recreations of memorable moments, without giving us much insight as to the why and how...The men in general fair very well in this show, showcasing killer vocals...Part way in, 'Prince of Broadway' starts to feel like a greatest hits parade done by 'American Idol' contestants...It feels speedy and showy, and without a narrative to ground it.\"\n\nRead more",
