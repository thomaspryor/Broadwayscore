  "bwwExcerpt": "Imagine simultaneous revivals of a dozen or so of the standout musical productions of the latter half of the 20th century. That's more or less what Prince of Broadway crams into two-and-a-half hours, in sample-size nuggets that touch on the magic while leaving you craving more. Sifting through such an embarrassment of riches, it's inevitable that certain choices and omissions appear questionable, and the nine performers that make up the tremendously versatile and hard-working ensemble are a bett",

The phrase \"will please devotees while providing newcomers with a solid primer\" suggests a qualified endorsement. | Kimi: The critic delivers a clear recommendation describing the show as 'slick' and 'professionally assembled' with the verdict that it 'will please devotees,' but the praise is measured and functional ('solid primer') rather than exuberant, placing it in the mid-range of positive reviews.",
