Beyond his penchant for unconventional material, there's little insight into Prince's craft or his vision. It's not easy to detect the director's history in what we're seeing, since the musical numbers-greatest hits from shows including West Side Story, Sweeney Todd, Company and Cabaret, plus a sprinkling of relative obscurities-feature new casts, new choreography (by codirect",

The 60 rating confirms mixed territory - acknowledging positives while expressing significant reservations about the theatrical experience. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'pleasant' but lacking in depth, aligning with a mixed verdict. The original rating of 60 supports this classification. | Gemini: The review is mixed, describing the show as \"pleasant enough\" but not a \"fully realized theatrical experience.\" The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60 rating and lukewarm assessment—calling the show 'pleasant enough' but criticizing it as more of a tribute concert than fully realized theater—places this squarely in the Mixed bucket.",
