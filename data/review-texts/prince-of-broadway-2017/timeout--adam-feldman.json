    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic finds it 'pleasant enough' but criticizes it as feeling incomplete as theater. The 60 rating confirms mixed territory - acknowledging positives while expressing significant reservations about the theatrical experience. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'pleasant' but lacking in depth, aligning with a mixed verdict. The original rating of 60 supports this classification. | Gemini: The review is mixed, describing the show as \"pleasant enough\" but not a \"fully realized theatrical experience.\" The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60 rating and lukewarm assessment—calling the show 'pleasant enough' but criticizing it as more of a tribute concert than fully realized theater—places this squarely in the Mixed bucket.",
