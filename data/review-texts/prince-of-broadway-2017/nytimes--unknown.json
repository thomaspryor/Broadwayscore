If only such reminders came more frequently in this motley production.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed feelings - acknowledges likable performers but compares unfavorably to dinner theater and finds production 'motley.' Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'overtaxed' and 'motley', with a negative comparison to a 'dinner theater'. Though the ensemble is described as 'likable', the overall tone suggests disappointment and a lack of coherence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the likable ensemble but compares the production to a dinner theater experience, suggesting a lack of polish or depth. The final sentence implies that positive moments are infrequent, leading to a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the critic praises the ensemble as 'likable' and acknowledges rare moments that recall Prince's genius ('shivers'), the overall verdict is clearly negative. The production is described as 'overtaxed,' 'rushed,' 'motley,' and compared unfavorably to dinner theater, with the critic lamenting that effective moments are too infrequent. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
