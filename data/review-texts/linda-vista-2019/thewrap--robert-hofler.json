  "bwwExcerpt": "The creep is a middle-aged guy named Dick Wheeler, and the role fits Ian Barford like a well-used boxing glove. He immediately seduces with his wild, irreverent sense of humor, and Letts wraps him up with cutting barbs. 'Linda Vista' is one of those boulevard comedies that you don't see on Broadway anymore. Television made them obsolete, and in its opening scenes, 'Linda Vista' plays like a great TV pilot.",
