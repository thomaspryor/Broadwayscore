    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this firmly in Mixed territory. The review balances positive elements (funny, smart, bracingly honest) against negative ones (indulgent), with no clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review. The description acknowledges both positive aspects ('funny, sad, smart') and reservations ('somewhat indulgent'), indicating a balanced view without a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses both positive and negative descriptors, suggesting a mixed experience. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the \"Mixed\" bucket. | Kimi: The critic's explicit 60/100 rating places this in the Mixed range, supported by the text praising the show as 'funny, sad, smart' and 'bracingly honest' while criticizing it as 'somewhat indulgent'.",
