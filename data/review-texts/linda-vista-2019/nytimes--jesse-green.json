    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review criticizes the protagonist as self-absorbed with problems that burden others, but praises Barford's performance for making the character complex and compelling. This suggests a show worth seeing for the acting despite character/story issues. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a key performance but doesn't offer a clear recommendation, suggesting a mixed or neutral assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the lead actor's complex performance but suggests the play itself is a taxing experience ('becomes everyone else's problem'). With only two sentences provided, the overall recommendation remains unclear.",
