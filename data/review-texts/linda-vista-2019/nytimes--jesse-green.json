  "fullText": "The everyday poison known as toxic masculinity becomes dangerously easy to swallow in “Linda Vista,” Tracy Letts’s inspired, ruthless take on the classic midlife-crisis comedy. In the sunny opening scenes of this very funny, equally unsettling Steppenwolf Theater production — which opened on Thursday at the Hayes Theater — you’ll probably feel like cozying up to that sheepish, disheveled big guy who rules the stage with his outspoken wit.\n\nPlayed with immense, shaggy charm — and anger to match — by Ian Barford in a performance that reminds you of how brilliantly bruising Steppenwolf acting can be, this charismatic loser is named Wheeler. Actually, it’s Dick Wheeler, but he prefers to dispense with the first name, perhaps on the theory that it’s better not to provide too many clues to your essential nature.\n\nWhen we first see Wheeler, he’s moving into new digs in San Diego, with the help of his best friend, Paul (Jim True-Frost), schlepping boxes and overstuffed bags with the sloppy casualness of college boys returning to campus. Never mind that Wheeler is 50.\n\nTheir conversation, too, has a sophomoric ring, as they debate the right word for big breasts, like the pair on one of Wheeler’s co-workers. And there’s a hilarious riff on their teenage crush on Ali MacGraw, who, Paul says, confessed to being a sex addict in her memoir.\n\nIs this talk too sexist for comfort? Wheeler might argue that he and Paul are just goofing (sort of), that they’re also enlightened 21st-century men who understand that some kinds of behavior regarding the opposite sex are no longer cool. You can sense that kind of self-consciousness at work when he’s talking to women.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review criticizes the protagonist as self-absorbed with problems that burden others, but praises Barford's performance for making the character complex and compelling. This suggests a show worth seeing for the acting despite character/story issues. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a key performance but doesn't offer a clear recommendation, suggesting a mixed or neutral assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the lead actor's complex performance but suggests the play itself is a taxing experience ('becomes everyone else's problem'). With only two sentences provided, the overall recommendation remains unclear.",
