However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning suggest a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"zippy score\", \"terrific tap numbers\", \"energetic performances\", and \"feel-good musicals\", indicating a positive recommendation.",
