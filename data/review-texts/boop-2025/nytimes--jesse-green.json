  "bwwExcerpt": "But none of that explains or justifies the show’s existence. Nor, despite enormous effort, can the book by Bob Martin.

That show’s imaginary ‘Eleanor! The Eleanor Roosevelt Musical,’ is no less ludicrous than the real-life ‘Boop! The Musical.’",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The It girl with the spit curl looks great for 100, but her Broadway musical, which feels like one big merch grab, is boop-boop-a-donât\"",
