    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show positively as 'heartfelt' and 'feel-good,' but extremely limited text prevents assessment of full verdict. Using lower end of Positive bucket due to single excerpt warning and minimal content. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'old fashioned, heartfelt, feel-good,' which suggests a positive sentiment. However, the single excerpt warning indicates that this may not represent the full review, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the musical as \"heartfelt, feel-good,\" which indicates a positive, though not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, review. Given that it is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt uses clearly positive descriptors ('heartfelt,' 'feel-good') indicating a solid recommendation, though the limited excerpt prevents higher confidence or a rave classification.",
