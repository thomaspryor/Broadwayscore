Its intentions are foggy and sometimes suspicious. \"Boop! The Musical\" now playing at the Broadhurst Theater, in a production directed and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell is a \"why?\" show par excellence.\"",

The use of 'disappointing' suggests a negative verdict, though the single excerpt limits full context. | Gemini: The review explicitly labels the show as a disappointing example of a subgenre, indicating a negative assessment. The phrase \"why?\" show suggests the critic finds the production unnecessary or lacking a clear purpose.",
