  "fullText": "If you are not a Baby Boomer, chances are you would have never seen any of the black and white Betty Boop cartoons that made the spit curl bombshell a household name. Now that she has made her way to Broadway, courtesy of Bob Martin’s book, David Foster’s music and Susan Birkenhead’s lyrics, everyone, (young and not so young), can enjoy Boop’s transformation and journey. There is absolutely no reason why you would not thoroughly enjoy the old, new-fashioned animated icon as she comes to life in the big Broadway Musical “Boop.” Mr. Martin takes Betty out of her 1930’s black and white, male dominated existence, and hurls her into the present day where she discovers the vibrant colorful, and diverse world of today. She is smart, curious, and adventurous, as she fully embraces the multifaced city of New York where she discovers vibrant color, makes new friends and finds love, and becomes her own woman. If that isn’t enough, her adorable dog Pudgy (embodied by marionette artist Phillip Huber), comes along for the ride. Mr. Martin’s book is quite simple and easy to follow, with a few sub plots thrown in just to make things a bit interesting. Betty’s mad scientist Grampy (an eccentric Stephen DeRosa) has invented a “trans-dimensional tempus locus actuating electro ambulator” which is basically a time machine. Betty (a remarkable Jasmine Amy Rogers) is transported through time, and lands in New York at the Comic Con Convention in 2025. She first meets Dwayne (a collected Ainsley Melham) and is mesmerized by his blue eyes, which is her first introduction to color. She later meets her biggest fan Trisha, (a precocious Angelica Hale), who happens to be Dwayne’s sister. Dwayne becomes Betty’s first romantic love. Back in the 1930’s Grampy discovers Betty is missing and must have time traveled, so he decides to go find her, and at the last-minute Betty’s dog Pudgy goes along for the ride. Grampy is then reunited with his past love, Valentina (a sensational Faith Prince), who helps him in his quest. That is the fundamental plot line. The specifics aren’t necessary, and – no spoiler alert – all ends well. The entire cast is incredible with no weak links. Director and Choreographer, Jerry Mitchell leads this excellent cast on a fast-paced ride through time, while providing a tributary nod to New York City. His choreography shines as executed by the energetic and extremely talented ensemble of dancers who become the pulse of this new musical. The smart lyrics of Ms. Birkenhead provide the characters with a flicker of intelligence, while also helping to advance the plot and service the sub-plots. The personality of this production can be discovered in the magnificent costume design by Gregg Barnes, transitioning from black and white to vibrant color. Combine those creative elements with the brilliant scenic design by David Rockwell, and there is the proof that artistic collaboration is necessary to achieve success. This is a big, family friendly musical that is pure joy. The fun is contagious, and you can’t help but let your guard down and be infected with the feel-good vibe that fills the theatre. As for Ms. Rogers, this may be her Broadway debut, but she is destined to follow in the footsteps of her character and become a big star and household name. Although this may be Mr. Foster’s first Broadway musical, let’s hope he has found yet another passionate outlet for his music. “Boop” is one of those old fashioned, heartfelt, feel-good musicals that helps shed just a bit more radiance on an already brightly lit Great White Way!
