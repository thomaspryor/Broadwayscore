Pretty much the same can be said about Boop! The Musical, which just opened at the Broadhurst, but especially about Jasmine Amy Rogers, the instant star imbuing each of the cartoon's iconic curls with larger-than-life charisma.\"",

This suggests a positive impression, though the single excerpt and lack of a definitive rating warrant a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review compares the musical favorably to its source material and praises the lead performance, suggesting a positive, though possibly not rave, recommendation. The single excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation language tempers the score.",
