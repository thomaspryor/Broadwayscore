The Musical\" likewise aims to remake and rebrand another dated pop character for contemporary times and audiences.\n\nUnlike Barbie, who has had a ubiquitous cultural presence for decades, Betty Boop is a Depression-era cartoon character of a jazz-age flapper, and in looks, attitude and style, she is of her time — not to say dimension.",

The conclusion suggests the show has potential but is not fully realized. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive and negative aspects of the show.
