    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt criticizes core elements as 'exhausting' with 'limp punchlines' and lacking 'emotional weight,' indicating clear disappointment. However, confidence is medium due to limited text availability. | GPT-4o: The review excerpts highlight significant issues with both the playful and real-world elements of the show, suggesting a lack of emotional weight and exhausting performances, indicating a negative impression. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights significant flaws in both the Toontown and real-world aspects of the production, suggesting an uneven experience that doesn't fully deliver on its emotional potential. This indicates a mixed assessment rather than a positive or negative one.",
