    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt criticizes both major elements of the show - calling Toontown 'exhausting' with 'limp punchlines' and noting the real world scenes lack subtlety and emotional weight. However, with only one excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the negative range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights significant issues with both the playful and real-world elements of the show, suggesting a lack of emotional weight and tiresome execution. The tone indicates a negative view, but the single excerpt limits full confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes significant flaws in both the 'Toontown' and 'real world' aspects of the production, suggesting an uneven experience that doesn't fully succeed. The language indicates neither a strong recommendation nor a strong discouragement.",
