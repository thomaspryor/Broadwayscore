  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Directed and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell, this is an old-fashioned candy shop of a show, where tasty confections are sold in bulk. When Boop! is corny, it's candy corn. Gorge on the multicolor gumdrops of its high-energy production numbers; chew the jelly beans of its gentle social-mindedness; let the caramel creams of its love story melt slightly oversweetly in your mouth. And above all, savor this show's red-hot cinnamon heart: Jasmine Amy Rogers, making a sensational Broadway debut as the 1930s animated-short icon Betty Boop.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The candy shop metaphor is overwhelmingly positive, celebrating the show's various elements and highlighting a 'sensational' lead performance. However, with only one excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review uses positive and vivid imagery to describe the show, likening it to a 'candy shop' with 'high-energy production numbers' and praises Jasmine Amy Rogers' performance. The tone suggests enjoyment and recommendation, though it acknowledges some oversweetness, indicating a positive but not unreserved endorsement. | Gemini: The review uses positive imagery and language to describe the show, comparing it to a candy shop and highlighting the lead actress's performance. While not a rave, it leans towards a recommendation.",
