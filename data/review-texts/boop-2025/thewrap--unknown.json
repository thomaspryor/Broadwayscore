However, this is only one excerpt so I'm scoring conservatively within the negative range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is strongly negative, comparing the production unfavorably to street performers and criticizing the costumes as 'seedy and smelly'. The tone suggests a strong disrecommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly negative, describing the costumes as \"seedy and smelly\" and comparing them unfavorably to people in Disney outfits on the street. This indicates a strong dislike for the production's aesthetic.",
