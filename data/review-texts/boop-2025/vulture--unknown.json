However, with only one curated excerpt available, the full review sentiment remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the musical does not fully succeed in capturing the essence of Betty Boop, indicating a lack of depth or impact. The critic's wish to understand more implies some level of engagement but ultimately a sense of unfulfillment. | Gemini: The critic's statement indicates a lack of connection with the musical, suggesting a mixed or neutral sentiment rather than a positive or negative one. The truncated nature of the text makes it difficult to assess the overall verdict with certainty.",
