    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises a standout performance, suggesting a positive view of at least part of the production. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses solely on praising the performance of Rogers as Betty Boop, suggesting a positive aspect of the musical. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive and leaning towards the higher end of the range due to the strong praise. | Kimi: The excerpt offers emphatic praise for the lead performance as the show's 'unmitigated highlight,' using strong positive language that suggests a favorable verdict. However, as a single curated excerpt, the overall review context is unknown, warranting low confidence and the upper end of the Positive range rather than a higher score.",
