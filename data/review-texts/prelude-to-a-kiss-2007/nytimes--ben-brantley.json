This is clearly negative criticism of the production quality. | GPT-4o: The critic suggests the production lacks polish and completeness, implying a negative view of the show's execution. | Gemini: The critic states the production feels like a rehearsal, indicating a lack of polish and overall quality, leading to a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic employs a pointed metaphor comparing the production to a 'rehearsal rather than a revival,' signaling that the show lacks polish, preparation, and professional finish. This represents a clear judgment of inadequacy, placing it in the negative range.",
