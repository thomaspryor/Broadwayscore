  "bwwExcerpt": "If you don't do recreational drugs but your friends do, you know the feeling. Everyone around you has smoked, snorted, dropped or injected something, and they're all having a great time. They all think the conversation they're having about a light bulb is fascinating. You, on the other hand, know they're talking nonsense. They're all on drugs. They're boring.You can replicate that feeling by seeing the new musical 'Flying Over Sunset,' which opened Monday at LCT's Vivian Beaumont Theater. Or, to put it more precisely, you can see the second act of this 160-minute musical.",
