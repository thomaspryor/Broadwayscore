  "bwwExcerpt": "Broadway, of course, should not dominated by schlocky copycat musicals based on old films, and ingenuity and experimentation must be encouraged. With risk, however, should come drama and the electricity of something new. Writer-director James Lapine has the originality part down, to put it mildly, but, boy, is his show sedate and esoteric. That's saying a lot for the man who wrote the strange-at-the-time books for 'Sunday in the Park With George' and 'Into the Woods.' They're 'Guys and Dolls' next to this. Beyond oddness, though, 'Flying Over Sunset' is unforgivably dull onstage. It would make a fascinating New Yorker article, but is far from a compelling, cohesive musical.",
