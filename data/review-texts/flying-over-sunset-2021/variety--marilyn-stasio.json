  "bwwExcerpt": "The show's trippy sensibility is strikingly displayed on Beowulf Boritt's spare, highly stylized cycloramic set and under Bradley King's luscious lighting, which turns the color blue into a juicy fruit so cool and sweet the eye can almost taste it. Mixing up the senses is very much a quality of this thoughtful and unusually literate musical, which book writer and director Lapine has apparently conceived as a head trip with brains.",
  "bwwScore": 7
