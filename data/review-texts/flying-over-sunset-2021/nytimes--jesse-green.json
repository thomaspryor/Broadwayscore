  "bwwExcerpt": "To a perpetual square, nothing is as mystifying as another person's high. Or so I learned in college, during the heyday of chemically induced inner journeys - and again at the Vivian Beaumont Theater the other night. Though sometimes mesmerizing, 'Flying Over Sunset,' the new musical about LSD that opened there on Monday, is mostly bewildering, and further proof that transcendence can't be shared.",
