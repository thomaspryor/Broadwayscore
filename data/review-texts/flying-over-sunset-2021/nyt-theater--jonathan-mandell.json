  "bwwExcerpt": "There are certainly some highlights in 'Flying Over Sunset,' chief among them Tony Yazbeck's phenomenal dancing as Cary Grant, accompanied step by step by 14-year-old newcomer Atticus Ware as his younger self. The choreographer, Michelle Dorrance, was a star performer in Stomp, and we hear the influence. The rest of the cast is also first-rate. However, after sitting through the nearly three hours of this unique fusion of high-minded spiritual contemplation, gossipy biographical tidbits, subtle comedy and fabricated hallucinations all presented in song and dance, I was never completely persuaded that these three famous figures belong in the same musical; indeed, it seemed unlikely that they would have had anything to do with one another.",

The mixed tone and lack of a clear recommendation suggest a score in the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review praises the performances and choreography but ultimately finds the premise unconvincing and the overall experience lacking a cohesive connection between the characters. | Kimi: While the critic praises specific performances as 'phenomenal' and 'first-rate,' the review concludes with fundamental reservations about whether the show's central conceit works, suggesting the three figures don't belong together dramatically.",
