The metaphor of being 'earthbound' implies a lack of success or impact. | Gemini: The review states that the show \"never quite takes flight\", indicating a negative assessment despite acknowledging the cast and creative team. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the stellar cast and creative team but delivers a definitive negative verdict using aviation metaphors ('never quite takes flight,' 'earthbound') to indicate the show fundamentally fails to achieve its potential or emotional impact.",
