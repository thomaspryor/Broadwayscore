    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic uses clearly positive descriptors 'thoughtful' and 'beautifully made' which indicates recommendation, but the text appears to be just an excerpt or opening line, limiting confidence in the full verdict. | Gemini: The review describes the musical as \"thoughtful\" and \"beautifully made,\" indicating a positive assessment. While not a rave, it's a clear recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers clear praise for the production's intelligence and craftsmanship, describing it as both 'thoughtful' and 'beautifully made.' Confidence is low due to the brevity of the excerpt.",
