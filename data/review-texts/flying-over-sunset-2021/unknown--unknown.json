    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise ('sometimes mesmerizing') but stronger criticism ('mostly bewildering'). The phrase 'further proof that transcendence can't be shared' suggests fundamental disappointment with the show's core premise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'sometimes mesmerizing' but 'mostly bewildering', indicating a mixed reception. The lack of full context and the single excerpt warning suggest a low confidence in the verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt states the show is \"sometimes mesmerizing\" but \"mostly bewildering,\" indicating a mixed reaction. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges occasional visual power ('sometimes mesmerizing'), the dominant verdict is negative ('mostly bewildering'), suggesting the show fails to achieve its transcendental goals. The single excerpt and truncation warrant low confidence.",
