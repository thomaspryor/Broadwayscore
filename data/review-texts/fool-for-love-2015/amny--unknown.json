  "bwwExcerpt": "The thin 70-minute drama, which won acclaim three decades ago and was made into a film with Kim Basinger, is essentially an unsettling character study with a sense of mystery behind it. Daniel Aukin's focused, highly physical revival is built around the intense interplay between Arianda, who evokes both a hurt young girl and a torrent of violent emotion, and Rockwell, who coolly struts around and cockily plays with his lasso as if he were the Marlboro Man.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the director's work as 'focused' and highlights strong performances, but calls the source material 'thin.' Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the revival's focus and the performances of the lead actors, suggesting a positive view. However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious, low-confidence score. | Gemini: The review describes the revival as \"focused\" and \"highly physical\", highlighting the intense performances of the leads. Given the limited text, it seems to be a positive review with some reservations, but the single excerpt makes it difficult to assess the overall sentiment with high confidence. | Kimi: While describing the play itself as 'thin,' the critic praises the revival's direction as 'focused' and 'highly physical,' with particular commendation for the intense interplay between the leads. Given only a single excerpt is available, this qualifies as a mildly positive recommendation in the lower Positive range.",
