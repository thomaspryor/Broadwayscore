  "bwwExcerpt": "Anyone who's ever slammed a door in anger will immediately recognize the hollow, stage-echo falseness of the two doors on the Fool for Love set-two doors that get slammed about once for each of the 75 minutes in Sam Shepard's 1983 play (playing now through Dec. 6 at Broadway's Samuel J. Friedman Theatre). The slamming, which produces a stereo boom you can feel in your organs, eventually becomes rote and numbing. As does much else in this staunch, uninvolving production, which features tempestuous performers in Nina Arianda and Sam Rockwell, but offers them not much more than glum platitudes on bad romance.",
