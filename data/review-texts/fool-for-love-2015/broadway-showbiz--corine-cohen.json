  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Sam Shepard has an edgy, gritty, rough and raw style that appeals to me. His plays are always about dysfunctional relationships and families. This is his best production since 'Curse of The Starving Class' which was about 20 years ago. His plays are seductive, raw, heart wrenching...While this show might be too raw for many tourists, I found the acting and play riveting. If you’re a Shepard fan, you are in for a treat!\"\n\nRead more",
