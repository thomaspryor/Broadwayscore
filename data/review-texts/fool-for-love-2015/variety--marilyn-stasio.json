  "fullText": "Love hurts — quite literally, in the Manhattan Theater Club's highly physicalized revival of Sam Shepard‘s 1983 play “Fool for Love.” The production originated last year at the Williamstown Theater Festival, which accounts for the easy rapport between Sam Rockwell and Nina Arianda as the battling lovers whose unbreakable bond of love and hate have made their lives a living hell. This may not be the definitive production of this iconic play, but director Daniel Aukin has done a thoroughly professional job.\n\nShepard’s assault-and-battery love story felt a lot more immediate thirty years ago, when the writer-turned-movie-star had recently separated from his first wife to start a new relationship with Jessica Lange. At the time, Shepard talked about “the absolute hell” of falling in love, a human condition he called “terrible and impossible.” That cri de coeur infuses the play with its dual sense of desire and despair.\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n VIP+\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n How Indie Film and Los Angeles Can Help Each Other \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Kelly Marie Tran on How 'Wedding Banquet' Empowered Her to Come Out as Queer and Why 'Star Wars' Racism Is a 'Microcosm for the Social Climate'\n\nThe tormented lovers in “Fool for Love” are a broken-down cowboy named Eddie (Rockwell, wonderfully at ease in the role) and his beaten-down girlfriend May (Tony Award winner Arianda, exhausted from battle). May has been hiding out in a ratty motel in the Mojave Desert. It's the kind of place where you go to blow your brains out. The kind of place where a wheezy ghost known only as The Old Man (Gordon Joseph Weiss, perfectly cast) sits on the porch to watch.\n\nEddie has finally tracked May down to this hellhole, and having driven 2,480 miles to find her, he’s determined to bring her back to their trailer in Wyoming. She resists — and the battle lines are drawn.\n\nYou get a strong sense that this scene has played itself out many times before, like a painful ritual that must be repeated until one or both of them collapse. These ritualized couplings (carefully choreographed by David S. Leong) consist mainly of one lover throwing the other against the wall or across the bed — although Eddie adds his signature touch of twirling a lasso normally used to subdue farm animals. His legs bowed and his posture a perpetual slouch, Rockwell is so genuinely invested in this cowboy role that anyone would take him for the real thing.\n\nIn between the bruising body contact, Eddie and May devour each other with fierce kisses. Along with all this body-slamming and lip-bruising, there is also dialogue, and some of the language is pure Sam Shepard gold. Like the anecdote the Old Man tells about finding himself in the middle of a herd of cows, or when Eddie joins him in recollecting their family drama. Rockwell and Weiss mine this old gold like prospectors who just got lucky.\n\nBut “Fool for Love” is far more physical than other plays by Shepard, and physicality is Arianda’s strong suit. The actress has a remarkably supple back, which she uses in expressive ways — curled in on itself like a beaten puppy, or hunched in a corner like a rabid dog. Long legs, strong body, she’s battle-ready and built for slamming doors (Ryan Rumery had the fun job of amplifying the sound) and kicking her lover in the groin.\n\nActors love this play, as do student audiences. And if laid-back Rockwell and body-conscious Arianda don’t quite have their acts together, Shepard is served well enough to satisfy his fan base.",

Henry-esque stories from contempo Tehran are woven together with mixed results in “Wednesday, May 9,” the debut feature of multihyphenate Vahid Jalilvand. Excellent acting from top star Niki Karimi in a decidedly unglamorous part in the first episode, and from sweet-faced newcomer Sahar Ahmadpour in the second, raises their tales of woe above mere melodrama. But the third story, about a would-be philanthropist who hasn’t fully considered the best way to distribute his largesse, comes off as forced and awkward. Some critical support, plus the top prize from the recent Reykjavik Film Festival, should parlay the pic into further festival exposure; sales agent Noori Pictures closed deals with Italy and Benelux after its Venice world premiere.\n\nEarly on the morning of Wednesday, May 9, long lines of the poor and afflicted wait outside an office building in an upscale Tehran neighborhood, drawn by an unusual advertisement in the newspaper offering 30 million tomans (about $10,000) to someone in need. Overwhelmed by the sheer numbers, the local police panic and try to disperse the crowds before driving off with Jalal (Amir Aghaei, the weak link in the acting department), the man who placed the ad. The shots of the crowd, consisting of the disabled, disfigured and truly distressed, register an almost documentary-like authenticity.\n\nMeanwhile, waiting apart from the throng, clad in a billowing black chador that marks her as working-class religious, Leila (Karimi) observes the goings-on with sadness before rushing to her job at a chicken slaughterhouse. Her husband, Ali (played by the helmer), is paralyzed and requires nearly full-time care, but an expensive operation might restore his mobility. In a turn of events that strains credibility, it turns out that Jalal is Leila’s ex-fiance from long ago, who abandoned her when he had a chance to leave their village. He promises her the money, but the jealous Ali is opposed to accepting his help. In filming Leila and Ali’s humble abode, veteran lenser Morteza Poursamadi uses tight compositions and framing within windows and doors to express the characters’ sense of isolation. (His expressive work is the standout of the attractive tech package.)\n\nOrphan Setareh (Ahmadpour) is another supplicant for Jalal’s money. She lives with her strict aunt (Afarin Obeisi), whose son Esmaeel (Borzou Arjmand) nurses an unrequited passion for his pretty cousin that has turned to bitter jealousy. Without telling her relatives, Setareh marries Morteza (Milad Yazdani), a young man from an impoverished family, whose proposal her aunt has refused many times. When the truth comes out, Morteza accidentally breaks Esmaeel’s nose in a fight and winds up in jail, hounded for 30 million tomans of blood money unless the now-pregnant Setareh agrees to a divorce.\n\nWhile the third episode supplies background on Jalal, finally revealing why he wants to give away this money — and where it came from — it never provides a satisfactory explanation of why he chose to do it in such a complicated and obtuse manner. Where the other two episodes feature lower-class women who are in thrall to their husbands, Jalal’s wife (Kataneh Afsharinejad) doesn’t hesitate to express her displeasure. Her angry monologue places Jalal’s act of charity in another light entirely.\n\nThe script, written by Jalilvand with Ali Zarnegar and Hossein Mahkam, functions well as a societal critique, provoking some interesting questions about misguided charity and highlighting the suffering of women in this patriarchal culture. Perhaps the gimmick of the advertisement serves as commentary on the handouts to the poor that former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad used to boost his popularity; nevertheless, it plays as the least credible element of the narrative.",
