  "bwwExcerpt": "...it's a welcome shock to see the actor stripped of all that allure in the opening tableau of Sam Shepard's Fool for Love, in which Arianda plays bucking bronco to Sam Rockwell's dusty cowpoke. Slumped on a motel bed in unflattering, baggy clothes, head slung low, this is Arianda as a broken doll, as trashed as the grubby room around her. She may spring to life with a furious attack and eventually pour herself into a little red number, but Arianda's May is not the glamor fest one expects. Just as surprising is Rockwell's Eddie...here he seems to dig deep into painful places for Eddie, a tight-lipped fellow whose leathery exterior hides a frightened boy...Daniel Aukin's painterly diorama production benefits from key support from a fine Tom Pelphrey as May's bemused beau and Gordon Joseph Weiss as a spectral old-timer who may have fathered both fractious lovers (there's a whisper of Greek tragedy amidst the tumbleweeds). But it's Rockwell and Arianda who most strike the sparks, blow on the embers and get the fire raging.",
