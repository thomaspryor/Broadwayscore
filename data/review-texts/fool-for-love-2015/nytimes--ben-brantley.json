Their end is evident in their beginnings, and vice versa. You know where they’re headed as well as they do.\n\nYet as May and Eddie perform the savage, cyclical dance that is Sam Shepard’s “Fool for Love,” which opened in a breathtaking production on Thursday night at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, you feel the gut-clutching suspense generated by a full-throttle cliffhanger. After all, odds are you’ve been on the edge of this particular cliff yourself, terrified and elated and wondering if you’re really going to jump.\n\nLove as a battlefield on which nobody wins has seldom been mapped as thrillingly as it is in Daniel Aukin’s definitive revival of this bruising drama from 1983. That’s in large part because as the inexorably coupled May and Eddie, Nina Arianda and Sam Rockwell exude the sort of chemistry from which nuclear meltdowns are made.\n\nBut every ingredient that’s gone into this Manhattan Theater Club and Williamstown Theater Festival offering has been measured, sifted and distilled to create the most potent combination conceivable. When I saw an earlier version of this production at Williamstown, in Massachusetts, last year, I figured it couldn’t get much better. I was wrong.\n\nMaking a very belated debut on Broadway, which has rarely found room for mad poets like Mr. Shepard, “Fool for Love” is perhaps best known today as an arena for extreme-sport acting, in which performers willing to tear up the scenery (and each other) can strip down to their rawest emotions. That was certainly the impression I had when I first saw it, 32 years ago, with Ed Harris and Kathy Baker getting down and dirty Off Broadway. (Robert Altman’s 1985 film version, starring Mr. Shepard and Kim Basinger, somehow lacked the same immediacy.)\n\nMs. Arianda and Mr. Rockwell, wild-card stars who here fulfill every promise of their earlier careers, provide plenty of injury-courting action as they bounce off the walls of Dane Laffrey’s last-chance motel room set. (I hope they have a good house physician on call — and solid insurance policies.) But this production also makes it clear that “Fool for Love” has a lot more going for it than its adrenaline quotient.\n\nHere, Mr. Shepard’s apache dance of a drama comes across not only as exciting theater but also as world-class literature, the kind that balances in-the-moment detail with an echoing sense of eternity. The couple we see fighting and loving onstage (and those activities are synonymous) are presented with pore-by-pore individuality. But they are also universal combatants.\n\nThis double vision is confirmed in our first glimpse of them, suspended in time in a motel on the cusp of nowhere (or the Mojave Desert, according to the program — same thing). He’s up against the wall, duded up like the Marlboro Man, his hips cocked and his hat tilted low. She’s seated, slumped, on the bed in profile, and her face, too, is covered, by her long hair.\n\nThey look exhausted, defeated, as if in a postcoital moment when the sex has been unbelievably great and a terrible mistake. Yet the room throbs with a precoital tension, too, a feeling made palpable by Justin Townsend’s edge-of-night lighting and Ryan Rumery’s thrumming soundscape.\n\nAnd then, for just an instant, there’s tenderness. He walks over to stroke her hair, gently and wonderingly. You may notice, though, that his bandaged hand is bloody. And when she abruptly grabs him by the legs, like a hand from the grave, we’ve shifted into irreversible high gear. The anonymous lovers assume the specific identities of May and Eddie. In the 90 minutes that follow, no one will be allowed to relax.\n\nThe rhythms of “Fool for Love” can be reduced to two commands that May delivers to Eddie again and again, variations on “Go!” and “Don’t go!” The play’s sensibility of naturalistic surrealism is summed up when Eddie says to May, of their imagined future together, “It’s no fantasy,” and she responds, “It’s all a fantasy.”\n\nIt turns out these two — whose relationship stretches back, way back, in time — have been separated for a while, since she ran away from the trailer they used to share. Now he’s tracked her down. He always does, or she finds him. And you just know that soon they’re going to be kissing deeply. And so they do. And then she knees him in the groin.\n\nThere you have, in sum, the story of Eddie and May, who exist in a magnetized, bipolar state for which ambivalence isn’t nearly a strong enough word. What ensues is a matter of filling in details and clarifying lineaments. But it’s hardly just exposition as usual.\n\nFor Mr. Shepard, as always, is concerned with the fictions we invent to give consoling form to what’s tearing us apart. May and Eddie have stories — rendered in some of the most exquisite imagistic prose in contemporary theater — to explain how they came to be who and where they are. Each says the other is lying, of course.\n\nThey have an audience (I mean, besides us). One of its two members is always there, at least in the minds of Eddie and May. That’s the Old Man (Gordon Joseph Weiss, pitch-perfect). It seems he has a consanguineous tie to both Eddie and May, and he comments on their activities like a folksy, responsibility-disavowing Greek chorus.\n\nThen there’s Martin (a wonderfully uncomprehending Tom Pelphrey), who has the misfortune to have a date with May on the day that Eddie arrives. Like the party guests in Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,” Martin stumbles onto a folie à deux, the language and rituals of which he can’t begin to understand. He’s there to remind us of just how hermetically sealed Eddie and May’s private world is.\n\nThe price of living in such a world is given achingly vibrant life by Mr. Rockwell and Ms. Arianda, and I’m not just talking about the fisticuffs. Ms. Arianda, an unclassifiable actress of seemingly infinite reserves, finally gets a gamut-running role on a par with her Tony-winning part in David Ives’s “Venus in Fur” of several years ago.\n\nHer performance here is all pulsing flesh and exposed nerve endings, dynamic resistance and passive fatalism. She is, in a word, magnificent.\n\nMr. Rockwell, best known as an off-center leading man in film, provides a dazzlingly precise portrait of a deluded illusionist, a personality shaped by a myth of machismo and a childhood that left him feeling like a perpetual outsider. What better role to assume than that of the existential cowboy?\n\nBy the way, Mr. Rockwell, you’ll be pleased to hear, has mastered the necessary art of lassoing for this production, and the sound of Eddie’s rope slicing the air has the startling twang of impending captivity.\n\nWhen that noose finally slips around May’s waist, we know how she feels. We’ve been lassoed, but good, since the show began. This beautiful, taut production never once slackens its hold.\n\n“Fool for Love” runs through Dec. 6 at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 212-239-6200, foolforlovebroadway­.com.",
