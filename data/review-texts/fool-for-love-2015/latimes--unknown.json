  "bwwExcerpt": "Daniel Aukin's production...is also sensationally acted...Arianda vividly embodies the conflict between May's sensuality and shame as she bounces from the bed to the bathroom to the front door of the shabby motel room...(The way she wields her long blond hair, which covers her face when she's disgusted and furiously flies in all directions when her violent temper has been stoked, is something to see.) But the revelation for me was Rockwell, who sheds new light on Eddie...Eddie is often portrayed as a Marlboro Man, a last holdout of the iconic West. Rockwell shows that he can lasso furniture as adroitly as any carnival cowboy, but there's a charming clumsiness to his characterization. He's fleshy and clownish -- qualities that intensify the violent threat.",
