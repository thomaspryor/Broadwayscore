  "bwwExcerpt": "Is Sam Rockwell the most versatile actor of his generation? That was the thought that kept occurring to me as I watched his swaggering, magnetic performance in Sam Shepard's 'Fool for Love'...Rockwell can play comedy, tragedy, tenderness, menace, or (as in 'Fool for Love') all of the above...this one-act play can easily come off as overwrought melodrama. Here, though, Rockwell and Arianda gleefully tear into one another, generating palpable sexual tension and nailing the grimly comic underbelly of Shepard's dialogue. The director, Daniel Aukin, strikes just the right notes of urgency and uncertainty; even if you've seen 'Fool for Love' before, you feel as if you have no idea what's coming next. The play builds, thrillingly, to an off-stage fire that bathes the set in a warm red glow -- and, indeed, if ever a production deserved the adjective 'combustible,' it's this one.",
