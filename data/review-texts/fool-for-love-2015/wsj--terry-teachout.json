The tone is clearly negative, focusing on what the production fails to deliver. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the claustrophobic intensity of the original production is missing, leading to a less immersive and ultimately disappointing experience. | Kimi: The critic finds the Broadway transfer fails to recreate the essential intimate horror of the original, noting that the production keeps the audience at a 'comfortable distance' rather than immersing them in the characters' desperation. No redeeming qualities are mentioned.",
