  "bwwExcerpt": "Ms. Arianda has returned to Broadway in a revival of Sam Shepard's 'Fool for Love' that originated at Massachusetts' Williamstown Theatre Festival. Directed by Daniel Aukin, it is fully worthy of her gifts, and the results are -- almost literally -- explosive. This show will make you sweat...Dane Laffrey, the set designer, has situated the action of the play in a shallow, low-ceilinged wooden box that forces Ms. Arianda and Mr. Rockwell to spend much of their time standing in profile to the audience. They look like a lanky pair of parentheses and act like two rabid dogs in heat. It's no knock on Mr. Rockwell, who delivers his big monologue with unemphatic but absorbing force, to point out that whenever Ms. Arianda is onstage, she's the one you look at and listen to. I wish she'd worked harder on her accent, but that doesn't matter too much: Every other part of her performance is scaldingly, unimpeachably real.",
