  "bwwExcerpt": "And for 75 minutes, director Daniel Aukin and his flawless cast, led by a riveting Nina Arianda and a fiercely unsettling Sam Rockwell, deliver, never allowing themselves or the audience an uncharged moment...The arrival of a gentleman caller named Martin -- an awkward but patient fellow, imbued with a strange grace by a wonderful Tom Pelphrey -- spurs the possessive Eddie to reveal that he and May share DNA...By this point, Arianda, who takes a short while to completely settle into her role -- her twangy accent seems to come and go -- has dug in with full force, and the results are devastating. The actress...has never had trouble holding a stage, or dominating one. Here, she reveals the desperation and shame of a woman who wants to exert her independence but cannot, and her final resignation is harrowing. Rockwell deftly mines the vulnerability and humor behind the menace Eddie shows us initially.",
