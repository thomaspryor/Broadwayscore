  "bwwExcerpt": "The Children - which premiered at the Royal Court in London last year and has now transferred to Broadway's Samuel J. Friedman Theatre with its original cast and director, the deft, deceptively unostentatious James Macdonald - is a play about responsibility and guilt, reparation and redemption. It's also a British play, so these heavy matters are handled lightly, wryly, approached from the side until circumstances absolutely demand a head-on confrontation.",
