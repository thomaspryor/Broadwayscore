  "showScoreExcerpt": "“A disturbing tale about nuclear power that mirrors real events, is troubling from the onset…The dialogue between the two women has an edge to it, and the talented actresses project an air of tension…Kirkwood's drama is engrossing and absorbing…‘The Children’ is a somber cautionary tale, sadly one that is not far-fetched. Serious thought-provoking ideas for the ride home.”\n\nRead more",
