  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Even though it is completely successful as an eco-thriller, bristling with chills and suspense, denuclearization is not its subject…Its true concerns…become so lofty and yet at the same time so essential that the play is as disturbing to replay in your imagination as it is to see in the first place...The naturalness of Mr. Macdonald’s stage movement in such a confined space is central to the containment of energy that makes the play thrilling.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong positive language ('completely successful', 'thrilling', 'bristling with chills') but limited context. Set confidence low due to excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play's success as an eco-thriller and highlights its thrilling nature and essential concerns, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"completely successful\", \"bristling with chills and suspense\", and \"thrilling\". Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring it in the upper end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the play as 'completely successful' and 'thrilling' with strong praise for the direction, warranting a high Positive score, though the single-excerpt limitation prevents higher confidence or a Rave classification.",
