  "bwwExcerpt": "Black humor occasionally pops up, as do secrets from the past. At one point, the characters listen to James Brown's 'Ain't It Funky Now' and recreate a choreographed dance routine from 40 years earlier. But first and foremost, 'The Children' is a social drama that is disturbing and thought-provoking.",
