  "bwwExcerpt": "But for all its clever construction, I doubt 'The Children' would feel so important without Rose's agenda and the challenge that comes with it. I will say only that it has to do with selfishness in both its ordinary and also its existential varieties. When Rose tells Robin that 'we can't have everything we want just because we want it,' she means, yes, the love of one's youth, but that's just the start. A good death is not guaranteed. Even electricity, as the local disaster has proved, is not a right.",
