  "showScoreExcerpt": "“James Macdonald's sometimes gripping, sometimes dull production…combining a modicum of tension, mystery, and a refreshing spray of laughter…For all its dramatic circumstances, 'The Children' is not nearly as intense as its outline suggests. Talky, expository passages, where little transpires, combine with a thinning plotline to introduce occasional longueurs during its intermissionless hour and 50 minutes. Thanks to the lovingly honed performances, though, you remain invested for most of it.”\n\nRead more",
