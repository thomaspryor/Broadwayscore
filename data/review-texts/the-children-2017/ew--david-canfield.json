  "bwwExcerpt": "The Children may take place within an apocalyptic landscape, but you'd barely know it. Within the confines of its remote, modest cottage home is a whole world of personalities, ideas, humor, and conflict. Virtually anything could be going on outside, an idea rendered brilliantly in the stage design: The set's a small, slightly tilted box surrounded by vast areas of dark, empty blue. We, like the characters, stay inside.",
