  "bwwExcerpt": "And here, from Manhattan Theatre Club via the Royal Court, comes another doomsday play. Lucy Kirkwood's The Children is a sturdy drama; interesting, arresting, and enigmatic enough to hold interest for its almost two-hour running time. It has crossed the sea intact, importing director James Macdonald, his design team, and his cast of three. All do a fine job, making The Children a worthwhile evening in the theatre. But is worthwhile, one wonders, enough?",
