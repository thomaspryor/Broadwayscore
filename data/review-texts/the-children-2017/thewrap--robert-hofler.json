  "bwwExcerpt": "'The Cows' would have made a better title. The poster for Lucy Kirkwood's new play features its three actors suited up for what looks like a tour of a nuclear power plant, and emblazoned across their bundled-up bodies is her chosen title, 'The Children.' This very scary, cautionary drama opened Tuesday at MTC's Samuel J. Friedman Theatre, and there's no doubt about it. Splashed across all that protective gear, 'The Cows' would have been more provocative.",
