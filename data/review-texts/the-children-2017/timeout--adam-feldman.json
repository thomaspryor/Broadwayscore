Uses strong praise ('superb performances,' 'haunting meditation') with no caveats or reservations expressed. | GPT-4o: The review praises the performances and describes the play as 'haunting' and 'deeply human,' aligning with the original rating of 80, indicating a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"haunting meditation\" and \"superb performances\" to describe the show, indicating a positive recommendation. The critic's rating of 80 supports this classification. | Kimi: The critic offers unqualified praise for the performances ('superb') and the story ('deeply human,' 'haunting'), indicating a clear recommendation consistent with the 80/100 rating.",
