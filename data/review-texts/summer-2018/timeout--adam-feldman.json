  "bwwExcerpt": "Heaven knows what the creators of Summer are thinking, if any thought at all has gone into this disco dud of a show. Three talented and blameless women-LaChanze, Ariana DeBose and Storm Lever-play the late Donna Summer at different stages of her life in a tacky, sub-Vegas jukebox biomusical that draws from the singer's groovy catalog of hits, including \"I Feel Love,\" \"MacArthur Park,\" \"On the Radio\" and \"Last Dance.\" At its most watchable, the show plays like a barely dramatized adaptation of Su",

The phrase 'has its moments of genuine power' suggests qualified praise - acknowledging strengths but implying the show is inconsistent overall. | GPT-4o: The review highlights moments of genuine power but does not offer an overall strong recommendation. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review, indicating some positive elements but not enough for a positive classification. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects, but the overall tone suggests a mixed experience, aligning with the critic's rating of 60. | Kimi: The critic's original 60/100 rating places this squarely in the Mixed range, supported by qualified praise acknowledging specific strengths while the phrasing implies overall inconsistency.",
