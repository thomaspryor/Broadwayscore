    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own rating of 60 places this squarely in Mixed territory. The phrase 'has its moments of genuine power' suggests qualified praise - acknowledging strengths but implying the show is inconsistent overall. | GPT-4o: The review highlights moments of genuine power but does not offer an overall strong recommendation. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review, indicating some positive elements but not enough for a positive classification. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects, but the overall tone suggests a mixed experience, aligning with the critic's rating of 60. | Kimi: The critic's original 60/100 rating places this squarely in the Mixed range, supported by qualified praise acknowledging specific strengths while the phrasing implies overall inconsistency.",
