    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive assessment ('succeeds') with praise for the show's approach as a celebration. However, this appears to be a brief excerpt, limiting confidence in the full critical perspective. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the show is successful in its limited scope, focusing on celebrating the music and the artist. This indicates a positive recommendation, though it implies some reservations about depth or ambition. | Gemini: The review states that the show \"succeeds\", which indicates a positive recommendation. The phrase \"in large part because it doesn't try to be more than it is\" suggests a reservation or qualification. | Kimi: The critic clearly recommends the show, praising it for succeeding as a celebration of Donna Summer's music, though the qualified phrasing ('in large part,' 'doesn't try to be more') suggests modest rather than ecstatic enthusiasm.",
