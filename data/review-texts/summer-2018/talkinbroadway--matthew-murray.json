    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive verdict with 'succeeds' and praise for being an effective celebration, but this appears to be a brief excerpt lacking fuller context for higher confidence. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the show achieves its goal as a celebration, implying a positive experience. However, the lack of superlative language or detailed praise indicates a solid but not enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review states that the show \"succeeds,\" indicating a positive recommendation. The phrase \"in large part because it doesn't try to be more than it is\" suggests a reservation or qualification, but the overall sentiment is positive. | Kimi: The critic clearly recommends the show, praising it for succeeding as a celebration of Donna Summer's music, though the qualified phrasing ('in large part') and lack of superlatives places it in the solid Positive range rather than Rave.",
