    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The critic implies the show would be 'complete mediocrity' without the lead performances, suggesting a barely-salvaged production that's mixed at best. | GPT-4o: The review suggests the show is mediocre overall, with the only redeeming aspect being the performances of the actresses. This indicates a negative view of the production as a whole. | Gemini: The review states the show is saved from \"complete mediocrity\" by the performances, implying the show is otherwise mediocre and not worth seeing. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates the show approaches complete mediocrity, with only the vocal performances preventing it from being a total failure, suggesting a lukewarm assessment with significant reservations about the production quality. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",
