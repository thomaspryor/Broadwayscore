This indicates a negative recommendation despite some praise for the performers. | Gemini: The review states that the singing saves the show from \"complete mediocrity,\" implying that the show is still mostly mediocre and not worth seeing overall. This indicates a negative recommendation. | Kimi: The critic explicitly labels the show as 'mediocre' and suggests it would be completely so without the performances, indicating a negative overall recommendation despite praise for the cast.",
