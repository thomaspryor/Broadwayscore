  "bwwExcerpt": "Pirates, orphans, natives, mermaids and a gigantic crocodile romp through a two-act tale bursting with dastardly doings, epic chases, daring escapes and silly humor. Co-directed by Roger Rees and Alex Timbers, the off-Broadway production offered delightful entertainment. Some of that charm is missing, unfortunately, from the Broadway version of the show, which opened on Sunday at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre.",
