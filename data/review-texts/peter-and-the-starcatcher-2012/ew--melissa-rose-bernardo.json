  "bwwExcerpt": "Once the entire gang of orphans, pirates, and aristocrats get caught up in a doozy of a sea storm, the show starts to get a little bumpy as well. (Directors Roger Rees and Alex Timbers’ deliberately low-tech staging — think spray bottles, sticks, and wires — is terribly clever and impeccably paced, but that is one looong shipwreck scene.) And when everyone finds themselves wandering through a jungle, your mind may begin to wander as well. A bunch of savages with names like Fighting Prawn and Hawking Clam who want to 'butterfly and deep-fat fry' Peter & Co. definitely overstay their welcome.",
