You may find yourself trembling, as one often does when something scary and baffling starts to make sense. At the same time, you're likely to have trouble figuring out exactly where your sympathies lie. Fo",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise for Pacino's performance which 'elevates' the production, but describes the revival as merely 'straightforward,' suggesting qualified recommendation. Low confidence due to single curated quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Al Pacino's performance as elevating the production, suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Pacino's performance and suggests it elevates the production. Given that this is the only excerpt available, and it is positive, I am scoring it as positive, but with low confidence due to the limited information. | Kimi: While the critic praises Pacino's performance as elevating the production, describing the revival itself as merely 'straightforward' suggests a qualified recommendation focused primarily on the star rather than the production as a whole.",
