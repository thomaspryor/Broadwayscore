    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises Pacino's performance as elevating the production, but describes it as merely 'straightforward' which suggests solid but unremarkable. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Al Pacino's performance as elevating the production, suggesting a positive view. However, the limited text and warning about potential cherry-picking necessitate a cautious approach, placing it in the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Pacino's performance and suggests it elevates the production, implying a positive but potentially qualified recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt praises Pacino's performance as 'elevating' the production while damning the revival itself with faint praise ('straightforward'), indicating a mild positive recommendation focused on the star turn rather than the overall production.",
