  "bwwExcerpt": "As the Jewish moneylender Shylock, one of theater's most complex, reviled roles, Pacino has made The Public Theater \"Merchant of Venice\" a blockbuster hit -- first in Central Park this summer, now on Broadway for a limited run. Yet it's Rabe who leaves a lasting impression. Bringing illuminating insights to the headstrong heiress Portia, the young actress is the production's real treasure.",
