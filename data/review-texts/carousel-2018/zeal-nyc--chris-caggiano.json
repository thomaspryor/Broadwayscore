    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows mixed elements (cuts cause problems) but concludes with clear reasons to see it (first-class cast, thrilling choreography). Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mildly positive so scored at lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights positive aspects such as the cast and choreography, but also mentions issues with cuts and problematic aspects. The recommendation is positive but with reservations, hence a lower score in the Positive range. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review highlights a first-class cast and thrilling choreography as reasons to see the show, but also mentions 'problematic aspects' and 'dramatically defensible' cuts, indicating a mixed but overall positive assessment. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly identifies 'reasons to see' the show and praises the 'first-class cast' and 'thrilling choreography,' but criticism of problematic cuts and the 'intermittently thrilling' qualifier indicate a qualified recommendation rather than an unreserved rave.",
