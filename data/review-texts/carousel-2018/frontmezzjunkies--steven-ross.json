    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Opens with strong praise ('first-rate revival') and acknowledges the production achieves what the material demands. While noting textual issues with the source material, the focus is on how well this production handles those challenges. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the revival as 'first-rate' and captures the mood effectively, but notes 'troubling issues' within the text. The positive elements are emphasized, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt contains positive language like \"first-rate revival\" and \"beautifully introduces\", but also mentions \"troubling issues\" and a male character's \"unsympathetic actions\", suggesting a recommendation with reservations. Given that it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production ('first-rate', 'beautifully', 'expertly') despite acknowledging problematic elements in the source material, indicating a clear recommendation.",
