  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A sublime hit...Henry as carnival barker Billy Bigelow, glistening on stage, delivering a vocal and dramatic performance...This is his breakthrough, and it’s just jaw dropping good. You want to him hear him sing anything, all day long...You’re almost taken aback hearing gorgeous, trained voices handing sublimely written music. For that – for the mesmerizing unfolding carousel canopy at the beginning of Act 1 – this show is a memorable winner.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong superlatives throughout ('sublime hit', 'jaw dropping good', 'memorable winner') with unqualified praise for lead performance and production. Single excerpt warning applies but language is definitively rave-level. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('sublime hit', 'jaw dropping good') and praises the lead performance highly. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the lead performance and music. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low, but the language suggests a strong positive assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous enthusiasm ('sublime hit,' 'memorable winner,' 'jaw dropping good'), but as a single curated quote it may not capture the full review's nuance, warranting the upper Positive range rather than a Rave. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
