  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The plot needs too much dusting off to be deemed worth reviving...The musical numbers lack luster except for a couple that can still muster up some shine...The singing talents of Henry, Mueller, and Fleming are all highly commendable. But not enough to make the show recommendable. It's the choreography and the fabulous ensemble dancing that give the show its stellar (and much needed) lift...Except for the stunning dancing I couldn't wait to get off this antiquated ride.\"\n\nRead more",

The overall verdict is clearly negative, calling it an 'antiquated ride' they 'couldn't wait to get off.' | GPT-4o: The review highlights issues with the plot and musical numbers, and while praising individual performances and choreography, it ultimately does not recommend the show. The single excerpt suggests a negative overall sentiment, but due to the warning about curated excerpts, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review praises the singing and dancing, but ultimately states the show is not recommendable and the reviewer couldn't wait to leave. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states that the commendable singing and stellar dancing are 'not enough to make the show recommendable,' delivering a clear negative verdict on the revival while acknowledging isolated strong elements.",
