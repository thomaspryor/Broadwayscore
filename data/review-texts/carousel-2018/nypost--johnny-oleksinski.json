The tone suggests disappointment without any positive elements mentioned. | Gemini: The critic clearly states that the production feels unfinished, like a workshop, which indicates a negative assessment and lack of recommendation. | Kimi: The critic unfavorably compares the Broadway production to an unfinished workshop, indicating it lacks necessary polish. While clearly negative, the single-sentence excerpt provides limited detail for a more precise assessment.",
