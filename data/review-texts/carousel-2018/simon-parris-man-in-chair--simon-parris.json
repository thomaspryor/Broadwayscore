    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the production ('sterling cast', 'thrilling choreography') and reverence for the material, but this is only a curated excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's cast, orchestra, and choreography, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using words like \"treasured\", \"beautiful\", \"sterling\", and \"thrilling\". Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt uses superlative language ('rapturously beautiful,' 'sterling,' 'thrilling') and positions the production as a vital connection to Broadway's golden age, indicating an enthusiastic recommendation despite the limited context.",
