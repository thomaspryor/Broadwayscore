  "bwwExcerpt": "It's been nearly 25 years since Rodgers and Hammerstein's 'Carousel' has come around on Broadway. And good reason... the last production featuring a young Audra McDonald set the bar pretty high. And while the current revival doesn't measure up in some ways, it makes up for it in others - starting with that glorious score.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows balanced assessment - acknowledges shortcomings compared to previous production but finds compensating strengths in the score. Neither clearly recommends nor discourages. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges that the current revival doesn't fully measure up to past productions but highlights the strength of the score as a redeeming factor, indicating a mixed assessment. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The review states the current revival doesn't measure up in some ways, but makes up for it in others, indicating a positive but not rave review. The mention of the 'glorious score' further supports a positive classification. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the revival falls short of the previous production in some respects but compensates with a glorious score, indicating a qualified but positive recommendation to see the show. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"It is pure ear candy once the overture swells. Somewhat disappointing is what meets the eye, with design elements that scream low budget...This is a beautifully sung production. All of the principal performers are in sublime voice...Jack O’Brien’s direction is rather inconsistent, with some bizarre choices. But the show’s bones are incredibly strong. And with a superb company of actors, dancers and musicians, this is still a 'Carousel' worth a mighty spin.\"\n\nRead more"
