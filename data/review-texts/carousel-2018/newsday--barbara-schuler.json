  "bwwExcerpt": "Jack O'Brien directs a stunning cast of vocal masters, led by Mueller's beautiful portrayal of Julie Jordan, a vulnerable mill worker who falls quickly - too quickly, really - for Billy Bigelow, intensely played by Henry as a bitter man unable to face his failures. His 'Soliloquy,' the introspective song in which he anticipates the birth of his child, stabs you in the heart. Throw in Lindsay Mendez, whose Carrie Pipperidge provides much needed comic relief, and opera's Renée Fleming as Nettie Fowler, taking your breath away consoling Julie after Billy's suicide with the haunting 'You'll Never Walk Alone.'",
