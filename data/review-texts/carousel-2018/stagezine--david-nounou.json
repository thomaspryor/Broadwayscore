The overall tone is negative, suggesting the production is not worth seeing. | Gemini: The review states there is little reason to revive the show and criticizes the direction and chemistry between the leads, despite acknowledging their individual talents. The positive mentions of Fleming and Gemignani are not enough to outweigh the negative assessment of the overall production. | Kimi: While the excerpt praises the source material score and two supporting performances, the critic fundamentally questions the revival's existence, criticizes the lead chemistry as 'below the charts,' and deems the direction 'listless' and the proceedings 'ponderous,' resulting in a clear recommendation against.",
