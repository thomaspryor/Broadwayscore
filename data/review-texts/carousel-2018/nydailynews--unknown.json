  "bwwExcerpt": "'Carousel' has such a glorious score that the music always shines bright - even in a revival as wobbly as the one now on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre. You know something is off when the lead roles are supplanted by secondary characters and endless dancing. Moreover, director Jack O'Brien ('Hairspray') hasn't discovered anything fresh and exciting in Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein's 1945 classic that introduced such indelible songs as the plaintive 'If I Loved You' and jaunty 'June Is Bustin' Out All Over.'",
