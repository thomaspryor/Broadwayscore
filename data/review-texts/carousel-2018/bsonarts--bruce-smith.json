  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The way this team portrays women and treats marital violence in 'Carousel' raises questions in a contemporary audience...This production plays like it’s 1945...The sound of the music was rich and sweet...If you have never seen 'Carousel,' this production is pleasant and worth seeing. Several of the performances are as good as they possibly could be. But the production lacks imagination and never really thrills an audience the way some past revivals have.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Review acknowledges good performances and music but criticizes dated treatment of sensitive themes and lack of imagination. The conditional recommendation ('if you have never seen') suggests qualified interest rather than enthusiastic endorsement. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a mixed assessment, noting both positive elements (music, some performances) and criticisms (lack of imagination, fails to thrill). The recommendation is conditional, suggesting it's worth seeing for newcomers but not as thrilling as past revivals. | Gemini: The review states the production is \"pleasant and worth seeing\" for those unfamiliar with the show, but notes it lacks imagination. Given the single excerpt and the reservations, a score in the lower positive range is appropriate. | Kimi: While the critic explicitly recommends the show as 'pleasant and worth seeing' for newcomers, this is heavily qualified by criticism of its dated treatment of violence, lack of imagination, and failure to thrill compared to past revivals. Single excerpt availability limits confidence. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
