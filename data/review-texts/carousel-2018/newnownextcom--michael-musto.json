Director Jack O’Brien has sculpted a dark, powerful production, which—like the revival of 'My Fair Lady' uptown—earns its strength by reveling in moment-to-moment acting choices and glorious singing and staging.

Single excerpt limits full context but the 'please go see' directive and 'dark, powerful production' language indicates strong positive assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt strongly recommends seeing the show, highlighting the powerful production and wonderful performance by Jessie Mueller. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly positive sentiment. | Gemini: The critic explicitly recommends seeing the show and uses positive language like \"dark, powerful production\" and \"glorious singing and staging.\" The single excerpt suggests a strong positive sentiment. | Kimi: Single excerpt with strong positive language ('dark, powerful production', 'glorious singing and staging', 'wonderful' lead performance) and explicit recommendation ('please go see'). However, confidence is low due to single-excerpt warning and truncated text.",
