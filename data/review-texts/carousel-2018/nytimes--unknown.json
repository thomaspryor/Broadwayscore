    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for direction, choreography, and performances with evocative language like 'tingles with rapture.' However, single excerpt and 'first two-thirds' qualifier suggests possible reservations about the ending. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'vividly reimagined' and highlights 'thoughtful and powerful performances', suggesting a strong positive impression despite the limited context. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using words like \"warmly\", \"chillingly\", \"vividly reimagined\", \"thoughtful and powerful performances\", and \"never seemed quite as ill-starred or, at the same time, as sexy\". Given the limited text, I am scoring it as a strong positive. | Kimi: The excerpt is strongly positive ('vividly reimagined', 'tingles with the rapture of life', 'thoughtful and powerful performances') but explicitly notes the praise applies only to 'the first two-thirds,' suggesting a potential drop-off. Single excerpt with warning about cherry-picking limits confidence.",
