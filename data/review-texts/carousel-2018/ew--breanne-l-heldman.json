  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Jack O'Brien's new revival of Rodgers & Hammerstein's 1945 smash stars several of the hottest actors currently gracing the Great White Way (Jessie Mueller and Joshua Henry, for starters), features the work of a hot young choreographer in Justin Peck, and includes a number of classic songs, but none of that can make up for the show's one key problem: The story is Just. Plain. Bad.",

Plain. Bad' which overwhelms the positive elements. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges strong elements like the cast and choreography but ultimately criticizes the story as fundamentally flawed. This suggests a negative overall verdict. | Gemini: Despite praising the actors and director, the review explicitly states that the story is \"Just. Plain. Bad\", leading to a negative recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic praises the cast, choreography, and songs, they conclude these elements cannot compensate for a fatally flawed story, delivering a clear recommendation against seeing the show.",
