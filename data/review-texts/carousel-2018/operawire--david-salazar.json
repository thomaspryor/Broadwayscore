    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performances (Fleming's 'unquestionable success,' Henry 'sang like a god') and production values ('moved with great agility and grace'). However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked positive content from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the performances and production, using superlatives like 'unquestionable success' and 'sounded as fresh and as emotionally riveting as ever'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt contains strong praise for Fleming and Henry's performances, as well as the production's agility and grace. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the upper end of the Positive bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise for lead performances ('unquestionable success,' 'sang like a god') and seamless production values, indicating a strong positive verdict, though the single-excerpt format warrants caution.",
