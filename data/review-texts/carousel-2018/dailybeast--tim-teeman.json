  "bwwExcerpt": "The current Broadway production, which opens Thursday night directed by Jack O'Brien, does not stint on the darkness of the source material, and it doesn't resolve or make easy for a modern audience one of its most pronounced storylines-the violence Billy Bigelow (Joshua Henry, who will surely be Tony-nominated for a third time for his excellently sung performance) shows to his wife, Julie Jordan (the Tony-winning Jessie Mueller), and his repeated lack of repentance for it.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows praise for lead performance and production choices, but discusses problematic source material without clear overall verdict. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the production's commitment to the dark themes of the source material but does not provide a clear recommendation. Praise for Joshua Henry's performance suggests some positive elements, but the focus on unresolved and challenging storylines indicates a mixed reception. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the show's handling of difficult themes and mentions strong performances, but doesn't offer a clear recommendation. The lack of a definitive verdict and the focus on the show's darkness suggest a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance ('excellently sung') and commends the production for not stinting on the source material's darkness, indicating a clearly positive assessment of these elements, though the single-quote limitation necessitates low confidence. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
