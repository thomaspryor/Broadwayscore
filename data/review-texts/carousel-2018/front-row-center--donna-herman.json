We believed his feelings and understood his reasoning even if we couldn't condone his actions. Mueller once again displays the magnificent soprano voice and well honed acting skills.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning requires caution, but language is clearly positive with detailed appreciation of artistic elements. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides high praise for the score, lyrics, and performances, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so a score at the upper end of the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language about the score, lyrics, and performances, indicating a favorable review. The use of words like \"gorgeous\" and \"masterful\" suggests a high level of praise. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains clearly positive language ('masterful', 'gorgeous', 'magnificent') praising the score, lyrics, and performances. Per guidelines for curated excerpts with strong positive indicators, scored at upper end of Positive range.",
