  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The score is gorgeous, the lyrics moving, and the interweaving of dialog, song, and dance in service of explicating both plot and emotions is masterful...Both Henry and Mueller give us very full-fledged, rounded characters...His acting is specific and nuanced, his voice strong and his physicality magnetic. We believed his feelings and understood his reasoning even if we couldn't condone his actions. Mueller once again displays the magnificent soprano voice and well honed acting skills.\"\n\nRead more",
