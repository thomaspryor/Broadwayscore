  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"While choreographer Peck has done a lot of fine work and NYCB soloist Pollack makes a fine Louise, the real revelation for me was NYCB principal Amar Ramasar, whose Jigger is a magnetic presence who commands attention...This production did nothing to make the element of domestic abuse less distasteful, at least for me. Nevertheless, there is much to admire...With an orchestra of 25, the music sounds lush, although I wish the volume had been reduced during the soliloquy.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed signals - praising specific performers and orchestration while expressing significant discomfort with production choices. Low confidence due to limited text and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The review praises individual performances and the orchestra but notes issues with the production's handling of domestic abuse and sound levels. The mixed signals and single excerpt lead to a low confidence mixed score. | Gemini: The review highlights positive aspects like the choreography, performers, and music, but also expresses reservations about the domestic abuse element. Given the limited excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive with reservations. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows qualified praise for individual performances (particularly Ramasar as 'magnetic') and acknowledges 'much to admire,' but includes significant reservations about thematic handling and sound design, indicating a mildly positive rather than enthusiastic recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
