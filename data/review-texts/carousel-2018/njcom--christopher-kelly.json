  "bwwExcerpt": "So where did this handsome, but fundamentally inert production of 'Carousel' go wrong? One way is that, instead of approaching the story of Julie Jordan (Mueller) and her doomed romance with Billy Bigelow (Henry) with a fresh, contemporary point-of-view, O'Brien has doubled down on the nostalgia factor, giving us a 'Carousel' that -- save for the darkish lighting scheme and the absence of an actual onstage carousel -- looks and feels like something from 70 years ago. (The set design here is by Santo Loquasto; Brian MacDevitt did the lighting.)",
