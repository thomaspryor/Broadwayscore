    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Strong praise throughout with 'stellar production,' 'powerhouse performance,' Tony Award prediction, and conclusion that show 'has lost none of its power.' Single excerpt warning noted, but consistent enthusiasm suggests upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's score, performances, and choreography, highlighting a standout performance by Henry. The tone is highly positive, suggesting a strong recommendation despite the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the score, characters, performances, and choreography. The phrases \"haunting beauty\", \"rich humanity\", \"powerhouse performance\", and \"stellar production\" indicate a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives ('haunting beauty', 'rich humanity', 'powerhouse performance', 'stellar production') and explicit praise for multiple elements—score, performances, choreography, and emotional impact. The phrase 'lost none of its power' affirms the revival's success. However, confidence is low due to single-excerpt warning; this curated quote may represent the most positive passage. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
