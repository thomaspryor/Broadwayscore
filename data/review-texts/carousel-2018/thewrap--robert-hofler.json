  "bwwExcerpt": "It took real guts for the lead producers and director Jack O'Brien to revive Rodgers and Hammerstein's 'Carousel,' which opened Thursday at the Imperial Theatre. Theatergoers still speak with hushed reference about Nicholas Hytner's phenomenal 'Carousel' revival, imported from the National Theatre to Lincoln Center Theatre in 1994. The good news is that we don't have to choose which version is more perfect. Enjoy the memory of Hytner's show and make sure you don't miss O'Brien's.",
