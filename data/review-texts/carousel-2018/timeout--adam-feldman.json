    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating and balanced assessment ('handsome and well-performed' vs 'doesn't solve fundamental problems') clearly places this in Mixed territory. The score aligns perfectly with the critic's numerical rating. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the production's visual and performance quality but highlights unresolved issues with the protagonist, aligning with the critic's original rating of 60. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (handsome, well-performed) but ultimately finds the show's core issues unresolved, aligning with a mixed assessment. The critic's rating of 60 supports this classification. | Kimi: The critic's own 60 rating confirms a middle-of-the-road assessment. While praising the production as 'handsome and well-performed,' the review emphasizes that the revival fails to address 'fundamental problems' with the source material, resulting in neither a recommendation nor a dismissal.",
