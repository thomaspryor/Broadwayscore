  "bwwExcerpt": "Carousel's sumptuous new Broadway revival plows steadily through the show's darker currents. Director Jack O'Brien invites us to admire the show as an exemplar of classic American musical theater, lovingly emphasizing its virtues. Prime among them is Rodgers and Hammerstein's innovative and varied score, repolished by orchestrator Jonathan Tunick and sterlingly sung by the cast; Henry offers a powerful account of Billy's long and winding first-act finale, 'Soliloquy,' and opera star Renée Fleming-though too grand in manner for the role of Julie's kindly cousin-adds elegant vocal luster to the stirring 'You'll Never Walk Alone.' The gorgeous choreography, by New York City Ballet's Justin Peck, is danced with aplomb by a very fine ensemble led by NYCB's Brittany Pollack and Amar Ramasar. Santo Loquasto's set, Ann Roth's costumes and Brian MacDevitt's lighting are first-class.",

The score aligns perfectly with the critic's numerical rating. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the production's visual and performance quality but highlights unresolved issues with the protagonist, aligning with the critic's original rating of 60. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (handsome, well-performed) but ultimately finds the show's core issues unresolved, aligning with a mixed assessment. The critic's rating of 60 supports this classification. | Kimi: The critic's own 60 rating confirms a middle-of-the-road assessment. While praising the production as 'handsome and well-performed,' the review emphasizes that the revival fails to address 'fundamental problems' with the source material, resulting in neither a recommendation nor a dismissal.",
