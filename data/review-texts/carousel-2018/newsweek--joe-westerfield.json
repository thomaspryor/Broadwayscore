    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite acknowledging the show as 'problematic,' the critic calls it a 'delightful revival' with 'stellar cast' and praises it as representing 'the best of the Golden Age.' The positive language ('delightful,' 'stellar,' 'lovely') outweighs the caveats. Single excerpt warning applied - using upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the revival as 'delightful' with a 'stellar cast' and highlights strong performances. Despite acknowledging the work's problematic aspects, the tone is clearly positive. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the music, cast, and relevance of the themes. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt is clearly positive ('delightful revival', 'stellar cast', 'highlight reel of the best'), though the opening acknowledges the source material is 'problematic.' The critic praises the production's handling of difficult themes and the performances. With only one excerpt available, confidence is low, but the language suggests a strong positive recommendation.",
