  "bwwExcerpt": "Of the musicals by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II that continue to hold the stage, 'Carousel' is-up to a point-the strongest. That point arrives toward the end, when the ghost of Billy Bigelow, the show's romantic antihero, returns to earth, watches his daughter graduate from high school and is escorted back to the Pearly Gates by an angel as the company sings a reprise of 'You'll Never Walk Alone,' the stickiest song that Rodgers and Hammerstein ever wrote (though the competition is stiff).",
