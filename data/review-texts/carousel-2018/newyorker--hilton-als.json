Single excerpt warning applies - mixed signals suggest middle of Mixed range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt provides both positive and negative elements, praising O'Brien's direction but criticizing Fleming's acting and Peck's choreography. The mixed nature of the comments suggests a balanced view without a clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises O'Brien's performance and Peck's choreography, but criticizes Fleming's acting and Henry's direction. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt balances praise for O'Brien against substantial criticism of Fleming's acting, Peck's choreography, and Henry's performance, indicating a mixed verdict. Confidence is low due to reliance on a single curated excerpt.",
