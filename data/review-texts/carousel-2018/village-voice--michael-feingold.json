Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review highlights both strong choices and significant shortcomings, suggesting a mixed verdict. The production is described as having potential but not fully realized, indicating a lack of a clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges \"great things\" but ultimately finds the production \"wishy-washy\" and not fully realized, leading to a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the production contains 'great things' but ultimately finds it 'wishy-washy' and insufficiently imagined to support its performers. With only a single excerpt available, confidence is low.",
