That’s thanks to a quintet of smashing principal performances, stunning choreography, an enchanting set design, and a generous, 24 piece orchestra...From the very first downbeat, Mr. Peck asserts his creative command, clearly articulating every key relationship in the story and setting the tone and sensibility of the show.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Strong praise for performances, choreography, design, and direction with superlatives like 'smashing' and 'stunning'. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential for cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is filled with superlatives and praises the performances, choreography, set design, and orchestra, indicating a highly positive assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language such as \"smashing principal performances\", \"stunning choreography\", \"enchanting set design\", and \"generous orchestra\", indicating a positive review. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives ('soaringly operatic', 'heart-wrenchingly intimate', 'smashing', 'stunning', 'enchanting') with no reservations mentioned. However, confidence is low due to single-excerpt warning and lack of full context. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
