    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt criticizes casting choices as potentially stereotypical, faults the production for lacking interpersonal connections, and concludes with a clear negative recommendation using 'sadly' and suggesting audiences will want to 'get off' this ride. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates significant criticism, particularly regarding casting choices and lack of connection between characters. The negative tone suggests a disappointing experience, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses disappointment with the production, highlighting issues with character connections and potential stereotypes, leading to an overall negative assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a clear negative verdict, criticizing the production's problematic handling of racial dynamics and lack of emotional connection, with explicit language warning audiences away ('want to get off').",
