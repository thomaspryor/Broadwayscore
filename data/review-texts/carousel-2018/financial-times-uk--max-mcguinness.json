  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A lack of theatrical oomph is a general problem with Jack O'Brien's staging, which plays it safe and makes no attempt to update the story. Both Jessie Mueller's high-spirited Julie and Joshua Henry's Bigelow perform their numbers with aplomb, even if Henry struggles to transcend his character's oafishness in the spoken passages. And Justin Peck's choreography is a lively and graceful visual feast. But the overall dramatic approach seems too literal and predictable.\"\n\nRead more",

Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The review highlights issues with the staging and dramatic approach, describing them as 'literal and predictable.' However, it praises the performances and choreography, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review praises the performances and choreography but criticizes the staging as safe and predictable, resulting in a mixed assessment. The limited excerpt makes confidence low. | Kimi: Single excerpt with mixed signals: praises performances and choreography but criticizes staging as 'safe,' 'literal,' and 'predictable.' The 'But' pivot and final negative framing suggest qualified disappointment rather than recommendation. Low confidence due to single excerpt limitation.",
