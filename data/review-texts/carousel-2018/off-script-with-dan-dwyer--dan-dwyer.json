Joshua Henry...muscular in both movement and voice, fits the part. Mueller, although exceptionally vocally skilled, brings no physicality to Julie.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Review praises the score, Joshua Henry's performance, and opening scenes as 'perfectly integrated' and 'high points,' but criticizes casting choices and states it can't quite achieve memorability. Single excerpt with mixed signals requires cautious scoring. | GPT-4o: The review praises the score and male lead but indicates the revival is not memorable overall. Casting issues are highlighted, suggesting a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review praises the score and lead performance but also expresses reservations about the casting and overall impact. Given the single excerpt and the reservations, I'm scoring it as a low positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the score and male lead but emphasizes that casting issues prevent the revival from being truly memorable, indicating a qualified recommendation typical of the lower Positive range. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
