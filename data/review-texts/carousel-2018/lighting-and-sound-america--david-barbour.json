However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the choreography, dance sequences, and vocal performances, suggesting a strong positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt contains strong praise for the choreography, vocals, and overall production, indicating a positive recommendation. The reference to honoring the tragedy in a unique way further supports this assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the choreography, vocal performances, and the production's unique honoring of the material, indicating a strong recommendation despite the limited context.",
