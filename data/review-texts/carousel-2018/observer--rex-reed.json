    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, the language is unequivocally enthusiastic with superlatives ('humdinger', 'magnificently', 'vein of Broadway gold') and an explicit warning against missing it ('at your own peril'). This represents a must-see recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the production, direction, choreography, and cast, with a clear recommendation not to miss the show. The phrase 'risk overlooking at your own peril' indicates a highly positive verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using terms like \"superbly populated\", \"magnificently choreographed\", and \"humdinger\". The concluding sentence strongly recommends seeing the show. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('humdinger', 'magnificently choreographed', 'Broadway gold') and an urgent recommendation, though as a single curated excerpt it may not fully represent the review's overall tone. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
