    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Despite opening with a criticism about domestic abuse handling, the verdict is overwhelmingly positive with superlatives like 'masterful direction,' 'stunning,' 'near perfect reboot,' and the ultimate praise calling it 'The best Broadway musical revival I have ever seen.' This level of praise merits high Rave scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt contains superlative praise, calling it the best revival the critic has ever seen, with 'masterful direction' and 'otherworldly' performances. Despite the text quality warning, the language strongly suggests a rave review. | Gemini: The review uses superlatives like \"masterful direction\", \"stunning new revival\", \"otherworldly\", \"gorgeous vocals\", and \"near perfect reboot\" culminating in the critic calling it the best revival they've ever seen. | Kimi: Despite being a single excerpt with quality warnings, the language is unambiguously ecstatic: 'masterful direction,' 'stunning new revival,' 'near perfect reboot,' and the definitive superlative 'best Broadway musical revival I have ever seen.' The single caveat about domestic abuse is immediately overridden by overwhelming praise. Even accounting for cherry-picking risk, this excerpt alone contains sufficient verdict language for a high Rave score.",
