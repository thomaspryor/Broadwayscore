Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses phrases like \"fresh and delightful,\" \"top to bottom perfect cast,\" and \"not to be missed,\" indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong praise ('perfect cast', 'stunning choreography', 'masterwork') and an explicit urgent recommendation, though confidence is reduced given only one curated quote is available.",
