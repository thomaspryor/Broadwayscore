  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Pleased as I was by just about everything in this production--its fine casting; its songs, sung by supple, able voices; its choreography...I remain disappointed that no matter how well-played she is, the passive, silent Julie just can't hold a candle to the brooding, restlessly self-destructive Billy. Mueller does her best...But ultimately, 'Carousel' is a musical about a restless man who marries, dies, and gets redeemed, rather than it is about a couple negotiating the unfair circumstances.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Critic expresses clear pleasure with the production elements (casting, songs, choreography) but has fundamental disappointment with the source material's structure. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears to be a qualified positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the casting, songs, and choreography but expresses disappointment with the character dynamics, particularly Julie's portrayal. The mixed sentiment suggests a balanced view, with positive elements but significant reservations. | Gemini: The review expresses pleasure with many aspects of the production (casting, songs, choreography) but ultimately finds the central female character lacking, leading to a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and truncated nature reduce confidence. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states being pleased by 'just about everything' in the production, praising the casting and vocals, but maintains significant reservations about the show's structural imbalance between characters. As a single excerpt, the full verdict is unclear, but the tone suggests a qualified positive recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
