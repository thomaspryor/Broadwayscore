  "bwwExcerpt": "There is one rousing scene in 'Honeymoon In Vegas,' near the end. A troupe of impersonators, the Flying Elvises - also the highlight of the film - fly toward Las Vegas, accompanied by a very nervous Jack, and prepare to parachute into the city. They perform an exuberant, super-charged Presley-like number, 'Higher Love,' led by the ebullient head Elvis (a marvelous David Josefsberg, who also plays the lounge singer). Song and story, verve and imagination, come together, and the result, for that moment, is musical-comedy bliss.",
