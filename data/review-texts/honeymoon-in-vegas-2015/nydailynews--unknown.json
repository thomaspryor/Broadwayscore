  "bwwExcerpt": "There's plenty to like about the new Broadway arrival 'Honeymoon in Vegas.' That goes double for the terrific score...If only the overall production were sexier, funnier and more surprising. As is, the show, directed by Gary Griffin ('The Color Purple') is cute and old-fashioned, a good time...Jason Robert Brown...deserves huzzahs for making the kicky musical cocktail of catchy melodies and clever lyrics that drive this show. The songs smartly change tempo and tone, shifting from classic showtunes to jazzy stylings to island breeziness as the action moves from New York to Nevada to Hawaii...Griffin's production speeds along efficiently...But the director trips up occasionally on nonessential material...The three leads lend charm and appeal. O'Malley is plucky and makes her 'Anywhere But Here,' a musical ultimatum, stand out...McClure ('Chaplin') gets the show off on a winning note with the tuneful 'I Love Betsy,' and goes full-throttle from then on out. Danza is a charmer with his Sinatra-like singing and tap-happy moments. He'll never convince as a bad guy, but Danza's the boss of good fun.",
