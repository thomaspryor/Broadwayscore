  "bwwExcerpt": "This is, of course, an old-fashioned musical comedy, a genre not known for its progressive values. And the warm-centered tone of 'Honeymoon' is never crass or sleazy. Still, this thing badly needed the safety of some chronological remove, especially given that it's women who buy most of the tickets to shows like this. It may seem like a weird transition to now say that much of 'Honeymoon' is artful, but it's true. Brown's songs are packed with big-band energy, as if in tribute to old Vegas with all its good jobs for union musicians. Moreover, many of his lyrics are extremely amusing...In the lead role, McClure brings charm, energy and comic chops (when not overplaying). And then there's Danza, who is so clearly thrilled to be standing onstage. He's a fair singer and, all things considered, a classy tapper...'Honeymoon' would have been better off with a sharper satirical scalpel, something closer to that of Mel Brooks or 'The Book of Mormon'...You can see bits and beginning of a potential edge...But in the end, the show does not want to go there.",
