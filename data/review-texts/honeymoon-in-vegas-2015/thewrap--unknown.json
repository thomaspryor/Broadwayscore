  "fullText": "There’s an old Hollywood truism that good movies are made from second-rate books, not the classics. On Broadway, the new musical “Honeymoon in Vegas,” which opened Thursday at the Nederlander Theatre in New York, uses a second-rate movie from 1992 for its source material. Have its makers been able to turn it into a good musical? Or is this one effort that should have stayed in Vegas?\n\nHere and there, “Honeymoon in Vegas,” the musical, is better than good, with most of the good being Jason Robert Brown’s very plentiful score, which shows him in a much lighter, less ponderous...",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Here and there, 'Honeymoon in Vegas,' the musical, is better than good, with most of the good being Jason Robert Brown's very plentiful score, which shows him in a much lighter, less ponderous mood than his work on 'Parade,' 'The Last Five Years,' and 'The Bridges of Madison County'...He's committed to writing a traditional Broadway comedy score, and he fully succeeds, offering up witty lyrics with the occasionally laugh-out-loud rhymes, as well as jaunty tunes, some of which are sly riffs on beloved standards...Sad to say, the show also needs some radical recasting. Smarm needs charm, and none of the three principals have the latter...McClure doesn't delight, he just grins manically. O'Malley delivers one good silent comic moment, playing Tommy's overly tanned dead wife, but as Betsy she is made up to look like one of the more desperate Housewives of Orange County, which pretty much sums up her approach to the role. Danza can't sing or dance, but he seems to be enjoying himself immensely on stage. It's a kind of charm.",

The single excerpt limits confidence in fully capturing the critic's overall sentiment. | Gemini: The review praises the score highly but criticizes the casting of the three leads, resulting in a mixed assessment. The positive and negative elements balance each other out. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Jason Robert Brown's score ('fully succeeds,' 'witty lyrics') but delivers harsh criticism of the three lead performances, noting the show needs 'radical recasting.' With such divided verdict on crucial elements, the review sits in mixed territory.",
