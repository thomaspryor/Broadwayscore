    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear positive sentiment with 'surprisingly engaging' and 'genuine heart', but low confidence due to limited text from curated quote that may not represent full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the musical as 'surprisingly engaging' and highlights its ability to capture 'manic energy' while delivering 'genuine heart'. This indicates a strong positive impression, though the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the phrase \"surprisingly engaging musical\" which indicates a positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, I am placing the score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the adaptation's energy and emotional resonance, indicating a clearly positive recommendation. With only one curated excerpt available, confidence is reduced despite the enthusiastic tone.",
