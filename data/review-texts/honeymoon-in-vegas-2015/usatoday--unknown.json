  "bwwExcerpt": "Vegas' ace in the hole is the duly beloved TV vet Tony Danza, who makes Tommy much warmer than James Caan did on screen -- more of a mensch, and thus a more viable rival in pursuing Nick's fiancée, Betsy. When Danza sings, serviceably, or breaks into a tap-dance routine, he sails on pure charm...McClure is energetic and endearing throughout, as is leading lady Brynn O'Malley, whose Betsy is sharper and brighter than Sarah Jessica Parker's was. Jason Robert Brown's generic-sounding score, which can veer on caricature in nodding to Rat Pack-era Vegas, and Andrew Bergman's unabashedly hokey book don't offer them, or the supporting players, a lot of meat...As empty-calorie musicals go, you could do worse than this Honeymoon.",
