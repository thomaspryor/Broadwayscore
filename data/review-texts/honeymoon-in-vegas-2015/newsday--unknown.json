  "bwwExcerpt": "'Honeymoon in Vegas,' based on the 1992 film, is an unexpectedly delightful, thoroughly conventional movie spinoff that isn't hard-selling anything more than a good time created by experts. Tony Danza, no joke, is a pro...And director Gary Griffin ('The Color Purple') has an inventive idea for every location-hopping improbable moment without losing the show's easygoing likability. And then there is the supper-club jazzy/old-time Broadway score by Jason Robert Brown...Here he writes new songs that seem as if they ought to be old-time brassy standards, except for the nonstop-clever, up-to-the-minute lyrics for outrageous farce and sweet ballads...Rob McClure ('Chaplin') is virtuosically understated as Jack, a nice Brooklyn guy who loves Betsy, a nice schoolteacher, embodied by Brynn O'Malley with down-to-earth slinkiness...Despite all these original spins on a familiar brand, the show has not been selling during previews. Perhaps it will now.",
