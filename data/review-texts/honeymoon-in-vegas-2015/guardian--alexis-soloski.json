  "bwwExcerpt": "Perhaps you wouldn't notice if you had anything riding on the central pair. But McClure, an able actor, plays the part at such a pitch of neurotic schlubbiness that who cares if he gets the girl? And though O'Malley is a fine, leggy singer with calf muscles that could crack lobster claws, her Betsy is so bereft of character that what does it matter if she's gotten or not? Yet through it all there's Danza, effortlessly cool and obviously amused. His voice, thin and a little lunkish, is no great instrument, but he plays it like a jazz cat that's got the cream. He can even put over a tender ballad about skin cancer. And he can tap-dance, too. Well, kind of. Ladies and gentleman, this is what a high roller looks like.",
