  "bwwExcerpt": "Funny? You bet, and Mr. Brown has crunched the dramatic exposition of the film into a fast-moving sequence of musical numbers whose sterling craftsmanship is marvelous to behold, starting with one of the smartest list songs to hit Broadway in decades: 'She likes hockey. No, I swear! / She likes guys with thinning hair! / And I love Betsy!' What's more, Ms. O'Malley, a stunningly sharp-witted stage performer whose talent has heretofore been squandered on second-banana parts, proves herself more than equal to the challenge of a starring role. She's almost reason enough to see 'Honeymoon in Vegas,' and Gary Griffin's on-the-button staging and Anna Louizos's deluxe sets display her to ideal advantage.",
