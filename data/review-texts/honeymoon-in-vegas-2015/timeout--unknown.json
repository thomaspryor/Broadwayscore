  "bwwExcerpt": "Honeymoon in Vegas is too damn fun to keep secret. Jason Robert Brown's big and brassy score borrows gleefully from the obvious sources -- Sinatra, Mancini and Liberace -- and splices that swingin' lounge vibe with his own bouncy, wryly neurotic voice...it's a thrill to see his musical craft and depth in the service of so much splendid silliness. Because let's face it: Andrew Bergman's book, which hews closely to the bones of his 1992 screenplay, is goofy stuff...But it's very funny...The cast is superb, and what Danza lacks in strong vocal chops he makes up for in charm and characterful crooning. Gary Griffin's frisky staging abounds in sight gags and gorgeous chorus girls. In terms of sheer bubbly fun, Honeymoon ranks up there with some of my favorite new musical comedies on the job The Full Monty, Hairspray or In the Heights, and recent ones The Book of Mormon and A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder. Broadway may be a crapshoot, but Honeymoon hits the jackpot.",
