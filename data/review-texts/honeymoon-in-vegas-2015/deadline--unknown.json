  "bwwExcerpt": "You think they just don't make 'em like they used to? To find out how wrong you are, head to Broadway's Nederlander Theatre for a couple of hours of finger-snapping, tap-dancing, hip-swiveling, Elvis-impersonating, night-club crooning fun. That's what the musical adaptation of Honeymoon In Vegas promises and what it delivers, courtesy of an ingratiating performance by Tony Danza...Jason Robert Brown is terrifically talented but he's no Frank Loesser, and...Honeymoon In Vegas is no Guys & Dolls...the show has been struggling through weeks of poorly-attended previews that began before Thanksgiving, when it ought to have opened right away...The biggest toll was taken on Danza...He has a Sinatra-like stage presence, but in truth he's Sinatra's opposite: Warm, not cool; needy, not diffident. Those aren't necessarily bad things, but at the critic's preview his voice was pretty well shot and his dancing was unsteady...The balance of the show has gone much more in McClure's favor...",
