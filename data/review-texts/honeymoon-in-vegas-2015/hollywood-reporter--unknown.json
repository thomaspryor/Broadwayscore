  "bwwExcerpt": "Its frothiness is initially enjoyable until it becomes silly and then tiresome, before sparking back to life toward the end. Ultimately, the show feels slight. Much of the most infectious stuff comes from composer-lyricist Jason Robert Brown, whose talent as a songsmith is sharper than his nose for a winning property. Brown's songs are more catchy than memorable, but their lyrics are clever and droll...In the leading role of Jack Singer, the excellent Rob McClure works hard and is a winning nebbish...However, as Betsy, Brynn O'Malley seems not quite a natural for this kind of screwy comedy...the costume, hair and makeup team has SJPed all over her, hardening the attractive brunette into a tough-looking blonde...Danza strikes a nice balance between suave and sleazy...The Taxi and Who's the Boss? star's sitcom timing gets put to good use, and while his vocals are on the thin side, he carries a tune with confidence...Danza tackles the role with laidback Sinatra-style panache, and it works.",
