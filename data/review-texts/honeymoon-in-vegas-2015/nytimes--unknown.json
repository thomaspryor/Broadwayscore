  "bwwExcerpt": "As embodied by the bright and bouncy new musical 'Honeymoon in Vegas'...the world capital of gambling and neon is everything you want it to be. That means a little hip, a little square, a little dangerous, a little kitschy and a whole lotta delicioussh fun...But here's the bonus, in which East (Coast) meets West: This production is also a real-live, old-fashioned, deeply satisfying Broadway musical in a way few new shows are anymore...Mr. Brown...here finds a shiny, fertile common ground between brassiness according to Broadway and to Las Vegas. His songs seamlessly propel plot and define character in the way numbers did in the heyday of Rodgers and Hammerstein. But he often inflects them with the ring-a-ding swell and swing you associate with Frank Sinatra recordings from the late 1950s and early '60s. He's not just quoting or sending up that style; he's embracing it on his own terms as a keen-eared fan of today. And in a breakout performance, Mr. Danza...matches the nuanced flash of the music.",
