  "bwwExcerpt": "Here and there, Brown offers an exciting, finely crafted song, and the show starts to soar. During those moments, you feel as though you're watching a modern-day 'Guys and Dolls,' and not yet another forgettable movie-turned-musical churned out for Broadway. But more often than not, 'Honeymoon in Vegas' is mired in a pained attempt to enliven and exaggerate a simple but heartfelt boy-meets-girl/boy-loses-girl story into a broad, over-the-top musical comedy. There is an air of desperation to some of the antics...Tony Danza, as the card shark, has a congenial presence, but his character drags down the sparks flying between the dynamic Rob McClure and alluring Brynn O'Malley.",
