    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('deeply satisfying', 'perfect sunny holiday') with enthusiastic tone, but single excerpt warning requires caution about full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a 'deeply satisfying Broadway musical' and suggests it offers a 'perfect sunny holiday', indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language such as \"deeply satisfying\" and \"perfect sunny holiday\", indicating a strong recommendation. However, because it is a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified enthusiasm ('deeply satisfying', 'perfect sunny holiday') and insists audiences would be 'churlish' not to embrace the show. Per instructions for single curated excerpts, this clearly positive quote warrants the upper end of the Positive bucket (80-84) despite limited context.",
