  "bwwExcerpt": "Times, they have a-changed. And suddenly the sexual aggressiveness of the 1998 'Cabaret' seems tame. To put it another way: imagine watching Britney Spears' 'Baby One More Time' video for the first time today. Would you be as outraged by Spears' sexy schoolgirl look having seen Miley Cyrus swing around naked on a wrecking ball? Just because this 'Cabaret' doesn't carry the same shock value as it once did doesn't mean we should strip this production of its worth...Cumming's Emcee is mischievous and funny as ever. But age has allowed Cumming to mature his character in ways we haven't seen before. His Emcee is more in command now, and when he peers in on the action from the shallows, it feels less observant and more foreboding. Like he knows the inevitability of what's ahead...And then there's Michelle Williams' stunning and heartbreaking portrayal of nightclub singer Sally Bowles...It took me a bit to notice the nuance and layers the three-time Oscar nominee has built into Sally...Williams' voice is lush, for example, but she adds shaky moments to show us that Sally's internal insecurities. Throughout, Williams gives us these little crumbs of what becomes a tragic, beautiful character.",
