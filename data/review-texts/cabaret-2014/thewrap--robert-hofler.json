  "bwwExcerpt": "With this 2014 'Cabaret,' audiences will come to see Fraulein Schneider and Herr Schultz, and that's the big change with Mendes and Marshall's remounting...At Studio 54, Linda Emond and Danny Burstein take the middle-aged Schneider and Schultz and turn them into mature star-crossed lovers whose hearts beat more passionately than any teenagers' ever could...Michelle Williams also begins well, as the third-rate chanteuse who will never graduate from the Kit Kat Klub...One thing is clear: This Sally will do anything to succeed, and as cookies go she's too tough to crack in the arms of any man, gay or straight...Alan Cumming is back in the role that Joel Grey made famous. Despite several returns to the Emcee, Grey always remained a nasty little imp. Cumming, on the other hand, is now giving a self-referential performance that softens the character considerably.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performances (Emond/Burstein described as passionate stars, Williams begins well). Some critical analysis of Cumming's interpretation suggests thoughtful engagement rather than dismissal. No negative verdict language present. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances by Emond and Burstein, but also notes a softer, self-referential performance by Cumming that may not align with expectations. The mixed tone suggests some elements work well, while others may not meet the mark. | Gemini: The review highlights strong performances, particularly from Emond and Burstein, and notes a change in focus. However, it also mentions reservations about Williams' portrayal and Cumming's softened character, leading to a positive but not rave recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Linda Emond and Danny Burstein's performances as the mature lovers, while providing more qualified or observational comments about the leads. Given this is a single curated excerpt with mixed signals about different elements, it represents a mildly positive recommendation.",
