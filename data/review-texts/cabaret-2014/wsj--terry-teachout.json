  "bwwExcerpt": "I don't share in the general enthusiasm for Mr. Cumming's overcooked performance, which pales in intensity when compared to the diamond-hard detachment that Joel Grey, who created the role in the original stage production, brought to Bob Fosse's extraordinary 1972 film version, from which Messrs. Mendes and Marshall borrowed a thing or three. But Michelle Williams plays Sally Bowles, the shopworn diva of the Kit Kat Club, with a poignant blend of vulnerability and desperation, while Linda Emond and Danny Burstein are as good as it gets as Fräulein Schneider and Herr Schultz, the couple whose middle-age romance serves as a backdrop to Sally's doomed affair with the bisexual Clifford Bradshaw (played with just the right amount of small-town naiveté by Bill Heck). While I like 'Cabaret' better when it's done on a smaller scale with shabbier décor, the way that Rhode Island's Trinity Repertory Company did it in 2009, this staging is fabulously good in its fancier way.",

The single excerpt suggests a positive overall impression. | Gemini: The review praises several performances (Williams, Emond, Burstein, Heck) and calls the staging \"fabulously good\", but expresses reservations about Cumming's performance and prefers smaller-scale productions. This suggests a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: While the critic dislikes Alan Cumming's 'overcooked' performance and prefers smaller-scale productions, he ultimately judges this staging as 'fabulously good' and praises the supporting cast highly.",
