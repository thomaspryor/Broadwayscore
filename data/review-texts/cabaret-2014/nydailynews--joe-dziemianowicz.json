  "bwwExcerpt": "Though Michelle Williams is credible but not memorable in her Broadway debut as songstress Sally Bowles, her performance can't mar the Roundabout's redo (re-revival?) of its Tony-winning 1998 take at Studio 54...As before, the oily emcee looms especially large. Alan Cumming won a Tony for the role 16 years ago. Beaming with creepy charisma, the sly Cumming is better than ever conjuring an androgynous bottom feeder whose smile hides something much darker and grimmer... a platinum-blond Williams assumes an English accent and an almost jolly and girlish demeanor flecked with desperation. She comes off so feathery that Sally could fly away -- except for her full-tilt go at the title song. Besides that final scene, Williams comes off paler and wispier than desired. Maybe next time.",

However, the text is truncated, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The quote praises \"Cabaret\" as entertaining, tuneful, and illuminating, suggesting a positive recommendation. However, the excerpt is short, so confidence is low. | Kimi: The available excerpt offers strong praise, calling the show a 'great musical drama' that is 'entertaining, tuneful and illuminating.' However, confidence is low because this is a curated excerpt that cuts off with 'Read more,' leaving the full context and potential reservations unknown.",
