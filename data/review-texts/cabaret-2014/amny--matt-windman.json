  "bwwExcerpt": "Anyone who is unfamiliar with 'Cabaret,' or even just this version of it, should definitely check it out. But as for everyone else, it's really just more of the same. Even a new production that proved to be less innovative would have been more exciting than this rehash. As the Emcee, Alan Cumming retains the sleazy presence that made his performance so entrancing originally. On the other hand, Michelle Williams makes a shaky Broadway debut, coming off as too fragile to portray the sexually aggressive singer Sally Bowles.",
