  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Cabaret,\" which opened at Studio 54 Thursday night, is the last show of the 2013-14 Broadway season. And perhaps the most exciting. Yet, it's totally fresh and crisp, and completely seductive, with Alan Cumming repeating his memorable performance, and Hollywood's Michelle Williams making a triumphant Broadway debut.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Calls it 'perhaps the most exciting' show of the season and 'completely seductive' with 'triumphant' debut - strong superlatives indicating rave territory. Medium confidence due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong positive language ('totally fresh and crisp', 'completely seductive', 'triumphant Broadway debut') indicating a highly favorable review. The use of 'most exciting' suggests a standout production. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language like \"most exciting\", \"fresh and crisp\", \"completely seductive\", and \"triumphant Broadway debut\". Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the language suggests a strong positive review. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise using words like 'most exciting,' 'triumphant,' and 'completely seductive,' indicating a clear recommendation, though the single-excerpt format warrants caution. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
