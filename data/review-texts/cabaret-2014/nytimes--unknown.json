    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The playful, celebratory tone ('Hot diggity dachshund') and nostalgic enthusiasm ('divinely, dangerously decadent') suggest positive reception, but with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses nostalgic and positive language, suggesting a positive sentiment. However, the lack of a full review and single excerpt warning means the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is mildly positive, suggesting a nostalgic and perhaps idealized view of the show. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring at the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic, playful language ('hot diggity dachshund,' 'divinely, dangerously decadent') and expresses genuine affection for the production's ability to recapture past magic. The nostalgic warmth and clear enjoyment suggest a positive verdict, though single-excerpt limitation keeps confidence low.",
