  "bwwExcerpt": "Cumming, who began his huge American career with this Tony-winning pansexual ghoul of a performance, seems older, seedier, more used up than he did back when Sam Mendes' you-are-there environmental staging of the 1966 Kander/Ebb masterwork was so new and dangerous and radical. In other words, Cumming is better than ever -- wiser, more dissipated, even more deeply entertaining in the role he stunningly recreated from Joel Grey's iconic original. And that freshness is so infectious it spills over into a landmark production that closed in 2004 but feels, with one uneasy exception, as confident -- and about as dangerous -- as if it has been running ever since. The exception, alas, is Michelle Williams, making her Broadway and musical debut as Sally Bowles...Her Sally is timid, bland and covered up in costumes that make her seem almost chaste.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performer ('better than ever') and production ('landmark', 'confident', 'dangerous' as positives). However, confidence is low due to excerpt-only text with unclear full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises Cumming's performance and describes the production as 'landmark' and 'confident,' suggesting a strong positive impression despite the mention of an 'uneasy exception.' The lack of full context necessitates a lower confidence level. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Cumming's performance and describes the production as \"infectious\" and \"confident.\" The phrase \"better than ever\" suggests a strong positive recommendation. However, the text is truncated, so confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise for the lead performance ('better than ever') and describes the production as a 'landmark' that feels 'confident' and 'dangerous,' indicating strong enthusiasm despite one minor caveat.",
