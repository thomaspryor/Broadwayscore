  "bwwExcerpt": "I'm not sure you could call Cumming, with his rouged nipples and S&M undergear, tame; certainly he's tireless. But as the only holdover cast member, he's also the only one with a need to articulate a deeper understanding of his character. I'm not sure this can be done with a character who is a concept; at any rate, Cumming over-articulates the Emcee, illustrating every word he speaks like a mime instructor. Some of the punch lines get killed by the huge pauses he takes to set them up...The performers who make the most of their material are in fact the two who have the least background in musicals. Michelle Williams's head voice is breathy, with a hummingbird vibrato; her belt is solid if somewhat coarse. But these are not handicaps with Sally, and in any case she acts the hell out of the role...Not even Richardson, superb as she was, brought quite this sense of brimming irrepressibility to the role: irrepressible eagerness and irrepressible sorrow. And, somehow, both together.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges high-quality performances but expresses fatigue with the familiar material. The repeated 'Almost' suggests the production doesn't quite overcome its overfamiliarity. However, this is only an excerpt so the full verdict may be different. | GPT-4o: The review praises the skill and commitment of the performance but suggests a lack of novelty, indicating a mixed impression. The excerpt is limited, so the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the skill and commitment of the performance, but the word \"almost\" indicates a reservation. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as a positive with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the performances as skillful and committed but undercuts this with 'Almost,' suggesting the production cannot overcome the staleness of familiar material. As a curated excerpt, the full verdict is unclear, but the tone is neither enthusiastic nor dismissive—merely acknowledging competence without recommending the revival as essential.",
