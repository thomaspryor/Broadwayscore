  "bwwExcerpt": "This being Trump’s America, the play hits hard. The casual racism of 1980s real estate — “Patel? Ravidam Patel? How am I going to make a living on these deadbeat wogs?” — is deeply uncomfortable. Remember Trump’s reference to migrants from “shithole countries”? Real estate offices of the 1980s are, of course, where the president learnt his trade. There is no need to labour the point, though. The play zips along without any overt political ploys. And it doesn’t need them. Mamet’s script is as fresh today as it was 40 years ago and Marber has assembled a cast worthy of its revival.",

However, the single excerpt warning indicates potential cherry-picking, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review highlights the play's continued relevance and praises the cast, indicating a positive overall assessment. The lack of a clear recommendation and the single excerpt available reduces confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the script's continued relevance and the cast's quality, describing the production as effective and well-paced, though the single-excerpt limitation requires cautious confidence.",
