    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic describes this as 'only reasonably involving' which is lukewarm praise at best. However, with only one excerpt available and the context that this is curated content, the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a production that is only 'reasonably involving', indicating a mixed reception. The mention of the playwright's powerful earlier work adds some positive context, but the focus is on the current production's limited engagement. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the production is \"only reasonably involving,\" which indicates a mixed reaction. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to a lower confidence score. | Kimi: The critic characterizes the production itself as 'only reasonably involving,' indicating lukewarm engagement, while noting that Mamet's writing remains powerful. The qualified praise and single-excerpt context suggest a middle-of-the-road assessment.",
