    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review describes the production as 'oddly tentative' with cast still 'finding its groove' - clearly critical language but not definitively negative. However, this appears to be a truncated excerpt with very limited evaluative content, making confidence low. | GPT-4o: The review suggests a lack of confidence and cohesion in the production, indicating mixed feelings without a strong recommendation or discouragement. | Gemini: The review uses the word \"tentative\" to describe the performance, suggesting it's neither good nor bad, but still in progress. | Kimi: The brief excerpt criticizes the revival as underprepared and lacking polish, suggesting the production falls short of expectations without recommending it.",
