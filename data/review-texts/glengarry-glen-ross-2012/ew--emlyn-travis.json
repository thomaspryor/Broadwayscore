  "bwwExcerpt": "With such an impressive list of actors, audiences will likely flock to Glengarry Glen Ross simply because they want to see Odenkirk, Burr, McKean, and Culkin knock it out of the park — and that is what they will find in spades. Any further exploration into the play's themes of toxic masculinity, morality, and corruption, however, have been largely left at the wayside in favor of watching these men work. Which, of course, creates a thrilling experience, but also leaves something more to be desired.",
