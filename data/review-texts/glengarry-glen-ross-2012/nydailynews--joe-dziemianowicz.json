'Better than nothing' is faint praise, suggesting a mixed verdict leaning negative. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the power of the play and Pacino's performance but suggests the production is underwhelming overall. The excerpt indicates a mixed reaction, with some positives but overall disappointment. | Gemini: The review states that the production is better than nothing, but also expresses disappointment, suggesting a mixed reaction. The truncated text and single excerpt lower the confidence. | Kimi: The critic finds the production disappointingly muted compared to the play's power, offering only faint praise ('better than nothing') while noting it fails to meet expectations. Confidence is low due to truncated text and single-excerpt availability.",
