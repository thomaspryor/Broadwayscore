  "bwwExcerpt": "It's a perfect beginning to the pair of monologues that make up the Off Broadway production of Sea Wall/A Life, a very intimate night of theater from director Carrie Cracknell, who previously brought A Doll's House to the stage in London's West End and at Brooklyn's BAM. Cracknell keeps everything so small to the point that brushing up near one of the actors isn't too far out of the realm of possibility. Sturridge (Starz's Sweetbitter) and Jake Gyllenhaal, who most recently costarred in Netflix's Velvet Buzzsaw, both are paired up with playwrights with whom they've collaborated many times before.",
