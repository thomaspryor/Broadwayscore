  "bwwExcerpt": "That world is on delicate display in Sea Wall/A Life, two monologues that were originally paired at the Public Theater this past winter. Now it has opened on Broadway at the handsome Hudson Theatre, with its moody design and appealing leading men intact. I reviewed Carrie Cracknell's mostly satisfying production downtown, and a second viewing only slightly budged my positive conclusion.",
