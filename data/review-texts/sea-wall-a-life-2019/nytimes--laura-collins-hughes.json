  "bwwExcerpt": "Directed by Carrie Cracknell, 'Sea Wall/A Life' - a hit downtown early this year, at the Public Theater - is the most stripped-down storytelling on Broadway right now. The quiet spectacle these plays offer is in the acting of tragicomedies of love and loss, young men's stories about fatherhood and family, and about the hole that grief can blast right through a person's center.",
