  "bwwExcerpt": "On the basic level, it is different because this time we get two: two short plays, two different actors, two stories. Together they make a fascinating pairing that is equally captivating and devastating. Although they may not share any direct overlap, both stories explore themes of family, love, fatherhood, death, loss, and grief. They are Greek tragedies for the modern age, full of pathos and heart-wrenching prose.",
