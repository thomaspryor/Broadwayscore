    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Clear mixed verdict - acknowledges the stars' considerable efforts but finds the overall revival lacking energy and impact. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the star power of the lead actors but ultimately describes the revival as 'tepid,' indicating a lack of enthusiasm and a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the star power of the leads but ultimately finds the revival to be tepid, suggesting a mixed or neutral overall experience. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the 'considerable star power' of the leads but ultimately characterizes the revival as 'oddly tepid,' indicating a lack of vitality or emotional heat. The brevity suggests this is an excerpt from a longer review. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
