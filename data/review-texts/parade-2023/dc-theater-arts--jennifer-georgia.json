  "bwwExcerpt": "The acting and voices are all excellent, in all registers, from Binnicker (Tom Watson)’s oily baritone, to Tacconi (Brit Craig)’s frenzied tenor, to Knight (Newt Lee)’s rich, despairing bass, to Suskauer (Lucille Frank)’s lovely but strong mezzo. Ramone Nelson stands out as the amused, powerful, and evil Jim Conley.",
