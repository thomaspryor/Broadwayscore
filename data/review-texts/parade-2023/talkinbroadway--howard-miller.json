    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong superlatives like 'gloriously thrilling' and statement that all previous issues were 'thoroughly addressed' indicate enthusiastic recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires caution about scoring too high. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong positive language ('gloriously thrilling') indicating a high level of enthusiasm. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using phrases like \"bright and shiny and gloriously thrilling\" and stating that all previous quibbles have been addressed. Given that this is a single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the 'Positive' range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified superlative praise ('gloriously thrilling') and indicates previous flaws have been completely resolved. As a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's nuance, the score is placed at the top of the Positive range per guidance. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
