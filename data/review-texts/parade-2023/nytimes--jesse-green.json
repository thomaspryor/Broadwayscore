  "bwwExcerpt": "What struck me even more vividly in this well-judged and timely revival is the quick path hysteria has always burned through the American spirit if fanned by media, politicians and prejudice of any kind. When a chorus of white Georgians chants “hang ’im, hang 'im, make him pay,” the words can’t help but echo uncomfortably in the post-Jan. 6 air. And another song, a prayer for a return of the day when “the Southland was free,” sounds a lot like current talk of a second secession.",

However, without further details, it's a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt favorably compares the revival to the original Broadway production, praising it as superior in intimacy and intensity. However, the brevity of the provided text prevents determination of whether this constitutes an enthusiastic recommendation or qualified praise.",
