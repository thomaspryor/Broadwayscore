    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: CRITIC'S PICK designation combined with praise for 'well-judged and timely revival' indicates strong positive recommendation. Single excerpt warning means using upper end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the revival as 'well-judged and timely' and is labeled as a 'CRITIC'S PICK', indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt includes \"Critic's Pick\" and describes the revival as \"well-judged and timely,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a score in the upper end of the Positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt carries a 'CRITIC'S PICK' designation and describes the revival as 'well-judged and timely' with vivid impact, indicating a clear recommendation. Following the single-excerpt protocol for clearly positive quotes, this scores in the upper Positive range (80-84).",
