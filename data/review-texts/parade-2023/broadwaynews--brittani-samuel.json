    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises the director's restraint and acknowledges the show's enduring relevance. However, this is only one curated quote which may not represent the full review sentiment, hence low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed view, acknowledging the historical significance of 'Parade' while implying that the production avoids unnecessary modern alterations. The lack of a clear positive or negative tone and the single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the reviewer appreciates the production's handling of historical themes and its relevance. Without more context, a score in the lower end of the 'Positive' bucket seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt praises director Michael Arden for avoiding heavy-handed updates, showing appreciation for the production's restrained approach. As a single curated excerpt with mild rather than enthusiastic praise, it scores in the lower Positive range.",
