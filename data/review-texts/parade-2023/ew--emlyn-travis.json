  "showScoreExcerpt": "“‘Parade’ is much more than just a singular spectacle; it slowly and methodically highlights the ways in which Frank's tragedy isn't an isolated incident, but rather a cog in the wheel of injustice that continues to spin to this day...and it's easy to see why ’Parade’ is the most gut-wrenchingly gorgeous production on Broadway.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The superlative 'most gut-wrenchingly gorgeous production on Broadway' indicates exceptional praise placing this in the top tier of current shows. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong, positive language ('gut-wrenchingly gorgeous') suggesting a highly favorable view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"gut-wrenchingly gorgeous\", indicating a strong recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the language suggests a high positive score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise calling it the most gorgeous production on Broadway with strong emotional impact, but as a single curated excerpt that may be cherry-picked, it falls in the upper Positive range per instructions. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
