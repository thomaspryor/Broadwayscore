  "bwwExcerpt": "People often see musicals as a means of escape, a way to forget about the real world for a little while. But ‘Parade’ asks us to remember. The trial of Leo Frank was highly publicized at the time, and the show calls attention to reality through enlarged photos and newspaper clippings splashed on a screen behind the action. When a new character is introduced, we see photos of their real life counterparts. When the action moves to a new location, the set stays the same, but the photograph changes.",
