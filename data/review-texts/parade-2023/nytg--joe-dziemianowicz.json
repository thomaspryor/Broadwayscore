  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It’s a rare and thrilling gift when a musical presents a song that stirs up a legitimate lump in your throat. ’Parade,’ back in a banner revival, sees its stars Ben Platt and Micaela Diamond work that special magic twice with a pair of duets, one hopeful and one crushing. Memo: Bring tissues.”\n\nRead more",

However, only one excerpt available so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('rare and thrilling gift', 'special magic') and highlights emotional impact, suggesting a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the musical's ability to evoke strong emotions and highlights the performances of the stars, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Fortunately, the uniformly terrific cast makes up for small-scale quibbles. Standout supporting work comes from Sean Allan Krill as the honorable Governor Slaton; Alex Joseph Grayson as Jim Conley, whose testimony nails Leo; Paul Alexander Nolan as the rabid prosecutor; and Jake Pedersen as Mary’s boyfriend. Leo and Lucille’s evolving relationship forms the heart of the show, and both stars deliver in performances that are authentically life-size — no larger — and that is key to this story. Watching Diamond (The Cher Show) go from timid Jewish wife to take-charge partner is exhilarating. As a displaced New Yorker who’s not so likable, Dear Evan Hansen Tony winner Platt notches another Broadway triumph.",
