  "bwwExcerpt": "omeone in my group wondered if this might make a better play than musical, because it feels odd to have dancing and singing about themes like Anti-Semitism and outright racism. It’s an odd juxtaposition, and it feels more tragically operatic than a pop music piece that we are used to on the stages these days. And that’s what makes PARADE important, alive, and vital. It refuses to take the easy road or find the easy answers. But it also refuses to not give you beauty to admire in the midst of all",
