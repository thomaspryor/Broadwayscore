Single excerpt warning and 'Read more' suggests incomplete text, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the book as 'reductive' and 'ham-fisted,' indicating a negative view of the show's narrative. The text quality warning suggests the excerpt may not fully represent the review, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt criticizes the book as \"reductive\" and \"ham-fisted,\" and the second act as \"preposterously scripted.\" While the score is tempered by the single excerpt, the negative language suggests a negative review. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
