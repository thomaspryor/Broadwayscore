  "bwwExcerpt": "The Broadway revival of “Parade” originated a few months ago as a week-long production at City Center directed by Michael Arden (who has helmed solid revivals of “Spring Awakening” and “Once On This Island”) and starring Ben Platt as Leo Frank. It was a gripping and thrilling production that was absolutely worthy of a Broadway transfer and has gotten better since then.",

Single excerpt limits confidence, but tone is clearly positive without reservations. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('gripping and thrilling', 'absolutely worthy') suggesting a highly favorable view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"gripping and thrilling\" and states that the production was \"absolutely worthy of a Broadway transfer and has gotten better since then.\" | Kimi: The excerpt contains enthusiastic praise ('gripping,' 'thrilling,' 'absolutely worthy'), indicating a clear recommendation to see the show. However, as a single curated excerpt, the full context of the review is unknown.",
