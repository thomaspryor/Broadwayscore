  "bwwExcerpt": "The problem is that the story, and thus the cast, is so bloated, it’s difficult to track. It would land much more powerfully if it had been trimmed, both characters and songs. Another problem is that the music doesn’t really pop. There’s a lot of it, but not much is memorable, which ends up being true for the characters as well. There are so many, it’s hard for them to stand out. It also means many of them are so thinly characterized, they’re not fully realized, so there’s no significant connect",
