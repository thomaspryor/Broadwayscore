    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong recommendation using language like 'imperative for viewing' and 'vital,' comparing it to essential news. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong language ('vital', 'imperative for viewing') suggesting a must-see recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"complex, passionate\" and \"vital and informative\" and calls it \"imperative for viewing\", indicating a strong recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper range of Positive. | Kimi: The excerpt features strong endorsement language ('imperative for viewing', 'vital'), indicating a firm recommendation. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this scores in the upper Positive range, though the limited context necessitates low confidence.",
