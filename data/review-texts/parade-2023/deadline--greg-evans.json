The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning suggests caution, but the language indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the cast and calls the revival \"commanding,\" suggesting a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise comparing the show to the best Broadway revivals in recent years, placing it in the upper range of Positive. Confidence is low given only one curated excerpt is available.",
