  "bwwExcerpt": "The scaled-down ensemble compensates with singing out, as if it’s a grand opera chorus. The small orchestra plays with immense tenderness and expression. Great care is taken so that the sound design is never oppressive but waxes and wanes with the drama. “Parade” is the best touring musical of the year so far, but the run is short. Don’t let it pass you by.",
