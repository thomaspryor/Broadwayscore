  "bwwExcerpt": "Expect to feel a roller coaster of emotions as we’re led through a journey of shock, hope, redemption, and tragedy. Chernin poignantly conveys the feelings of utter helplessness and despair that Leo Frank must have experienced, while Suskauer embodies a woman pulling from reserves she doesn’t know she has. Parade is a spectacle of class and grace, and its themes of anti-Semitism, racism, politics, and injustice are incredibly relevant today.",
