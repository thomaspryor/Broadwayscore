  "bwwExcerpt": "The cast of nearly three dozen is flawless in their approach under the direction of Michael Arden. The choreography by Lauren Yalango-Grant and Christopher Cree Grant creates wonderful pictures framed on Dane Laffrey's scenic design, Heather Gilbert's lighting, Jon Weston's sound design, presented in Sven Ortel's production design. Charlie Alterman leads the cast of this nearly entirely sung through musical pitch perfectly as the Musical Director and Conductor.",
