  "bwwExcerpt": "“Parade” is both a warning and a promise of what America has been, is, and may become. This is musical theater at its most potent. Beautiful music, inspired directing, and a phenomenal cast merge for a once-in-a-lifetime production now in its final days. I doubt we will again see “Parade” so powerfully produced at so devastating a moment. Challenge yourself and “Parade” will stay with you well beyond the performance.",
