  "bwwExcerpt": "What “Parade” offers, however, is a reflection. It urges us not to shy away from our past, but to confront it, with the hope that understanding it might one day help us break the cycle. This is where Uhry’s book and Brown’s lyrics truly shine, making the show as essential to see as “Wicked” or “Hamilton,” albeit for entirely different reasons.",
