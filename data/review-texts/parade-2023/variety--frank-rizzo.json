    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('theatrically thrilling') and frames the show as important and relevant. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the revival as 'theatrically thrilling' and emphasizes its importance, suggesting a strong recommendation. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language indicates a rave review. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the phrase \"theatrically thrilling revival,\" which indicates a positive assessment. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs enthusiastic praise ('theatrically thrilling') and highlights the production's contemporary relevance, indicating a strong recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty.",
