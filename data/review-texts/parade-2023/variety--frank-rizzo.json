    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('theatrically thrilling') and frames the show as important and relevant. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the revival as 'theatrically thrilling' and emphasizes its importance, suggesting a strong recommendation. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language indicates a rave review. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the phrase \"theatrically thrilling revival,\" which indicates a positive assessment. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs enthusiastic praise ('theatrically thrilling') and highlights the production's contemporary relevance, indicating a strong recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Key to this retelling is the presentational style of the show, which is common for City Center’s Encores! shows and here becomes an asset as it sharpens the focus and always keeps the musical numbers front and center, enhanced by Heather Gilbert’s lighting, Susan Hilferty’s period costumes and Jon Weston’s sound design. The tri-level raised stage by Dane Laffrey also keeps it simple, effectively standing in for a wide variety of locales: factory offices, court room, ballroom, gravesites, prison cell and ultimately gallows. Co-choreographers Lauren Yalango-Grant and Christopher Cree Grant make the sweep of history move with grace and flair. Sven Ortel’s projections of vintage photographs of the actual characters, settings and headlines are a constant reminder of the real world and its actual history. This theatrically thrilling revival of “Parade” teaches lessons that still need to be learned from a wicked past that haunts us still.",
