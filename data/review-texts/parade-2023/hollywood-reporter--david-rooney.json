    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt uses strong positive language ('stirring', 'urgently relevant') and highlights lead performances positively. However, confidence is low due to limited text - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the revival as 'stirring' and 'urgently relevant', indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"stirring\" and \"urgently relevant,\" suggesting a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly positive evaluative language ('stirring,' 'urgently relevant') indicating an enthusiastic recommendation for this revival, though the single-quote limitation necessitates low confidence.",
