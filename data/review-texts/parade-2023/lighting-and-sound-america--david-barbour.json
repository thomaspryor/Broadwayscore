  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It has always been one of the two or three best musicals of the last quarter century, foregrounding a wrenching personal drama against a teeming canvas of prejudice, media manipulation, and political chicanery. Unlike most musicals, it minces no words, building its case unsentimentally and climaxing in an absolute haymaker of an eleven o'clock number.

It's an exhilarating demonstration of what musical theatre can achieve.”\n\nRead more",
