  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It has always been one of the two or three best musicals of the last quarter century, foregrounding a wrenching personal drama against a teeming canvas of prejudice, media manipulation, and political chicanery. Unlike most musicals, it minces no words, building its case unsentimentally and climaxing in an absolute haymaker of an eleven o'clock number. If the current production is not ideal, the show remains a stunner with much to say about today's poisoned political discourse. It's an exhilarating demonstration of what musical theatre can achieve.”\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning noted - this positive language suggests upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a 'stunner' and 'exhilarating,' despite noting the current production is not ideal. The positive language suggests a strong recommendation, but the excerpt's limited nature reduces confidence. | Gemini: Despite the caveat that the current production is \"not ideal,\" the excerpt strongly praises the show as a whole, calling it a \"stunner\" and an \"exhilarating demonstration of what musical theatre can achieve.\" | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the musical material ('one of the two or three best musicals,' 'exhilarating demonstration') but explicitly notes the current production is 'not ideal,' placing it in the Positive bucket rather than a Rave.",
