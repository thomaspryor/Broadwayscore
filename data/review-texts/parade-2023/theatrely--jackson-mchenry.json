    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong positive language ('powerful and haunting', 'urgently relevant') but confidence is low due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('powerful', 'haunting', 'urgently relevant'), suggesting a highly favorable view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low as the full review context is unavailable. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"powerful and haunting\" and \"urgently relevant,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the language pushes the score to the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('powerful,' 'haunting,' 'urgently relevant') indicating a clear recommendation, placing it in the upper Positive range (80-84). Confidence is low as this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's complexity or qualifications.",
