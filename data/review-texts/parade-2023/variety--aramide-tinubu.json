    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: The word 'exquisite' is strong praise for the revival, and the critic highlights the leads' 'nuanced performances.' However, this appears to be an excerpt focusing only on the performances, so confidence is medium. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language ('exquisite', 'nuanced') to describe the performances, indicating a highly favorable opinion of the production. | Gemini: The review uses the word \"exquisite\" to describe the revival and praises the performances of the leads. This indicates a positive recommendation, though brief. | Kimi: The critic describes the revival as 'exquisite' and praises the lead performances as 'nuanced' and 'strikingly contemporary,' indicating strong enthusiasm despite the brevity of the provided text. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
