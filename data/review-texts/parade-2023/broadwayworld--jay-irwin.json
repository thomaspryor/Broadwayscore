  "bwwExcerpt": "This is simply a super solid production of an underdone masterpiece, and you need to catch it. And so, with my three-letter rating system I give the North American Tour of “Parade” at the 5th Avenue Theatre a “let’s try and learn from the past” YAY. We still seemed to be doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past, but with theater and stories like this, hopefully we can learn to overcome even a little bit of our own prejudice and ignorance.",
