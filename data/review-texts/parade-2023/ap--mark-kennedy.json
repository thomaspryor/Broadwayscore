  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Platt is one of the reasons to see this grim and doomed musical love story set against the real backdrop of a murder and lynching in Georgia in pre-World War I. Another is Micaela Diamond, who plays his wife. A third reason is the score by Jason Robert Brown, which brilliantly veers from muscular work songs to intricate duets.”\n\nRead more",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances and a brilliant score as reasons to see the show, indicating a positive recommendation despite the grim subject matter. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt lists multiple reasons to see the show, including the performances and the score, indicating a positive recommendation despite the grim subject matter. The single excerpt and lack of a clear overall verdict lead to medium confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly identifies multiple 'reasons to see' the production and praises the lead performances and 'brilliant' score with enthusiastic language, indicating a clear recommendation despite the grim subject matter.",
