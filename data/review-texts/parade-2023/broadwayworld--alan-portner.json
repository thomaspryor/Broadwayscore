  "bwwExcerpt": "This is a super production of a perhaps slightly flawed show.  Starring are an excellent Max Chernin as Leo Frank and an as good Talia Suskauer as Lucille Frank. Chernin comes direct from working as Ben Platt’s understudy in the Broadway production. Suskauer was last seen as Elphaba in the Broadway company of “Wicked.”  Both are tremendous performers.  Chernin is easily one of the best male stage voices I’ve heard in many years.",
