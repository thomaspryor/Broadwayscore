  "fullText": "Bug Broadway Review: This Play Crawls Under Your Skin By J.J. Colagrande | January 13, 2026 January 13, 2026 Bug is a play by American playwright Tracy Letts, starring Carrie Coon and Namir Smallwood. It first premiered in London in 1996 and is currently making its Broadway debut at the Manhattan Theatre Club, at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre. Most of the play takes place in a seedy motel room. A lonely cocktail waitress, Agnes, is living there, on the lam from her violent ex-husband, Jerry, who has recently been released from jail. One night, Agnes’s lesbian biker friend introduces her to Peter, a Gulf War veteran and drifter. Agnes gets involved with Peter, who grows increasingly paranoid about a bug infestation in the hotel room. This soon connects to a web of conspiracy theories involving the government. The play explores love, paranoia, addiction , conspiracy, and Agnes’s slow descent into insanity under Peter’s influence. This psychological thriller is gut-wrenching and tense. It will make you uncomfortable in the best way. You will cover your eyes during certain scenes. The performances are courageous, compelling, and traumatic. The chemistry and nuance between the actors are extraordinary. Both actors will almost certainly be nominated for Tony Awards under Best Revival of a Play. Bug Broadway Review On a deeper level, this play is more relevant in 2026 than ever. We give it five stars, a 96 out of 100. That said, this dark, twisted psychological thriller is not for everyone. And yes, we hate to get all freshman composition on you, but this play demands to be viewed through Ernest Hemingway’s Iceberg Theory, you know, the idea that only 20 percent of a story is visible on the surface, while 80 percent lives underneath in context and subtext. If you understand the cultural language and history beneath Bug , you will get far more out of it. If you don’t, you may only see a redneck woman and an African-American veteran holed up in a motel, smoking crack, having sex, getting paranoid, violent, and descending into addiction and madness. You might cringe at the self-harm and brutality and leave wondering what the hell you just watched, especially if you came for Carrie Coon fresh off The White Lotus and The Gilded Age . But if you go deeper, you’ll recognize how profoundly American these themes are: addiction, misinformation, domestic violence, paranoia, delusion, mental health decline. When the play was written in the mid-1990s, the internet was just being born. Misinformation was only a seedling. In 1996, Bug was a warning . In 2026, it’s a mirror. Even the word “bug” matters. In ’90s slang, to bug out meant going crazy. You buggin, meant, hey, you&#8217;re losing your grip. Language matters. In law enforcement, a bug is a listening device. Without cultural context, those meanings disappear, and so does the play’s power. There’s a moment in the Apple TV+ series Pluribus where a character (Carol) doubts her apartment has been bugged , and another character (Manousos) new to American culture, takes the word literally, picturing an insect. Again, language matters. This is not a feel-good night at the theater. It’s raw, violent, sexy, and deeply American. It asks uncomfortable questions about trust, trauma, and the stories we choose to believe when reality starts to fracture. Bug is tense, moody, dark, sexy, strange, riveting, and deeply unsettling. It’s not fun but it’s necessary. You will leave shaken and in that discomfort, you’ll know you felt something. That is all great drama ever promises. Bug opens January 8 and runs for a limited engagement. For more info and tickets click here. Sidenotes and ramblings The last two plays we’ve seen featuring strong, young African American men— Purpose and now Bug —present their male leads as essentially asexual despite the presence of sex, raising the question of coincidence or something more deliberate at work.
