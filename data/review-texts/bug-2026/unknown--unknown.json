  "fullText": "Twenty-nine years after its London premiere, Tracy Letts’ “Bug” has finally crawled onto Broadway at Manhattan Theatre Club’s Samuel J. Friedman Theatre, and the question that matters most isn’t whether this David Cromer-directed production succeeds or fails—it’s whether Cromer understood what play he was directing. “Bug” is a psychiatric horror about folie à deux, the clinical term for shared psychotic disorder, in which one person’s delusion infects another through intimacy and isolation. Peter Evans (Namir Smallwood) is severely mentally ill—as Dr. Sweet confirms, Peter spent four years institutionalized and diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. Agnes White (Carrie Coon), traumatized by her lost son and abusive ex-husband, is desperately vulnerable. The play’s power comes from watching Agnes get drawn into Peter’s elaborate fantasy, mistaking his madness for love, until they destroy themselves in a gasoline-fueled immolation. This is tragedy. But Cromer has directed it as conspiracy thriller, inviting the audience to wonder “is Peter right?” rather than pulling us into empathetic horror. That fundamental misreading drains the play of its devastating impact. Letts wrote “Bug” in 1996, in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, and the play taps into real American anxieties about government surveillance and conspiracies. But it uses those anxieties as backdrop for something more intimate and terrifying: the seduction of shared delusion. Peter weaves real history—the Tuskegee experiments, MKUltra, Nazi scientists at NASA—into his elaborate fantasy about microscopic aphids implanted in his body to transmit surveillance data. He sounds almost plausible, which is precisely what makes him dangerous. Agnes, working a dead-end waitress job and living in a seedy motel, has spent nine years tormented by the disappearance of her six-year-old son Lloyd from a grocery store. That unresolved trauma—the guilt, the not-knowing—makes her desperately vulnerable to Peter’s narrative. He offers her what grief has denied: an explanation. Lloyd wasn’t lost through her negligence but taken by powerful conspirators for nefarious purposes. This relieves her guilt while giving her an enemy to fight. The play charts her psychological collapse as Peter’s delusion becomes their shared reality. We’re not meant to wonder whether the bugs are real or the conspiracy is true. We’re meant to watch—with mounting horror—as two damaged people construct an elaborate folie à deux that ends in murder and suicide. The tragedy is that this feels like love to both of them. But Cromer’s production consistently makes choices that validate Peter’s paranoia rather than reveal it as psychosis. From the moment Peter enters, Cromer directs the play as if we should be asking “is he right?” rather than “how will Agnes be destroyed by believing him?” The result is observational distance rather than empathetic immersion. The staging keeps us outside looking in, analyzing the characters’ behavior from a clinical remove, rather than pulling us into Agnes’s devastating descent. This approach might work for a play commenting on conspiracy culture in the QAnon era, which is how many critics have received it. But it betrays the text. “Bug” loses its power when we’re meant to evaluate Peter’s claims rather than feel Agnes’s destruction. The play isn’t a meditation on whether conspiracies exist—it’s a horror story about how vulnerable people can be consumed by another person’s madness. Cromer has made it the former when Letts wrote the latter. The clearest evidence of Cromer’s misreading comes in the staging of Dr. Sweet (Randall Arney). In the text, Sweet arrives claiming to be Peter’s psychiatrist from the institution, offering to help, even dangling the possibility that he can help Agnes find her lost son Lloyd. Peter, in full psychotic break, believes Sweet is a robot sent by conspirators and stabs him to death. This should be tragedy—a real person, however flawed, murdered by someone who cannot distinguish reality from delusion. But Cromer stages Sweet as sinister and suspicious from the moment he enters, his demeanor suggesting genuine threat rather than misguided psychiatric intervention. This validates Peter’s paranoia. If Sweet seems dangerous, then Peter’s violence becomes defensible, even heroic—he’s protecting Agnes from a government agent. The murder loses its horror. We should be watching Peter commit an irreversible act that seals both their fates. Instead, we’re invited to wonder if maybe Peter was right to kill him. This is the conspiracy-thriller track, and it drains the scene of its devastating power. Sweet must seem like a genuine doctor trying to retrieve a patient for the play to work as psychiatric tragedy. Cromer’s decision to add an intermission is equally devastating. The original 2004 Off-Broadway production ran 90 minutes straight through—a relentless, claustrophobic descent with no relief. Here, the intermission breaks the organic transformation of the motel room and, more critically, the audience’s psychological immersion. During intermission, we see stagehands setting up the fly strips, the industrial pesticides, the roach motels—all the physical evidence of escalating paranoia. What should feel like inevitable psychological collapse becomes theatrical construction we watch being assembled. We return from intermission to find the madness already installed, ready for Act Two. The break allows analytical distance; we have time to step back, think “this is crazy,” discuss it with our companions. But the play depends on pulling us deeper without pause, making each paranoid elaboration feel like the only logical next step. The intermission lets us reset emotionally when we should be spiraling downward with Agnes and Peter. It transforms immersive horror into episodic observation. The staging compounded this problem with a turntable. The final apocalyptic room—walls covered in tinfoil to “scramble the signal,” jerry cans of gasoline positioned for immolation—was pre-built offstage and rotated into view during a blackout. This is theatrical magic trick, not organic transformation. The power of Act Two lies in watching Agnes and Peter methodically seal themselves in, piece by piece—every sheet of tinfoil stapled to the wall, every paranoid “improvement” to their fortress. We should witness the obsessive labor of constructing their delusion, the way mad logic builds on itself until they’ve created a tomb. Instead, the turntable delivers a complete set change: the nightmare appears fully formed. It says “this is theater, here’s what madness looks like” rather than “you’re watching two people destroy themselves in real time.” The choice to close the set in rather than use the full playing area of the Friedman Theatre further emphasizes contained observation over immersive horror. We’re looking at madness from the outside, not trapped inside it with them. The paranoia itself never builds with the necessary inexorability. It feels sporadic—isolated episodes of “craziness” rather than accumulating psychological pressure. We should feel Agnes being pulled deeper with each scene, each new “discovery,” until she’s past the point of return. Instead, the descent feels episodic, giving us distance rather than momentum. The violence compounds this problem by being consistently soft-pedaled. When Jerry Goss (Steve Key) hits Agnes early in the play, establishing the real physical threat that makes her vulnerable to Peter’s protection, the stage slap is unconvincing—one of the worst executed we’ve seen. Peter’s self-mutilation—yanking out his own molar with pliers, carving into his skin to remove “egg sacs”—should be genuinely shocking, forcing us to confront his absolute commitment to the delusion. The stabbing of Dr. Sweet should be brutal and irreversible. But the production pulls its punches throughout. If the violence isn’t real and shocking, the stakes aren’t real. We don’t believe these people are capable of the final murder-suicide, and the ending loses its horror. Psychological realism demands physical reality. Carrie Coon and Namir Smallwood are both fully committed to the delusion—there’s no question of their dedication or their understanding of the characters. But their performances register as adequate rather than exceptional, constrained by direction that keeps them at arm’s length from the audience. Smallwood brings intelligence and vulnerability to Peter, finding nuance in the text, but Cromer never allows him to emphasize the character’s psychiatric diagnosis. It’s always “conspiracy theory” rather than psychosis. Coon, returning to Broadway for the first time since her 2012 debut in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” (opposite Letts, her husband), has been heavily promoted on the strength of her recent television work in “The White Lotus” and “The Gilded Age.” The hype may have inflated expectations, but more fundamentally, the observational staging prevents her from taking us inside Agnes’s devastation. We watch her perform grief and vulnerability rather than feeling it with her. The supporting cast is inconsistent—Arney’s Dr. Sweet and Key’s Jerry Goss are particularly weak, though the directorial choices regarding Sweet bear more responsibility for that character’s failure than the actor does. What gets lost in all these choices is the play’s essential intimacy. “Bug” takes place entirely in one claustrophobic motel room because the world must contract to nothing but Agnes and Peter’s shared reality. They must become everything to each other—the only witnesses, the only believers, the only truth-tellers in a hostile world. Cromer’s decision to close the set in rather than use the Friedman’s full playing space should have intensified this claustrophobia, but the observational framing works against it. The tone never settles into psychological realism; it’s not camp either, but something confused and uncertain. Most critically, Cromer never finds a way to make us understand why Agnes believes Peter. We see that she’s lonely, traumatized, vulnerable—but we don’t feel the seductive pull of his certainty, the relief of having someone explain her pain, the intoxication of being special enough to know “the truth.” Without that emotional logic, Agnes’s descent looks like weakness rather than tragedy. We judge her for being foolish instead of grieving for her destruction. After twenty-nine years, “Bug” finally reached Broadway, and this should have been the definitive production of a psychological horror masterpiece. The play has aged into uncomfortable relevance—in an era where conspiracy thinking has metastasized from fringe paranoia to mainstream political discourse, Letts’ examination of how delusion spreads through intimacy feels urgent. But Cromer’s fundamental misreading—treating the play as conspiracy culture commentary rather than folie à deux tragedy—squanders that opportunity. By keeping us at analytical distance, by validating Peter’s paranoia through staging choices, by breaking the immersive descent with theatrical interventions, this production asks us to think about madness rather than feel it. The play’s power lies in its terrifying empathy: we should understand exactly how Agnes ends up dead in a burning motel room, even as we’re screaming for her to run. We should feel complicit in her destruction because we’ve been inside it with her. Instead, Cromer has given us specimens under glass—clinical observation of how conspiracy theories seduce the vulnerable. That’s sociology, not horror. “Bug” deserves better than being reduced to timely metaphor. It deserves to devastate us.
