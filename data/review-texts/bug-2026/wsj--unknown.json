    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt describes a 'blistering' revival with strong lead performance but lacks any clear evaluative language or recommendation. Without the full review text, cannot determine the critic's actual verdict. | GPT-4o: The use of 'blistering' suggests a strong performance or production, indicating a positive tone. However, the lack of a clear recommendation and the text quality warning necessitate a cautious approach. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on Carrie Coon's performance and the nudity in the play. Without a clear recommendation or overall assessment of the production's quality, it's difficult to classify beyond a mixed assessment. The 'blistering' description suggests some positive aspects, but the lack of a definitive statement prevents a higher score.",
