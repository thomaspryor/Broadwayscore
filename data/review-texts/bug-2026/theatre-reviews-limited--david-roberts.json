    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic feels the production reduces the play to mere sociology rather than delivering its intended horror impact, expressing clear disappointment that it 'deserves better.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the production for failing to deliver the intended impact, suggesting it falls short of expectations. The confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the production falls short of its potential, indicating a negative assessment despite the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production for prioritizing intellectual metaphor over visceral horror, explicitly stating it fails to devastate as the material should, indicating a negative assessment of this interpretation.",
