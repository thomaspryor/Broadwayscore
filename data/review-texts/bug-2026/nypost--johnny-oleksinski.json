  "dtliExcerpt": "As they turn into paranoid shut-ins who insist the world is out to get them, Coon’s waitress goes from a vulnerable shift worker to something resembling the subject of an exorcism. Smallwood’s secretive nomad, meanwhile, amps up his crazed conspiracy theories to the volume of “the power of Christ compels you!”\r\n\r\nBecause of Letts’ empathetic writing and Coon’s broken, can’t-take-it-anymore performance, we understand their extremism and why they believe the outlandish things they believe — even if Peter is the harder nut to crack.",
