  "fullText": "Samuel J Friedman Theatre, New York The White Lotus and Gilded Age actor takes on her real-life husband Tracy Letts’ 1996 thriller, which could have afforded some modern-day tweaks You can practically smell the stale cigarette smoke lingering in the air of the fake motel set for Bug. It’s the play’s only location – though it appears in a distinctive second guise in the second act – and in its staging at the Samuel J Friedman Theatre, the set comes to a corner in the center of the stage, jutting out toward the audience. The additional angle gives the room a little more depth, but it also distorts the room’s geography, rendering it neither proscenium neat nor fully realistic. That’s the increasingly hard-to-recognize world that Agnes (Carrie Coon) inhabits when she brings near-stranger Peter (Namir Smallwood) into her life. Agnes is a waitress living out of the motel, drinking and taking drugs in between shifts. Her abusive ex, Jerry (Steve Key), just out of prison, lurks around, expecting Agnes to welcome him back to their “home” whenever he pleases. So when her friend RC (Jennifer Engstrom) introduces Agnes to the drifter and supposed veteran Peter, he can’t help but seem gentler by comparison. But when Peter thinks he notices a bug bite from their shared motel bed, he starts to spiral further into paranoia. Agnes, whether aided by drugs, love, grief over her lost child or a combination of those, spirals right along with him. This play by Tracy Letts – Coon’s spouse in real life – was initially produced in 1996 in London; revised for American shows in the early 2000s, including a year Off Broadway; and adapted into a 2006 feature film starring Michael Shannon as Peter (who originated the role in London and reprised it in several subsequent productions) and Ashley Judd as Agnes. So it’s a little odd that this first version on Broadway also purports (at least according to the Playbill) to be taking place in the present day, raising questions about what a new production of Bug has to offer in 2025. The answers are mixed, even as the production itself remains a concise and compelling piece of theater. First written nearly 30 years ago, Peter’s increasing paranoia has a lot of 90s-era touchstones, positioning him as a Gulf war veteran, rambling about the Unabomber, Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995. There’s something to be gained from recontextualizing that itchy distrust into the present day, when conspiracy theories have undergone a shift from X-Files-ready pulp entertainment to something spread with near-religious fervor across the internet. After all, is seeing a motel room covered in microscopic bugs (even when the manager insists no other rooms have reported this problem) that different from ranting about the invisible threats of vaccines? In a sense, the world has caught up with the unnerving credulity Letts was underlining so many years ago. Yet on a purely logistical level, there’s not much effort to make Bug less of a period piece, despite the claim that it’s taking place now. Granted, that would probably require a wholesale rewrite, and anyway, there is something equally poignant and devastatingly lonely about a world where this couple can still isolate themselves and find both solace and madness in each other, sometimes naked and sometimes afraid. Coon is as open and vulnerable as she is on the TV shows that have garnered her so many additional fans. And in contrast to Shannon, an actor whose magnetism derives from the intensity of his eyes, Smallwood plays Peter as more mild-mannered at first, doing a convincing impression of just what Agnes needs. The full extent of his paranoia, causing him to endlessly scratch at his skin and examine blood droplets in a microscope, convinced he’s seeing parasites, feels all the more heartbreaking. Audiences seeing Bug for the first time, then, may well be transfixed, albeit temporarily. Anyone familiar with an earlier production or the William Friedkin film (which introduces some ambiguities to the story’s ending) might start to wonder if maybe Agnes and Peter are ultimately a little thin as characters – if they’re worth the intensity that Coon and Smallwood invest into this production. It’s probably not fair to compare a 100-minute early work from Letts to a towering masterpiece like August: Osage County, his Broadway debut from 2007. At the same time, Letts has clearly evolved as a writer since Bug, and it’s hard not to come away from this production wondering how he might address the contemporary version of this drug-addled psychological unmooring. It’s not so much that this production of Bug is outdated; more accurately, it’s got way too much competition, on stage and off. We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could support the Guardian at this crucial time for journalism in the US. In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one. From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced. While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts. While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel. Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less. But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.",

But it’s Coon and Smallwood’s performances that make us question how far we’ll go to not feel alone, regardless of the outcome.",
