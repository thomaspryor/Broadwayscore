  "dtliExcerpt": "If you’d told me at the time that I’d be at a Broadway opening night watching “Bug” 25 years later starring Letts’ very famous wife, Carrie Coon, I’d have suggested a good fantasy exterminator. And yet, demonstrably, “Bug,” a drama penned when Letts was still in his 20s, still had the capacity to shock some of the nice folks in the audience at Manhattan Theatre Club. At least judging by their involuntary screeches.",
