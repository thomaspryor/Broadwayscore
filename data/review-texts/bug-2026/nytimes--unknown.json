  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "This new Manhattan Theater Club production, which opened Thursday at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, is more tender and balanced, with Namir Smallwood rendering Peter as a gentler, less alien figure. The focus has shifted to his romantic partner, Agnes (Coon), a desperate sad sack haunted by a loss in her past. In a superb performance, Coon provides the alpha energy this time, her eruptive anger masking an inner conflict worn on her weary face. The director David Cromer still delivers effective jolts, yet his production feels disturbingly closer to home.",

However, the single excerpt and lack of a clear overall verdict necessitate a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review highlights a \"superb performance\" and notes the production \"feels disturbingly closer to home,\" suggesting a positive but potentially unsettling experience. The mention of \"effective jolts\" also indicates a compelling production, but the lack of a clear recommendation and the limited text suggest a score in the lower end of the positive range.",
