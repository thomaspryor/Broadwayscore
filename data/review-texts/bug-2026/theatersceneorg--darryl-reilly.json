    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with 'awesome' and 'fierce revival' indicates positive recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires low confidence and upper-end scoring for clearly positive language. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the performances and describes the revival as 'fierce', indicating a positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances of the leads and describes the revival as \"fierce,\" indicating a positive assessment. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single available excerpt uses strong positive language ('awesome', 'fierce') to praise both the lead performances and the revival itself, indicating a clear recommendation at the higher end of the Positive range. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence must remain low due to potential cherry-picking.",
