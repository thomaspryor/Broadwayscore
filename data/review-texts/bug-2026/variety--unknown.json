  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Bug\" is as intimate as it is intense. The set, designed by Takeshi Kata, drops the audience right into this specific place and time. The lightning, helmed by Heather Gilbert, and the sound, spearheaded by Josh Schmidt, also keep the play tightly grounded, though the production may have worked even better in a smaller theater. Additionally, midway through Act II, there is a shocking set change that reveals just how deep into their psychosis Agnes and Peter have sunk. Moreover, amid Agnes and Peter's continued descent toward insanity, the story remains convincing because of the characters' obvious affection and mutual obsession. It's pretty apparent they are causing each other immense harm. However, their actions stem from a place of love, companionship, humor and understanding, which makes the tale especially heartbreaking.",

Single excerpt warning requires conservative scoring. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the production's intensity and convincing storytelling, despite some reservations about the theater size. The focus on the characters' depth and the emotional impact suggests a positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review highlights the production's strengths (set, lighting, sound) and the convincing portrayal of the characters' relationship, but suggests it might have been better in a smaller theater. This indicates a positive but not rave review.",
