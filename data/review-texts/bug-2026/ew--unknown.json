However, the 'skin-crawling effect' implies some level of discomfort, which may not appeal to all audiences, hence the recommendation with reservations. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the production positively, highlighting its ability to create tension and surprises, suggesting a recommendation, but the single excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation language keeps it in the lower end of the positive range.",
