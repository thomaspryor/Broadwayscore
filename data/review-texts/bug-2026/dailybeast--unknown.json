Coon and Smallwood's performances navigating this nightmare slalom are electric. The play, prophetically prescient as it may be, is not.",

This suggests a mixed reception, recognizing some positive aspects but not enough to fully recommend. | Gemini: The review praises the performances but ultimately states that the play itself 'is not', indicating a mixed assessment with some positive aspects but an overall lack of recommendation.",
