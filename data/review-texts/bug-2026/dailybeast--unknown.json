Coon and Smallwood's performances navigating this nightmare slalom are electric. The play, prophetically prescient as it may be, is not.",

The mixed signals suggest neither a strong recommendation nor a strong discouragement, placing it in the 'Mixed' bucket. | Gemini: The review praises the performances as 'electric' but ultimately states 'the play...is not,' indicating a mixed assessment with strong elements but an overall lack of recommendation.",
