  "dtliExcerpt": "Tracy Letts's grisly play receives its Broadway premiere via Steppenwolf and Manhattan Theatre Club.\n\nBeing a New Yorker and only in my late 30s, I've often said that my go-back-in-time shows would be from the early days of Chicago's Steppenwolf ensemble, when rising stars like Gary Sinise, John Malkovich, and Laurie Metcalf tore up the stage with volatile, brutally real acting choices that got your heart racing. I've been lucky enough to catch flashes of that electricity in the Big Apple—the thrillingly intense dinner scenes in\n\nA relic from Letts's angry-young-man era (the good old days of 1996),\n\nDirected by David Cromer, this revival opened at Steppenwolf just weeks before Covid shut the world down in 2020. Peter and Agnes were fringe figures way back then, strangers for us to collectively grimace at. In 2026, as we watch their fears gradually turn into convictions, as they find meaning in conspiracy because even their bodies can't be trusted anymore, it's impossible not to be personally devastated by the way they grasp for certainty in a world that offers none. They're not characters anymore; Peter and Agnes are our anti-vax uncle and birther grandma. Peter and Agnes are us.\n\nThat's one of the reasons Smallwood and Coon are so devastating to hang out with. Unassumingly dressed by Sarah Laux, they could be anyone you pass on the street. Playing a woman with a long-missing child living in constant fear of her ex's fist, Coon conveys with exacting precision how a lifetime spent asking \"why me\" can push someone to seek extravagant answers from whatever source seems most plausible, even if those answers are delusions. In her profoundly shattering turn, Coon makes Agnes's descent at the hands of Peter feel inevitable.\n\nSmallwood isn't the same kind of pistol as his stage-and-screen predecessor in the role, Michael Shannon, but his performance is no less fascinating, and for different reasons. Casting a Black actor in the part gives real credence to Peter's governmental paranoia, specifically when he invokes the country's\n\nThe authenticity extends to the supporting actors—live wires Engstrom, Key, and former Steppenwolf artistic director Randall Arney—and Cromer's creative team. Heather Gilbert's lighting and Josh Schmidt's especially unnerving soundscape are essential in conveying how things may truly go bump in the night, while Takeshi Kata creates a no-tell motel straight off the side of a country road, the kind you'd swear you'd pick up scabies just by staying in. Kata also provides a late-in-the-game, how'd-they-do-that scenic coup that's absolutely thrilling.\n\nThere are elements of Cromer’s staging that could be tightened—the opening scene could ignite more quickly, and the final moments would benefit from greater explosive sharpness. But that's just picking nits. Neither diminishes the way this production achieves\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.
