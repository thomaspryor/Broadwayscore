    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong positive language ('riveting', 'prescient timeliness') and praise for lead performances. Upper end of Positive range due to clearly positive tone, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'riveting' and highlights the strong performances of the lead actors, suggesting a highly positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is strongly positive, describing the show as a 'riveting psychological thriller' and praising the leads' chemistry. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a score in the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strongly positive evaluative language ('riveting', 'radiate', 'prescient timeliness') placing it in the upper Positive range, but confidence is low due to limited available text.",
