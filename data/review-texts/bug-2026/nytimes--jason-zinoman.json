  "fullText": "What does it feel like to fall down a rabbit hole?\n\nConsidering the number of people obsessed with cabals and cover-ups, there must be some comfort in conspiracy theories. A secret plot is less scary than the unknown. Listen to enough podcasts and you can tell that the paranoid mind-set can also evoke a sense of connection, some solace in a chaotic and lonely world.\n\nNo play this century dramatizes this better, and with as much twisted horror, as “Bug,” Tracy Letts’s nerve-rattling shocker whose eerily topical Broadway production stars a ferocious Carrie Coon as a waitress getting red-pilled.\n\nWhen it premiered in New York two decades ago at the intimate Barrow Street Theater, “Bug” played like a downtown freakout: a visceral, blood-soaked American gothic dominated by Michael Shannon’s breakthrough performance as the conspiracy theorist Peter, eyes flared as he scurried across the stage like an overgrown insect.\n\nThis new Manhattan Theater Club production, which opened Thursday at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, is more tender and balanced, with Namir Smallwood rendering Peter as a gentler, less alien figure. The focus has shifted to his romantic partner, Agnes (Coon), a desperate sad sack haunted by a loss in her past. In a superb performance, Coon provides the alpha energy this time, her eruptive anger masking an inner conflict worn on her weary face. The director David Cromer still delivers effective jolts, yet his production feels disturbingly closer to home.\n\n“Bug” may seem less outlandish now because the world has become more so, with once fringe theories of pedophile rings and deep state operations now the stuff of mundane political rhetoric and mainstream news. American life is so awash in fevered conspiracy theories that the play’s core dramatic question — How could someone fall for this madness? — seems more urgent than ever.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",
  "dtliExcerpt": "But what really holds this production together is Coon, an excitingly live-wire performer who sells the play’s hard-boiled poetry with conviction. “I just get sick of it, my lousy life, laundromats and grocery stores, dumb marriages and lost kids,” she says, making you feel her pain. She’s fed up and ready for something, anything new.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"It wants to make you scream and maybe chuckle to yourself about it, though its most disturbing suggestion is that the descent into conspiratorial thinking might feel a little like falling in love.\"",
