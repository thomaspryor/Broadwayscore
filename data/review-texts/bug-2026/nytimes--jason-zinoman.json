  "dtliExcerpt": "CRITIC'S PICK. This new Manhattan Theater Club production, which opened Thursday at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, is more tender and balanced, with Namir Smallwood rendering Peter as a gentler, less alien figure. The focus has shifted to his romantic partner, Agnes (Coon), a desperate sad sack haunted by a loss in her past. In a superb performance, Coon provides the alpha energy this time, her eruptive anger masking an inner conflict worn on her weary face. The director David Cromer still delivers effective jolts, yet his production feels disturbingly closer to home.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"It wants to make you scream and maybe chuckle to yourself about it, though its most disturbing suggestion is that the descent into conspiratorial thinking might feel a little like falling in love.\"",
