  "fullText": "Read our review of Bug, the Broadway premiere of Tracy Letts's 1996 psychological thriller, presented by Manhattan Theatre Club at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre. Call it a glow-down, and Carrie Coon rocks it. After seeing the Emmy and Tony Award nominee glammed up in the sumptuous TV shows The White Lotus and The Gilded Age, it’s a genuine treat to watch her walk on the seedy side — hitting a freebase pipe, no less — on Broadway in the wild but sometimes wobbly Bug. In this conspiracy theory-filled 1996 mind-bender by playwright Tracy Letts (August: Osage County), her real-life husband, Coon plays Agnes, a bone-deep lonely waitress with an abusive ex-husband Jerry (Steve Key) and a mystery surrounding her child. At lights up, Agnes stands in a grubby Oklahoma motel room gazing out the open door. Expecting someone? Aggie’s life changes when her friend R.C. (Jennifer Engstrom) drops by with a guy she just met, Peter (a riveting Namir Smallwood). A lost soul like Agnes, he and she click, then hit the sheets. Deeper feelings emerge when Peter, a Gulf War vet, claims the U.S. government has planted microscopic, parasitic aphids in his body to track and control him. Agnes buys his deluded tale and clings to it like a tick. By the time creepy Dr. Sweet (Randall Arney) arrives claiming to know all about the pair's troubles, disaster looms. Thrillers are rare specimens on Broadway, so director David Cromer’s production — cast intact from a 2020 run with Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago — is a welcome departure from typical living-room dramas. While bureaucratic espionage and broken people make for fertile, topical terrain, there are flies in Letts’s dramatic ointment. An uneventful first act wearies. Random banging and buzzing and long silent stretches don’t unsettle as presumably intended. And the notion that Agnes's loneliness is so extreme that it makes her susceptible to Peter's wild delusions strains credulity. It’s not like she’s shut off from society. We’re left to just go with it; how much that bugs you will vary. Amid crafty scenic metamorphoses, blood, violence, and pyrotechnics, the show’s most special effects are performances by Coon and Smallwood. They’ve etched their forsaken characters with impressive ache and intensity that sets off sparks as bright as any bug zapper. Lonely waitress Agnes, hiding from her abusive ex-husband in a motel, meets the drifter Peter, who convinces her they’re victims of a diabolical secret experiment. Fueled by drugs, alcohol, delusion, and paranoia, they spiral down a disturbing path from which there’s no coming back. Bug burrows into dark places, including Peter’s troubled mind. Along the way to an explosive conclusion, the conversation turns to notorious figures: serial killer Ted Bundy, Oklahoma bomber Tim McVeigh, and cult leader and mass murderer Jim Jones. At its core, Letts’s play explores intimacy that’s more than skin-deep. To underscore that idea, Agnes and Peter are naked during an extended scene. As such, you must power down and seal your cell phone in a provided Yondr pouch before entering the theatre. As of publication, the play has an 80% audience approval ranking on the review aggregator Show-Score. Theatregoers applauded the script, acting, and production.
