(that question mark did some very heavy lifting) positing that pretty much the entire history of human achievement can be credited to interventions of ancient, advanced aliens. A silly but far-reaching classic of conspiracy theories and paranoia, the book put the concept of alien-assisted pyramid-building and Stonehenge-erecting firmly into a Cold War culture primed for rabbit holes, gullibility and rejection of anything smacking of the sort of Establishment thinking that relied on little details like evidence and science. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article1-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid-article\",\"300x251\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[2,2],[300,250],[620,350],[300,251],[501,282],[3,3],[2,4],[4,2],[620,366]]) .exemptFromSleep() .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Related Stories News Deadline's Theater Critic Greg Evans Picks His Top 10 Broadway Shows Of 2025",
