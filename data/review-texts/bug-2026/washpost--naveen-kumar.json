  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessReview by  Naveen KumarNEW YORK — The distinction between truth and delusion has taken some tough blows in the digital age — from lying politicians, the internet, politicians lying on the internet — and that was before AI. But it used to be that for a conspiracy to spread, it had to take hold of a single mind and jump from person to person in the flesh.\n\n9 CommentsMost ReadOpinionMichael ShermerI’ve reported on UFO sightings for decades — and come to this conclusionJanuary 29, 2026Salvador RizzoDOJ misconduct complaint against D.C. federal judge dismissedEarlier todayOpinionEditorial BoardTrump’s tariffs can’t cover a bill this staggeringJanuary 26, 2026NewsletterFridaysBook ClubOur weekly selection of book reviews and recommendations from Book World editor Ron Charles.Sign up",

  "dtliExcerpt": "As Agnes, Coon is loose-limbed, quick-witted and frank, with a fragility that flits close to the surface. She’s magnificent onstage, returning to Broadway for the first time since Steppenwolf’s 2012 revival of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” (co-starring Letts, whom she married the next year). Though Agnes is lightly sketched around a formative trauma, Coon inhabits her with specificity and shattering intensity, as she’s engulfed in Peter’s twisted fears involving tiny bugs.",
