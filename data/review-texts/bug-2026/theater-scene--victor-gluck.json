    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt suggests the director's approach fundamentally changed the show's nature, which could be viewed as either positive or negative. The neutral tone and lack of clear evaluative language places this in Mixed territory, with low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a shift in tone from thriller to character study, which may not meet expectations for all audiences. The lack of clear praise or criticism indicates a mixed reception. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt limitation. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a shift in focus due to the direction, implying a deviation from expectations. This indicates a mixed reaction, as it's neither outright positive nor negative. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates a significant shift from thriller pacing to slower character-focused drama without clear praise for the result, suggesting the production may not satisfy genre expectations nor fully succeed as a drama.",
