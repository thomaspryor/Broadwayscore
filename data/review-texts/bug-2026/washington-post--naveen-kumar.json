  "fullText": "As Agnes, Coon is loose-limbed, quick-witted and frank, with a fragility that flits close to the surface. She’s magnificent onstage, returning to Broadway for the first time since Steppenwolf’s 2012 revival of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” (co-starring Letts, whom she married the next year). Though Agnes is lightly sketched around a formative trauma, Coon inhabits her with specificity and shattering intensity, as she’s engulfed in Peter’s twisted fears involving tiny bugs.",
