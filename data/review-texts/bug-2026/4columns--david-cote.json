  "bwwExcerpt": "A hardworking and very effective Coon is left to maintain dramatic tension. In her TV triumphs as plucky social climbers (The Gilded Age and The White Lotus), Coon’s fresh beauty and vivacious yet sensible vigor has elevated so-so scripts. She makes a smart and relatable protagonist either in nineteenth-century bustle or Thai resort muumuu.
