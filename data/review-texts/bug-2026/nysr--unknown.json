  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "When Bug was first seen Off-Broadway in 2004, it seemed prescient in its portrayal of mental illness and conspiracy theories. Now after the world has gone collectively crazy with wacky notions about COVID, pedophile rings, vaccines, and 5G, among countless other things Tracy Letts' play practically feels quaint. Receiving its Broadway premiere in a Manhattan Theatre Club production in association with Steppenwolf Theatre Company, it nonetheless remains a grippingly unnerving thriller that feels like a waking nightmare.",

Single excerpt warning requires conservative scoring within positive range. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the play's dated themes but ultimately describes it as a 'grippingly unnerving thriller,' suggesting a positive recommendation despite some reservations about its contemporary relevance. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the play's initial impact and notes its continued relevance, describing it as a \"grippingly unnerving thriller.\" This suggests a positive, though perhaps not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation.",
