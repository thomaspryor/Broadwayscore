  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Although Agnes and Peter sleep together early on, their relationship isn't primarily sexual. But there's an element of seduction to their whole dynamic, as Peter, at first reluctantly, gets under Agnes's skin. Letts is an actor as well as a playwrighthe and Coon, who are married, met while co-starring in a revival of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?and he knows how to craft scenes that keep performers intensely engaged with each other onstage. Smallwood and Coon, reprising their roles from the 2021 production of Bug at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre, strike a compelling balance. He arrives full of secrets that he gradually reveals; she arrives empty and eager to swallow them up, spiraling ever farther away from life beyond her room. (In several ways, this role is like the flip side of the steadfast mother Coon played so indelibly in Mary Jane.)",

However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of explicit recommendation, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the compelling performances and engaging dynamic between the actors, suggesting a positive experience. However, without the full review, it's difficult to gauge the overall recommendation strength, so I'm placing it in the lower end of the 'Positive' bucket.",
