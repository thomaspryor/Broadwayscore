  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Although Agnes and Peter sleep together early on, their relationship isn't primarily sexual. But there's an element of seduction to their whole dynamic, as Peter, at first reluctantly, gets under Agnes's skin. Letts is an actor as well as a playwrighthe and Coon, who are married, met while co-starring in a revival of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?and he knows how to craft scenes that keep performers intensely engaged with each other onstage. Smallwood and Coon, reprising their roles from the 2021 production of Bug at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre, strike a compelling balance. He arrives full of secrets that he gradually reveals; she arrives empty and eager to swallow them up, spiraling ever farther away from life beyond her room. (In several ways, this role is like the flip side of the steadfast mother Coon played so indelibly in Mary Jane.)",
