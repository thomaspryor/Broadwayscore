    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Pan) - using median score | Claude: The critic dismisses the show as merely 'a very expensive jukebox' rather than a proper theatrical work, which is clearly negative evaluation despite acknowledging some quality in the dancing. | GPT-4o: The review dismisses the production as lacking substance, comparing it unfavorably to a jukebox with little value beyond its cost. This indicates a strong negative assessment. | Gemini: The review explicitly compares the show to a jukebox, indicating a lack of substance and originality, leading to a negative classification. | Kimi: The reviewer fundamentally denies the production artistic legitimacy by refusing to classify it as a 'show,' instead dismissing it as a commercial 'jukebox,' though the extremely brief excerpt limits confidence in the overall assessment. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Pan",
