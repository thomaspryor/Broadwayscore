However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review highlights 'brilliant performances' and describes the play as a 'gripping real-life drama,' suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited text and single excerpt, a score in the middle of the 'Positive' bucket is appropriate.",
