    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance ('brilliant') and show ('captivating'), but single excerpt warning requires caution about full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Michael Stuhlbarg's performance and describes the drama as 'captivating,' suggesting a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"brilliant\" and \"captivating,\" suggesting a positive review. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the language pushes the score to the upper end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strong praise ('brilliant', 'captivating') for both the lead performance and the production itself, indicating a clear positive recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced though the language suggests solid enthusiasm.",
