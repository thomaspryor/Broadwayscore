However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review highlights a 'powerhouse performance' and describes the production as 'gripping' and full of 'tension and intelligence,' indicating a positive experience. However, due to the limited excerpt, a score in the middle of the 'Positive' range is appropriate.",
