  "fullText": "In Peter Morgan’s latest, cartoonish versions of the red-blooded Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky and his political puppet, Vladimir Putin, go head-to-head.\n\nGood evening, and welcome to Broadway News’ Broadway Review by Brittani Samuel — our overview of reactions, recommendations and information tied to tonight’s Broadway opening of “Patriots.”\n\nPeter Morgan’s “Patriots” is a mannish backroom play about the men who rose to power in post-Soviet Russia, particularly slick oligarch Boris Berezovsky (Michael Stuhlbarg) and his political puppet Vladimir Putin (Will Keen). The show blurs historical facts, figures and legitimate research with Morgan’s indulgent imaginings of how these men interacted. You can practically feel how drunk with excitement Morgan is over this type of brutish representation of historymakers — lots of fists banging on tables, slamming of landline telephones, shooing away hapless assistants and, of course, dismissing women. (Throughout the play, “Mother Russia” is the only woman to which either of the main characters shows respect.)",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review suggests the show has strong moments but criticizes it for trying too hard to be epic, indicating an uneven production with both strengths and weaknesses. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the show has moments of brilliance but also implies a struggle with its ambition. The use of 'shines when' indicates that there are positive aspects, but the need to 'release' suggests some reservations. The aggregator's 'flat' verdict supports a mixed classification. | Gemini: The review suggests the show is good when it focuses on complexity, implying it's worth seeing when it achieves this. The aggregator verdict of \"Flat\" suggests a lukewarm reception overall, so a score in the lower half of the Positive bucket is appropriate.",
