  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Peter Morgan, like a moth to the flame of spirited stateliness, can be relied upon to provide dramatized look behind diplomatic doors in one of two modes: dignified (The Queen, The Audience, the first few seasons of The Crown) and haute-trashy (The Other Boleyn Girl, the last few seasons of The Crown).

The tone is clearly negative, indicating disappointment with the production. | Gemini: The review highlights the playwright's tendency towards both dignified and \"haute-trashy\" approaches, but ultimately concludes that the play lacks direction, suggesting a mixed or neutral recommendation.",
