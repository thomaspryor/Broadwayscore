However, this is only one curated quote and may not represent the full review verdict, so I'm scoring conservatively within the negative range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the comedic elements of the show are not landing with the audience, which is a significant issue for a production that relies on humor. The lack of laughter indicates a failure to engage the audience, leading to a negative assessment. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the comedic elements of the play are not landing well with the audience, indicating a mixed reception. The silence following jokes suggests a lack of engagement or enjoyment.",
