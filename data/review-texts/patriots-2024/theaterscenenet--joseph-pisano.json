    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The word 'kitschy' is clearly pejorative when describing a serious political drama, suggesting poor directorial choices. However, this is only one excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the staging as 'kitschy vaudeville,' which suggests a stylized and potentially divisive approach. Without additional context, it's unclear if this is meant positively or negatively, leading to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is negative, describing the staging as a \"kitschy vaudeville show,\" which suggests a lack of seriousness or quality. Given the limited information, I am scoring it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: The single curated excerpt describes the staging as 'kitschy' and 'vaudeville,' implying a trivialized or overly flashy treatment of the material that may undermine the drama, but without the full review context, the overall recommendation remains unclear. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",
