  "fullText": "Peter Morgan's new play Patriots, now on Broadway, opens with an awareness of its audience. \"In the West you have no idea,\" Boris Berezovksy (an excellent Michael Stuhlbarg) says through a voiceover. \"You think of Russia as a cold, bleak place, full of hardship and cruelty.\" The stage is bare, and the oligarch, who played an instrumental role in Vladimir Putin's rise to power, speaks to us from a liminal space. He goes on to describe the beauty of his country, Russian music, the sounds of children laughing in the streets and the taste of ice cream on a cold day.\n\nWhen the stage comes into view (set design by Miriam Buether, lighting design by Jack Knowles), it's 1955. Berezovsky is a schoolboy gifted in mathematics. A teacher urges his parents — congenial and full of quips — to push their son. \"Anyone can be a doctor, Mrs. Berezovsky,\" says the teacher played by Jeff Biehl, as if pleading. \"Only the elite can be a mathematician. It's like entering the gates of heaven.\"",
