  "bwwExcerpt": "By great good fortune it is also possible to see the same thing happen right now in Denzel Washington's filmed version of 'Fences,' a play that is part of the same cycle. Neither should be missed. In both, fathers and sons wrestle with ruthlessness and rebellion; in both, the outside world has left its scars, but decisions by individuals determine their fates.",
