  "bwwExcerpt": "The Broadway debut of August Wilson's Jitney by Manhattan Theatre Club is that very rare thing - a play that ought to be longer. Ruben Santiago-Hudson's production runs two and a half hours and uses the whole of the published text. But the immersion in these characters and their world is so closely woven and complete that when the final line peals out, it's hard not to wish for another act, another scene, another ride.",
