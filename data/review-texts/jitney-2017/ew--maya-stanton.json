  "bwwExcerpt": "The talented cast soars under the confident direction of Tony-winner Ruben Santiago-Hudson, in his first turn at the helm of a Broadway production. His familiarity with Wilson's oeuvre - both as a performer and as the artistic director for New York Public Radio's unprecedented recording of all 10 plays in 2013 - serves him well, and other than a lighting flourish that seems out of step with the rest of the production, he offers a straightforward interpretation of the material.",
