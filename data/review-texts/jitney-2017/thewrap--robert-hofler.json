  "bwwExcerpt": "Finally, August Wilson's 'Jitney' makes it to Broadway in a powerful, if uneven, new staging at MTC's Samuel J. Friedman Theatre, where it opened Thursday. Until now, 'Jitney' had been the only one of Wilson's Pittsburgh Cycle plays not to have appeared on Broadway, even though it was the first he wrote, in 1979. Has any great writer delivered a more accomplished first play?",
