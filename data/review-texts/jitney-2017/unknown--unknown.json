  "showScoreExcerpt": "Conversation sings and swings, bends and bounces and hits heaven smack in the clouds, in the glorious new production of August Wilson’s 'Jitney'...Acted by an impeccably tuned ensemble...There’s no way a theatergoer can watch 'Jitney' without feeling the pulsing, defiant aliveness of every character onstage...Conversation becomes performance art, and part of the pleasure of watching this peerless cast is the delight its characters take in listening to the others riffing.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Rhapsodic language with superlatives ('glorious', 'peerless', 'impeccably tuned') and vivid praise. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly enthusiastic language ('glorious', 'peerless cast', 'pulsing, defiant aliveness') indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language such as \"glorious new production\", \"impeccably tuned ensemble\", and \"pulsing, defiant aliveness\". Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt features unambiguous superlatives ('glorious,' 'peerless,' 'impeccably tuned') and promises profound emotional impact, but confidence is low given this is a single curated excerpt that may not reflect the full review's context or reservations. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
