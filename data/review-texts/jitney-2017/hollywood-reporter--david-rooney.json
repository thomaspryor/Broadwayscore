  "bwwExcerpt": "Is there a more accomplished living interpreter of the plays of August Wilson than Ruben Santiago-Hudson? As both actor and director, his deep connection to the dramatist's work has gone from strength to strength in recent years, consolidated further in this gorgeous production for Manhattan Theatre Club of Jitney, the last of Wilson's 10-part chronicle of African-American experience in the 20th century to be staged on Broadway. With the broader exposure to the late playwright's unique voice currently being garnered by Denzel Washington's film of Fences, the timing feels ideal to revisit his inimitably pulsating world - simultaneously mythic and grounded in everyday grit, sorrow and joy - with a peerless company of actors.",
