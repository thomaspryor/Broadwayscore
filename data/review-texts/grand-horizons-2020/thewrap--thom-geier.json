Just months after staging Tracy Letts’ genial comedy “Linda Vista,” Second Stage has mounted Bess Wohl’s broadly entertaining “Grand Horizons.”",

However, due to the truncated nature of the text, the final verdict might be missing, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review calls the show \"broadly entertaining\" which indicates a positive, but not rave, review. The text is truncated, so confidence is low. | Kimi: The review describes the production as 'broadly entertaining' and favorably compares it to the theater's previous 'genial' hit, indicating a solid recommendation despite the truncated text cutting off the full verdict.",
