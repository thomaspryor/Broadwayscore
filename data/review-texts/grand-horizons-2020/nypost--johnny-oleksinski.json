    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Clear mixed assessment - acknowledges strong lead performances but states the show 'never quite finds its footing,' indicating fundamental problems despite good acting. | GPT-4o: The review indicates that the show fails to find its footing, suggesting a lack of overall success despite strong performances. This leads to a negative verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges strong performances but states the comedy 'never quite finds its footing,' indicating a mixed or neutral assessment. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states the show 'never quite finds its footing,' indicating fundamental creative failure, even while acknowledging the quality of the lead performances. This qualifies as a non-recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
