  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "This production isn't exactly cracking the material open in any new way, but soars in one particular aspect: the friendship between its leads. Reeves and Winter are old friends playing old friends and their dynamic oozes fondness and longfelt frustration. The love and safety that Didi and Gogo find in one another is so endearing."
