However, due to the text quality warning and limited context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"simply stunning,\" indicating a rave review. However, due to the truncated text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt employs superlatives including 'simply stunning' and 'laser-focused,' indicating an enthusiastic endorsement of this Broadway revival despite the limited available text.",

  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Mary Jane is clear-eyed, compassionate, and leavened with humor. Herzog (4000 Miles, 2023's Broadway adaptation of A Doll's House) is known for her fine-tuned, lived-in dialogue. Director Anne Kauffman's cast breathe life into the script beautifully."
