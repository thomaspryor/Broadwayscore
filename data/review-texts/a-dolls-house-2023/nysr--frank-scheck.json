That approach is a particular specialty of Lloyd’s, who apparently feels that such things as costumes, scenery, and lighting that’s bright enough to discern which actors are speaking, are simply too bourgeois. Instead, we’re supposed to concentrate on the text, the text, the text, which would be fine if you were attending an Actors Studio wo",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic criticizes the director for prioritizing flashy effects over the play's substance, suggesting the production undermines the material. However, this is only one excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the directorial choice distracts from the play's intended impact. This implies a mixed reception, focusing more on the director's cleverness than the play's message. With only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that a directorial choice detracts from the play's message, suggesting a negative experience. Given that this is the only excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes a specific directorial choice as distracting and self-indulgent, undermining the play's emotional impact. However, as a single curated excerpt, it may not capture the full verdict or redeeming qualities of the production. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",
