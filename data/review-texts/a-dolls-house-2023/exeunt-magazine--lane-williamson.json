    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear appreciation for multiple elements (writing, performances), but limited text and cherry-picked nature requires caution. Sounds positive but not enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights appreciation for the revival, specifically praising Herzog's writing and the performances of Chastain and Moayed. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the writing and the performances of the leads, suggesting a positive experience. However, as it is a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unreserved praise for the writing and lead performances ('so much to appreciate'), indicating a clearly positive verdict. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced per instructions.",
