  "showScoreExcerpt": "It’s too tempting to mock this austere version of Ibsen’s play as Broadway’s answer to the movie that just swept the Oscars. Call it: Nothing Nowhere With No Intermission!... Yet…there are two main reasons I was happy to have attended director Jamie Lloyd’s often off-putting production — playwright Amy Herzog’s refreshingly idiomatic rewrite of the usual stodgy translations from Ibsen’s Norwegian, and Jessica Chastain’s performance in the last fifteen minutes\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic calls the production 'often off-putting' and opens with mockery, but finds two specific reasons to be 'happy to have attended' (Herzog's adaptation and Chastain's performance). This suggests a qualified, mixed response rather than a clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt acknowledges positive elements like Herzog's rewrite and Chastain's performance but describes the production as 'often off-putting'. The tone suggests a mixed reception with specific highlights. | Gemini: The review seems mixed, noting that the production is \"often off-putting\" but praising the rewrite and Chastain's performance. Due to the truncated text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows qualified recommendation: critic finds production 'often off-putting' and 'austere' but was 'happy to have attended' due to Herzog's rewrite and Chastain's performance, warranting mild Positive score.",
