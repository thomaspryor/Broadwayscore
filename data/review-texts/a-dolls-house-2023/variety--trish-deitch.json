    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the revival's 'beautiful, spacious clarity' which suggests appreciation and recommendation, but as a single curated quote it may not represent the full verdict, warranting lower confidence and mid-range Positive scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a positive assessment of the revival's clarity and impact, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language like \"beautiful\" and \"clarity,\" suggesting a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive tone warrants a score on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the production's interpretive clarity and aesthetic qualities ('beautiful, spacious clarity'), warranting a score in the upper Positive range per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts. However, confidence is low due to the curated, truncated nature of the available text.",
