    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls the revival 'inventive' and 'sturdy' with a 'theatrical and surprising' finale, but the qualifier 'unfurnished' suggests reservations. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the revival as 'inventive' and 'theatrical and surprising,' suggesting a positive view. However, the phrase 'sturdy, although unfurnished' implies some reservations. Given the single excerpt and text quality warning, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review calls the revival \"inventive\" and the finale \"theatrical and surprising\", but also describes it as \"unfurnished\", suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I am placing it in the middle of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic praises the revival as 'inventive' and 'theatrical' with a 'surprising' finale, but the 'unfurnished' caveat suggests significant reservations. 'Sturdy' indicates solid craftsmanship without enthusiasm, placing this in the lower Positive range.",
