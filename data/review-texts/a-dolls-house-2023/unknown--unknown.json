However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the dialogue's effectiveness and clarity, suggesting a strong positive impression. The 'CRITIC'S PICK' designation further indicates a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the dialogue as being direct and impactful, suggesting a positive assessment of the adaptation. However, due to the limited text available, confidence is low. | Kimi: The 'Critic's Pick' designation and praise for Herzog's lean, effective adaptation ('pared away,' 'raw and red') indicate a strong recommendation for this production, though the limited excerpt warrants low confidence.",
