  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Broadway rookie Reeves (The Matrix, John Wick) shelves his surfer-dude charm to evoke melancholy as a man motoring on anxiety. He gamely throws himself around the set like a rag doll. Winter, who acted on Broadway as a kid in Peter Pan and The King and I, brings an impressive gravity as the deep-thinking Didi, who's prone to contemplative dives.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes committed performances from both leads with appreciative language ('gamely throws himself', 'impressive gravity'). However, as only one curated quote, this may not represent the full review sentiment, so scored at lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights positive aspects of the performances by Reeves and Winter, suggesting a favorable view of their contributions. However, the single excerpt and lack of a full review text lead to a low confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the performances of Reeves and Winter, suggesting a positive experience, but the lack of a clear overall verdict and the single excerpt warrant a lower confidence and a score in the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for both lead performances, noting Reeves' effective dramatic turn and Winter's 'impressive gravity,' indicating a recommendation based on acting quality. However, as a single curated excerpt with no broader show context, confidence must remain low.",
