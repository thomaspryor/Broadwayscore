    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the director's \"bold, fearless\" choices and affirms the production's success in highlighting Ibsen's timelessness. However, this is only one curated excerpt, so confidence is low and the score reflects strong positive language without full context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the director's choices as 'bold' and 'fearless', suggesting a strong positive impression of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the directorial choices as bold and fearless, emphasizing the timelessness of the play. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper range of positive, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the director's bold, fearless choices and validates the production's approach to the classic material, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty.",
