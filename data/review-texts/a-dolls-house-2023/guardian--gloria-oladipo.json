  "fullText": "The Oscar winner makes for an exceptional Nora in a visually muted yet emotionally effective remount of Ibsen’s classic drama Gone is the elaborate 19th-century home. Gone are the time-specific corsets and floor-length petticoats. In Jamie Lloyd’s minimalist reimagining of A Doll’s House lies a new iteration of the seminal classic. The latest remount follows Ibsen’s original formula. Nora Helmer (Jessica Chastain), an infantilized housewife, fraudulently borrows money from disgraced banker Krogstad (Okieriete Onaodowan). Krogstad threatens to expose Nora’s secret unless she can secure his job at the bank with her husband Torvald (Arian Moayed), who was recently promoted. But now Nora and those who occupy her universe wear modern-day clothing. On the simple, rotating set (designed by Soutra Gilmour), the only props are wooden chairs. A singular projection reminds us that it is indeed 1879. In some ways, it feels disappointing to lose the visual fullness of Ibsen’s world. Despite it being Christmastime in the Helmer house, a plentiful one at that, staples such as presents or sweets are discussed but never shown. The facade of Nora’s life that is typically in play are dissolved onto a minimalist slate. But in this muted revival, adapted by Amy Herzog, the modernization emphasizes the legitimacy of Nora’s life and what she can control. Nora is not just a mother, or just a wife. Under Lloyd’s direction, Chastain emphasizes the responsibility and reverence of these identities that Nora firmly grasps, the real grief that swallows her when she fears she has corrupted it all. In the play’s preamble, Chastain sits stone-faced as she is rotated by the moving set. Akin to a figurine in a music box, Nora lives trapped under the watchful eye of others. But Nora remains at the center and in control, able to carve out agency in a world that relishes in its thievery. With a lobbed compliment to her husband, Nora woos him into giving Kristine (Jesmille Darbouze) a job. Nora maintains individual and tender relations, particularly with the dying Dr Rank (Michael Patrick Thornton) or the family’s nanny Anne-Marie (Tasha Lawrence). Nora thrashes to hold her husband’s attention during a feverish dance scene, choreography that becomes increasingly sinister given Chastain’s enthralling performance. “I am a human being, just like you are,” proclaims Nora. Chastain is captivating as Nora, providing a robust understanding of Nora’s inner life beyond the cruelty she suffers. Chastain fully understands the various pieces that make up Nora: her humor, wit and (at times) incomprehension. A fuller, infinite portrait is painted of the long-time heroine through Chastain’s work. Some aspects of the modernization misfire. Lloyd’s version feel slackened in its finale, as Nora realize just how her husband (and recently departed father) view her. Nora’s decision to leave – and eventual departure – thuds along, despite Herzog’s adaption remained tenuous throughout. Race is a current in Lloyd’s revival, with Krogstad and Kristine played by people of color. The play nudges at that acknowledgement, specifically underlined in Krogstad’s mistreatment by his white associates and Nora warning Christine that Krogstad will “hurt” her (a white Nora assuming that Krogstad, a Black man, is capable of violence). But the reality of racism is treated as a point of view that Krogstad and Christine share, versus an operating framework the characters live in. Kristine’s independent arc is still sidelined in Herzog’s adaption. Darbouze delivers a tender performance, particularly in moments of kinship with Krogstad. But Kristine remains largely relegated as a tool for Nora’s self-actualization. Like much of white feminism, her own desires are swept in the storm of Nora’s needs. Amid the hangups, all members of the cast excel. Lloyd delivers an ensemble worthy of taking on Ibsen’s masterwork. Moayed intensely spotlights the casual cruelty in Torvald. Skating between sweet quips and eager putdowns, his portrayal emphasizes the disparate nature of violence. Onaodowan is magnetic as Krogstad, bringing a quiet pain and dignity to a character usually colored in blind rage. Thornton and Lawrence, despite brief appearances, are evocative and moving. Thornton embraces a needed curtness and humor as Rand’s life comes to an end, keying into a love for Nora that is part erotic and part protective. Lawrence acts as an essential parallel to Nora’s motherhood, bringing a sensitivity and love to her moments with Nora. Overall, Lloyd’s interpretation strips the work to its bones, but still keeps Nora intact. We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could support the Guardian at this crucial time for journalism in the US. In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year into his second term, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one. From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump returned to office. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced. While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts. While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel. Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less. But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, we’ll show you far fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you for protecting the free press. Thanks for this thoughtful review, this production appears to be one of those \"updates\" that work well, not easy to achieve. Wishing now I lived in New York so I could see it live, not merely read about it, but I don't, so thanks again for providing at least a glimpse of it all! The last production of A Doll's House that I saw was in modern dress. Thorwald and Nora were living in a suburban house. The climactic scene took place outdoors, and I suppose in October, because at the finale, Nora picked up a leaf-blower and aimed it at her husband, exclaiming, \"I am leafing you, Thorwald!\"",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the excellent performances of the cast, particularly highlighting Lloyd, Moayed, and Onaodowan. While there's a mention of 'hangups,' the overall tone is positive due to the strong emphasis on the actors' portrayals. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the cast and direction, describing performances as 'magnetic' and the ensemble as worthy of Ibsen's material, though the mention of 'hangups' suggests minor reservations. As a single clearly positive excerpt, it scores in the 80-84 range per instructions.",
