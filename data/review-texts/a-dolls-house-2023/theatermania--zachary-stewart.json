    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the acting quality with 'indestructible' suggesting durability and excellence, but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the acting and suggests the production is strong enough to withstand directorial choices, indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The quote praises the acting and suggests the play is good despite potential issues. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic employs the superlative 'indestructible' and praises the acting highly, indicating strong endorsement, though the reference to 'directorial gimmicks' suggests minor reservations.",
