  "bwwExcerpt": "It’s worth noting that linguists generally translate Ibsen’s title — “Et dukkehjem” — as “A Dollhouse” instead of “A Doll’s House.” The prison isn’t just Nora’s; she and Torvald are equally trapped in it. My only real quibble with this compelling, surgically precise revival is that it doesn’t seem to be interested in preserving that unity: in keeping our sympathy for both characters as balanced as Ibsen evidently intended. When the astonishing curtain coup finally comes, you should feel his loss",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Calls the revival 'compelling, surgically precise' with only one 'real quibble.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential for cherry-picking positive language from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the revival as 'compelling, surgically precise' but notes a quibble about character balance. The positive tone suggests a recommendation, though with some reservations. | Gemini: The review calls the revival \"compelling\" and \"surgically precise,\" but expresses a reservation about its interpretation of Ibsen's intent. This suggests a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('compelling,' 'surgically precise,' 'astonishing') with a single specific criticism about character sympathy balance, indicating a clear positive recommendation despite reservations.",
