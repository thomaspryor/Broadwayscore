  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Their finely tuned performances are unshowy and completely in service of the production. They're neither vaudevillians clowning for our enjoyment nor thespians hamming up each ponderous line. Reeves and Winters' work is quiet and grounded entirely in their genuine chemistry. When they share a quick hug at the top of Act 2, after a whole day of waiting has come and gone fruitlessly, it reveals a profound knowledge that they can find comfort in each other.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for the lead performances with terms like 'finely tuned,' 'genuine chemistry,' and 'profound.' However, this is only one excerpt from a larger review, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances as 'finely tuned' and 'quiet and grounded,' indicating a positive view of the actors' work. However, without a full review or clear verdict, the confidence is low, and the score reflects a mild positive sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the positive performances, describing them as 'finely tuned' and 'completely in service of the production,' indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead actors' chemistry and restrained performances, describing them as 'finely tuned' and 'grounded.' As a single curated excerpt, confidence is low but the tone is clearly positive.",
