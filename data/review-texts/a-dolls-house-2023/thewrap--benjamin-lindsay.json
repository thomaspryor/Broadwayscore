Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt criticizes the direction as a 'parody of minimalism' and describes the set as 'not really a set,' indicating a negative view. However, it acknowledges the music and Chastain's performance positively. The single excerpt and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Chastain's performance but strongly criticizes the direction and minimalist staging, suggesting an overall negative experience. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic praises Jessica Chastain's performance and the music but heavily criticizes the direction as 'a parody of minimalism' and dismisses the set design, suggesting the production fails to support its assets. Limited to a single truncated excerpt, the overall verdict appears negative but confidence is reduced.",
