The metaphor of 'all bones, no flesh' suggests a lack of substance, indicating a negative impression. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates that the production has been stripped of its power and leaves the audience with only the bare bones of the play, suggesting a negative experience. | Kimi: The critic condemns the director for scrubbing away action and interaction, reducing the play's power to move the audience and leaving it lifeless. As only a single excerpt is available, confidence is low.",
