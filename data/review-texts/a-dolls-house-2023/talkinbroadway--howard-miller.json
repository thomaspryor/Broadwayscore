  "bwwExcerpt": "Many undoubtedly will want to attend A Doll's House in order to see Jessica Chastain's performance. Some will be intrigued by the subject matter or will be interested in this variation on a theme by Ibsen. Regardless, it is difficult to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the heavy-handedness of the production. Frankly, I'd rather see a revival of Lucas Hnath's funny and cleverly conceived 'sequel,' A Doll's House, Part 2.",

With only one excerpt available, the full verdict is unclear, warranting low confidence and mixed scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges Jessica Chastain's draw but criticizes the production's heavy-handedness, indicating a mixed reception. The lack of full context and single excerpt warning suggest caution. | Gemini: The excerpt acknowledges the draw of Jessica Chastain's performance but expresses feeling overwhelmed by the production's heavy-handedness, suggesting a mixed experience. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges the draw of Jessica Chastain's performance but delivers a specific criticism of the production as 'heavy-handed,' suggesting significant reservations without fully discouraging attendance.",
