  "bwwExcerpt": "Lloyd mostly surrounds Chastain with dry, sympathetic performances. Michael Patrick Thornton, a highlight of last year’s Macbeth, plays Nora’s pining confidant, the sickly Dr. Rake, with an affecting mix of Weltschmerz and good humor. Okieriete Onaodowan brings low-key decency and desperation to the role of her secret loan shark and potential blackmailer, and Jesmille Darbouze is believably hard-nosed as her widowed friend; Tasha Lawrence has a sharp scene as the nursemaid who gave up her own ch",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt focuses entirely on praising the supporting performances with specific positive descriptors like 'highlight,' 'affecting,' and 'believably.' However, this is a single curated excerpt that appears cut off mid-sentence, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of the supporting cast, describing them as 'sympathetic' and 'affecting'. However, without a clear verdict or more context, the positive tone is mild. The single excerpt and lack of full review text necessitate a low confidence rating. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on praising the performances of the supporting cast. While it doesn't give an overall verdict, the positive tone suggests a recommendation, albeit with reservations due to the limited text available. | Kimi: The excerpt offers warm, specific praise for multiple cast members ('affecting,' 'believably hard-nosed,' 'sharp scene') indicating a solid recommendation based on acting quality. However, as a single curated excerpt with no broader verdict visible, confidence is reduced.",
