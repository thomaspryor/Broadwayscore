    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises both lead performances as 'beautiful' and 'revelatory' with lasting impact, but limited text and no clear overall show recommendation makes this a cautious positive score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances, particularly highlighting Winter as 'revelatory' and memorable. The tone suggests a positive impression, but the single excerpt limits the confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises both actors, but implies Winter's performance is more memorable. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for both lead performances ('suffers beautifully', 'revelatory', 'will haunt you'), indicating a strong recommendation. However, limited to a single curated quote, the score reflects the upper Positive range rather than a full Rave.",
