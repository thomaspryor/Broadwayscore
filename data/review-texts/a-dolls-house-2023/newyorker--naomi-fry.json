    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt focuses on praising Chastain's performance as 'exhilarating to watch' but lacks broader show evaluation. Given excerpt-only limitation and performance-focused praise, scored at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Chastain's performance and describes the journey as 'exhilarating to watch,' suggesting a strong positive impression. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the lead performance and the character's journey as \"painful and exhilarating to watch,\" which suggests a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Chastain's performance using enthusiastic language ('exhilarating to watch'), placing it in the upper Positive range. However, confidence is low given this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's verdict on the complete production.",
