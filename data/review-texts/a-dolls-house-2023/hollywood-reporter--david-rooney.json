When she steps out of the Helmer home and quite literally into the 21st century in this boldly conceived, commandingly acted production, it’s both shattering and exhilarating.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('boldly conceived', 'commandingly acted', 'exhilarating') indicates enthusiastic recommendation. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'boldly conceived' and 'commandingly acted,' with a strong emotional impact ('shattering and exhilarating'). These superlatives suggest a highly positive assessment, placing it in the Rave bucket despite the limited context. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"boldly conceived\", \"commandingly acted\", \"shattering and exhilarating\", indicating a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's concept and performances, describing it as 'shattering and exhilarating,' though the single excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
