However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation - the full review verdict is unknown. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Chastain's performance as 'fierce and nuanced' and highlights the fresh energy brought to the classic, indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Chastain's performance as both fierce and nuanced, suggesting a strong positive assessment. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the content is strongly positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance and the production's handling of the material, indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited context.",
