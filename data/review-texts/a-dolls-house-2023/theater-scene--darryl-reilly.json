    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language praising multiple elements (performance, direction, adaptation, finale) with clear recommendation language ('stimulating and memorable theatrical event'). Single excerpt warning suggests caution, but tone is clearly enthusiastic positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the performance, direction, adaptation, and production, indicating a highly positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the performance, direction, adaptation, and finale. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I'm scoring it high in the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for multiple production elements including an 'awesome' lead performance, 'vivid' direction, and 'memorable' overall experience. However, as only a single curated excerpt is available, the score reflects the upper range of Positive (80-84) per instructions, with confidence set to low due to potential cherry-picking.",
