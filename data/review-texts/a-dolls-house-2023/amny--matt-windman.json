  "bwwExcerpt": "Here, Lloyd has foregone all period detail and removed traditional production elements (including set and costumes, revealing the theater’s multilevel backstage area) and bits of staging in order to produce a seamless, direct, and fresh reexamination of the play. Although originally written in three acts, it is presented without intermission and runs exactly two hours.",

Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive take on the production's fresh reexamination of the play, but without more context, the confidence is low. I am scoring it as positive, but with reservations. | Kimi: Single excerpt uses clearly positive evaluative language ('seamless,' 'direct,' 'fresh') to praise the directorial approach, warranting the upper Positive range per the excerpt warning.",
