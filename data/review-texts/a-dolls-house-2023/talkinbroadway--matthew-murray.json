    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows praise for lead performance but significant criticism of production choices and overall theatrical value. The 'but' construction and 'event vs genuine experience' distinction suggests reservations outweigh positives. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Huppert's performance but criticizes the production for prioritizing spectacle over substance. The mixed tone suggests neither a strong recommendation nor a strong discouragement, fitting the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a magnetic performance but criticizes the production's emphasis on spectacle over substance, leading to a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation result in low confidence. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
