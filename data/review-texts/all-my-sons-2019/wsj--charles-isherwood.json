However, the phrase \"can sometimes feel overly schematic in lesser productions\" suggests a slight reservation. | Kimi: The critic uses strong commendatory language ('sterling,' 'welcome clarity,' 'emotional force') to praise this revival, distinguishing it from weaker productions. The unambiguous positive evaluation places it in the upper Positive range, though the extreme brevity suggests this may be an excerpt.",
