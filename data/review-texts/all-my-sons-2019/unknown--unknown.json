She also has terrific technique...But the opacity of the production overall means we still can’t read her with any clarity, and the play acquires a weird wobble at its core...The production is almost never moving, except when Ann’s brother, George, shows up intending to expose everyone’s lies.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Review criticizes the production as 'literal-minded', 'not resonant', having 'opacity' and 'weird wobble at its core', and being 'almost never moving'. While praising Bening's performance and technique, the overall assessment is clearly negative about the production's effectiveness. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the production for lacking resonance and clarity, with only isolated praise for Bening's performance. The overall tone suggests a negative impression, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review criticizes the production as \"literal-minded\" and \"opaque,\" resulting in a lack of clarity and a \"weird wobble.\" While praising Bening's performance, the overall assessment is negative. | Kimi: While praising Annette Bening's 'terrific technique,' the critic finds the production 'literal-minded' and opaque, creating a 'weird wobble at its core' and ultimately judging it 'almost never moving' with no resonant case for the drama today.",
