She also has terrific technique...But the opacity of the production overall means we still can’t read her with any clarity, and the play acquires a weird wobble at its core...The production is almost never moving, except when Ann’s brother, George, shows up intending to expose everyone’s lies.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite praising Bening's individual performance and technique, the critic finds the production 'literal-minded' and 'not resonant,' with 'opacity' that creates 'a weird wobble at its core' and is 'almost never moving.' The overall assessment is clearly negative. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt criticizes the production for lacking resonance and clarity, and describes it as almost never moving. Praise for Bening's technique is overshadowed by the overall negative tone regarding the production's impact. | Gemini: The review criticizes the production as literal-minded and opaque, causing a \"weird wobble\" at its core. While praising Bening's performance, the overall assessment is negative. | Kimi: While praising Annette Bening's technique, the critic finds the production opaque and failing to make a resonant case for the drama today, calling it 'almost never moving' with a 'weird wobble at its core.'",
