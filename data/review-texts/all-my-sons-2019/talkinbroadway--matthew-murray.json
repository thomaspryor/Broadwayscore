However, the lack of superlatives or strong enthusiasm suggests some reservations. | Gemini: The review praises the production and direction, highlighting the performances of the stars. It captures the essence of the drama, indicating a positive assessment. | Kimi: The review offers clear praise for the direction, fidelity to the source material, and performances, describing the production as 'handsome' and the casting as 'tailor-made' for the stars.",
