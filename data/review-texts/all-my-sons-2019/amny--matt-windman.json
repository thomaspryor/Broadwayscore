  "bwwExcerpt": ": Directed by three-time Tony winner Jack O'Brien ('Hairspray,' 'Henry IV,' 'The Coast of Utopia'), this revival gets to the heart of Miller's writing and brings out increasingly intense and layered performances, making for highly compelling and confrontational theater. Period costumes, an extensive exterior set design and video projections between scenes further enrich a fine production.",
