    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'compelling from start to finish' with 'stellar performances' from marquee stars. Single excerpt limitation prevents higher confidence, but the language suggests enthusiastic recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'compelling from start to finish' and highlights 'stellar performances,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the phrase \"compelling from start to finish\" and highlights \"stellar performances\", indicating a positive review. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers enthusiastic praise using words like 'compelling' and 'stellar,' indicating a strong recommendation. Per guidelines for clearly positive single excerpts, this falls in the upper Positive range (80-84).",
