  "bwwExcerpt": "A thrilling cast rise to the challenge of making this entirely believable, fraught and eventually scorching. As matriarch Kate, Annette Bening is devastating as well as devastated: a woman clinging to hope, despite knowing in her heart that it is hopeless. And Tracy Letts -- who is also a playwright who wrote the Tony and Pulitzer Prize-winning August: Osage County -- is equally superb as a man consumed by his secrets.",

The tone is strongly positive, suggesting a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"thrilling\", \"entirely believable\", \"devastating\", and \"superb\", indicating a positive review. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the performances ('devastating', 'superb') and describes the production as 'scorching' and 'entirely believable', indicating a clear positive verdict despite limited available text.",
