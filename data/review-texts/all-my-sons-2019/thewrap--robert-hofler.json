  "fullText": "After all the Donald Trump references in recent plays, it’s refreshing to see an actor and director go back to another administration for their hit job.\n\nIn the new revival of Arthur Miller’s “All My Sons,” which opened Monday at the Roundabout’s American Airlines Theatre, Tracy Letts delivers a Dick Cheney who’s every bit as terrifying as Christian Bale’s in “Vice” — but without the need of all those prosthetics.",

  "promptVersion": "5.2.0",
  "bwwExcerpt": "But O'Brien creates two interracial families for the Miller drama, set in an otherwise realistically depicted 1947, without comment. Since 'All My Sons' is an indictment of capitalism, it's odd to have a byproduct of that economic system as practiced in the United States simply ignored here. This revival acts as if racism didn't exist among these kinds of characters at that time, which isn't that far away from Joe Keller's attitude regarding his crime.",
