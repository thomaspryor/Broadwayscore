    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise ('pleasure,' 'well-executed,' 'done right') but qualifier 'for the first half anyway' suggests reservations about the full production. Given single excerpt warning and qualified praise, scoring at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the traditional execution and the pleasure of the first half, suggesting a positive view, but the limited context and single excerpt warrant a cautious, low-confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive experience, particularly in the first half, praising the traditional execution. However, the limited text and the phrase \"for the first half anyway\" suggest some reservations, leading to a score in the lower-middle of the Positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the production's competent execution of theatrical tradition, but the limitation to 'the first half' and emphasis on conventionality rather than innovation suggest a mild, reserved recommendation.",
