    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it a 'stellar, harrowing production' and connects it to Miller's enduring legacy. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is reduced despite the clearly positive language. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('stellar', 'harrowing') suggesting a highly favorable view of the production. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"stellar\" to describe the production, and notes that it reinforces the reasons Miller's works endure. This is a strong positive statement, so I scored it as a high positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise using words like 'stellar' and emphasizes the production's emotional power and relevance, though the single-excerpt limitation warrants conservative scoring within the Positive bucket.",
