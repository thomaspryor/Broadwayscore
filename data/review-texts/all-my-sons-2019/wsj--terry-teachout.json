Single excerpt warning noted, but the enthusiasm level suggests upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, calling it one of the best revivals, with a magnetic staging that overcomes any doubts about the play's preachiness. The positive tone suggests a rave, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt contains very strong praise, calling it \"one of the best Miller revivals I’ve ever seen\" and praising the staging as \"magnetic.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Despite being a single excerpt, the critic offers superlative praise calling this one of the best Miller revivals they have seen, describing the staging as 'magnetic' and praising the uniformly strong supporting cast, indicating a high recommendation.",
