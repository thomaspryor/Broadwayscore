    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the revival as 'solid' and praises Irons' performance. Given the limited text and measured praise ('solid' rather than enthusiastic language), this appears to be a qualified positive recommendation, scoring in the lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Jeremy Irons' performance, describing the revival as a 'solid showcase'. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, indicating a mildly positive tone with limited context. | Gemini: The review excerpt is positive, calling the revival a \"solid showcase\" for Jeremy Irons. Given that it's a single excerpt, the confidence is low, and the score is in the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt describes the production as a 'solid showcase' with praise for the lead performance, indicating a mild positive recommendation. The limited context and measured language ('solid' rather than 'triumph') warrant the lower end of the Positive bucket.",
