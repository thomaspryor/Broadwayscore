However, single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's cast, particularly highlighting Annette Bening's transformative performance. The strong language suggests a positive recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses heavily on Annette Bening's performance, calling it a \"revelation\" and transformative. While it mentions the play itself is \"sometimes heavy-handed,\" the overall tone is positive due to Bening's contribution and the \"stellar cast.\" | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the cast ('stellar') and specifically Bening's transformative performance ('revelation', 'subtlety and power'), though it acknowledges the source material can be heavy-handed. As only a single curated excerpt is available, confidence is reduced.",
