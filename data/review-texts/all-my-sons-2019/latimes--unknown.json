  "bwwExcerpt": "O'Brien's production includes actors of color in important roles. Hampton Fluker plays George and Chinasa Ogbuagu plays Sue Bayliss, a neighbor with sharp opinions on the Keller family's self-deceiving ways. The casting, neither colorblind nor thematic, is part of a theatrical tradition that has become more or less standard. If the company seems unsettled, the issue isn't race but style. O'Brien's ensemble mixes realism with contemporary classicism in a catch-as-catch-can way. It's the acting equivalent of a mixed salad.",

However, this is only one excerpt and may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt describes the production as having a mix of styles that results in an 'unsettled' company, suggesting a mixed verdict. The lack of a clear positive or negative recommendation places it in the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review describes the production as \"unsettled\" and the acting as \"the equivalent of a mixed salad,\" indicating a mixed or neutral assessment. The lack of a clear recommendation and the critical tone suggest a score in the Mixed range. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the acting as 'unsettled' and a 'mixed salad' combining styles in a 'catch-as-catch-can way,' suggesting uneven execution without clear recommendation or condemnation. With only one curated excerpt available, the overall verdict remains ambiguous.",
