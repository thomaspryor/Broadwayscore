Mixed verdict with both positive and negative elements. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges strong performances but notes the production lacks the impact of great versions. This suggests a mixed assessment, with positive elements but not a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges that the production doesn't reach greatness, but highlights the superb performances, indicating a positive but not rave recommendation. | Kimi: The review states the production fails to achieve the greatness of past iterations while praising the lead performances as superb, resulting in a balanced assessment that neither endorses nor rejects the show overall.",
