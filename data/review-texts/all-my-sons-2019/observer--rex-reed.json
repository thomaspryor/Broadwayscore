Despite being an excerpt, the consistent high praise across multiple elements warrants a high Rave score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is highly positive, using superlatives like 'Best Show of the Broadway Season' and 'exemplary production'. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses superlatives like \"Best Show of the Broadway Season\", \"beautifully mounted revival\", and \"heart-stopping dramatic impact\", indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives ('Best Show of the Broadway Season', 'heart-stopping dramatic impact', 'exemplary production') indicating an enthusiastic must-see recommendation, though confidence is reduced given only a single curated excerpt is available.",
