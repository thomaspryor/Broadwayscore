  "bwwExcerpt": "Letts' performance likely will strike some as odd or disconnected - I find it perfectly in tune with the moment, and there is much to like about Bening's work, too. Kate Keller is a tricky part - she can come off as merely an enabler or a kook. Bening comes up with something much richer, as does Walker, who is quite moving and, well, sad. It will take another generation or two to fix things, you think.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Critic praises lead performances as 'much to like' and 'quite moving' but excerpt suggests qualified appreciation rather than strong enthusiasm. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Bening's and Walker's performances, indicating a positive view, but the single excerpt and lack of a clear overall verdict suggest a cautious, low-confidence score. | Gemini: The critic finds Letts' performance \"perfectly in tune\" and says there is \"much to like\" about Bening's work, indicating a positive, though perhaps not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, assessment. The phrase \"something much richer\" also suggests a positive view. | Kimi: The excerpt offers warm, specific praise for the principal performances, finding Letts 'perfectly in tune,' Bening's work 'much richer,' and Walker 'quite moving,' indicating a clear positive recommendation despite limited text availability.",
