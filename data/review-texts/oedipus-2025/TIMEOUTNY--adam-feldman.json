  "fullText": "Sophocles's Oedipus is a story of blind ambition: the cautionary tale of a proud ancient Greek ruler whose determination to avoid a terrible fate leads him into it headlong. There are no kings in the English playwright-director Robert Icke's modernized 2018 adaptation of the play, written \"(long) after Sophocles,\" as the script jokingly notes. Icke's Oedipus (Mark Strong) is a star politician instead, with resemblances to several other 2010s leaders. Like Barack Obama, he is an inspirational family man derided by some as a foreigner; like Donald Trump, he's a populist outsider who promises strong leadership; and like France's Emmanuel Macron, he shares a scandalous past with his significantly older wife. On the verge of winning power, Oedipus presents himself as the bald, muscular, tough-talking hero-daddy his rudderless country needs: the reformist politician as badass motherfucker. Which in a tragic sense—spoiler alert—he already is.\n\nOedipus is not really about the fall of a great man; rather, it's about a great man coming to realize that he has already fallen. It is election night, the TV screen blinks with news, and Oedipus is surrounded by his family: his studious daughter Antigone (the lovely and sympathetic Olivia Reis); his twin sons, the sweet Polyneices (James Wilbraham) and the rakish Eteocles (Jordan Scowen); his sturdy old mum, Merope (Anne Reid, tasty as a crust of bread), whom Oedipus keeps blowing off. And above all there is his wife, Jocasta, who—as played by the great Lesley Manville—is a creature of effortless fascination: confident, worldly, intelligent, practical, passionate, sexually frank and a touch narcissistic, with a hint of Sphinxlike inscrutability to shroud the trauma behind her drive. Oedipus seems untouchable. But as an onstage clock ticks down to his landslide win, the earth gives way beneath him.\n\nIcke's Oedipus is continuously engaging and smart, and it is exceedingly well performed by a cast that also includes Teagle F. Bougere, Bhasker Patel and Ani Mesa-Perez as aides and employees. Where it runs up against a wall—as many modern adaptations of ancient texts do—is in trying to make the story function without gods and fates. The possibility of divine machinations is brought up in passing here and there, but inconclusively. And that's a particular problem for Oedipus, because the original play is about the backfiring impossibility of trying to avoid predestiny.\n\nThe double bind that this play presents to adaptors—keeping the gods and fates makes it feel alien to us, but removing them makes it an especially lurid soap opera—is perhaps why, despite its harrowing subject, I have never seen an Oedipus that truly wrecks. But perhaps that's a problem that can't be cracked. Sometimes it pays to find the answers; sometimes, the play suggests, it's better not to know.",
