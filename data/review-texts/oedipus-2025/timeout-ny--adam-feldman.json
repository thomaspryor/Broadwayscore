  "fullText": "And above all there is his wife, Jocasta, who—as played by the great Lesley Manville—is a creature of effortless fascination: confident, worldly, intelligent, practical passionate, sexually frank and a touch narcissistic, with a hint of Sphinxlike inscrutability to shroud the trauma behind her drive.",
  "isFullReview": false,
  "dtliExcerpt": "Icke’s Oedipus is continuously engaging and smart, and it is exceedingly well performed by a cast that also includes Teagle F. Bougere, Bhasker Patel and Ani Mesa-Perez as aides and employees. Where it runs up against a wall—as many modern adaptations of ancient texts do—is in trying to make the story function without gods and fates. The possibility of divine machinations is brought up in passing here and there, but inconclusively.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Ickeâs Oedipus is continuously engaging and smart... but where it runs up against a wall... is in trying to make the story function without gods and fates... I have never seen an Oedipus that truly wrecks.\"",
