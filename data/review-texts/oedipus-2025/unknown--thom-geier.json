Medium confidence due to single excerpt warning - could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly enthusiastic language, describing the play as 'mesmerizing' and 'one of the memorable nights of theater,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"searing,\" \"mesmerizing,\" and \"one of the memorable nights of theater you are ever likely to experience,\" indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise calling it the 'most contemporary, trenchant new play on Broadway' and promising it will be among the most memorable theater experiences, indicating a rave review. Confidence is reduced due to the availability of only a single excerpt.",
