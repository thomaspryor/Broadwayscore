  "bwwExcerpt": "While the absence of real tension (besides that signaled by the countdown) is frustrating, Strong and Manville find dramatic urgency in their relationship, played as misplaced optimism (or is it opportunism?) and passionate drive. The clarity of their want for one another, and their shared desire to propel themselves to power, rings sharp and crystalline. Even as doubt sets in, Strong and Manville’s dynamic is magnetic and explosive, like it's about to set the whole world on fire.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"This new adaptation is less about what will happen or how, and without that thrust, Icke's Oedipus struggles to find its meaning.\"",
