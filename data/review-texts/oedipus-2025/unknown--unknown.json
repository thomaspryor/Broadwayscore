However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review describes a compelling and intense experience, suggesting it is worth seeing despite the difficult subject matter. The phrase 'impossible to look away' implies a positive, albeit potentially unsettling, recommendation.",
