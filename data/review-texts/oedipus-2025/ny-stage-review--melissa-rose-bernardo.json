  "dtliExcerpt": "Icke—whose last Broadway outing in 2017 was an adaptation of Orwell’s 1984, which he cowrote and codirected with Duncan Macmillan—has retained the characters’ names and the core of Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex, but otherwise, he has completely rebuilt the centuries-old tragedy from the ground up. And when a play has endured for nearly 2,500 years, it can withstand an extreme home makeover. Even the merch is up-to-the-minute: The T-shirt, coffee mug, and even direct mailings are emblazoned with the grabby tagline “Truth is a mother**ker.",
