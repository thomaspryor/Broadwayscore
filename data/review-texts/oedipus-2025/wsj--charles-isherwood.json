  "bwwExcerpt": "I thought what might follow would be Mr. Icke’s most provocative—and logical and interesting—departure from Sophocles, an ending of a more ambiguous and less gruesome kind. Instead he reverts to tradition. It’s an understandable move: Many might feel shortchanged if Mr. Icke had chosen otherwise. Nevertheless, it’s a Grand Guignol finish to what has previously been an effective, affecting and strictly naturalistic new interpretation of this canonical drama.",

The BroadwayWorld aggregator says 'Up', which suggests a positive leaning, but the limited text makes it difficult to be certain.",

In this ingeniously reimagined contemporary staging on Broadway (“created by” Mr. Icke “after” Sophocles), the Theban king of the original becomes a hard-driving candidate hoping to lead his country as he gathers with his family on election night to await the returns, while a dark fate gradually encircles him like a snake ready to spring.\n\nCopyright ©2026 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
