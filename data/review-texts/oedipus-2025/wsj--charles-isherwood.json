  "bwwExcerpt": "I thought what might follow would be Mr. Icke’s most provocative—and logical and interesting—departure from Sophocles, an ending of a more ambiguous and less gruesome kind. Instead he reverts to tradition. It’s an understandable move: Many might feel shortchanged if Mr. Icke had chosen otherwise. Nevertheless, it’s a Grand Guignol finish to what has previously been an effective, affecting and strictly naturalistic new interpretation of this canonical drama.",

Though disappointed by the traditional ending, the overall assessment is clearly favorable. | GPT-4o: The review describes the production as 'transfixing,' 'ingeniously reimagined,' and 'effective, affecting,' indicating a strong recommendation. The minor reservation about the traditional ending does not significantly detract from the overall praise. | Gemini: The review is largely positive, praising the reimagining and contemporary staging. However, the critic expresses disappointment with the traditional ending, which prevents a higher score.",
