  "fullText": "Editor in Chief: Giampaolo Pioli\n\nThe First Italian English Digital Daily in the US\n\nEnglish Editor: Grace Russo Bullaro\n\nThe Cast of Oedipus. All photos by Julieta Cervantes\n\n*****/***** (five stars out of five)\n\nThe wonderful thing about a work of classical theater is its ability to seamlessly integrate with the modern era, making it feel as if it were written today, specifically addressing our present concerns and anxieties. But it takes a first rate production team to make an adaptation not just relevant, but truly, truly special. Not for the first time, wunderkind English director Robert Icke has re-ignited (and re-engineered) a classic—Sophocles’ 5th century BC Greek tragedy, Oedipus Rex—and exploded it over the theater world like a 20-megaton bomb. Icke’s adaptation, Oedipus—now playing at Studio 54 on Broadway—grips the audience by the throat from the outset, slowly tightening its grip as the minutes tick by (literally, with an onstage countdown clock) leading to its devastating conclusion.\n\nDespite most audience members’ familiarity with the tragic tale of Oedipus Rex, one is immediately lost in the moment-to-moment drama unfurling on stage, such that when the inevitable (and known) denouement occurs, it practically comes as a surprise. Icke’s Oedipus (faithful to the original, yet somehow more jarring) takes its sharp turn in a manner worthy of a “Twilight Zone” episode, forcing us to reevaluate our expectations of storytelling.\n\nAs both director and writer/adapter, Icke has created a relatable modern narrative, setting the story in the midst of a political campaign in which Oedipus (Mark Strong, composed and powerful as the emerging politician) is the favored candidate to become leader of an unspecified western nation (it feels mostly like the US or England, though it matters not). The action takes place on election night, as the hours count down to the polls&#8217; closing time. When the curtain rises the audience is treated to a huge, stage-wide video screen airing election coverage. Candidate Oedipus is talking exuberantly to a mob of reporters and fans, all of whom seem exhilarated by his truth telling:\n\n“I think what everyone thinks. We’re sick. The civic body is ill. And that &#8211; that isn’t trees and chemicals in lakes – it’s us – we’re sick. . . The water got poisoned – and we got used to the taste.”\n\nHis politics are a bit ambiguous, but he’s a man of the people: a compassionate populist reformer with an aggressively enthusiastic base. Accordingly, on election eve, he gathers with his family and workers in the campaign headquarters, rather than in a posh hotel suite. But two foreboding visitors—his mother (Anne Reid, effectively understated), who persistently tries to speak with him despite his repeated brush-offs (“OK. Well, hold fire – and later, we’ll catch up”); and Teiresias (Samuel Brewer), a blind prophet who attempts to dissuade Oedipus from re-opening some seemingly unwarranted investigations brought on by opposition parties—cause him to emotionally unravel far more quickly than warranted. Among other things, he accuses his brother-in-law/ campaign manager, Creon (an excellent John Carroll Lynch), of treachery. He seems to be slowly coming off the rails, his smooth, powerful exterior rapidly disintegrating. However, his wife Jocasta (the absolutely riveting Lesley Manville) and three children bring him back down to earth with a specially organized family dinner in the HQ conference room. For a time he seems placated, even engaging with Jocasta in a graphic sexual act after the guests have left. Nonetheless, the clock keeps ticking and Oedipus tragically insists on digging further into some of Teiresias’ forebodings.\n\nHildegard Bechtler’s set—a modern, not-unpleasant office festooned with TV screens running election news 24/7—neatly spans the breadth of the stage, creating a thoroughly realistic environment, further inviting the audience into the story as it unfolds in real time. The countdown election clock (a sort of “theater verité” device) and the rising tension create a mesmerizing atmosphere—and this (as well as a tight script with sharp dialogue), is the heart of Icke’s genius. He has taken a well-known, 2500-year-old tragedy and made it as relevant and immediate as any story written today. Rarely have I been in a theater with an audience so focused and intensely silent. Oedipus won England’s 2025 Olivier award for Best Revival (as well as few others), and it’s likely to fare equally well at the Tonys next Spring. If you want to see classical theater done right, this is a can’t miss opportunity.\n\nOedipus. Through February 8, 2026 at Studio 54 (254 West 54th Street, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue).\n\nShare on Twitter     JK Clarke     Based in New York, JK Clarke is a writer, photographer and associate editor for theater review site, Theater Pizzazz and is a Drama Desk member and voter.
