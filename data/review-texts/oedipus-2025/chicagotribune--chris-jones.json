(Julieta Cervantes) By Chris Jones | cjones5@chicagotribune.com | Chicago Tribune PUBLISHED: November 13, 2025 at 10:00 PM CST Getting your Trinity Audio player ready... NEW YORK — A countdown clock ticks down at the rear of the election headquarters of a man named Oedipus, a candidate for high political office who has built his campaign on restoring a divided city-state now unable to talk to itself. Oh, where can we be? Somewhere close to home? The exit polling looks good as the candidate’s crew — wife Jocasta, daughter Antigone, sons, drivers, interlopers and campaign aides — prepare for a celebration. But there’s an 11th-hour issue, an October surprise, if you will. The candidate suddenly becomes interested in finding out the hidden secrets of his own identity and coming clean with the voters in his pending victory speech, even when those with greater insight tell him to stop before everything unravels. “Truth,” as it says on the sweatshirt available at the merch stand, “is a mother(expletive).” That’s the premise behind Robert Icke’s thrilling (and self-directed) new adaptation of Sophocles’ “Oedipus the King,” which opened at Broadway’s Studio 54 venue Thursday night following a hit West End run. The relentless show, which justly snagged all manner of awards in the U.K., casts the ill-fated King of Thebes as a macho, loquacious and hubristic politician; if one were looking for a real-life corollary to Mark Strong’s leading performance among today’s aspirants, Gavin Newsom strikes me as the closest. function dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss( getS2NApiForPlayer ) { if( typeof window.MNGAuthentication !== 'undefined' ){ const s2nApi = getS2NApiForPlayer( document.querySelector('.k-wQoDAMss') ); s2nApi.float = ! window.MNGAuthentication.isUserSubscriber(); } } I mean, he would be if he had killed his dad and married his mom. (Jocasta, said wife and mom, is played here by the Academy Award nominee Lesley Manville). Spoiler alerts don’t really apply in Greek tragedy. The original audience in 5th century B.C.

(Julieta Cervantes) Aristotle called “Oedipus the King” the perfect tragedy and that still applies in my book, 2,500-odd years later.

The spectacularly good Bougere totally creeped me out.\n\nMoreover, nobody at my performance moved much of a muscle for the two intermission-less hours. Safer, it felt, to stay put in your seat.\n\nChris Jones is a Tribune critic.\n\nAt Studio 54, 254 W. 54th St., New York; oedipustheplay.com",
