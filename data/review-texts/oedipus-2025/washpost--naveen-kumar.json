Most people in the audience also know that within that time, he’ll discover unspeakable horrors and self-destruct.\n\n14 CommentsMost ReadMatt ViserTrump tries humor, gets some silence at black-tie dinner with ‘people I hate’February 1, 2026Janay Kingsberry, Travis Andrews, Niha Masih and Leo SandsTrump plans to close Kennedy Center for about two years, starting in July3 hours agoFaiz Siddiqui, Nitasha Tiku and Elizabeth DwoskinInside Musk’s bet to hook users that turned Grok into a porn generatorEarlier todayNewsletterFridaysBook ClubOur weekly selection of book reviews and recommendations from Book World editor Ron Charles.Sign up\n\nAs a California consumer, you have the right to opt-out from the sale or sharing of your personal information at any time across business platform, services, businesses and devices.

The context provided is more descriptive of the plot setup rather than a critique of the show itself. | Gemini: The review text is severely truncated, making it impossible to determine the critic's overall recommendation.

  "dtliExcerpt": "The taut spin on “Oedipus” now on Broadway after a West End run last fall is a rare and magnificent feat of adaptation: Writer and director Robert Icke draws Sophocles’ ancient play into the present while deepening its timeless explorations of power, desire and fate. As the doomed mother-son couple, Lesley Manville and Mark Strong deliver two of the most captivating performances on New York stages this year, in a production that combines the intrigue of a primal tragedy with a modern political thriller.",
