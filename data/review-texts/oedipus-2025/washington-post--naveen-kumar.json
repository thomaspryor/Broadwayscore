  "fullText": "The taut spin on “Oedipus” now on Broadway after a West End run last fall is a rare and magnificent feat of adaptation: Writer and director Robert Icke draws Sophocles’ ancient play into the present while deepening its timeless explorations of power, desire and fate. As the doomed mother-son couple, Lesley Manville and Mark Strong deliver two of the most captivating performances on New York stages this year, in a production that combines the intrigue of a primal tragedy with a modern political thriller.",
