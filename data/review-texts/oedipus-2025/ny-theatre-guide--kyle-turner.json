  "fullText": "After millennia, Sophocles’s mother lode of a play Oedipus Rex — a grand work of ambition, moral decay, and the pain of seeing yourself and others as they really are — has been swallowed up by pop psychology and armchair history&#8230; This new adaptation is less about what will happen or how, and without that thrust, Icke's Oedipus struggles to find its meaning.",
