    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Calls it 'extraordinary production' which is strong praise, but notes pacing flaw. Single excerpt warning applies - using upper end of Positive bucket given strong opening praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'extraordinary' but notes a pacing issue. Given the single excerpt warning, the positive tone suggests a strong recommendation despite some reservations. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates an \"extraordinary production\" but mentions it takes \"a bit too much time\" on certain aspects, suggesting a positive recommendation with reservations. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic uses the strong superlative 'extraordinary' to describe the production, indicating a clear recommendation, while offering a minor reservation about the pacing of the first half. As this is a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
