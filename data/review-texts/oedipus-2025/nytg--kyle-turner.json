  "fullText": "Robert Icke — the playwright/director known for putting modern yet mythically fatalistic spins on classic plays — knows you know how Oedipus is going to end. There's the ticking clock resting on a windowsill, counting down to the reveal of the great \"twist.\" There's the show's tagline: \"truth is a motherf---er.\" And there's the script littered with references to sight and blindness, and, naturally, to slang unprintable but which aggressively references too-close-for-comfort relationships between sons and mothers.\n\nAfter millennia, Sophocles's mother lode of a play Oedipus Rex — a grand work of ambition, moral decay, and the pain of seeing yourself and others as they really are — has been swallowed up by pop psychology and armchair history. Icke has attempted to give it the polish of the modern world: Oedipus, the soon-to-be King of Thebes, carries a cool, populist persona, complete with campaign posters evoking Obama's \"HOPE\" era and a campaign HQ with an antiseptic, ivory aesthetic.\n\nOedipus (Mark Strong) and Jocasta (Lesley Manville) are a modern couple whose pristine appearance now trembles beneath the weight of the political office Oedipus is about to take. The politician overestimates what he and his family can withstand under the specter of public scrutiny: Oedipus's obsession with honesty and truth, and sharing that with the people, forces him to realize how order is maintained through ignorance, manipulation, and blunt lies. That Icke has leaned on winking at the audience about the show's finale strongarms the show into reordering its sense of tension. This new adaptation is less about what will happen or how, and without that thrust, Icke's Oedipus struggles to find its meaning.\n\nDespite telegraphing real political figures who have found themselves in Sophoclean situations, this adaptation also keeps the richness and terror of our modern political realities at arm's length. What Oedipus and Jocasta see or don't see — about their lives, their political ambitions, and one another — only succeeds on the strength of Strong and Manville's performances.\n\nWhile the absence of real tension (besides that signaled by the countdown) is frustrating, Strong and Manville find dramatic urgency in their relationship, played as misplaced optimism (or is it opportunism?) and passionate drive. The clarity of their want for one another, and their shared desire to propel themselves to power, rings sharp and crystalline. Even as doubt sets in, Strong and Manville's dynamic is magnetic and explosive, like it's about to set the whole world on fire.\n\nHildegard Bechtler's sleek interiors are bright and immaculate, at first littered with the chaos of campaign debris strewn across tables, chairs, and couches. Tal Yarden's video work includes a political interview at the beginning and a loop of exit polls on various monitors.\n\nIcke's Oedipus repeatedly nods to its audience's knowledge (even if passive) of the play's secrets and bends over backwards to make its language accessible, not infrequently at the expense of making it interesting.\n\nWith a gleaming set, casual language, and chic cynicism, Robert Icke's adaptation signals Oedipus's modern relevance in ways that are only sporadically truthful or interesting. But Mark Strong and Lesley Manville's turns as Oedipus and Jocasta give this take on the Greek classic a grounded yet otherworldly sense of magnificent devastation.",
