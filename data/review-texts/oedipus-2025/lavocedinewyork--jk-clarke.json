    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the director's achievement making classic material feel contemporary, plus description of powerful audience engagement. Single excerpt warning means low confidence, but the language suggests strong positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's relevance and impact on the audience, suggesting a strong positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the production's relevance and impact on the audience, indicating a positive assessment. Due to the limited text, confidence is low, but the strong positive tone suggests a score in the upper end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers strong praise for the production's contemporary relevance and gripping effect on audiences. Language ('as relevant and immediate as any story written today') warrants upper Positive range despite limited context.",
