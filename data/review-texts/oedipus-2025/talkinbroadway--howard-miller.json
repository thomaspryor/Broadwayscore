    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt uses superlative language ('absolute model', 'could not be better') indicating strong praise. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the adaptation and performances, suggesting a highly positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt contains very positive language, calling the adaptation an \"absolute model\" and praising the performances as the best possible. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive with a high score, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The single available excerpt contains unqualified superlatives ('absolute model', 'could not be better') indicating strong enthusiasm for the adaptation and performances. However, given this is a solitary curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's balance, the score remains in the upper Positive range with low confidence rather than Rave. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
