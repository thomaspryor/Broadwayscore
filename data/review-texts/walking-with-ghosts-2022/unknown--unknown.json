    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a reflective and possibly somber tone, indicating a mixed or neutral stance. The lack of clear positive or negative language and the warning about a single excerpt lead to a cautious, low-confidence classification. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the ending of the show, suggesting a reflective and perhaps unresolved conclusion. Without more context, it's difficult to determine a clear recommendation, so I've classified it as mixed with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show's thematic conclusion with language suggesting emotional resonance and coherence, though 'resignation' and the absence of explicit praise terms keep it at the lower end of Positive. Single excerpt availability significantly limits confidence.",
