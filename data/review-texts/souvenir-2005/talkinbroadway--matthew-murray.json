The tone suggests enjoyment despite any unconventional elements. | Gemini: The review indicates the show 'succeeds' and 'celebrates' something, which suggests a positive, though perhaps quirky, experience. The phrase 'tone-deaf wonder' implies it's enjoyable despite its flaws. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states the show 'succeeds' and praises its 'glorious' celebration of its subject, indicating a clear recommendation despite the brief excerpt.",
