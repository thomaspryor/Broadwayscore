  "bwwExcerpt": "Rylance takes it to the max--and the mat. Rarely has an antihero been so antiheroic. His limp alone looks so real I wouldn't be surprised if he let himself get run over by a car for the proper effect...It's a real experience, and though it becomes too ponderous and hard to take, I welcome anything with a statement and the theatrical means to blare it.",
