    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, the language is unqualifiedly superlative: 'titanic performance...one for the ages' and 'mighty force of irrepressible live theatre.' The combination of praising both lead performance and the play itself with such strong language indicates a rave review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for both the lead performance and the play itself, describing it as a 'mighty force of irrepressible live theatre'. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Rylance's performance as 'titanic' and the play as a 'mighty force', indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the language suggests a high positive score. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unambiguous superlatives ('titanic performance,' 'one for the ages,' 'mighty force') indicating enthusiastic endorsement typical of a rave review. Confidence is reduced to 'low' due to the single-excerpt format, which may not capture the full review's nuance.",
