This suggests recommendation primarily for the star turn despite script weaknesses. Low confidence due to very brief excerpt. | GPT-4o: The review praises Rylance's performance as a 'tour de force', suggesting a strong positive aspect, but notes the play itself is 'sometimes meandering', indicating some reservations. | Gemini: The review praises Rylance's performance as a \"tour de force\" but notes the play itself is \"sometimes meandering.\" This suggests a positive recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The critic lavishes superlatives on Rylance's performance ('towering', 'tour de force') and states it transcends the play's flaws, indicating the production is worth seeing primarily for the acting despite reservations about the script.",
