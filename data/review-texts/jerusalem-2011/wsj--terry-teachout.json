  "bwwExcerpt": "Into every spring on Broadway a brand-new British play must fall. This year there are two, 'War Horse' and Jez Butterworth's 'Jerusalem,' and those Anglophiles who like their accents thick and their plays pretentious will prefer the latter to the former. Indeed, 'Jerusalem' is pretentious almost without limit, a three-hour save-our-England tract in which the uplift is slathered with a thick brown sauce composed of two parts coarse humor and one part pseudopoetry. In addition, 'Jerusalem' features a performance by Mark Rylance ('La Bête,' 'Boeing-Boeing') that is every bit as good as the critical buzz that accompanied its transfer from London's West End. Connoisseurs of great acting won't want to miss him—but those with normal attention spans will be hard pressed to make it to the finish line.",
