However, this appears to be an excerpt focusing only on Rylance's performance without broader show assessment. | Gemini: The review contains high praise for Mark Rylance's performance, suggesting it is a must-see and a highlight of the Broadway season, which warrants a positive score. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives ('finest performance by an actor on Broadway this season') and emphasizes the transformative quality of the acting ('forget you're watching theater'), indicating an unqualified rave.",
