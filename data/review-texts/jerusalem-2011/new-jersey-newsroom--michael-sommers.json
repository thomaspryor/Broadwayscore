  "bwwExcerpt": "An award-winning hit in London, “Jerusalem” is very, very, very English in its cultural references and significance. As the play wends its garrulous way towards a baleful conclusion, some American viewers may wonder why they should care about Johnny, a messy wastrel who idly corrupts adolescents. But that would be missing the higher pretensions of Butterworth’s drama and certainly not appreciating Rylance’s deeply-immersed depiction of Johnny.",
