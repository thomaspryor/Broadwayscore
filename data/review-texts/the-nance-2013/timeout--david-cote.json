  "bwwExcerpt": "The season isn't over yet, but The Nance may turn out to be its dramatic high point...Beane is in top form, tossing off glittering epigrams, but also crafting rich, flowing dialogue and giving even minor roles strokes of shading. Jack O'Brien stages the comedy skits and regular scenes with equal gusto. Lane shows his enormous range, expertly landing punch lines before punching us in the gut. Perhaps it's heteronormative of me to say, but The Nance can attract man or woman, gay or straight-even the undecided.",
