  "bwwExcerpt": "There are moments when 'The Nance' feels too contemporary, though the play resists the snide humor afflicting Beane's adaptation of 'Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella,' which opened earlier this season. But it's also a sympathetic love story about one damaged man's inability to feel deserving of more than anonymous sex...Lane, in his best performance since 'The Producers,' brings considerable heart to Chauncey's ambiguities...Jack O'Brien has directed with his usual sensitivity, never allowing the play to devolve into a camp fest.",
