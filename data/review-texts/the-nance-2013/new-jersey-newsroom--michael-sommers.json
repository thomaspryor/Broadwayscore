  "bwwExcerpt": "Partly a history lesson, partly a laugh riot and partly a gay weeper, 'The Nance' is an ambitious new play by Douglas Carter Beane that does not coalesce into a completely persuasive drama. Thanks partly to a vivid performance by Nathan Lane in the title role, director Jack O'Brien's evocative production usually makes the most of Beane's troubling look at homosexual existence in Manhattan during the 1930s.",
