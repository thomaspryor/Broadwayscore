  "bwwExcerpt": "Even if the play eventually loses momentum, it is the most ambitious and substantial effort made to date by Beane, who is known primarily for writing the books of silly musicals like 'Xanadu' and 'Lysistrata Jones.' It also allows Lane to combine his comedic persona with a tragic undertone...Jack O'Brien's solid production, which effectively uses a turntable to shift its massive set pieces, also features engaging performances from Cady Huffman (Lane's Tony-winning co-star in 'The Producers') and Lewis J. Stadlen (who took over for Lane in 'The Producers'). 2.5 stars",
