  "bwwExcerpt": "Nathan Lane is at his tragicomic best in The Nance...Beane - along with director Jack O'Brien, who knows a thing or two about showbiz razzle-dazzle (see: Hairspray) - has come up with a few genuinely fresh burlesque bits (no easy feat!), accompanied by Glen Kelly's too-darn-catchy tunes. And they've assembled a crack comic team to play the Irving Place performers...the priceless Lewis J. Stadlen portrays Efram, Chauncey's usual scene partner. Stadlen and Lane have built up quite the easy-breezy comic rapport over the years in shows such as Laughter on the 23rd Floor, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,Mizlansky/Zilinsky or 'Schmucks', and The Man Who Came to Dinner. If they got an act together, they could take it on the road. B",
