  "bwwExcerpt": "Directed with subtlety and tenderness by Jack O'Brien, this is a bittersweet tale of repression and rebellion wrapped up in a valentine to a lost theatrical art form...Lane as the tortured soul at the play's heart is magnificent -- showing sides that are charming, witty, savage, self-destructive and yearning...One of the best scenes is toward the end when a self-loathing Miles returns to the stage in full-on drag. He has dropped The Nance act and is playing an old whore named Hortense. Lane is still funny but seems thoroughly and unbearably broken. It is heartbreaking.",
  "bwwScore": 8
