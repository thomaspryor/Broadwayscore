  "bwwExcerpt": "Lincoln Center Theater's stunning production of Douglas Carter Beane's 'The Nance' is a textbook example of how to put on a classy show. It helps to have a bona fide (and certifiably bankable) star like Nathan Lane casting his glow in the title role of a Depression-era comic who plays 'pansy parts' in burlesque shows. Another smart move was booking this period piece into a beautiful old Broadway house. The final coup was entrusting the helming to Jack O'Brien, whose impeccable taste in casting and keen eye for design guarantee a seamless show.",
