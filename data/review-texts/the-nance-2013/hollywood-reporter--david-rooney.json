    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising Lane's 'powerhouse performance' and calling the drama 'moving' suggests strong positive elements, but limited text prevents full assessment of overall recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Nathan Lane's performance and describes the drama as 'moving,' suggesting a positive view. However, without additional context, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a cautious, low-confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a \"powerhouse performance\" and a \"moving drama,\" which suggests a positive, though limited, assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strong praise for both the lead performance ('powerhouse') and the play itself ('moving'), indicating a clear positive recommendation. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence remains low regarding the full review's overall verdict.",
