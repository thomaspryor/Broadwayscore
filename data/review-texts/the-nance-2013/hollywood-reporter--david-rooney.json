However, this is only one curated quote, so confidence is low and verdict may not represent the full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a strong performance by Nathan Lane and describes the drama as 'moving,' suggesting a positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment might not be fully captured, leading to a lower confidence level. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Nathan Lane's performance as a \"powerhouse\" in a \"moving drama.\" Given the limited text, I am scoring it as positive, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The single available excerpt contains strongly positive language ('powerhouse performance,' 'moving drama'), indicating a clear recommendation in the upper Positive range. However, confidence is low due to the limited excerpt availability.",
