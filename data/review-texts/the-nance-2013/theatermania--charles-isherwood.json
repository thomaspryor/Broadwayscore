    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong praise ('powerhouse performance', 'moving drama') suggests positive recommendation, but limited text requires low confidence. Scored in upper Positive range given clearly enthusiastic language. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a strong performance by Nathan Lane and describes the drama as 'moving'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment might be mildly positive rather than strongly positive. | Gemini: The excerpt highlights a 'powerhouse performance' and a 'moving drama,' suggesting a strong positive experience. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence due to the limited information. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance ('powerhouse') and the play itself ('moving drama'), indicating an enthusiastic recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, this represents the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
