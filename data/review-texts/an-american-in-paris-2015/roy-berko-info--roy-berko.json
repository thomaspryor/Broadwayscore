    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Uses four superlative adjectives (gorgeous, enchanting, seamless, sophisticated) and calls it a 'tribute' to both the source material and creative team. Despite being a single excerpt, the language is unqualifiedly celebratory, indicating a rave review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly positive language such as 'gorgeous', 'enchanting', and 'sophisticated', indicating a strong recommendation. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using words like \"gorgeous\", \"enchanting\", \"seamless\", and \"sophisticated\", indicating a strong recommendation. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise using words like 'gorgeous,' 'enchanting,' and 'sophisticated,' and lauds the director's 'genius' and a 'stellar' cast. Per the single-excerpt guidance, this clearly positive quote warrants the upper range of the Positive bucket, though confidence is reduced due to the lack of full context. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
