And that's a problem for a show that's billed as a romance....Though very nicely acted by a supporting cast of stage veterans, Craig Lucas's book gets bogged down with too many complicating subplots...on its toes, \"An American In Paris\" is glorious. But when the dancing stops, it falls disappointingly flat.\"\n\nRead more",

This is a classic mixed review with clear highs and lows but no overall recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review praises the dancing and music but criticizes the book and emotional impact. The excerpt suggests mixed feelings, with strong elements but significant drawbacks. | Gemini: The review praises the dancing, music, and scenery, but criticizes the book and lack of romance. This indicates a mixed experience with both positive and negative aspects.",
