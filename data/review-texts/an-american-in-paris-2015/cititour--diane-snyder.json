  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The show has a glorious Gershwin score going for it, not to mention exquisitely conceived and executed ballet numbers…But it’s the characters and their stories that elevate this show beyond mere musical extravaganza…The story unfolds with great finesse…The show looks as good as it sounds…The creators show they understand why people go to musicals— to be moved and dazzled with equal force. 'An American in Paris' is as smart and spirited as it is spectacular.\"\n\nRead more",
