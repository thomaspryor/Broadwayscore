'An American in Paris' is as smart and spirited as it is spectacular.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise throughout with 'glorious', 'exquisitely conceived', 'great finesse', and concluding that creators understand what makes musicals work. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt contains strong praise for multiple elements of the show, including the score, choreography, and storytelling. The language used ('smart and spirited', 'spectacular') suggests a highly positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using words like \"glorious,\" \"exquisitely,\" \"elevate,\" \"finesse,\" \"spectacular,\" \"smart,\" and \"spirited.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring it high in the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the Gershwin score, ballet numbers, storytelling, and production values using words like 'glorious,' 'exquisite,' and 'spectacular,' indicating a clear recommendation despite the limitation of having only a single curated quote.",
