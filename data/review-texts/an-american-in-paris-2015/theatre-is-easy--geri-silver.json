    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges visual beauty and nostalgic appeal but criticizes fundamental structural weaknesses, calling it 'patchwork' storytelling. The conditional recommendation ('for anyone with a passion for ballet') suggests limited appeal rather than broad endorsement. | GPT-4o: The review highlights visual beauty and nostalgic charm but notes structural weaknesses. The recommendation is targeted at specific audiences, indicating a mildly positive verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges structural weaknesses but ultimately recommends the show for those seeking nostalgia or with a passion for ballet. The \"must-see\" phrase pushes it into the positive bucket. | Kimi: The critic praises the visual spectacle and beloved Gershwin melodies but criticizes the show as structurally thin and a patchwork that sacrifices cohesive storytelling, offering only qualified recommendations for specific audiences. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Positive, gemini=Positive, kimi=Mixed",
