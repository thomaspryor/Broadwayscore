  "bwwExcerpt": "Had this ambitious new musical fully committed to telling its story through the love, pain, rush and insecurity of movement, especially movement that does not have to compete with digitized scenery drawing pictures of its own, and had it more overtly abandoned the usual way of musicals, then 'American in Paris' would have touched the heart and soul more than currently is possible. The expanded narrative, penned by Craig Lucas for this first legitimate staging of the 1951 movie, has resulted in an overly complex and less-than-involving story, exploring the residue of the Nazi occupation of Paris.",
