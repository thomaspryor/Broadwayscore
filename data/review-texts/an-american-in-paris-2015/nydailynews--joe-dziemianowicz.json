  "bwwExcerpt": "But the reason this beautiful ballet-happy show is so richly satisfying isn't luck. It's about director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon of London's Royal Ballet. Guiding his first musical, Wheeldon shows a vibrant vision and buckets of imagination, transforming the 1951 Gene Kelly-Leslie Caron film that inspires the show. He's also got a cast and design team at the top of their game.",
