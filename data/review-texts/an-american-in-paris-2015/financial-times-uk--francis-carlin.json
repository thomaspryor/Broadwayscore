    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, the critic's final statement 'I would beg, borrow or steal to see it all again' is an extremely enthusiastic endorsement that suggests a strong positive review, warranting upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, describing the show as a 'savvy, poetic cocktail' and a 'perfect Christmas treat'. The phrase 'beg, borrow or steal to see it all again' suggests an enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic calls it a \"perfect Christmas treat\" and says they \"would beg, borrow or steal to see it all again.\" Given the single excerpt and strong positive language, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt features effusive praise calling the show a 'perfect Christmas treat' and stating it 'deserves to become a repertoire standard,' alongside a passionate personal commitment to see it repeatedly. As a single curated excerpt, the score is capped in the upper Positive range.",
