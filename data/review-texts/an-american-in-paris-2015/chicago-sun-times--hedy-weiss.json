  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Inspired by the beloved 1951 film, Wheeldon has created what might best be described as a story ballet on steroids. Everything in this new musical moves — from the actors (two of whom just happen to be world class dancers), to the fabulously “choreographed” projection-enhanced sets and costumes...And even when the dialogue falls a bit flat, the story is in such perpetual motion that words seem almost beside the point. Dance is the only language really needed here.\"\n\nRead more",

However, this is a single curated excerpt with limited context, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's dynamic movement and visual elements, suggesting a strong positive impression despite some flat dialogue. The language used is enthusiastic, indicating a high positive score. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights the show's perpetual motion, world-class dancers, and choreographed sets and costumes, indicating a positive experience, especially for those who appreciate dance. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the visual spectacle and choreography ('story ballet on steroids', 'world class dancers') with only minor reservation about dialogue, indicating a clearly positive recommendation despite limited text availability.",
