  "bwwExcerpt": "The breathtaking new Broadway musical inspired from Vincente Minnelli's 1951 film An American In Paris is not ballet choreographerChristopher Wheeldon's first Broadway credit, but it's his first as a director/choreographer, and one can't help thinking of the greatest work of Robbins as dramatic stage pictures and ravishing movements swiftly and effectively reveal emotions that would require pages of dialogue. It isn't just the dancing that's impressive; it's how Wheeldon places the evening in a heightened reality that embraces a people's desire to wake from a nightmare and get back to the business of artistic creation.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with 'breathtaking' and comparisons to legendary Robbins, plus acclaim for Wheeldon's direction. However, single excerpt warning requires caution - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlative language ('breathtaking', 'ravishing movements') and compares the work to the greatest of Robbins, suggesting a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, with only a single excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses phrases like \"breathtaking\" and \"ravishing movements\" to describe the show, indicating a positive assessment. The critic highlights Wheeldon's direction and choreography as impressive. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains superlatives ('breathtaking,' 'ravishing') and favorably compares the production to Jerome Robbins' greatest work, indicating strong enthusiasm. Scored at upper end of Positive bucket per single-excerpt guidelines.",
