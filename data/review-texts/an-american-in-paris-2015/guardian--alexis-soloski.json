  "bwwExcerpt": "Where Wheeldon falters is in pacing and storytelling. Often, the songs, dances and the book all repeat the same plot points. At times, the action stalls while the actors move. And an act 2 revelation about Lise's involvement with Henri's family is lavishly unshocking. But if you can ignore the stops and starts, there's so much to enjoy in between, not least some of the Gershwins' greatest hits: You Can't Take That Away from Me, The Man I Love, But Not for Me, I Got Rhythm.",
