  "fullText": "Let’s get some uncomfortable truths out of the way: An American in Paris is a Broadway adaptation of a Hollywood movie. It is a jukebox musical. Its leads are not renowned for their acting and singing abilities; the director is untried. As Adam (Brandon Uranowitz), a New York composer limping through the City of Light, says, “How do you say bleougghhhh in French?” Mais, non! As directed by the choreographer Christopher Wheeldon and starring the dancers Robert Fairchild and Leanne Cope, An American in Paris is a fine and fanciful entertainment. It redecorates the 1951 Vincente Minnelli musical with a new book by Craig Lucas, and plenty of extra tunes. It has sublime songs and dexterous dancing. ’S wonderful? ’S marvellous? ’S nearly. A nearly wordless prologue shows how a demobbed Jerry ditches his boat home in favour of an uncertain future in Paris, sketchpad in hand. Soon, he teams up with nebbish Adam and reticent Henri (Max von Essen), a mama’s boy with deep pockets and cabaret dreams. They’re all more or less involved with the lithe Lise (Cope), a shopgirl turned ballerina. It’s her they sing ’S Wonderful about, each in his own little pool of light, each unaware of the other’s affections. A friend of mine, anxious for the outcome, leaned over and whispered, “This can’t end well.” But it does. Mostly. As befits a choreographer of Wheeldon’s stature, An American in Paris understands that dance is a language all its own, not merely punctuation or something to do during the bridge. Sometimes his choreography is serious, sometimes (as in Fidgety Feet, which is basically a song about being bored at the theatre) it is funny, and in moments such as those when Lise leaps into Jerry’s arms, it is simply divine. Neither Cope nor Fairchild has a voice that’s big enough for Broadway, though each sings pleasantly. But can they dance! Fairchild is especially skilful at telling story through movement, at times you can see his body determining and prompting his emotions. His shirts are so tight that his next pectoral workout might rip them wide. And would that be so wrong? The story, as well as Bob Crowley’s costumes, allows the men and women equal shares in eroticism. There’s something here for everyone. Well, maybe everyone except French-accent enthusiasts. Where Wheeldon falters is in pacing and storytelling. Often, the songs, dances and the book all repeat the same plot points. At times, the action stalls while the actors move. And an act 2 revelation about Lise’s involvement with Henri’s family is lavishly unshocking. But if you can ignore the stops and starts, there’s so much to enjoy in between, not least some of the Gershwins’ greatest hits: You Can’t Take That Away from Me, The Man I Love, But Not for Me, I Got Rhythm. Jill Paice, as the wealthy socialite Milo, gives a lush rendition of Shall We Dance? And really, why not take her advice? “Put on your dancing shoes,” she counsels. “And watch your spirits rise.” Currently booking until 22 November 2015. Box office: 00 1 877 250 2929. Venue: Palace theater, New York. We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could support the Guardian at this crucial time for journalism in the US. In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year into his second term, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one. From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump returned to office. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced. While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts. While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel. Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less. But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, we’ll show you far fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you for protecting the free press.",

The positive aspects outweigh the negatives, leading to a solid recommendation. | Gemini: Despite some reservations about pacing and storytelling, the review is overall positive, praising the songs, dancing, and performances. The critic calls it a \"fine and fanciful entertainment.\" | Kimi: The review opens with acknowledged concerns (jukebox musical, untried director, non-singer leads) but delivers a clear positive verdict: 'fine and fanciful entertainment' with 'sublime songs and dexterous dancing.' The critic praises Wheeldon's choreography as 'simply divine' and Fairchild's storytelling through movement, while noting pacing and storytelling flaws. The closing invitation to 'take her advice' and 'watch your spirits rise' confirms a recommendation, though qualified by 'nearly' and explicit caveats about vocal limitations and structural issues.",
