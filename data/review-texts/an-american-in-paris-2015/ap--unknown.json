  "bwwExcerpt": "The exuberant new musical is helmed with panache by best director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon. Gloriously inventive and balletic, it has an intriguing new book by Tony-nominee and Pulitzer Prize finalist Craig Lucas... Scenery and costumes by Tony-winner Bob Crowley are bold and witty, with inventive props whirling around amid the dancers, such as artfully aged mirrors to simulate a ballet studio.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('exuberant', 'panache', 'gloriously inventive') with praise for direction, choreography, book, and design. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the tone is clearly enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt uses highly positive language such as 'exuberant', 'gloriously inventive', and 'bold and witty', indicating a strong recommendation. The praise for the director and creative team suggests a high level of enthusiasm. | Gemini: The review excerpt is filled with positive descriptors such as \"exuberant\", \"panache\", \"gloriously inventive\", \"bold\", and \"witty\", indicating a strong positive recommendation. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the direction ('helmed with panache'), choreography ('gloriously inventive and balletic'), and design ('bold and witty'), indicating a strong recommendation. However, confidence is low as this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's verdict.",
