These elements, like every aspect of 'An American in Paris,' are sustained in perfect balance by Wheeldon. C’est magnifique.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning suggests upper range of Positive bucket, but medium confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives like 'breathtaking', 'effervescent delight', and 'perfect balance', indicating strong praise. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses very positive language such as \"remarkably effective\", \"breathtaking\", \"thoroughly effervescent delight\", and \"C’est magnifique\" to describe the show, indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the book, choreography, and production design, calling the show an 'effervescent delight' and 'magnifique,' though as a single curated excerpt, the full review context is unknown.",
