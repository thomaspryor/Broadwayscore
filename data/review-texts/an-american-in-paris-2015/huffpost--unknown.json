  "bwwExcerpt": "Christopher Wheeldon's choreography for An American in Paris, at the Palace, is so spectacular that you have to forgive anything else wrong with the production--and believe you me, there's plenty to forgive... Featuring New York City Ballet soloist Robert Fairchild and the Royal Ballet's Leanne Cope in a thrilling pas de deux that you wish could go on forever, it's one of the highest lights of a 2014-2015 season notable for more and better dancing than has been seen for years.",
