  "bwwExcerpt": "Fairchild recalls Kelly somewhat in his sturdy, deceptively wholesome presence. Reprising Kelly's role as Jerry Mulligan, an aspiring painter who lingers in France after serving the USA in World War II, Fairchild looks and carries himself like a college athlete. He moves so cleanly and with such ease that you may not notice at first how instinctively, and seductively, he responds to the jazz nuances in George Gershwin's glorious music.",
