The original 87 rating supports positive territory. | GPT-4o: The review praises the adaptation for capturing the original's essence, despite a minor reservation about matching Gene Kelly's charisma. The original rating of 87 supports a strong positive classification. | Gemini: The review is positive, highlighting the show's romantic sweep and visual splendor, but notes it doesn't quite match Gene Kelly's charisma. This suggests a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The critic praises the lavish production for successfully capturing the original film's romantic sweep and visual splendor, with only a minor reservation about matching the original star's charisma. The provided original rating of 87 confirms this falls in the Rave range.",
