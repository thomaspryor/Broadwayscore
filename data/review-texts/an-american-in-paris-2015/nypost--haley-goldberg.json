    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising design elements (gorgeous costumes/sets, effective projections). However, with only one curated quote available, this may not represent the full review verdict. Scored conservatively in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the visual elements of the production, suggesting a positive impression. However, with only a single excerpt available, the overall sentiment of the review is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the positive aspects of the production design, suggesting a favorable, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, review. Given it's a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the production design using strong positive language ('gorgeous'), indicating a recommendation in the upper Positive range, though the single-excerpt limitation prevents higher confidence or a Rave classification.",
