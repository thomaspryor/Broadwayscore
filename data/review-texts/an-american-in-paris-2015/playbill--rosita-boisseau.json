    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Extremely positive language (\"cloud nine\", \"exhilaration\", \"true miracle\", \"hell of a pleasure\") suggests a rave, but confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, describing the show as a 'true miracle' and a 'hell of a pleasure,' suggesting a highly enthusiastic recommendation. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language indicates a rave review. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using phrases like \"walking on cloud nine,\" \"exhilaration,\" \"golden reputation,\" and \"hell of a pleasure.\" Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I scored it high in the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise ('true miracle', 'hell of a pleasure', 'walking on cloud nine') indicating strong enthusiasm for the production. However, as a single curated excerpt, it may not represent the full review's balance, warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket rather than Rave. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
