Single excerpt warning requires caution, but language is clearly positive with superlatives. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('truly thrilling', 'high class and polish') and describes the production as thoroughly realized and absorbing, indicating a highly favorable review. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"truly thrilling\", \"high class and polish\", and \"thoroughly realised\", indicating a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strongly positive evaluative language ('truly thrilling', 'high class', 'completely absorbed') indicating clear enthusiasm for the production's artistic integration, though limited context requires conservative scoring at upper end of Positive range per excerpt guidelines.",
