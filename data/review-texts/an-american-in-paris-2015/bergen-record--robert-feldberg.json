  "bwwExcerpt": "Fresh-faced, attractive and amusing, Fairchild holds the stage in leading-man style. He acts effectively and sings remarkably well. Cope, whose dark, gamine good looks suggest the film's Leslie Caron, has perhaps less acting range, but she can sing and is thoroughly appealing. Their dancing is exhilarating, especially in the big 'American in Paris' ballet, which begins and ends as a performance piece by Lise's ballet company, with a romantic middle of Lise and Jerry conveying their growing relationship.",
