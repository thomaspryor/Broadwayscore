    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('bold, satisfying and witty', 'love letter to the great American musical') with specific praise for choreography and production numbers. Single excerpt warning applied - using upper end of Positive range due to clearly enthusiastic tone. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('bold, satisfying and witty') and praises the production as a 'love letter' to musicals. Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone suggests a strong positive impression. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"bold, satisfying and witty\" and describes the routines as \"life-enhancing\" and \"grand and splashy\". Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I'm placing it in the upper range of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers strong praise ('bold, satisfying and witty', 'life-enhancing', 'love letter') for the choreography and production numbers, indicating clear enthusiasm, though limited context warrants reduced confidence.",
