Single excerpt warning applies - this appears genuinely enthusiastic, so scoring upper end of Positive bucket, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language like 'sublime,' 'gloriously inventive,' and 'enchanted,' suggesting a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"sublime\", \"panache\", \"gloriously inventive\", and \"heartfelt romance\", suggesting a strong recommendation. However, it is only one excerpt, so confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise using words like 'sublime,' 'gloriously inventive,' and 'enchanted,' indicating an enthusiastic recommendation for this production. Confidence is low due to limited excerpt availability.",
