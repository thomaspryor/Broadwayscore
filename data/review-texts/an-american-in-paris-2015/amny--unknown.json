  "bwwExcerpt": "Lucas stresses the cultural tensions in postwar Paris, bringing up the painful stains of Nazi occupation... Though heavy-handed and drawn out, he deserves credit for trying to add depth to the film rather than simply recreating it or sanitizing it (i.e. 'Gigi'). Regardless of the book, the music is glorious, the visuals are innovative and the performances are top-rate.",
