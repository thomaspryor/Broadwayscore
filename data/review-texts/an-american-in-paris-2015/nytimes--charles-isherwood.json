Even the elegant buildings on the grand boulevards appear to take flight... 'An American in Paris' is very much a traditional Broadway musical, with a book by the playwright Craig Lucas that amplifies the movie's thin story line, mostly to witty and vivifying effect.",

  "fullText": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/theater/review-an-american-in-paris-a-romance-of-song-and-step.htmlShare full article74Advertisement\n\nThe city of light is ablaze with movement in the rhapsodic new stage adaptation of “An American in Paris” that opened at the Palace Theater on Sunday, directed and choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon, a gifted luminary of the ballet world. This gorgeously danced — and just plain gorgeous — production pays loving tribute to the 1951 movie, to the marriage of music and movement, and to cherished notions about romance that have been a defining element of the American musical theater practically since its inception. Just about everything in this happily dance-drunk show moves with a spring in its step, as if the newly liberated Paris after World War II were an enchanted place in which the laws of gravity no longer applied. Even the elegant buildings on the grand boulevards appear to take flight.\n\nMusicals based on classic movies, or not-so-classic movies, have become a familiar staple on Broadway. Just last week, “Gigi,” another show based on an Oscar-winning MGM movie set in Paris — also featuring a screenplay by Alan Jay Lerner — opened a few blocks away. Dance, on the other hand, has become the wallflower at the Broadway prom in recent decades, which makes Mr. Wheeldon’s triumph all the sweeter.\n\nStill, unlike the shows directed and choreographed by Twyla Tharp — “Movin’ Out” being the most successful — “An American in Paris” is very much a traditional Broadway musical, with a book by the playwright Craig Lucas that amplifies the movie’s thin story line, mostly to witty and vivifying effect. And while its two radiant leading performers, Robert Fairchild and Leanne Cope, are ballet dancers by profession, they also sing (quite well) and deliver dialogue (more than quite well).\n\nAn almost equal collaborator with Mr. Wheeldon and Mr. Lucas is the great designer Bob Crowley, who provides both the sets and costumes, and whose work here outshines anything currently on Broadway in its blend of elegance, wit and sophistication. With its shimmering, poetic renderings of one of the world’s most beautiful cities — boats floating in the Seine awash in starlight, pink clouds scudding over the rooftops at dusk — the musical is as rich a visual feast as it is a musical one.\n\nSpeaking of music, by now I should probably have tipped my hat to the artist who inspired all this affectionate invention: George Gershwin, whose songbook and concert compositions provide the whirring engine that drives all the exuberant motion onstage. (Not incidentally, the music has been adapted and arranged with incomparable finesse by Rob Fisher, the founding music director of the Encores! series.) As in the movie, the titular composition is employed for the show’s climactic ballet, but the musical also includes a good dozen Gershwin tunes, classics and rarities alike (“The Man I Love,” but also “Fidgety Feet”), most newly interpolated into the story.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",
