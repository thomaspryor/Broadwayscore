  "bwwExcerpt": "Just about everything in this happily dance-drunk show moves with a spring in its step, as if the newly liberated Paris after World War II were an enchanted place in which the laws of gravity no longer applied. Even the elegant buildings on the grand boulevards appear to take flight... 'An American in Paris' is very much a traditional Broadway musical, with a book by the playwright Craig Lucas that amplifies the movie's thin story line, mostly to witty and vivifying effect.",
