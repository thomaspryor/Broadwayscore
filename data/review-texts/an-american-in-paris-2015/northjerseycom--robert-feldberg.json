Single excerpt warning noted - scored in upper positive range given consistently enthusiastic tone. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides highly positive language, describing the show as 'colorful, charming, dazzlingly danced' and a 'marvelous journey.' Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using words like \"colorful, charming, dazzlingly danced\" and \"marvelous journey.\" Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I'm scoring it high in the positive range. | Kimi: The single excerpt contains strong unequivocal praise ('dazzlingly danced,' 'marvelous journey,' 'swell evening') with no reservations, indicating an enthusiastic recommendation for the current Broadway production.",
