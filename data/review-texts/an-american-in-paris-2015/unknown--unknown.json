  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The city of light is ablaze with movement in the rhapsodic new stage adaptation of “An American in Paris.” This gorgeously danced — and just plain gorgeous — production pays loving tribute to the 1951 movie, to the marriage of music and movement, and to cherished notions about romance that have been a defining element of the American musical theater practically since its inception. Just about everything in this happily dance-drunk show moves with a spring in its step.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt is clearly enthusiastic with superlatives ('rhapsodic', 'gorgeously danced', 'gorgeous', 'happily dance-drunk') and no caveats. However, confidence is low because this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly positive language ('rhapsodic', 'gorgeously danced', 'loving tribute') and suggests an enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using words like \"rhapsodic,\" \"gorgeously danced,\" and \"happily dance-drunk.\" Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I'm placing it in the upper range of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong, unqualified praise for the production's choreography and visual splendor, describing it as 'rhapsodic' and 'gorgeous.' Following the guidance for clearly positive single excerpts, this falls in the upper Positive range despite the limited context.",
