    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong superlative language ('one of the most extraordinary and spectacular works...in many years') indicates enthusiastic praise. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt limitation - the full review verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the director/choreographer's work, calling it 'extraordinary and spectacular'. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt contains very strong positive language, calling the show \"extraordinary and spectacular.\" Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise calling the work 'extraordinary,' 'spectacular,' and 'utterly alive,' indicating a clear recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced per instructions. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
