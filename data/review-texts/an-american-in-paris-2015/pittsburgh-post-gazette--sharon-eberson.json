With exquisite performances and aesthetics, this ballet-musical theater hybrid makes good on a title with Oscar-winning clout. The similarities don’t end there — but this adaptation goes its own way and then some, with an innovative approach to staging and a breathtaking melding of art forms.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it a 'gem' with 'exquisite performances' and 'breathtaking melding of art forms,' but confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a 'gem' with 'exquisite performances and aesthetics' and highlights its 'innovative approach to staging,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, the confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using phrases like \"gem,\" \"exquisite performances,\" \"breathtaking melding of art forms,\" and \"innovative approach to staging.\" Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I am scoring it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly positive language including 'gem,' 'exquisite,' and 'breathtaking' to praise the performances, aesthetics, and staging innovation. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive curated quotes, this warrants a high Positive score, though confidence remains low due to limited text availability.",
