  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Any one of Wheeldon’s dances packs more content, smarts, and finesse than practically all the book scenes put together...When you can convey so much through pure physical expression—with a slight assist from Gershwin’s “Second Rhapsody” and “Cuban Overture”—words seem somehow insufficient.

Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Wheeldon's choreography but criticizes the script as 'plodding' and 'paint-by-numbers'. The positive elements are overshadowed by significant criticism of the book, indicating a mixed review. | Gemini: The review praises the dances but criticizes the script, suggesting a mixed experience. Given the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the choreography while explicitly criticizing the book as 'plodding' and 'especially insufficient,' indicating a sharply divided response with notable strengths and significant weaknesses.",
