  "fullText": "Hailed as a comeback for dance in musical theater, the arrival of An American in Paris and acclaimed director-choreographer Christopher Wheeldon on Broadway in March 2015 was a breath of springtime air in other ways too. The cast of classically trained ballet dancers could somehow — almost magically — sing as splendidly as many Broadway veterans. And they could act. And tell jokes!\n\nMeanwhile, between their lighter-than-air leaps, there was also another visual bounty: sets that appeared to float, a river that actually rippled and costumes that transported audiences straight back to the 1951 Oscar-winning movie on which this stage musical is based, director Vincente Minnelli’s masterpiece starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron.\n\nThe touring production now at the Pantages through April 9 continues the magic of its 18-month Broadway run, which landed 12 Tony nominations, winning for choreography, scenic design, lighting and orchestrations. Ascending to the leading roles of Jerry and Lise are original ensemble members Garen Scribner and Sara Esty, former soloists with the San Francisco Ballet and Miami City Ballet, respectively. Both had been alternates in the starring roles on Broadway, and their experience shows.\n\nGraceful and assured, they are a winning romantic pair — but not before overthrowing the usual Broadway barricades. Jerry, the American ex-G.I. now a painter on the post-World War II Paris art scene, is not the only man who aches for Lise. There’s also the show’s lovelorn narrator Adam, a wonderful turn from Etai Benson as the composer who sheds his nebbishy persona when he brings the brilliant Gershwin score to life. And there’s the occasionally dashing Henri (Nick Spangler), a sensitive textile heir who yearns to be a song-and-dance man against his parents’ wishes.\n\nAll the men are artists with a message for the world, as resonant today as it was back then: If you can create something of beauty, don’t hold back.\n\nLise, our ballerina and shopgirl with a secret past, sets the story in motion when she wows at a dance audition. Pushy philanthropist Milo Davenport (Emily Ferranti) is so moved she wants to fund a new ballet in which Lise will star, also creating a canvas for Jerry’s scenic art and Adam’s music. These contrivances and other weaknesses in the book by Craig Lucas are forgiven, as the show adroitly depicts 1940s Paris awakening from war, its hungover citizens both exhausted and exhilarated.\n\nThis is most apparent when Jerry cartwheels over a park bench on the banks of the Seine. Bounding into thin air with hang-time for days, his optimism soars through Wheeldon’s sublime choreography. Scribner, wisely channeling Kelly’s macho charms only in spurts, places his own stamp on the role with glorious grand jetes and a fine singing voice.\n\nEsty, too, is a marvel, putting over her big vocal number — “The Man I Love” — as if she’d trained all her life for a music career instead. With her adorable chic bob she looks a bit like Caron, but overall seems sprung from the serene DNA of Audrey Hepburn. Who knew there were so many multifaceted performers in the ranks of America’s finest ballet companies?\n\nThe show’s stand-out voice belongs to Spangler, whose Henri takes “I Got Rhythm” from elegy to party anthem as the three men cement their friendship. His singing is the saving grace of “I’ll Build a Stairway to Paradise,” an ornate fantasy in which the Pantages transforms into Radio City Music Hall, complete with dancers in shimmering bikinis and feather boas. But the so-so tapping is the one weak dance link here, and the result is not quite the showstopper it should be.\n\nRedemption follows, however, with the evening’s emotional centerpiece, the “American In Paris” ballet — an 18-minute show-within-a-show set to the familiar George Gershwin orchestral composition, with its bold jazz influences and Paris taxi horns. Set against designer Bob Crowley’s modernist costumes and nuanced set, the piece seemed to transport Thursday’s opening-night audience to another place and time.\n\nThe length, detail and sheer scope of that stand-alone ballet place it among the most demanding Broadway dance numbers ever staged. To allow the leads some relief, ensemble member Ryan Steele steps in for Scribner at some matinees and Sunday shows, and for Esty what more perfect sub could there be than her own twin sister, Leigh-Ann Esty, also of Miami City Ballet.\n\nRounding out all this greatness are additional Gershwin classics — “‘S Wonderful,” “But Not for Me” and \"They Can’t Take That Away From Me” — plus stunning visual effects created by 59 Productions, which permit the whole thing to be pulled off with a minimalist twist. Barring a trip across the Atlantic, there’s probably no better way to visit Paris this spring.\n\nThe North American tour continues through July 1, 2018, stopping next in Las Vegas from April 11-16. A London production recently opened at the West End’s Dominion Theatre, starring original Broadway leads Robert Fairchild and Leanne Cope.\n\nVenue: Pantages Theatre, Los Angeles\n Cast: Garen Scribner, Sara Esty, Etai Benson, Emily Ferranti, Gayton Scott, Nick Spangler, Ryan Steele, Leigh-Ann Esty\n Director-choreographer: Christopher Wheeldon\n Music & lyrics: George and Ira Gershwin\n Book: Craig Lucas, inspired by the movie\n Set & costume designer: Bob Crowley\n Lighting designer: Natasha Katz\n Sound designer: Jon Weston\n Projection designer: 59 Productions\n Music director: David Andrews Rogers\n Orchestrations: Christopher Austin and Bill Elliott\n Musical score adaptation, arrangement & supervision: Rob Fisher\n Presented by Stuart Oken, Van Kaplan, Roy Furman, Troika Entertainment, Stephanie P.

  "bwwExcerpt": "Now comes ballet luminary Christopher Wheeldon, taking an exhilarating leap as director-choreographer with An American in Paris, another show indelibly associated with a classic MGM movie musical. Not only is Wheeldon's nuanced command of storytelling through dance front and center, the production also foregrounds a triple-threat revelation in NYC Ballet principal Robert Fairchild, who proves himself more than capable of following in the suave footsteps of Gene Kelly.",

  "wrongFullText": "The Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) says its become the first western media group to operate a Chinese registered web portal after it launched AustraliaPlus.cn on Wednesday in Shanghai, offering a mixture of Australian content aimed at a mainland Chinese audience as well as Chinese living in Australia.\n\nThe portal carries Chinese language stories about Australia covering business, education and travel as well as a selection of ABC English language programs including documentary, drama and children’s fare.\n\nThe service is run in partnership with the Shanghai Media Group, and follows the signing of a free trade agreement between the two nations last year. It also follows the closure of the long running Australia Network pan Asian satellite TV service, on September 2014, after the current conservative government scrapped the service's funding.\n\nABC International chief executive officer Lynley Marshall said AustraliaPlus.cn \"gives the nation an important new gateway through which to connect to millions of Chinese. We now have the ability to engage directly with our Chinese audiences from within China supported by our valued Chinese partners.\"\n\nPresident of the Shanghai Media Group, Madame Wang Jianjun, also welcomed the launch.\n\n“The ABC and the Shanghai Media Group have been long term international partners and we have over the past run TV weeks for each other for many years, and we are making progress on other aspects in our partnership,\" Madame Wang said. \" We warmly congratulate them on this new achievement they have made.\"\n\nWith an eye on the soft diplomacy benefits of the new service, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott added: \"the potential for Australia’s relationship with China to grow and prosper has never been greater and the launch tonight is a testament to the high degree of respect for Australia and for the ABC within China.\"\n\nContent on the site includes a focus on Australian lifestyle, travel, studying and doing business in Australia, career opportunities, financial, business and sports news. Australian culture is showcased through programs and stories on ABC International's partners such as the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and the Queensland Ballet. The site also will also carry the world premiere of the Bobbie the Bear live action kids series – featuring a lavender bear from Bridestowe Estate, Tasmania that's caused a sensation across China.\n\nABC International signed an extended international media agreement with the Shanghai Media Group (SMG), in June last year and currently has 16 syndication and co-production partnerships with Chinese TV, radio and online organizations including CCTV, Beijing TV, China Daily Online, Tencent QQ, Sina and Youku.",
