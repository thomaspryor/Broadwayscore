  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"It's a well-written book. The musical score is pure Gershwin. There are some great vocals. But that is not why people will flock to this musical — Its all about the dance — even the sets dance — things float, cross, move, flutter, sometimes all at the same time...This is not your typical Broadway musical — this is ballet set upon a Broadway stage, and it is simply remarkable...Come for the musical — stay for the ballet — and absolutely get tickets to this stunner of a show.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong recommendation with superlatives ('simply remarkable', 'stunner') and clear directive to 'absolutely get tickets'. However, single excerpt warning reduces confidence despite rave language. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise, highlighting the unique blend of ballet and Broadway, and strongly recommends seeing the show. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly positive, using words like \"great,\" \"remarkable,\" and \"stunner.\" The critic clearly recommends seeing the show, especially for the dance elements. | Kimi: The excerpt features strong praise ('simply remarkable,' 'stunner') and an explicit imperative to buy tickets, warranting an upper-range Positive score. However, confidence is low due to the single-excerpt warning about potential cherry-picking. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
