  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"To paraphrase from one of the many gorgeous Gershwin tunes: It's got rhythm...it's got music...and it's got superb dancers and colorful, eye-popping settings for them to strut their fleet-footed stuff. Bottom line: It's a Wow!...The dancing in this new An American in Paris is sublime. Add the lovely, ear-hugging Gershwin tunes, the stunning stage craft and performances — and what you've got is a theatrical sweetshop filled to the brim with delectable eye and ear candy.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Clear rave language with 'Wow!', 'sublime', 'stunning', and 'delectable' describing multiple production elements. However, only excerpt available so confidence reduced. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly enthusiastic language, praising the production as 'a Wow!' and 'sublime,' with no reservations mentioned. Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone is clearly a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using phrases like \"sublime,\" \"stunning,\" and \"theatrical sweetshop.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring at the higher end of the positive range, but lowering the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers an enthusiastic verdict ('Wow!', 'sublime') with glowing praise for the dancing, Gershwin tunes, and staging, indicating a strong recommendation despite limited context. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
