    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance with sophisticated language about authenticity and emotional depth. However, this appears to be a truncated excerpt focusing only on the star, so confidence is medium due to limited scope. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the lead performance, praising its authenticity and depth. Given the original rating of 87, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with a score reflecting strong praise, but lowering confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: This brief excerpt offers unqualified praise for the lead performance using superlatives ('lived-in authenticity', 'beyond mere impersonation'), and the provided original rating of 87 confirms placement in the Rave bucket despite the truncated length.",
