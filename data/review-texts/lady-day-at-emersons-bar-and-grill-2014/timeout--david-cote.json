    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performance with superlatives like 'extraordinary' and 'masterclass', but this appears to be a brief excerpt focusing only on the star rather than a complete review assessment. | GPT-4o: The review offers high praise for McDonald's performance, describing it as a 'masterclass'. However, due to the brevity of the text, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"extraordinary vocal power\" and \"masterclass in performance\", indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives ('extraordinary', 'masterclass') to deliver unqualified praise for both the lead performance and the production quality, indicating an enthusiastic recommendation despite the text's brevity. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
