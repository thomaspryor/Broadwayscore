    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performance with powerful language like 'devastating authenticity' and 'inhabits them,' but this appears to be a brief excerpt lacking broader production assessment. | Gemini: The review praises the performance of McDonald, stating she inhabits the songs and channels the singer's pain and passion. This indicates a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlative praise for the central performance ('devastating authenticity'), indicating an enthusiastic recommendation, though the limited excerpt reduces confidence about the full review's verdict.",
