    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for performances ('powerhouse') and calls the revival 'riveting', but this appears to be a very brief excerpt with limited evaluative content, hence low confidence. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language ('powerhouse performances', 'riveting revival') suggesting a highly favorable view. However, the text is very brief, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses the word \"riveting\" and \"powerhouse performances\" which indicates a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong unqualified praise for both the performances ('powerhouse') and the production itself ('riveting'), indicating an enthusiastic recommendation despite the brevity of the available text.",
