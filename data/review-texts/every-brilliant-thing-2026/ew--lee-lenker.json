  "bwwExcerpt": "Everybody's Talking About Jamie is a glitter-coated tribute to living life loudly and proudly as your truest self, naysayers be damned. In its sparkle, it's also a welcome escape from reality. The culture it presents trades in appearances and concealment, transforming and exposing in equal measure - yet ironically, the show's weakest moments often arrive when it tries to peel away the wigs and the bright-blue eyelashes to say something profound. Still, no one can say it's a drag.",
