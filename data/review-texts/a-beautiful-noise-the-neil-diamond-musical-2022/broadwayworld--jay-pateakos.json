  "bwwExcerpt": "\"A Beautiful Noise: The Neil Diamond Musical\" is a near-perfect stroll down memory lane for many of us, a reunification of the songs that made us during times we needed them the most.  The production features a remarkable 29 of Diamond's best hits.  We may have been robbed of seeing Diamond, 83, ever play again with his 2018 Parkinson's Diagnosis, but this musical brings it all back.  You'll marvel at how incredible Fradiani is as Diamond, \"Play Me\" was a close second to \"You Don't Bring Me Flow",
