  "bwwExcerpt": "A stellar supporting cast is assembled here in the first act (this psychological look at the Diamond persona reminded me a bit of the musical MJ) including an affecting quiet performance by Lisa Reneé Pitts as the therapist. A highly captivating performance by Hannah Jewel Kohn steals the show as Ms. Kohn “knocked it out of the park” with magnetic stage presence and a sensational soaring voice. As wife Marcia Murphey, Ms. Kohn delivered a poignant rendition of “Play Me” and a scintillating power",

Single excerpt warning and truncation make confidence low, but praise is enthusiastic enough for upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong praise for the performances, particularly Hannah Jewel Kohn's, using superlatives like 'knocked it out of the park' and 'sensational.' The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the supporting cast, particularly Hannah Jewel Kohn's performance, and uses positive language like \"highly captivating\" and \"sensational.\" While it's just an excerpt, the tone suggests a positive, albeit potentially qualified, recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the supporting cast using superlatives like 'stellar,' 'steals the show,' and 'sensational,' indicating a strong positive recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
