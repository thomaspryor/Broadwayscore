    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes effective entertainment value but notes the show 'goes somewhat overboard' with production elements. Qualified positive recommendation with caveats about excess. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the show's entertainment value, despite noting some excesses. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt is positive, but the phrase \"at its best\" and the mention of going \"somewhat overboard\" suggest reservations. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as a lower positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the show's entertainment value while criticizing its excessive styling and 'evangelical flavor.' As a single curated excerpt, the confidence is low, but the tone suggests a lukewarm recommendation focused on competent showmanship rather than theatrical excellence.",
