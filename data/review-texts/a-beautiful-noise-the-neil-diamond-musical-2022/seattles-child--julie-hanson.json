  "bwwExcerpt": "“The Neil Diamond Musical: A Beautiful Noise,” here for a brief run at Seattle’s Paramount Theatre, is full of song, dance, drama, and emotion. It is very lively, and occasionally heavy. For that reason, while I wholeheartedly endorse it for any Neil Diamond fan or music lover of a certain age, I can’t really say it’s a good fit for kids.",
