  "bwwExcerpt": "The real magic of A Beautiful Noise, though, lies in the ensemble work and creative direction. Director Michael Mayer keeps things moving at a brisk pace, blending past and present with sleek transitions and concert-style flourishes. The choreography by Steven Hoggett leans more toward expressive movement than traditional musical theatre dance, which suits the introspective tone of some of the show’s quieter moments.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clear praise for direction, pacing, and creative elements. However, limited text makes full verdict assessment difficult, hence low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the ensemble work and creative direction, highlighting the director's effective pacing and choreography. Despite the single excerpt warning, the positive language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the direction, choreography, and ensemble work, indicating a positive experience, but the lack of a full review and explicit recommendation necessitates a lower confidence and a score in the middle of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the direction, choreography, and ensemble with words like 'magic,' 'brisk,' and 'sleek,' indicating a solid recommendation, though as a single curated excerpt the full context is unknown.",
