  "bwwExcerpt": "The real magic of A Beautiful Noise, though, lies in the ensemble work and creative direction. Director Michael Mayer keeps things moving at a brisk pace, blending past and present with sleek transitions and concert-style flourishes. The choreography by Steven Hoggett leans more toward expressive movement than traditional musical theatre dance, which suits the introspective tone of some of the show’s quieter moments.",
