    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Critic explicitly calls it 'lukewarm' but acknowledges it will appeal to fans and notes audience engagement. This suggests a qualified, conditional recommendation - classic mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'lukewarm', indicating a mixed reception, but notes it will appeal to fans, suggesting some positive elements. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The review states the show will appeal to fans, which indicates a positive recommendation, but the 'lukewarm look' suggests reservations. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic explicitly calls the show 'lukewarm' and limits its appeal to existing fans, indicating a middling verdict with niche appeal rather than a broad recommendation.",
