Acknowledges flaws but recommends for the concert experience. Single excerpt warning applied with lower positive score. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges structural unevenness but emphasizes the show's success in delivering an engaging concert experience. The positive tone and vivid imagery of audience engagement suggest a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges imperfections but ultimately recommends the show as a worthwhile concert experience, indicating a positive but not rave review. The single excerpt and \"flat\" aggregator verdict suggest a score on the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: While acknowledging the musical has structural unevenness and isn't perfect, the critic praises it as a 'pretty fantastic concert experience' that succeeds in delivering exuberant spectacle and audience engagement, ending on a high note with enthusiastic participation.",
