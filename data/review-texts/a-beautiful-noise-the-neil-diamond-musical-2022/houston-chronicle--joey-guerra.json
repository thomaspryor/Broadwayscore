  "bwwExcerpt": "\"A Beautiful Noise\" isn't a perfect musical, but it is a pretty fantastic concert experience. Despite the structural unevenness, the show succeeds where it matters most — delivering the exuberant spectacle of a Neil Diamond concert. By the time the company launches into a final, soaring rendition of \"Sweet Caroline,\" you'll be out of your seat and singing along.",
