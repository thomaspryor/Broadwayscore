  "bwwExcerpt": "The show was fantastically entertaining. I and the people around me left the theater singing, humming, and dancing. But we also left with a much deeper understanding of Neil Diamond’s songs and lyrics and a greater appreciation for the man behind the American idol, and of our shared humanity.",

Single excerpt warning noted, but tone is clearly enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a strongly positive impression, describing the show as 'fantastically entertaining' and highlighting the audience's enthusiastic response. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a very positive experience, with the audience leaving the theater singing and dancing. The critic also mentions a deeper understanding and appreciation, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic language ('fantastically entertaining') and describes a highly positive audience response, though as a single curated excerpt, the overall verdict may not be fully represented.",
