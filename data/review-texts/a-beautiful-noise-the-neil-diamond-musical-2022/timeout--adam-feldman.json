The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed assessment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the lack of originality but also notes the power of Diamond's songs, resulting in a mixed assessment. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's 60/100 rating places this firmly in the Mixed range. The single-sentence review balances criticism of the show's lack of originality against acknowledgement that Diamond's songs remain emotionally effective.",
