  "bwwExcerpt": "Dan DeLuca, Philadelphia Inquirer: The show works partly because Fradiani is believable enough as Diamond goes from wracked-with-doubt — he thinks “Neil Diamond” is a lousy stage name — to being bedazzled with sequins as he earns his “Jewish Elvis” nickname in the 1970s. But the best reason for Diamond fans to see A Beautiful Noise is Fradiani’s booming voice, whether on the schmaltzy “You Don’t Bring Me Flowers,” the rousing immigrant anthem “Coming to America,” or “Sweet Caroline.”",
