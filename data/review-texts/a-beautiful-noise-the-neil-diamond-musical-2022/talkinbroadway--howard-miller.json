However, confidence is low due to this being only a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a positive shift in the critic's opinion, suggesting a mild recommendation. However, the limited text and single excerpt warning reduce confidence. | Gemini: The critic states they were \"won over\" which indicates a positive sentiment. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it as a positive review, but with medium confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt provides a clear positive verdict ('won over') indicating the critic recommends the show despite initial skepticism, placing it in the Positive bucket. Confidence is low due to availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
