    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: This appears to be a truncated excerpt. The critic suggests the show succeeds only when it abandons its musical theater aspirations, implying structural problems with the adaptation while acknowledging the songs have nostalgic appeal. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the show is only effective when it focuses on the music, implying that other aspects of the musical may not be as successful. This indicates a mixed review with neither a strong recommendation nor a strong discouragement. | Gemini: The review suggests the show is better when it focuses on the songs, implying the musical aspects are weaker, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic suggests the production has merit when functioning as a vehicle for the songs/nostalgia, but implicitly criticizes its efforts as a fully realized musical with a book. This qualified assessment indicates a mixed reception rather than an enthusiastic recommendation.",

  "wrongFullText": "The show will take us back in time at Rydell High.\n\nParamount has greenlit a new Grease prequel series titled Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies. The show has been picked up for 10 episodes and is the first scripted series order by Paramount Television Studios head Nicole Clemens.\n\nSet four years before the original Grease, Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies is described as follows: \"Before rock ‘n' roll ruled, before the T-Birds were the coolest in the school, four fed-up, outcast girls dare to have fun on their own terms, sparking a moral panic that will change Rydell High forever.\"\n\nGrease, written by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey, debuted on Broadway in 1972 and was made into a feature film in 1978. The big screen adaptation famously starred John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John as star-crossed high school sweethearts Danny and Sandy. Stockard Channing, Didi Conn, Dinah Manoff, and Jamie Donnelly played Sandy's pals, the Pink Ladies. The prequel series will feature new characters not portrayed in the original musical or film.\n\nAnnabel Oakes (Atypical) writes and executive produces, and will also serve as showrunner. Marty Bowen will executive produce under Temple Hill, and Erik Feig will executive produce under Picturestart.\n\nReview: Jason Alexander Leaves a Little Gristle in New Production of Sweeney Todd \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: Manon!, Opera’s Have-It-All Girl \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: In The Porch on Windy Hill, Bluegrass Heals a Broken Family \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: Power Slips Away, One Lear at a Time, in King Lear at La MaMa \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: Blackout Songs, When Your Life Is One Long Night Out \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: Stories of Childhood Told Through Dance in BLACK GIRL: Linguistic Play \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Theater News & discounts\n \n Get the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania's newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre."
