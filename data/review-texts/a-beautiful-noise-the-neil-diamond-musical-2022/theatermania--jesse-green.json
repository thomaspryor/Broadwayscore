    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: This appears to be a truncated excerpt that suggests the show has problems as a musical but succeeds when relying on the source material's songs, indicating mixed reception. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the show has strengths in its musical numbers but implies a lack of coherence or success as a full musical, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review suggests the show is better when it focuses on Diamond's songs, implying the musical aspects are weaker. This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic suggests the production fails at its primary goal of being a coherent musical, only succeeding when it abandons theatrical ambitions for straightforward nostalgia, indicating a 'hit or miss' experience that depends heavily on pre-existing fan attachment to the songs rather than the quality of the staging.",
