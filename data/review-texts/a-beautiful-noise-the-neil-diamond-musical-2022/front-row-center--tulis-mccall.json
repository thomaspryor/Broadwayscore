    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt presents qualified recommendation ('could be a treat') with conditional phrasing ('if you are looking for'). Given single excerpt warning and cautious tone, scored at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive experience for those familiar with the songs, indicating a recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a positive but mild recommendation. The phrase \"could be a treat\" indicates some reservation, so I scored it at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a qualified but clear positive recommendation, calling the show 'a treat' for audiences seeking familiar songs, though the conditional phrasing ('could be', 'if you are looking for') suggests mild rather than strong enthusiasm. Single-excerpt limitation requires low confidence.",
