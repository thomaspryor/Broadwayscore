  "bwwExcerpt": "Joe Caskey leads an outstanding cast as the title role. Caskey's singing is rich and tender, with a gorgeous low range and electric stage presence. Every time Caskey performed a song the audience sat up with rapt attention. This interpretation of Neil Diamond is three-dimensional and full of life. \"Sweet Caroline\", the crowdpleasing Act I finale, was by far one of my favorite moments from the show. It was beautiful to see pathos melt to joy as Neil Diamond discovered his sound and catapulted him",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Enthusiastic praise for the lead performance with words like 'outstanding,' 'gorgeous,' and 'electric stage presence.' However, this is only one excerpt focusing on one performer, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for Joe Caskey's performance and the show, highlighting moments of joy and engagement. The language is enthusiastic, suggesting a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the lead actor's performance and stage presence. The description of the audience's reaction and the reviewer's enjoyment of a key moment suggests a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performance ('outstanding cast', 'electric stage presence', 'rapt attention') and specific musical moments, though as a single curated quote, the full review context is unknown.",
