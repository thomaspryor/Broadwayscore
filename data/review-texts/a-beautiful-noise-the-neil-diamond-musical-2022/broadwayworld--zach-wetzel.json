  "bwwExcerpt": "Joe Caskey leads an outstanding cast as the title role. Caskey's singing is rich and tender, with a gorgeous low range and electric stage presence. Every time Caskey performed a song the audience sat up with rapt attention. This interpretation of Neil Diamond is three-dimensional and full of life. \"Sweet Caroline\", the crowdpleasing Act I finale, was by far one of my favorite moments from the show. It was beautiful to see pathos melt to joy as Neil Diamond discovered his sound and catapulted him",
