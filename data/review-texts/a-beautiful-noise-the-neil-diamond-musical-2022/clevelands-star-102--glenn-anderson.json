    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive verdict with enthusiastic language ('tremendous journey', 'so glad', 'doesn't disappoint'), but low confidence due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is clearly positive, describing the show as a 'tremendous journey' and stating 'A Beautiful Noise doesn’t disappoint.' The tone suggests strong enthusiasm, aligning with a higher score within the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review uses very positive language such as \"tremendous journey\" and \"doesn't disappoint\", indicating a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, I am placing the score towards the higher end of the positive bucket.",
