Mixed verdict with negative lean. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the energy, spectacle, and strong cast but notes it doesn't achieve the emotional impact expected. The single excerpt suggests a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive elements like energy and a strong cast, but ultimately finds the show lacking the emotional impact of similar productions. Given the single excerpt and aggregator verdict, a mixed score seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges strong production values and performances but emphasizes a critical failure to deliver the emotional impact of comparable shows, suggesting an uneven experience rather than a clear recommendation.",
