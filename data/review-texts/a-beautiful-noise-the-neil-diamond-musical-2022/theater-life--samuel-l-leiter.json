    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite acknowledging it's 'not quite as weak as some have made it out to be', the critic concludes it's 'undistinguished' and 'contributes little' - clear negative assessment with some qualification. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, noting the show as 'undistinguished' and contributing 'little' to Broadway. However, the text quality warning indicates the excerpt may not fully represent the review, leading to low confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt states that the show is an \"undistinguished contribution,\" indicating a negative assessment. Given that it is not the weakest show, but still not good, it falls into the negative bucket. | Kimi: While the critic grants the show isn't as terrible as some claim, they ultimately deem it an 'undistinguished contribution' that adds nothing to Broadway, offering no reason to see it.",
