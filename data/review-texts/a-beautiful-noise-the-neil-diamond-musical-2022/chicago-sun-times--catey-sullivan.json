  "bwwExcerpt": "As a fifth grader when “Song Sung Blue” became a hit in 1972, I didn’t know Neil Diamond from Neil Simon, but the song became an obsession. Its juxtaposition between major and minor chords — moving from happy to sad and back — fascinated me. The fingering of the song’s basic guitar chords remains embedded in my brain more than 40 years on.",
