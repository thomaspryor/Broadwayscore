Given only positive language available, scored in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the lead performance with strong positive language, indicating a recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the lead performance with strong positive language, suggesting a positive recommendation. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performance ('charisma, charm, vigor,' 'hits every single note just right'), placing it in the upper Positive range. However, with only one curated excerpt available focusing solely on a single actor rather than the full production, confidence must remain low.",
