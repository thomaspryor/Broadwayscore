However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show as 'sloppy' and lacking a coherent plot, indicating a negative view. However, with only one excerpt, the overall sentiment might not be fully captured, leading to a low confidence in the score. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is negative, describing the show as \"sloppy\" and lacking a plot. Given the limited information, a negative score seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt contains clear negative judgments ('sloppy,' 'in search of a plot') criticizing the show's construction and lack of coherent narrative. With only one excerpt available, confidence is low, but the language clearly indicates a thumbs-down review.",
