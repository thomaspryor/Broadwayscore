Unlike typical jukebox musicals, “A Beautiful Noise” is not an extroverted epic extravaganza, but an introverted intimate introspection. In fact, the frame of the show is an older Diamond (Robert Westenberg) going to see a therapist (Lisa Reneé Pitts) at the insistence of his wife (Tiffany Tatreau) because despite having everything and having done it all, he’s unhappy. Of course, it’s easy to be cynical about this and wish we all had such problems. But what is refreshing about what is revealed about Diamond, warts and all, is that he is an ordinary guy with flaws and insecurities as large as his stardom. There is no dramatic climax, there are no preachy conclusions. We muddle through, regardless of our level of fame and fortune, or lack thereof. <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-66837 lazyload\" src=\"https://www.newcitystage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03_Hannah-Jewel-Kohn-as-Marcia-Murphey-Nick-Fradiani-as-Neil-Then-and-The-Noise-in-A-Beautiful-Noise_-The-Neil-Diamond-Musical-Photo-credit-Jeremy-Daniel-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://www.newcitystage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03_Hannah-Jewel-Kohn-as-Marcia-Murphey-Nick-Fradiani-as-Neil-Then-and-The-Noise-in-A-Beautiful-Noise_-The-Neil-Diamond-Musical-Photo-credit-Jeremy-Daniel-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.newcitystage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03_Hannah-Jewel-Kohn-as-Marcia-Murphey-Nick-Fradiani-as-Neil-Then-and-The-Noise-in-A-Beautiful-Noise_-The-Neil-Diamond-Musical-Photo-credit-Jeremy-Daniel-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.newcitystage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03_Hannah-Jewel-Kohn-as-Marcia-Murphey-Nick-Fradiani-as-Neil-Then-and-The-Noise-in-A-Beautiful-Noise_-The-Neil-Diamond-Musical-Photo-credit-Jeremy-Daniel-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.newcitystage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03_Hannah-Jewel-Kohn-as-Marcia-Murphey-Nick-Fradiani-as-Neil-Then-and-The-Noise-in-A-Beautiful-Noise_-The-Neil-Diamond-Musical-Photo-credit-Jeremy-Daniel-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.newcitystage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03_Hannah-Jewel-Kohn-as-Marcia-Murphey-Nick-Fradiani-as-Neil-Then-and-The-Noise-in-A-Beautiful-Noise_-The-Neil-Diamond-Musical-Photo-credit-Jeremy-Daniel-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://www.newcitystage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03_Hannah-Jewel-Kohn-as-Marcia-Murphey-Nick-Fradiani-as-Neil-Then-and-The-Noise-in-A-Beautiful-Noise_-The-Neil-Diamond-Musical-Photo-credit-Jeremy-Daniel-350x233.jpg 350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /> Broadway In Chicago’s “A Beautiful Noise: The Neil Diamond Musical,” with Hannah Jewel Kohn, Nick Fradiani and the ensemble/Photo: Jeremy Daniel Along the way of looking back, we see the young Diamond (Nick Fradiani) struggling as a songwriter. He reluctantly turns to performing only because he doesn’t like the way others are performing his material nor the type of material that others are ordering up from him. “Noise” shows the toil involved and sugarcoats nothing. The Act I finale has him composing in a broken-down motel room at one of his most down-and-out moments only to stumble upon “Sweet Caroline.” That same number is also used at the end of the show, a sequined young and old Diamond singing it together with the full cast and the audience joining in. What stands out leaving the theater is how much Diamond’s songs have been the aural wallpaper of so many of our lives. And how taken for granted and underrated they have been. Broadway In Chicago’s “A Beautiful Noise: The Neil Diamond Musical” is extended through November 24 at Cadillac Palace Theatre, 151 West Randolph. Showtimes are Wednesday-Friday at 7pm; Saturdays at 2pm and 7:30pm; and Sundays at 1pm and 6pm. Tickets are $40-$115, available at broadwayinchicago.com.",
