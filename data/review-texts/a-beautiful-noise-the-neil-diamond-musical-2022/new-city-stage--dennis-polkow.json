  "bwwExcerpt": "“Noise” shows the toil involved and sugarcoats nothing. The Act I finale has him composing in a broken-down motel room at one of his most down-and-out moments only to stumble upon “Sweet Caroline.” That same number is also used at the end of the show, a sequined young and old Diamond singing it together with the full cast and the audience joining in.",
