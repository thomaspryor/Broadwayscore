  "bwwExcerpt": "McCarten delivers a beautifully wrought musical about the mega-watt talent that is, and always was, Neil Diamond. It’s a lovefest of sing-along tunes and get-on-your-feet, upbeat favorites. But again, hidden just under the surface of some of his biggest hits, is a lonely man searching for answers through song. His music acts as a break in “the clouds,” his personal term for depression. For Neil, music is what feelings sound like.",
