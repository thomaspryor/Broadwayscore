  "bwwExcerpt": "A BEAUTIFUL NOISE utilizes the device of Diamond and his 'Doctor' (psychologist) seated at the outset in comfy leather chairs... Through gentle probing, the composition of those lyrics form a springboard for Neil to tell his life's story. These two characters are on stage at all times, witnessing, commenting and mingling with the action as the life of Neil-Then unfolds.",
