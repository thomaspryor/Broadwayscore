    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive verdict with entertainment value confirmed, but qualified by 'too bad it leaves you wanting more' suggesting limitations. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mildly positive with reservations. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show is entertaining and has potential for success, but also notes it 'leaves you wanting more', indicating some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review states that the show is entertaining, but leaves the audience wanting more, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt promises audiences will be entertained and predicts commercial success, but the caveat that it 'leaves you wanting more' suggests a qualified, mildly positive recommendation rather than an enthusiastic endorsement.",
