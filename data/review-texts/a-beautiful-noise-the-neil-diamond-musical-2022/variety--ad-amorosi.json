    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt describes the show as 'victorious' which is positive language, but immediately qualifies it with 'rough bumps along the way.' This suggests a positive but qualified recommendation. Single excerpt warning requires caution - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a generally positive review with some reservations, noting the show as 'victorious' but acknowledging 'rough bumps'. The single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The phrase \"is victorious\" suggests a positive recommendation, but the phrase \"rough bumps along the way\" indicates reservations. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it as a low positive. | Kimi: Single excerpt uses strong positive language ('victorious') while acknowledging flaws ('rough bumps'), indicating a qualified but firm recommendation. Limited confidence due to cherry-pick risk of curated excerpt.",
