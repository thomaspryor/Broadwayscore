    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt praises production values ('looks and sounds great') but expresses significant frustration with character development and narrative progress. Single excerpt warning requires caution about full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the visual and auditory aspects but criticizes the lack of depth in understanding the character. The mixed elements suggest a balanced view, neither fully positive nor negative. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show has positive aspects ('looks and sounds great') but ultimately fails to achieve a deeper understanding of the subject, suggesting a mixed or lukewarm reception. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers genuine praise for the production's aesthetics but levels a significant criticism about the show's failure to reveal its subject's character, suggesting a style-over-substance verdict.",
