  "bwwExcerpt": "Fradiani fully embodies the role of Neil Diamond as he navigates his career. The talented actor, the first American Idol winner from the Northeast, replaced Will Swenson in the role on Broadway and was in the national tour of “A Bronx Tale.” He sings Diamond's classic hits perfectly, often playing guitar onstage, and often seems to be singing directly to a member of the audience. In his bio, he thanks his parents for taking him to his first concert at three years old to see Neil Diamond.",
