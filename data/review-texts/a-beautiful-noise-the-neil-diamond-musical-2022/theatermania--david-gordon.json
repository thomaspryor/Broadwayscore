Single excerpt with mixed signals requires low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises a specific scene for its simplicity and memorability, but implies a wish for the rest of the show to match this quality, suggesting an uneven experience. | Gemini: The review praises a specific scene for its simplicity and impact, but expresses a wish that the rest of the show followed suit, indicating a mixed overall impression. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises a specific scene as the show's most memorable element while criticizing the remainder for lacking that same simplicity and effectiveness, suggesting a qualified recommendation based on isolated highlights.",
