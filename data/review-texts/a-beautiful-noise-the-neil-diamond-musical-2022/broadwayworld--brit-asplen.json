    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt comparing favorably to other successful musicals suggests positive assessment, but excerpt is too brief and descriptive rather than evaluative to determine full verdict strength. | GPT-4o: The excerpt does not provide a clear recommendation or strong evaluative language. It compares the show to other musicals but does not clearly praise or criticize it, suggesting a mixed or neutral stance. | Gemini: The excerpt compares the show to other jukebox musicals, noting it's based more in reflection than a direct story. Without more context, it's difficult to determine a clear recommendation, suggesting a mixed or neutral assessment. | Kimi: Single curated excerpt places the show alongside excellent company and suggests its reflective narrative structure offers a thoughtful alternative to standard biographical formulas, though truncated text prevents assessment of explicit verdict language. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
