  "bwwExcerpt": "Fradiani has that. His timbre is like an open range studded with tumbleweeds and barbed wire, cowboy ruggedness crossed with Flatbush grit, schmaltz with singed edges. And he knows just how to deploy it: when to purr, when to rawr, when to strum those vocal cords. But “A Beautiful Noise” attempts to be more than just a concert, and in so doing, it creates the clunkiest framing device and the least likable protagonist possibly in the history of jukebox musicals.",
