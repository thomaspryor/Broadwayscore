However, single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive transformation for the audience, indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests that the show is enjoyable and reveals the dark spots in the singer's life, which molds even the most reluctant of listeners into Diamond fans by curtain call. This indicates a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the show's emotional depth and its powerful ability to win over skeptical audience members, indicating a clear positive recommendation despite limited text availability.",
