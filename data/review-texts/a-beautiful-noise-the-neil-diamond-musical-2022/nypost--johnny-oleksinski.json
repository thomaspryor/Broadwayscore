    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The review highlights the enjoyment of specific moments but does not provide a clear overall recommendation or critique of the production as a whole. The focus on audience participation suggests some appeal, but the lack of broader evaluation results in a mixed classification. | Gemini: The review is positive, highlighting the enjoyment of Diamond's hits, but it's brief and lacks a comprehensive evaluation, so confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the musical performances but the qualified phrasing 'at its best' implies the show is inconsistent or weaker during non-musical moments. Given this appears to be a truncated single sentence, confidence is low.",
