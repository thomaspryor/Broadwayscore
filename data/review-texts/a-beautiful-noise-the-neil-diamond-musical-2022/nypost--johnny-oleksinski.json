    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The review highlights the enjoyment of the musical numbers but lacks depth and context to provide a strong recommendation. The focus on audience participation suggests a positive experience, but the limited text prevents a higher confidence score. | Gemini: The review focuses on the enjoyment of the audience singing along to the hits, suggesting a positive but somewhat limited appeal. Due to the short length, confidence is low. | Kimi: The qualified phrasing 'at its best' implies the show has inconsistent quality, excelling during musical numbers but potentially weaker elsewhere. The single-sentence excerpt appears truncated, limiting certainty about the overall verdict.",
