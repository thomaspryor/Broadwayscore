However, the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence, suggesting a mild positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive experience, particularly for fans of Neil Diamond, with praise for the songs and performance. The average rating of 77% aligns with a positive assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the musical delivery and lead performance, specifically noting the show succeeds for fans of Diamond, though the qualifier suggests it targets a specific audience rather than universal acclaim.",
