  "bwwExcerpt": "For my first show of 2025, A Beautiful Noise was ‘so good, so good, so good!’ Baby boomers may get the most out of it, but youngsters should still find themselves toe-tapping countless times throughout the night. This not only serves as a nice throwback to a bygone era, but also as an empowering tribute to a music icon.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear enthusiasm ('so good, so good, so good!') and broad appeal noted, but single excerpt warning requires caution about full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses enthusiastic language ('so good, so good, so good!') and highlights both nostalgia and empowerment, indicating a strong positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The critic uses the show's catchphrase and calls it an \"empowering tribute\", suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt is unreservedly positive and enthusiastic, praising the show's appeal to multiple generations and its value as an 'empowering tribute,' warranting a score in the upper Positive range. Confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
