  "bwwExcerpt": "For a show heavy in music, there’s nobody better to do all the lifting than Nick Fradiani. His voice is stronger than a Kentucky Woman (I hear they are tough). The 2015 winner of American Idol, Fradiani perfectly duplicates the magical sound of Diamond’s voice. He’s as close as you are ever going to get to hearing the real Diamond himself. Fradiani should maybe change his name to Ruby or Sapphire, because he’s a valuable gem himself.",
