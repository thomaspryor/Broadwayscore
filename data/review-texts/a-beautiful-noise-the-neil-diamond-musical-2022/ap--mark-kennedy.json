The lack of full context and single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious approach. | Gemini: The review suggests the show caters to a specific audience, implying it may not appeal to everyone. The final line, \"For the rest of us, there’s always cocktails,\" indicates a lack of enthusiasm for those outside the target demographic. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges the show satisfies its target demographic but explicitly dismisses broader appeal, suggesting a mixed, qualified reception rather than a broad recommendation.",
