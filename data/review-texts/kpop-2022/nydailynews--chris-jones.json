    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as 'struggling' to meet expectations, suggesting unfulfilled potential rather than success. However, with only one curated quote available, the full verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show is struggling with its expectations, indicating a mixed reception. The single excerpt warning and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the show had internal struggles and failed to meet expectations, indicating a mixed or neutral assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows the show is 'struggling,' which is negative framing, but the 'ironically' suggests thematic coherence that may be intentional. Without more context, this reads as mixed—acknowledging ambition while noting execution problems. Low confidence due to single excerpt warning.",
