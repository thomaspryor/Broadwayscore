    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows praise for production numbers but clear criticism of overall substance. 'Bring the house down' is high praise, but 'not much else there' indicates significant weaknesses. Mixed verdict with low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production numbers but suggests the rest of the show lacks substance. With only one excerpt, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the production numbers but implies that other aspects of the show are lacking. Given the limited excerpt, it's difficult to determine the overall sentiment, but it leans towards mixed. | Kimi: The excerpt offers high praise for the show's spectacle ('bring the house down') but dismisses the remaining elements as insubstantial ('not much else there'), indicating an uneven, unbalanced production without a clear recommendation to attend.",
