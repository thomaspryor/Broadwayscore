However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the score's lack of connection to the plot and emotional impact, indicating a negative view. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt states that the score has very little connection to the plot and doesn't make much of an emotional impact, indicating a negative assessment. Given that this is the only excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers direct criticism of the show's 'flimsy plot' and describes the score as emotionally unimpactful, indicating a negative assessment. Confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation and truncation.",
