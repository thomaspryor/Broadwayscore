Positive overall but with clear reservations, placing it in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the immersive experience and ambitious spectacle but notes a shortcoming in the book. Given the single excerpt warning, the mildly positive tone suggests a lower-end Positive score. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive experience overall, but mentions a weakness in the book, suggesting a recommendation with reservations. Given it is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates the staging succeeds but the book is weak, suggesting a qualified positive recommendation. Score set at lower end of Positive range due to excerpt limitations and significant caveat about the book.",
