Low confidence due to single curated quote that may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review highlights strong visual and performance elements but criticizes the book and songs for lacking depth and memorability. The mixed elements suggest a balanced view without a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the visuals and performers but criticizes the book and songs, resulting in a mixed assessment. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt presents balanced critique praising production values and performances while criticizing fundamental book and songs. Lacks clear recommendation language, suggesting neither endorsement nor rejection.",
