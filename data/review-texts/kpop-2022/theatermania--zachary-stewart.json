    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the cast as among Broadway's best, but single excerpt warning means full verdict unclear. Using upper Positive range given unqualified superlative praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast as being among the best on Broadway, indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive about the cast, suggesting a positive overall experience. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic, unqualified praise for the cast quality, indicating a positive recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt with no broader context about the production, confidence is limited.",
