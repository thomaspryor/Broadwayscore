    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt expresses disappointment that the Broadway version lost something valuable from its previous iteration, indicating missed potential rather than clear recommendation or rejection. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a missed opportunity in the Broadway adaptation, indicating a mixed sentiment. The critic expresses a wish for more preserved moments, implying some disappointment but not outright negativity. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses a wish for more of something, suggesting the show has potential but falls short. It's neither a strong recommendation nor a clear dismissal. | Kimi: The critic laments that the Broadway adaptation lacks sufficient moments exploring the intersection of K-pop and musical theater, suggesting the show prioritizes surface excitement over meaningful artistic dialogue. As a single excerpt expressing disappointment without redeeming praise, it indicates a mixed reception.",
