    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges positive qualities (energy, heart) but identifies a fundamental flaw in theatrical realization. The 60 rating confirms this as mixed - not recommended but not discouraged either. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review. The text acknowledges positive elements like 'energy and heart' but criticizes the show for lacking a complete theatrical experience. | Gemini: The critic acknowledges positive aspects like energy and heart, but ultimately finds the show lacking as a fully realized theatrical experience, indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic's own 60 rating places this firmly in the Mixed range. While acknowledging positive elements (energy, heart), the review criticizes the show for lacking theatrical depth, comparing it unfavorably to a concert rather than a fully realized production.",
