This indicates a mixed reception, as it doesn't clearly recommend or discourage seeing the show. | Gemini: The review states that the musical wants to be many things but doesn't fully commit to any of them, indicating a lack of focus and a mixed impression. | Kimi: The excerpt identifies a significant structural flaw—the show's lack of narrative focus—but provides no concluding verdict or assessment of performances/music. With less than 50 words provided, the full recommendation is unclear.",
