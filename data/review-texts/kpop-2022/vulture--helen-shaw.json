  "bwwExcerpt": "There’s a lot in the musical KPOP that makes for a successful show, including a winning ensemble, melodies that sneak into your ears and stay there, and rhythm-perfect choreography. But it has a curious inertia. It lacks drama. Not in the sense of tension between its characters—there’s plenty of bickering to observe between the characters at the musical’s fictional K-pop label as they prepare for a big American showcase—but in the sense of a thrust, an arc, propulsion. It feels as if the show has rushed out into the open water of Broadway and then gotten stuck, like a ship unable to catch the wind.",

This indicates a mixed reception, as it doesn't clearly recommend or discourage seeing the show. | Gemini: The review states that the musical wants to be many things but doesn't fully commit to any of them, indicating a lack of focus and a mixed impression. | Kimi: The excerpt identifies a significant structural flaw—the show's lack of narrative focus—but provides no concluding verdict or assessment of performances/music. With less than 50 words provided, the full recommendation is unclear.",
