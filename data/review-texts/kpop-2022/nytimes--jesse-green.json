  "bwwExcerpt": "In its remaking for Broadway I wish 'KPOP' had preserved more moments like that: moments that allow you to consider what the excitement of K-pop (for those who feel it) and the expressiveness of American musical theater (likewise) can profitably say to each other. Both have their fans and no doubt their glories, as well as their limitations. But it seems to me that in introducing the two, a good place to have met would have been, well, halfway. 'KPOP' still has far to go to get there.",
