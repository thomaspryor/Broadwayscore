    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt presents balanced critique - acknowledges positive 'pulsing energy' but notes significant flaw of lacking plot. This balanced positive/negative suggests mixed assessment, but with only one curated quote available, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a show with strong energy but lacking in plot, suggesting a mixed review. The lack of full context and only one excerpt available lowers confidence in the verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt notes a positive aspect (pulsing energy) but also a negative (lack of plot), suggesting a mixed experience. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers mild praise for the show's energy while noting a lack of plot, suggesting a qualified recommendation. Limited text warrants low confidence and lower-end Positive score per guidance.",
