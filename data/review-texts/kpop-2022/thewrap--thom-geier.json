  "bwwExcerpt": "The concert portions of the evening are a cotton-candy delight. Helen Park and Max Vernon have written a handful of pulsing K-pop gems that feel like they'd fit right into a Seoul top 40 playlist, with pulsing beats, solo vocal runs, tight harmonies and occasional interjections of rap. The talented cast deliver the goods, aided by Jennifer Weber's crisp and energetic choreography, Clint Ramos and Sophia Choi's flashy costumes, Jiyoun Chang's dramatic lighting and Gabriel Hainer Evansohn's sleek scenic design.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt presents balanced critique - acknowledges positive 'pulsing energy' but notes significant flaw of lacking plot. This balanced positive/negative suggests mixed assessment, but with only one curated quote available, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a show with strong energy but lacking in plot, suggesting a mixed review. The lack of full context and only one excerpt available lowers confidence in the verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt notes a positive aspect (pulsing energy) but also a negative (lack of plot), suggesting a mixed experience. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers mild praise for the show's energy while noting a lack of plot, suggesting a qualified recommendation. Limited text warrants low confidence and lower-end Positive score per guidance.",
