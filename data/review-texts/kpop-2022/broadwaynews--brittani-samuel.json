  "bwwExcerpt": "There is an ecstatic upbeat tempo to “KPOP.” Eighteen of the aforementioned 22-person ensemble makes their Broadway debut here, and even the worst of scripts cannot stop them from having a great time. Too much love and hard work envelops Bergman’s stage to not bop your head to the music or mimic dance moves from your seat. While discrepancies riddle the musical’s book and erase all potential for a transformative time, I’d instead advise to venture out in pursuit of an entertaining one. You’ll find that at “KPOP.”",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear enthusiasm - describing infectious energy that makes audiences want to dance along. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential for cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive experience, highlighting the love and hard work in the production that engages the audience. The tone is enthusiastic, indicating a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive experience, indicating the reviewer enjoyed the music and dance. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive tone warrants a score in the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt expresses enthusiastic praise for the show's infectious energy and craftsmanship, suggesting audiences will find it hard to resist enjoying the performance. As a single curated quote with clearly positive language, it warrants the upper range of the Positive bucket.",
