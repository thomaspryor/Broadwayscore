    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes an exceptional finale with superlative language ('rarely heard on Broadway', audience 'sorry the show was over'). However, confidence is low due to limited text - this could be cherry-picked from a mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes an enthusiastic audience reaction to the finale, suggesting a positive experience. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes an \"incredible performance\" with a \"crescendo rarely heard on Broadway,\" suggesting a very positive experience. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the praise warrants a high positive score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the show's finale as 'incredible' and notes that the audience was 'sorry the show was over so quickly,' indicating strong positive sentiment. However, as a single curated excerpt, the overall verdict may not be fully representative.",
