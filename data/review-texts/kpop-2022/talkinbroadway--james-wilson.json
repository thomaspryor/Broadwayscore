  "bwwExcerpt": "For this reason–and I can't believe I am writing this–I would have preferred a K-pop revue without the strained narratives. In the concert numbers, the performers are electrifying, and they elicit earned shrieks, squeals, and thunderous applause from the notably young and Asian audience members. Helen Park's and Max Vernon's songs are silly confections that thankfully are accompanied by loud electronic music, so you don't end up with an ear worm consisting of a lyric like, 'This is my Korea/ This is my story-a/ A new category-a/ To make you dance and clap your hands.' Wearing Clint Ramos and Sophia Choi's appropriately gaudy, garish, and fabulous costumes, which include glittering bodysuits, playful dominatrix attire, faux military uniforms, MwE, RTMIS, and F8 put on a sensational show, particularly in the 15-minute finale. Jennifer Weber's thrilling choreography incorporates all the shakes, pops and thrusts one associates with the genre. KPOP will not go down in the Broadway annals as a groundbreaking, or even a very good, musical. But when the company sings the final song, 'Blast Off,' you may realize that you're having too much fun to notice–or care.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic explicitly states it's 'not even a very good musical' but acknowledges the finale is 'too much fun.' This suggests mixed feelings - significant reservations but some enjoyment. Single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt suggests the show is not considered groundbreaking or very good, but acknowledges an element of fun that may overshadow these shortcomings. The tone is mixed, with some positive elements but overall reservations. | Gemini: The review states that the show is not groundbreaking or very good, but that it is fun. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring it as a low positive. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states the show is 'not... a very good musical' but emphasizes that the audience will be having 'too much fun to notice–or care,' constituting a qualified recommendation based on entertainment value rather than artistic merit. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
