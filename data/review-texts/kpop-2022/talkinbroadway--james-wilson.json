    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic explicitly states it's 'not even a very good musical' but acknowledges the finale is 'too much fun.' This suggests mixed feelings - significant reservations but some enjoyment. Single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt suggests the show is not considered groundbreaking or very good, but acknowledges an element of fun that may overshadow these shortcomings. The tone is mixed, with some positive elements but overall reservations. | Gemini: The review states that the show is not groundbreaking or very good, but that it is fun. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring it as a low positive. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states the show is 'not... a very good musical' but emphasizes that the audience will be having 'too much fun to notice–or care,' constituting a qualified recommendation based on entertainment value rather than artistic merit. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
