    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Critics acknowledges the visual spectacle and songs work, but the core comparison to a theme park attraction over legitimate theater suggests disappointment with the theatrical substance. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges visual splendor and memorable songs but criticizes the show for lacking the depth of compelling musical theater, likening it to a theme park attraction. This suggests a negative overall verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (visuals, songs) but ultimately finds the show lacking as compelling musical theater, comparing it unfavorably to a theme park attraction. This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging the visual splendor and songs, the critic fundamentally rejects the production's artistic merit, comparing it unfavorably to commercial entertainment rather than legitimate theater. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
