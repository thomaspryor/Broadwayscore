    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies - this balanced critique praises visuals but criticizes drama and score as thin/mediocre, suggesting mixed reception without clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as visually appealing but lacking in dramatic substance and musical quality. The mixed assessment of strengths and weaknesses suggests a neither fully positive nor negative verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges visual appeal but criticizes the dramatic depth and score, indicating a mixed assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic praises the visual design as 'sumptuous,' the core theatrical elements receive sharp criticism: the drama is deemed 'thin' and the score 'mediocre.' For a musical, these are fundamental weaknesses that outweigh the production values, suggesting the critic does not recommend the show.",
