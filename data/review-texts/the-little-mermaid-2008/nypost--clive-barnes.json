    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear criticism of core elements (drama, score) despite acknowledging visual appeal. However, low confidence due to single curated quote that may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights visual appeal but criticizes the dramatic and musical elements, suggesting a mixed reception. The single excerpt and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review describes the show as visually appealing but criticizes the dramatic content and music, indicating a mixed opinion. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt balances genuine praise for the visual design ('visually sumptuous') with significant criticism of the dramatic content ('dramatically thin') and score ('mediocre'), indicating an ambivalent assessment that acknowledges strengths and weaknesses without a clear recommendation.",
