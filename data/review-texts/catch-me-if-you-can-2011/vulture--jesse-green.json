The phrase \"engineered to within an inch of its life\" suggests over-calculation without success. | Kimi: The critic's verdict is clear and unambiguous: despite extensive effort and polish ('engineered to within an inch of its life'), the show fundamentally fails to succeed ('still doesn't quite work'). This is a straightforward negative recommendation.",
