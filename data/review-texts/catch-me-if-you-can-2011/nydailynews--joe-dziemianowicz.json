  "bwwExcerpt": "The show has wonderful moments, but issues abound. McNally's overstuffed story jockeys unsteadily between hijinks and serious drama. With Frank's story, the FBI agent's story and Frank's girlfriend's family's story, it's just too much. Shaiman and Wittman's score shows polish and style. 'Butter Out of Cream' smoothly states Frank's life motto, while 'Don't Be a Stranger' is a moody backdrop for a glamorous dance. But '(Our) Family Tree' and 'Doctor's Orders' could've been cut and never missed.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges positive qualities (charm, energy) but expresses disappointment that it falls short of expectations. The original 60 rating confirms this as a mixed assessment. | GPT-4o: The critic acknowledges positive elements like charm and energy but ultimately finds the show lacking compared to the original, aligning with a mixed review. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like charm and energy, but ultimately finds it lacking compared to the source material, indicating a mixed assessment. The original rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The 60 rating confirms a Mixed bucket. The review acknowledges positives (charm, energy) but the decisive 'but' clause about failing to capture the source material's magic undermines enthusiasm. No clear recommendation to see it.",
