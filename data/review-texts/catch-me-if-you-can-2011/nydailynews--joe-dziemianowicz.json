    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges positive qualities (charm, energy) but expresses disappointment that it falls short of expectations. The original 60 rating confirms this as a mixed assessment. | GPT-4o: The critic acknowledges positive elements like charm and energy but ultimately finds the show lacking compared to the original, aligning with a mixed review. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like charm and energy, but ultimately finds it lacking compared to the source material, indicating a mixed assessment. The original rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The 60 rating confirms a Mixed bucket. The review acknowledges positives (charm, energy) but the decisive 'but' clause about failing to capture the source material's magic undermines enthusiasm. No clear recommendation to see it.",
