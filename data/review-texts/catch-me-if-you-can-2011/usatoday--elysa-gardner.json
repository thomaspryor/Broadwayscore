  "bwwExcerpt": "One feat that Abagnale did not attempt was writing and starring in a stage musical about his youthful adventures. And now we know why. Not that Catch Me If You Can (* * ½ out of four), the new Broadway show based on the aforementioned film and autobiography of the same name, is a dud. Boasting a score by the famously witty team of Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman and a book by Terrence McNally, Catch Me is too ambitious and stylish in its efforts to entertain and move us to induce boredom. The main problem with this production, which opened Sunday at the Neil Simon Theatre, is that only one of the two leading men is consistently compelling. And it's not the one playing Abagnale (Aaron Tveit).",

Acknowledges the show 'is too ambitious and stylish' to be boring but identifies significant problems with the lead performance. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review notes ambition and style, suggesting some positive elements, but highlights a significant issue with the lead performance, indicating a mixed overall impression. The excerpt's single nature and lack of a clear verdict contribute to low confidence. | Gemini: The review states the show is not a dud, but also not consistently compelling, indicating a mixed reaction. The truncated nature and single excerpt lower the confidence. | Kimi: The 2.5/4 star rating and balanced text indicate a mixed verdict: genuine praise for the score, book, and stylish ambition, but significant criticism of the lead performance and acknowledgment that it falls short of its potential.",
