This is mixed-to-negative territory, but the text is severely truncated so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges some charms but expresses disappointment in the adaptation compared to the film. The lack of thrill and suspense suggests a mixed review. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt limitation. | Gemini: The review excerpt acknowledges charms but expresses disappointment that it's not the \"thorough thrill\" hoped for, indicating a mixed assessment. The truncated nature lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges 'many charms' but emphasizes disappointment, noting the show fails to deliver the expected thrills and criticizes the truncation of the story. As a single truncated excerpt, the overall verdict remains unclear.",
