  "bwwExcerpt": "And yet there's something here that just isn't connecting, that smacks a bit of a color-by-numbers musical. A large reason may be the role of the hero, who is, after all, a cipher - a faker, a fraud, a man who is whatever we assume him to be. Beneath the pilot's uniform or doctor's white coat, there's little but a smile and a wink. 'Blink your eyes and I'll be gone,' he sings in one song. And he's right: He leaves nothing that resonates behind. Played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the film, this time the role of Frank Abagnale Jr. has been handed over to Aaron Tveit. As pretty as a Ken doll and blessed with a wonderful voice, Tveit nevertheless struggles to convey genuineness.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt criticizes the show as formulaic ('color-by-numbers') and notes fundamental problems with character development and lead performance. However, with only one excerpt available from what may be a longer review, the full verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show for lacking connection and depth, describing it as 'color-by-numbers' and highlighting issues with the lead role's portrayal. The tone suggests disappointment, but without the full review, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses reservations about the musical, calling it a \"color-by-numbers musical\" and criticizing the hero's role and the actor's ability to convey genuineness. This indicates a mixed assessment, but because it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the show as formulaic and emotionally hollow, finding that the lead performance lacks genuineness despite the actor's vocal talents. The overall tone indicates a clear recommendation against seeing the production. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
