Though the real-life story that inspired this show (and the 2002 movie of the same title) is full of elaborate deceptions and corkscrew twists, you will never at any point be confused by its theatrical incarnation.\n\nOr roused or touched or more than mildly entertained, for about 90 percent of the time. (There is one wow of an exception, a first-act production number led by Norbert Leo Butz.) In the season of the incomprehensible, out-of-control “Spider-Man,” I suppose one should give extra points to a show that is so tidy and utterly of a piece. But a tale that follows a continent-spanning pursuit of a chameleon criminal should have, above all things, momentum. And “Catch Me” mostly just seems to stand in one place, explaining itself.\n\nOn paper it must have read like a thrill-a-minute proposition. The real Frank Abagnale Jr. had the youth, looks, quick-wittedness and chutzpah that turn criminals into folk heroes. Before he was 21 he had forged millions of dollars worth of checks and successfully passed himself off as an airline pilot, a lawyer and a pediatric doctor.\n\nSteven Spielberg’s movie about him was a silken, sexy entertainment, featuring what is probably the best adult performance given by Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Frank. (Tom Hanks was the F.B.I. agent Carl Hanratty, Frank’s Javert-like pursuer, a role here played by the invaluable Mr. Butz.) And if it didn’t exactly cry out to be transformed into a musical, it possessed several ingredients much valued on Broadway these days.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "The script also draws blunt parallel lines between Frank, the pursued, and Carl, the pursuer, a work-obsessed loner. They turn out to have a lot more in common than you might suspect (except that you do, from the beginning), and they are each dutifully given songs to explain how and why. The flashy musical numbers definitely emerge from the plot, just as they are supposed to do in your basic organic musical, but they sometimes have the chalky flavor of audio-visual aids. The notion of Frank as a little boy lost limits the performance of Mr. Tveit, who was terrific as the mother-haunting son in 'Next to Normal.' He has intense presence, for sure, and a bright, blasting voice (though it belongs more to the age of 'American Idol' than 'American Bandstand'). But his performance is ultimately one-note, all shine and no shadows.",
