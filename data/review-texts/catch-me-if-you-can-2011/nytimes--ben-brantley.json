  "bwwExcerpt": "The script also draws blunt parallel lines between Frank, the pursued, and Carl, the pursuer, a work-obsessed loner. They turn out to have a lot more in common than you might suspect (except that you do, from the beginning), and they are each dutifully given songs to explain how and why. The flashy musical numbers definitely emerge from the plot, just as they are supposed to do in your basic organic musical, but they sometimes have the chalky flavor of audio-visual aids. The notion of Frank as a little boy lost limits the performance of Mr. Tveit, who was terrific as the mother-haunting son in 'Next to Normal.' He has intense presence, for sure, and a bright, blasting voice (though it belongs more to the age of 'American Idol' than 'American Bandstand'). But his performance is ultimately one-note, all shine and no shadows.",
