  "bwwExcerpt": "Two of Catch Me's best attributes are its handsome chorus and its voices; anybody who's anybody in the cast gets a turn in the spotlight, a few in show-stoppers. Butz' \"Don't Break the Rules\" is a little number he makes very big, a look into his FBI-man psyche; Kerry Butler, in a great turn as our scammer's love, has another of the best moments in \"Fly, Fly Away,\" and Tviet, 27, a tenor who made his name as the son in Next to Normal, delivers several pieces",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise for performances and production values ('best attributes', 'great turn', 'best moments'), but as a curated quote may not represent full verdict. Low confidence due to excerpt-only nature. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances and vocal talent, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights positive aspects of the show, such as the chorus, voices, and individual performances, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt enthusiastically praises the cast and musical numbers with terms like 'best attributes,' 'show-stoppers,' and 'great turn,' indicating a strong positive recommendation, though confidence is reduced due to the single-excerpt limitation.",
