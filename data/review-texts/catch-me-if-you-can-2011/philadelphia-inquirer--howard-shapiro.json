  "bwwExcerpt": "Two of Catch Me's best attributes are its handsome chorus and its voices; anybody who's anybody in the cast gets a turn in the spotlight, a few in show-stoppers. Butz' \"Don't Break the Rules\" is a little number he makes very big, a look into his FBI-man psyche; Kerry Butler, in a great turn as our scammer's love, has another of the best moments in \"Fly, Fly Away,\" and Tviet, 27, a tenor who made his name as the son in Next to Normal, delivers several pieces",
