This is a clear mixed-to-negative assessment that doesn't recommend the show at its current venue and price point. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'pleasant enough' but ultimately not meeting Broadway standards, suggesting a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: Extracted from malformed response | Kimi: While the critic grants the show is 'pleasant enough,' the dominant sentiment is that it fails to meet Broadway standards, comparing it unfavorably to a touring production and finding it unworthy of the venue. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
