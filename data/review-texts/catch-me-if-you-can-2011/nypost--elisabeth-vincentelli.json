  "bwwExcerpt": "'Catch Me If You Can' makes Abagnale a sympathetic figure guilty mainly of charming everybody. Tveit is handsome and sings well, but overuses his Colgate smile and lacks the pizazz necessary to sell the snake oil. This Frank is a junior, all right: many personas but little personality. Butz, on the other hand, has charisma to spare -- which is saying something, since he puts the 'ratty' back in Hanratty. His body hunched at an angle, a greasy-looking hat perched on his head, he creates a fully rounded character, and displays unfailing musical-comedy flair.",

This is a clear mixed-to-negative assessment that doesn't recommend the show at its current venue and price point. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'pleasant enough' but ultimately not meeting Broadway standards, suggesting a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: Extracted from malformed response | Kimi: While the critic grants the show is 'pleasant enough,' the dominant sentiment is that it fails to meet Broadway standards, comparing it unfavorably to a touring production and finding it unworthy of the venue. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
