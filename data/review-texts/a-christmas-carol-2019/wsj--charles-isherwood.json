While there is praise for Campbell Scott's performance, the overall recommendation is lukewarm. | Gemini: The review describes the staging as \"handsome\" and \"respectable,\" indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic assessment. The phrase \"if not revelatory\" suggests some reservations. | Kimi: The critic praises the 'handsome' staging and Scott's 'welcome subtlety' but qualifies the recommendation as 'respectable if not revelatory,' indicating a solid production that is worth seeing but not groundbreaking.",
