Even so, there are plenty of them, some of which are quite good, and I’ve never understood why Patrick Stewart’s one-man version of Charles Dickens’s seasonal tale of spiritual redemption, which has had four Broadway runs since 1991, is the only one to have had any luck there.",

The phrase \"if not revelatory\" suggests reservations. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise for the handsome staging and Scott's subtle performance, but the caveat that it is 'not revelatory' keeps it in the lower range of positive recommendations.",
