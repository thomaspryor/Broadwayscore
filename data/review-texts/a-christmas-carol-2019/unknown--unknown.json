    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the script favorably ('keen wit and gimlet detail') but notes it's 'lonelier' - suggests mild praise with qualifications. Low confidence due to single cherry-picked quote warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a production that is faithful to Dickens' original, with a mix of wit and detail, but describes it as a 'lonelier affair'. The lack of clear positive or negative language indicates a mixed verdict. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive, but somewhat reserved, recommendation due to the mention of 'lonelier affair' and 'cut the goose-fat sentimentality'. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt praises the adaptation's 'keen wit' and 'gimlet detail' while valuing its unsentimental approach, indicating a clearly positive view. Scored at upper end of Positive range per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, with low confidence due to limited context.",
