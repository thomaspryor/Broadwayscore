    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows measured appreciation for the script's authenticity and wit, but 'lonelier affair' suggests some distance. With only one curated quote available, confidence is low and score reflects cautious positive assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a unique aspect of the production but does not clearly recommend or discourage attendance. The mention of 'keen wit and gimlet detail' suggests some positive elements, but the overall tone is neutral, leading to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive assessment, highlighting the script's wit and detail while acknowledging the potential for sentimentality. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production's script for its 'keen wit' and 'gimlet detail,' offering a positive assessment of the adaptation's literary quality. However, the single-excerpt format and lack of explicit recommendation language warrant a lower-end Positive score and low confidence.",
