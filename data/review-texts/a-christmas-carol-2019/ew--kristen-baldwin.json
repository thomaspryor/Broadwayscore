    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review praises the production as a 'visual feast' that 'successfully marries' classic and modern elements, but the qualifier 'though it occasionally gets lost in its own spectacle' suggests reservations. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'visual feast' and 'successfully marries' elements, indicating strong praise. The original rating of 87 suggests a high positive score, and the excerpt aligns with this sentiment despite noting minor reservations. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, calling the production a 'visual feast' that 'successfully marries' the story with modern magic. However, the phrase 'occasionally gets lost in its own spectacle' indicates a reservation, placing it in the lower-middle of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('visual feast', 'theatrical magic') with only a minor caveat about spectacle, placing it in the upper Positive range per single-excerpt guidance.",
