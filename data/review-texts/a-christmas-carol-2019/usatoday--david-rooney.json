    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified positive assessment - 'solid' recommendation but explicitly 'not spectacular'. With only one curated quote available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'solid', indicating a positive but not enthusiastic recommendation. The lack of superlatives suggests a lower end of the Positive bucket. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review calls the show \"solid, if not spectacular,\" which indicates a positive but not enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt and the cautionary note, I've placed the score at the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise ('handsome,' 'solid') while explicitly noting it falls short of spectacular, indicating a mild recommendation rather than an enthusiastic endorsement.",
