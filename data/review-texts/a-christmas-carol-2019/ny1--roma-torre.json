  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Matthew Warchus wastes no time putting us in a festive mood with the actors handing out cookies and Clementines as the audience enters under hundreds of lanterns strewn throughout the theatre. There is dance and music both original and traditional played sweetly at times with hand bells adding to the merriment. But unlike other versions of the iconic story, which attempt to dazzle with special effects, this one has a more introspective tone adding dimension to the characters that have come to be so familiar to us.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows appreciation for the production's approach and atmosphere ('festive mood', 'adding dimension'), but as a single curated quote, it may not represent the full verdict. The tone is mildly positive rather than enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes a positive and festive atmosphere with unique elements like cookies and lanterns, and praises the introspective tone. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review describes the production as festive and introspective, adding dimension to familiar characters. While positive, the lack of strong superlatives and the single excerpt available suggest a score in the lower-middle range of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
