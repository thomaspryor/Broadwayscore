  "bwwExcerpt": "While retaining the jolliness and sentimentality associated with some 170 years' worth of stage versions (including a competitive flock that opened the year after its publication), Thorne and Warchus have polished the story's social conscience to a restored brightness. Be assured, though, that their 'Carol,' which stars Campbell Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge, never sings shrilly.",
