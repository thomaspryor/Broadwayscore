  "bwwExcerpt": "This being a holiday show for all ages, there's a broadly acted, crowd-pleasing vibe and frequent bits of audience interaction, especially after Scrooge's conversion. Carolers warble from every corner of the balconies; long sheets are unfurled to the stage to sluice apples, oranges and other treats into baskets for the Christmas feast; and stage snow drifts onto the audience. The kids at the matinee I attended squealed at the low-tech but delightful stage effects.",

However, the single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The review describes a \"crowd-pleasing vibe\" and \"delightful stage effects,\" suggesting a positive experience, but the lack of a clear recommendation and the single excerpt available lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt emphasizes the show's crowd-pleasing atmosphere, effective audience interaction, and delightful stagecraft, describing an engaged, enthusiastic reception. While the single-excerpt format limits certainty, the tone is clearly appreciative of the production's charms.",
