  "bwwExcerpt": "At the Old Vic in London, where Warchus's production premiered two years ago and has become an annual staple since, the show is staged in the round. Perhaps it is more effective in that form; at the Lyceum, even at what should be the joyous climax of the production-when the audience is corralled into helping assemble a massive Christmas feast-the festivity has a faint sense of effort. And just when our spirits have been suitably raised, Thorne's script tamps them down again with a buzzkill of a coda. This A Christmas Carol has many lovely moments and atmosphere aplenty. What it lacks, just a little, is cheer.",
