  "bwwExcerpt": "While much of the text may be new, the production leans on the traditional side, and attractively so. As audience members enter, music director Michael Gacetta's accordion and string ensemble play holiday favorites while cast members roam about the house offering guests clementines or packaged cookies.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows mild praise ('attractively so') but is purely descriptive of pre-show atmosphere. Single excerpt warning requires caution - this could be scene-setting rather than verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'attractively' traditional, suggesting a positive view. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of a clear verdict lower the confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the production as \"attractively\" traditional, suggesting a positive, albeit mild, assessment. Given the single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation, confidence is low and the score is at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt expresses gentle approval ('attractively so') of the traditional production approach, qualifying as mildly positive per the excerpt guidelines, though limited context necessitates low confidence.",
