  "bwwExcerpt": "Its current Broadway incarnation, adapted by Jack Thorne, directed by Matthew Warchus and embellished with a dozen carols, is as gleaming as a Christmas goose. Which is to say, it's no turkey. But in readying the play for Broadway, Thorne has echoed his Harry Potter and the Cursed Child themes - the tension between fathers and sons, the ways we misunderstand the people we love - and borrowed a bit from Dickens's own life, turning a weird ghost story into a thin psychological allegory about a man whose daddy didn't love him enough.",
