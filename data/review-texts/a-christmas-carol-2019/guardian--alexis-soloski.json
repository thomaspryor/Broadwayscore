However, it also notes a thin psychological allegory, indicating some reservations. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review states it's \"no turkey\" but also describes it as a \"thin psychological allegory,\" suggesting a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to a 'low' confidence score. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production as 'gleaming' and 'no turkey' but levels significant criticism at the adaptation, calling it a 'thin psychological allegory' with a dismissive tone. With only one curated excerpt available, the overall verdict remains ambiguous but leans mixed.",

Photograph: Joan MarcusView image in fullscreenCampbell Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge and the cast of A Christmas Carol on Broadway. Photograph: Joan Marcus This article is more than 6 years oldReviewA Christmas Carol review – Dickens on Broadway is a festive tearjerkerThis article is more than 6 years oldLyceum Theatre, New York\n\nJack Thorne’s Broadway transfer of the Christmas classic is sentimental but moving and boasts a host of surprises\n\nCharles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol has always been a bizarre, Yule-scented mélange of art and faith and commerce. A Victorian Christmas yarn about a miser who discovers the reason for the season with the help of various ghosts and an angelic disabled child, it was written to garner sympathy for poor children and to lift its author out of debt. In that it succeeded only partially – it sold well, but Dickens had gone in for some very expensive bindings.\n\nRead moreIts current Broadway incarnation, adapted by Jack Thorne, directed by Matthew Warchus and embellished with a dozen carols, is as gleaming as a Christmas goose. Which is to say, it’s no turkey. But in readying the play for Broadway, Thorne has echoed his Harry Potter and the Cursed Child themes – the tension between fathers and sons, the ways we misunderstand the people we love – and borrowed a bit from Dickens’s own life, turning a weird ghost story into a thin psychological allegory about a man whose daddy didn’t love him enough.\n\nThe adaptation is about what you would expect of Thorne – some story theater, some sentiment, a few genuinely moving moments. Campbell Scott, a likable actor now moving from nebbishes to heels, stars as the parsimonious Scrooge. His father, George C Scott, played the same role in a beloved television adaptation, and the younger Scott’s interpretation is more contained, less blustery, in its way quite as persuasive. Andrea Martin plays the childlike Ghost of Christmas Past with LaChanze as the imperious (and blind? and possibly Jamaican?) Ghost of Christmas Present.\n\nIn this version two boys with cerebral palsy alternate in the role of Tiny Tim. At the performance I attended it was Sebastian Ortiz, unspeakably adorable. If I was troubled by the sight of a disabled child of color brought onstage to enable a wealthy white character’s spiritual growth, I was also too busy wiping away tears to give it my full attention.\n\nAt any point, you can opt out of the sale of all of your personal information by pressing",
