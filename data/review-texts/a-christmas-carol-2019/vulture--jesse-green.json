    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the production's ability to achieve 'both intimate and epic' feel, calling it 'a neat trick' - positive language suggesting accomplishment. However, confidence is low due to limited text from single curated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a strong positive impression, highlighting the show's ability to balance intimacy and scale effectively. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper range of Positive. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, calling the show both intimate and epic. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt clearly praises the production's achievement of intimacy in a large venue, calling it a 'neat trick'—indicating solid endorsement. However, confidence is low given only one curated excerpt is available.",
