  "bwwExcerpt": "Every year around the holidays, adaptations of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol surface like regurgitated eggnog at regional theaters across the country. But Jack Thorne's retelling breathes new life into the old chestnut, creating an enchanting spectacle that really is something special. Staged with an ideal balance of sentiment and showmanship by Matthew Warchus and first seen in 2017 at London's Old Vic, where he is artistic director, the immersive production is infused with period atmosphere and heart-stirring music, fostering an infectious spirit of good cheer that reaches giddy heights with the movable feast of the play's climax.",

Disney CEO Robert Iger on Thanksgiving said the company learned of the unidentified fan’s final request and the company decided to grant his wish.\n\n“On this Thanksgiving, we at @Disney are grateful to be able to share #TheRiseOfSkywalker with a patient and his family @RowansHospice. May the force be with you and with us all!” Iger said via Twitter.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News after the screening, the man said he felt like he won the lottery.\n\n“During what is just a horrible situation to be in, you have helped to make some wonderful memories and bring some joy to my family,” the statement reads.\n\nMark Hamill was also happy to see the news.\n\n“Many thanks to @RobertIger & everyone at @Disney for making this happen! Hope the Rowan Hospice patient not only enjoyed the film, but gets an extra-special satisfaction in knowing he saw it before I did,” the actor said via Twitter.\n\nThe fan’s wife said the outpouring of support from not only Disney, but the entire Star Wars community was overwhelming.\n\n“We are truly humbled by everyone’s support,” she said in a statement to ABC News.\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is due in theaters Dec. 20.\n\nA dying Star Wars fan in England got to see #TheRiseOfSkywalker today at @RowansHospice with his family, thanks to @Disney and @RobertIger.
