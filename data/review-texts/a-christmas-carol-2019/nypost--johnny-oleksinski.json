The language indicates strong approval. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the show \"succeeds\" and feels \"fresh and necessary,\" indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers strong praise stating the adaptation succeeds where others failed, calling it 'fresh and necessary,' indicating a clear recommendation without extreme hyperbole.",
