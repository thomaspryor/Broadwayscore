  "bwwExcerpt": "While not always faithful to its source (Young Scrooge, sweetly played by Dan Piering, is given a drunken, abusive father, and old Fezziwig, sympathetically played by Evan Harrington, is an undertaker, among other alterations and additions), Thorne's adaptation pays off in its gambles. If it feels abridged and rushed at first - some secondary characters are melded together, and we're done with the Christmas Present section by intermission - this Carol goes to new places with the inevitability of a clock chime.",
