However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the set design in a positive light, but without more text, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation. I'm scoring it as mildly positive due to the descriptive but positive language.",
