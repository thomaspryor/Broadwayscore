However, the brevity and lack of detailed evaluation result in a medium confidence level. | Gemini: The critic states that the adaptation \"benefits from that approach,\" indicating a positive, though perhaps qualified, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers a mild endorsement, praising the show's approach as beneficial, though the extreme brevity of the excerpt suggests this is a capsule review or truncated text with limited evaluative detail.",
