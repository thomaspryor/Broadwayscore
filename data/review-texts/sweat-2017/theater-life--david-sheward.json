  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Nottage’s slice-of-lifer is moving and impactful even if the plot is somewhat melodramatic, thanks to Whoriskey’s detailed direction and the cast’s compassionate performances...Nottage’s script feelingly captures the plight of the working class...Yet too much of the action feels like a checklist as topics such as immigration and automation are crossed off...The play probably would have been more powerful if Nottage had not created such an obviously theatrical, tear-jerking finish.\"\n\nRead more",
