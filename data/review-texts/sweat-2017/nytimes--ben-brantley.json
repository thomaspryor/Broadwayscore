  "fullText": "The bar that is the principal location for “Sweat,” Lynn Nottage’s bracingly topical portrait of American dreams deferred in working-class Pennsylvania, is a place where friendships go to die. Sure, it looks awfully cozy and welcoming, and you can see why its denizens regard it as a second home.\n\nBut this much-trafficked watering hole also exerts a dangerous gravitational force, the kind that holds people in place when they should be moving on. In “Sweat,” which opened on Sunday night at Studio 54, the feeling of familiarity that pervades the play’s central setting gradually shades into contempt among those who drink there — for themselves, for one another and for the life they cannot escape.\n\nAs bars often are in old-fashioned and socially conscious dramas like “Sweat,” this one is a microcosm for a larger world. That includes not only Reading, Pa., the steel town where the play is set, but also a beleaguered part of the United States in which jobs are under siege and identity is fraying.\n\nIt is foolish to underestimate the anger in places like these, as the most recent presidential election confirmed. Though it takes place in 2000 and 2008, and one of its characters swears he will never vote again, “Sweat” is the first work from a major American playwright to summon, with empathy and without judgment, the nationwide anxiety that helped put Donald J. Trump in the White House.\n\nFor that reason alone, the arrival on Broadway of “Sweat,” which originated at the fertile Oregon Shakespeare Festival and was previously staged in New York at the Public Theater, warrants serious applause. So does the fact that it marks the belated Broadway debut of Ms. Nottage, a justly acclaimed dramatist of ambitious scope and fierce focus.\n\nThose traits are definitely on display in “Sweat,” which is directed by Kate Whoriskey and features a sturdy nine-member ensemble. Ms. Nottage did intensive research for this play, and it shows, perhaps more than it should.\n\nThough it is steeped in social combustibility, “Sweat” often feels too conscientiously assembled, a point-counterpoint presentation in which every disaffected voice is allowed its how-I-got-this-way monologue. And this thoughtful, careful play only seldom acquires the distance-erasing passion of Ms. Nottage’s “Ruined,” the 2009 Pulitzer Prize winner about female casualties of the Congolese civil war.\n\nThe play is set both on the eve and in the twilight of George W. Bush’s presidency. It begins in 2008 — in scenes that switch between a parole officer’s interrogations of two young men recently released from prison — and flashes back to 2000, to follow the road to the crime for which they were incarcerated.\n\nThe parolees are Jason (Will Pullen) and Chris (Khris Davis), and they were once the closest of friends. So were Jason’s mother, Tracey (Johanna Day), and Chris’s mother, Cynthia (Michelle Wilson).\n\nWith the hard-drinking Jessie (Alison Wright), these women form a triumvirate that gathers regularly at their hangout to celebrate one another’s birthdays and swap workplace gossip and grievances. (The unobtrusively on-target set is by John Lee Beatty, with costumes in the same vein by Jennifer Moeller.)\n\nMothers, sons and Jessie work for the town’s venerable steel tubing factory. So did Stan (James Colby), the bartender, but he lost his job after a leg-maiming accident. Everyone complains about the factory, but the work it has provided for generations of Reading residents shapes the rhyme and reason of their shared world.\n\nLynn Nottage explains how a broken city gets a turn onstage in her play “Sweat.”\n\nThere are rumors of imminent layoffs, though, which grow louder during the scenes set in 2000, along with speculation that the entire plant might relocate to Mexico. (The Nafta treaty is invoked with four-letter opprobrium.)\n\nSuch talk brings out Darwinian survival instincts, especially once Cynthia gets a job in management at the factory. Aspirations to another life may be common among these people, but such hopes are widely resented when they show signs of becoming reality.\n\nThat Cynthia is black and Tracey and Jessie are white becomes an issue in a way it never was before. So does the presence of Stan’s helper, Oscar (Carlo Albán), whose family comes from Colombia.\n\nThere is little doubt that when the rage festering among them fully erupts, no one will emerge unscarred. The shriveled, drug-addled figure of Cynthia’s estranged husband, Brucie (John Earl Jelks), looms as a possible prophecy of everyone else’s fate.\n\nUntil the play’s penultimate scene, “Sweat” keeps the nature of its climactic act of violence a secret, and the sense of mystery is underscored by questions posed and unanswered — between mothers and sons, and the men and their parole officer, Evan (Lance Coadie Williams) — in the 2008 scenes.\n\nAt the same time, all the characters in “Sweat” are given to elaborate passages of exposition, laying out the histories of their families, their employers, their city. Some of these, such as Tracey’s speech about the devaluing of manual labor, have a poignant lyricism.\n\nBut they are passages that turn those delivering these monologues into social case studies, a status that the bluntly drawn performances do not always combat. The soliloquies might just as easily belong to a series of human-interest news features as to a play.\n\nYou appreciate Ms. Nottage’s insistence that we be able to trace exactly the sources of her character’s unhappiness. But a little more indirection would be more dramatically satisfying.\n\n“Sweat” is best at its muddiest, when love and hate, and the urges to strike out and to comfort, teeter in precipitous balance. That’s when Ms. Nottage’s characters, and the cast members who embody them, emerge in their full tragic humanity.\n\nIt’s a paradox given beautiful life when Ms. Day’s Tracey, after angrily lecturing Oscar outside the bar, relents and gives him the cigarette he had asked for earlier; and when Tracey and Cynthia, now at loggerheads, share a memory of an eventful trip to Atlantic City.\n\nIn the play’s opening scene, Chris tells his parole officer about his first encounter with Jason after they’ve been released from prison. As the tension of the moment is described here, you expect the men to hit each other. Chris remembers his fingernails digging into his palms.\n\nInstead, to Chris’s obvious amazement: “We’re hugging. Hugging. I don’t know why.” There is a rich eloquence in his inarticulateness that this well-spoken play could use more of.",
