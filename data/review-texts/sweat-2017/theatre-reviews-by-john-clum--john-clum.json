  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Lynn Nottage's play has powerful moments, yet there is something that rings false about the play...The play seems to hover between realistic drama and docudrama…The second act, in which tensions come to a violent head, is far more effective than the talky first act…There are powerful moments in 'Sweat,' but there are flaws…The ensemble couldn't be better...Kate Whoriskey has given the play as much of a sense of authenticity as the script allows.\"\n\nRead more",
