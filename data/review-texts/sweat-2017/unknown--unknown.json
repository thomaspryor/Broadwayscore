That’s when Ms. Nottage’s characters, and the cast members who embody them, emerge in their full tragic humanity.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning applies - this mixed assessment could represent a broader negative or positive verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the play's strengths in character depth but criticizes it for feeling too 'conscientiously assembled'. The mixed tone suggests neither a strong recommendation nor a discouragement. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the play's topicality and tragic humanity but also notes that it feels \"too conscientiously assembled.\" This suggests a mixed reaction, leaning towards neither recommending nor discouraging. | Kimi: The excerpt offers both praise ('bracingly topical', 'full tragic humanity' for the cast) and significant criticism ('too conscientiously assembled', didactic structure). With only one curated excerpt available, the mixed signals suggest an ambivalent verdict rather than a clear recommendation.",
