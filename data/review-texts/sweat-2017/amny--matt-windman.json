  "bwwExcerpt": "'Sweat' is an involving drama, calibrated to increase in intensity toward its brutal climax. Nottage, who won a Pulitzer for 'Ruined,' explores her characters and their environment with the sensitivity of a master dramatist and the objectivity of a journalist. She doesn't provide any answers, only the faintest hope that people will take care of each other, even in desperate circumstances.",
