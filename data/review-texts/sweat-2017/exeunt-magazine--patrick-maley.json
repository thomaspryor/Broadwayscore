  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Worthy of all the considerable hype. Gritty, unapologetic, and never timid, the play examines the troubled lives of its blue-collar characters with stunningly compassionate introspection. Part of the play’s power comes from Nottage diving deep into a familiar and well-worn story line and bringing her masterful eye to it…The cast is universally strong…There is perhaps no better contemporary playwright at combing the rich nexus of history and humanity than Lynn Nottage.”\n\nRead more",
