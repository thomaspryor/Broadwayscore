  "bwwExcerpt": "Nottage, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of 'Ruined,' eloquently captures the malaise among a group of longtime coworkers at a Berks County, Pennsylvania, mill. As their career prospects fade-a fate one character attributes to 'that NAFTA bulls--'-they turn on one another, leading to a climax that is no less upsetting, even when you know it's coming. 'Sweat' should be hailed for its visceral performance by JohAnna Day, as the conniving and xenophobic Tracey, a longtime floor worker who sees her job as a generational entitlement.",
