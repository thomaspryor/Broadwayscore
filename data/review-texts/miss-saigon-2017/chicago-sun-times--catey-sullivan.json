  "bwwExcerpt": "But something remarkable happens under director Laurence Connor's direction of the lavish, no-expense-spared national tour. Powerfully aided by Bob Avian's choreography, the Broadway-sized ensemble cast captures the annihilating destructiveness of war with merciless, shattering vividness. If you missed the first televised war when it brought Vietnam into the living rooms of Mr. and Mrs. America in the 1960s and '70s, \"Miss Saigon\" offers a glimpse at the kind of images that helped the tide turn ",
