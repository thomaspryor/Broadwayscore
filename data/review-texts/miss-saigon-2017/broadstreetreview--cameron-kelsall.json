  "bwwExcerpt": "The production itself doesn't. Directed to bloated excess by Laurence Connor, it resembles an animatronic amusement-park attraction-the sights garish, the performers anonymous and interchangeable. Like most musical productions these days, it aurally assaults the audience with overamplification. Luckily, this becomes a blessing of sorts: if you could understand the lyrics, you'd cringe.",
