This creates a clear mixed verdict where artistic merit conflicts with content issues. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the production's spectacle but criticizes its racism and sexism, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the spectacle of the revival but also points out significant issues, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The review offers high praise for the production values ('spectacular,' 'soaring melodies') but significantly tempers this with moral reservations, noting that 'racism and sexism are hard to ignore,' resulting in a balanced mixed verdict.",
