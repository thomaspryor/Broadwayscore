  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Epic visually but very thin on story line…The score never lives up to the magnificence of ‘Les Misérables’...As for Jon Jon Briones as the Engineer, I honestly have no idea what he is conveying…Totally lacking in personality, charisma and style...Ms. Noblezada is enchanting as Kim, but Mr. Brammer lacks the passion that tortures Chris for having left Kim behind…Its direction by Laurence Connor is listless and aimless, no real vision or structure to it.”\n\nRead more",
