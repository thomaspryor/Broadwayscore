    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges strong production values and performances but finds the show fundamentally problematic and dated. The 60 rating confirms mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the production's impressive values and performances but criticizes the dated and problematic nature of the show's perspective. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like the production and performances, but ultimately finds the show's core problematic, resulting in a mixed assessment. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: While the critic praises the production values and performances ('handsome, well-performed'), they find the musical's orientalist perspective 'increasingly dated' and the material 'problematic at its core,' resulting in a neutral assessment reflected in the 60/100 rating.",
