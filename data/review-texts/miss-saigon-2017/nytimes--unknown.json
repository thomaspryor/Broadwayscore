  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'Miss Saigon' is as mechanically melodramatic as any theatrical potboiler from the early 20th century...It’s not as if such stories don’t still have the power to stir suspense and tears. But this eventful, sung-through production out of London, directed by Laurence Connor, feels about as affecting as a historical diorama, albeit a lavishly appointed one. This despite the hard and dedicated work of its earnest cast.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic finds the production 'mechanically melodramatic' and compares it unfavorably to a lifeless 'historical diorama.' Despite acknowledging the cast's 'hard and dedicated work,' the overall assessment is clearly negative. | GPT-4o: The review describes the production as 'mechanically melodramatic' and 'as affecting as a historical diorama,' suggesting a lack of emotional impact despite the cast's efforts. The tone is negative, but the excerpt is limited, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the hard work of the cast but ultimately finds the production lacking emotional impact, comparing it to a diorama. This suggests a mixed assessment, leaning towards the lower end of the Mixed range due to the negative comparison. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as mechanically melodramatic and unaffecting, explicitly contrasting the lavish production values and dedicated cast with the lifeless result, indicating a clear recommendation against seeing it.",
