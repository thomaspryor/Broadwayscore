  "bwwExcerpt": "But \"Miss Saigon,\" which is directed by Laurence Connor, isn't awful only because it's racist. It's theater not as Disney movie, but as Disney theme park ride. Characters and plot threads are only as defined as plastic dioramas you encounter for a split second before a roller coaster whisks you to the next thwack-thwack-thwack of that infernal helicopter, the musical's signature, which lurches down from the rafters with all the grace of a claw crane in an arcade game.
