  "bwwExcerpt": "A new revival of 'Miss Saigon' opened Thursday at the Broadway Theatre, and once again the music is merely loud when it needs to be affecting.

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Once again the music is merely loud when it needs to be affecting...Rather than giving us an impression of the repressive regime, director Laurence Connor and choreographer Bob Avian turn these songs into typical Broadway showstoppers...If only the songwriters had recycled more from Kander and Ebb...The lyrics by Boublil and Matlby Jr. can be summed up in their creation of a character named John.
