  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Schönberg's score is unfailingly melodic, but it doesn't add the requisite gravity and dramatic heft to such potboiler plotting. This is not for lack of trying…The lyrics are distressingly generic. It doesn't help that the characters are mostly one-dimensional and prone to dramatic flip-flops…Still, if you're a fan of ‘Miss Saigon,’ this is a first-class revival, both in terms of its cast and production values.”\n\nRead more",
