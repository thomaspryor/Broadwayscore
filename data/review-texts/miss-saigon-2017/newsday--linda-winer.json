  "bwwExcerpt": "The story feels more urgent amid renewed refugee tragedies and our consciousness of the sex trade. And the narrative - helped by unusually graceful lyrics by Boublil and Richard Maltby Jr. - almost distract from the generic Euro-pop ballads and anthems that sound like many we've heard before. There is still no distinction between the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese, with no explanation for the civil war, and the fake documentary showing real international orphans still strikes me as shameless.",
