  "bwwExcerpt": "The sung-through musical echoes the lush melodies and themes from the composers' Les Miz score while peppering the narrative with politically satirical overtones. It falls on the Engineer to finesse the social commentary and comic relief, which Jon Jon Briones pulls off brilliantly. His biggest number 'The American Dream' can't resist poking fun at our current ruler. This is a most worthy revival, and now, minus the controversy, fans are free to re-live the thrill.",
