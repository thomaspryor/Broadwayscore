  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The helicopter may not be completely the real thing but with the help of lighting and strong fans, it's still pretty amazing...Using that spectacle factor and the quality of the singing as a baseline to judge whether 'Miss Saigon' holds up, the answer is 'yes.' This is the biggest, most spectacle-rich show in town...Noblezada sings with enough feeling to touch even the most cynical members of the audience...Current events make this new production as sadly timely as it is entertaining.\" \n\nRead more",
