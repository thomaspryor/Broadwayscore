  "bwwExcerpt": "Stylistically, 'Miss Saigon' is a remnant of the bombastic, spectacle-driven, opera-meets-rock English mega-musicals that conquered Broadway in the '80s and '90s, such as 'Les Miz' and Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'Cats' and 'Phantom.' But as a piece of political theater that depicts Americans involved in a disastrous foreign war, cultural misunderstanding, the difficulties of emigrating to the U.S. as a refugee and the pursuit of success through shameless exploitation, 'Miss Saigon' is more relevant and heartbreaking today than when it premiered on Broadway in 1991 at the same theater.",
  "bwwScore": 9,
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'Miss Saigon' is more relevant and heartbreaking today than when it premiered on Broadway in 1991...As directed by Laurence Connor, this solid and satisfying revival builds on the extraordinary visuals, nonstop adrenaline, sweeping emotions and pulsating musical score that characterized the original production while adding an unmissable brutality and grittiness...Briones, Noblezada and Brammer are giving high-intensity performances that stand on par with their predecessors.\"\n\nRead more"
