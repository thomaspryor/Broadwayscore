  "bwwExcerpt": "Linda Lavin is alternately sardonic and fragile in the New York premiere of Richard Greenberg's drama \"Our Mother's Brief Affair\"...The notion of \"legacy\" weighs heavily in the drama, which touches on themes such as the suburban dream, and the desire, when one's life is nearing its end, \"to be known\"...Lavin...paints a balanced portrait here, as a Long Island mom who dutifully raised two kids despite being in a marriage that was never romantic... Greenberg...is making a point about \"scale,\" that",
