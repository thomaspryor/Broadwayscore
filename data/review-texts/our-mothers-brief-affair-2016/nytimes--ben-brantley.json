    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear negative assessment - comparing the play to an overlong therapy session with 'diminishing returns' for the audience is a direct criticism of the theatrical experience. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, likening the play to an overextended therapy session with diminishing returns, indicating a lack of engagement or satisfaction. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses a negative sentiment, suggesting the play is tedious and unrewarding. Given the single excerpt and negative tone, I placed it in the negative bucket. | Kimi: The critic uses the metaphor of an overlong therapy session to describe a tedious experience that fails to justify its length, explicitly stating the audience receives 'diminishing returns'—a clear indication not to recommend the show.",
