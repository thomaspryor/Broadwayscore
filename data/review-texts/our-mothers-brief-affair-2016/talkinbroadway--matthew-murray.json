    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative assessment - the play 'never quite achieves' its goals and 'wants desperately' suggests failed ambition. However, single excerpt warning requires low confidence as this could be setup for a more nuanced verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt indicates that the play fails to achieve its intended depth, suggesting a negative assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low as the full review context is missing. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the play falls short of its goals, suggesting a mixed or lukewarm reception. Given only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt clearly states the play fails to achieve its intended emotional and intellectual goals, indicating a negative assessment. With only one curated excerpt available, confidence is reduced.",
