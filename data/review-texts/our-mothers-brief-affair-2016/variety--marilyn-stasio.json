  "bwwExcerpt": "Not even the sainted Linda Lavin can save the deeply unpleasant character she plays in \"Our Mother's Brief Affair,\" a lazy play by Richard Greenberg...Stubbornly lacking in dramatic tension, the uneventful narrative features a mean-spirited woman who may or may not be on her deathbed, recounting a closely held secret to her disagreeable grown children. There's little to fault in the attractively mounted and very well cast production...Lavin's keen acerbic wit is wasted...on a character like Anna",
