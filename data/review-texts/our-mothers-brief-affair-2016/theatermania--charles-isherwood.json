    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the play appreciatively as a 'gentle, bittersweet meditation,' suggesting positive assessment, but lack of stronger evaluative language or clear recommendation keeps it in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation, describing the play as 'gentle' and 'bittersweet,' indicating a favorable impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the play as a \"gentle, bittersweet meditation,\" suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic assessment. Given the single excerpt and the instruction to use the lower end of the bucket for mildly positive reviews, a score of 74 seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt uses warm but subdued descriptors ('gentle,' 'bittersweet,' 'meditation') indicating appreciation without enthusiasm, consistent with a mild recommendation. Single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
