  "bwwExcerpt": "The play is filled with attempts at wit, like the one Mom delivers about her son being a \"string terrorist.\" Or statements that \"the potato chip is nature's most perfect food,\" which Lavin delivers as if she's quoting Oscar Wilde. The actress is a real trouper. \"Affair\" is nearly a drama-less drama. Nearly every conflict presented is resolved by someone on stage telling us how it is resolved...Likewise, character traits are thrown out and dismissed.",
