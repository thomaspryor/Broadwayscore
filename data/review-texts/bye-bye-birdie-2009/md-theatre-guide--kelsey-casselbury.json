Low confidence due to insufficient context for full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the ensemble and choreography, indicating a positive view of the production elements. However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach, leading to a mildly positive score. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the ensemble and choreography, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic review. Given the single excerpt and lack of overall verdict, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong praise for the ensemble and choreography, describing the group as 'fantastic' and commending the choreographer's ability to create quality work despite a rushed timeline, indicating a clearly positive assessment.",
