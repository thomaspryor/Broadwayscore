    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic clearly finds the revival 'tired and tepid' - decisively negative language. The praise for individual performances ('energetic') doesn't redeem the overall negative assessment, following the pattern where performer praise doesn't override a pan verdict. | GPT-4o: The review describes the revival as 'tired and tepid', indicating a lack of enthusiasm or recommendation, despite some praise for the performances. The single excerpt suggests a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review states the show feels \"tired and tepid\" despite the performances, indicating a negative overall assessment. The presence of performer praise does not redeem the negative verdict. | Kimi: The critic describes the revival as 'tired and tepid,' using 'despite' to indicate that energetic performances cannot overcome the show's lack of vitality, indicating a clear negative verdict.",
