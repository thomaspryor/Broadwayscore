(Click on links for complete stories.)\n\n“I was so nervous I went to hide in a broom closet in the theater. I opened the door and heard a growl. It was Mike. He was already in there.” —\n Charles Strouse, who wrote the music for “Bye Bye Birdie,” recalls an unexpected encounter with the musical’s book writer, Michael Stewart, during an out-of-town tryout in Philadelphia\n\n“Wow, look at that, wow! The film proceeded from wow.” —\n the avant-garde filmmaker Ken Jacobs, who will be presenting his work during a week-long series in Los Angeles, explains the inspiration behind experimental movies like “Tom, Tom, the Piper’s Son”\n\n“I said: ‘No, Johnny, the show is on Showtime. I’m not even going on a regular network, Johnny. I promise you I am no threat of any kind.’ ” —\n Garry Shandling recounts how he told Johnny Carson he was quitting “The Tonight Show” to focus on his cable sitcom “It’s Garry Shandling’s Show”\n\n“It was the first time we saw black alpha males in movies. Before, black men were depicted as buffoons, servants. I remember watching blaxploitation and logging all the dead white people … I’d never\n seen movies where a black guy killing white people was permitted.” —\n Michael Jai White, the star of the blaxploitation homage “Black Dynamite,” discusses his appreciation for the genre\n\nComments are no longer being accepted.",

This is a clear negative assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, comparing the production unfavorably to a high school show. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt clearly indicates a negative assessment, comparing the production unfavorably to a high school performance despite its budget. | Kimi: The critic delivers a harsh assessment comparing the production to amateur high school theater and suggesting it wastes its professional resources. However, confidence is reduced given this is a single curated excerpt that may not capture the full review's nuance.",
