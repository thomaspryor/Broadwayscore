    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic directly compares the Broadway production unfavorably to a high school production, suggesting it doesn't deserve its professional budget or Broadway status. This is a clear negative assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, comparing the production unfavorably to a high school show. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt clearly indicates a negative assessment, comparing the production unfavorably to a high school performance despite its budget. | Kimi: The critic delivers a harsh assessment comparing the production to amateur high school theater and suggesting it wastes its professional resources. However, confidence is reduced given this is a single curated excerpt that may not capture the full review's nuance.",
