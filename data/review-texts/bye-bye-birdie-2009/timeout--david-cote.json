    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this clearly in Mixed territory. While praising the cast's energy, the overall assessment is that the show feels 'dated and harmless' - neither a recommendation nor a pan. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review. The text describes the revival as 'dated and harmless' despite 'energetic performances,' indicating a lack of strong recommendation or discouragement. | Gemini: The critic finds the show \"dated and harmless\" but acknowledges \"energetic performances.\" This indicates a mixed reaction, aligning with the original rating of 60. | Kimi: The 60/100 rating and the critic's own language ('dated and harmless') place this squarely in Mixed territory. The 'despite' framing shows the performances don't overcome the core criticism. The verdict is neither a recommendation nor a warning—just a lukewarm assessment.",
