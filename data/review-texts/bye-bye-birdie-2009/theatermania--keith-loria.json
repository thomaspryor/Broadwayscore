  "bwwExcerpt": "Beaming with charisma and spot-on comic timing, Christian Borle is the ideal Albert, trying to balance managing Birdie’s less-than-press-appropriate lifestyle with his secretary-girlfriend who is losing patience waiting for a ring, and his guilt-inducing mother who has nary a kind word to say and tries to manipulate her son at every turn. Borle is well polished in making audiences smile, and his antics in “Put on a Happy Face” seemed very on-brand. Sarah Chiu as Helen matches Borle’s enthusiasm ",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt focuses on praising lead performance with enthusiastic language ('ideal', 'beaming with charisma', 'spot-on'), but truncated nature makes full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Christian Borle's performance and comic timing, suggesting a positive view of his role. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment of the review is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on praising Christian Borle's performance and enthusiasm, suggesting a positive overall experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper range of 'Positive' with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Christian Borle's performance as 'ideal' with 'spot-on comic timing,' and compliments Sarah Chiu's matching enthusiasm, though the limited excerpt prevents full assessment of the overall production.",
