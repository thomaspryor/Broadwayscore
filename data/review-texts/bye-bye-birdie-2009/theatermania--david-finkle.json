This is a negative recommendation against seeing the show, though not a complete pan. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the revival fails to live up to its past, implying a negative view. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review states that the show should have been left in the past, indicating a negative assessment. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is medium. | Kimi: The critic explicitly advises against seeing this revival, stating the production should have remained unproduced and rudely awakens fond memories of the original.",
