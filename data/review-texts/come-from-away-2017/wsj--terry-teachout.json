The language used indicates a powerful and moving experience. | Gemini: The review highlights the moving nature of the show, focusing on the positive portrayal of human kindness. This indicates a positive recommendation, though without strong superlatives. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise, calling the show 'moving' and commending its portrayal of human kindness, indicating a positive recommendation, though the extremely brief length requires low confidence.",
