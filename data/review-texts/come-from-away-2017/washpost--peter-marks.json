  "bwwExcerpt": "The lump that forms in your throat in the opening minutes of 'Come From Away' - and remains lodged there for 100 buoyant minutes more - is the physiological confirmation that this effervescent musical, enveloped in Canadian good will, is an antidote for what ails the American soul...The alternating stories of the townspeople and the strangers in their midst - all played by a dozen superbly cast actors - are communicated vivaciously by book and songwriters Irene Sankoff and David Hein, in a bracingly kinetic production directed by Christopher Ashley, doing some of the most impressive work of his career. With the arrival of 'Come From Away' to Broadway's 2016-17 season, joining such accomplished new shows as 'Dear Evan Hansen' and 'Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812,'the Tony race for best musical of the year just got interesting.",
