  "bwwExcerpt": "It's a story that sings...The score consists nearly entirely of group numbers. Music is flavored by Celtic folk, gentle rock, foot-stomping rhythms and perhaps a whisper of Gordon Lightfoot. While rousing and rich in harmony, the music suffers from sameness and a sound mix that obscures lyrics. Director Christopher Ashley guides the excellent cast and energizing staging. The show glides along, a nonstop one hour and 40 minute trip. It's a singing reminder that when things are at their worst, people can be at their best.",
