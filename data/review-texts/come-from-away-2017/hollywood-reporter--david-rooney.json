  "wrongFullText": "Former Trump aide Jason Miller is joining CNN as a commentator, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.\n\nMiller was appointed as White House director of communications after serving as a senior communications director on Donald Trump‘s presidential campaign and transition team.\n\nHe backed out of his White House job, however, just two days after the then president-elect announced Miller would be joining his senior communications team in December.\n\n“I am excited they will be leading the team that will communicate my agenda that will Make America Great Again,” Trump said at the time, while naming Miller, along with press secretary Sean Spicer, director of strategic communications Hope Hicks and social media director Dan Scavino.\n\nSpicer subsequently took over Miller’s duties.\n\n\"After spending this past week with my family, the most amount of time I have been able to spend with them since March 2015, it is clear they need to be my top priority right now and this is not the right time to start a new job as demanding as White House communications director,\" Miller, who had a second daughter in January, said at the time of his departure.\n\nA report alleging Miller was having an affair with another transition official also clouded his exit.\n\nPolitico was first to report the news of Miller’s hire.\n\nMiller, who called himself a Trump supporter while appearing on the network Sunday, isn’t the first to make the move from Trump’s camp to CNN.\n\nThe network faced criticism when it hired Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager, as a paid contributor shortly after he was fired by Trump but was still receiving payments from the campaign. Lewandowski resigned from the network in November."
