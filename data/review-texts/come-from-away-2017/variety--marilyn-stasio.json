    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review praises the show as 'sweet-natured' that 'warms the heart' and specifically commends it for avoiding emotional manipulation, indicating a positive recommendation though without strong superlatives. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'sweet-natured' and 'warms the heart,' indicating a positive tone. However, the lack of superlatives and the phrase 'without manipulating the emotions' suggests a more reserved recommendation. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"sweet-natured\" and \"warms the heart,\" which indicates a positive recommendation, although not an enthusiastic one. | Kimi: The critic offers unambiguous praise for the show's emotional impact and tasteful handling of sensitive material, describing it as heartwarming and sincere, though the brief length suggests this may be an excerpt.",
