  "bwwExcerpt": "The true-life story that inspired the new musical Come From Away would seem like the stuff of a Frank Capra movie. The show relates the tale of how a small Newfoundland town in 2001 found itself unexpectedly hosting 7,000 airline passengers stranded there for days after 9/11. But though the material might have lent itself to sickly sweet sentimentality, creators Irene Sankoff and David Hein have crafted a heartwarming and thoroughly entertaining musical. Especially in these politically fractious times, it should prove a true crowd-pleaser on Broadway following previous hit engagements in San Diego, Washington D.C. and Toronto.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive recommendation calling it 'heartwarming and thoroughly entertaining' and predicting it 'should prove a true crowd-pleaser.' Single excerpt warning suggests using upper end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'heartwarming and thoroughly entertaining' and suggests it will be a 'crowd-pleaser'. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning lowers confidence, but the positive language supports a strong positive score. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"heartwarming\" and \"thoroughly entertaining musical\". Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper range of positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise, describing the show as 'heartwarming,' 'thoroughly entertaining,' and a 'true crowd-pleaser,' representing a clear recommendation despite the limitation of having only a single curated quote.",
