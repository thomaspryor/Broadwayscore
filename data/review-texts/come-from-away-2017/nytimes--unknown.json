The tone is clearly positive, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"big bearhug of a musical\" and praises the show's respect for complexity, indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the show's emotional impact and intelligence, describing it as a 'big bearhug' that handles sensitive material with respect and complexity.",
