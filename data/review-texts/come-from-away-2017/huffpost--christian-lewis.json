  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Technically, there is nothing wrong with 'Come From Away.' The ensemble of the piece work amazingly together...A very upbeat and positive vibe of hospitality and community...Uplifting, entertaining, and enjoyable; it's easy listening...However, it certainly is not ground-breaking, precedent-smashing, or boldly innovative...Just exists...Somewhat boring and unoriginal...Feels as conventional, low-budget, and unspectacular as a school production and community theater musical.\"\n\nRead more",
