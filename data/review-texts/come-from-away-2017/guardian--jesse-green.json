However, this appears to be a truncated excerpt with only the opening sentence, requiring medium confidence. | Gemini: The review expresses a strong positive sentiment, stating that the musical restores faith in both musicals and humanity. This indicates a highly favorable opinion and recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers unqualified superlative praise using extreme positive language ('restores your faith'), indicating an enthusiastic, must-see recommendation with no reservations mentioned.",
