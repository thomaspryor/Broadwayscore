  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Rarely has altruism and compassion been as deeply explored and conveyed, much less in a hundred-minute musical...Music and lyrics mesh seamlessly, as the portrayals switch on a dime from townspeople to passengers and back again…A uniformly excellent cast…The show is in constant motion, with locations evoked by simple shifts in alignment of chairs. You’re never in doubt about where you are, and for the duration of ‘Come from Away’ you wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.”\n\nRead more",
