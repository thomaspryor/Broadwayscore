  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"There are 10 new titles debuting across the year, but 'Come from Away' towers over the rest in terms of originality and daring...Sankoff and Hein's folk-based score has an easy affability and an earnest sincerity. Christopher Ashley's production gives the show a homespun honesty, and the 12-strong ensemble company, each of whom plays multiple characters, invest it with real feeling and emotion...A musical that tells an unusual, unfamiliar 9/11 story with tact and tremendous feeling.\"\n\nRead more",
