  "bwwExcerpt": "Come From Away is more a rambunctious, musical exhalation rather than a deep and thoughtful examination. It's a snapshot of lives far from New York and D.C. in flux. 9/11 is not the show's focus or even default focus: it is simply the event that has brought these people together. The show now finds itself in New York, site of the most iconic tragedy of that day-and a cheery rock-musical about 9/11 may not be the first theatrical choice for those to whom the city has long been home and who may have their own complex relationship to 9/11. For some, maybe the musical itself strikes a bum note: it is not set here, and it is not directly about the human tragedy of that day. But Come From Away doesn't trivialize the events of 9/11 or seek to facetiously co-opt them. It is as simple in its focus as the acts of goodness and gratitude at its thematic core.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The review acknowledges potential concerns about the show's approach but ultimately defends it as genuine and well-intentioned. However, with only one excerpt available that focuses heavily on contextual concerns rather than clear recommendation, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's positive aspects, such as its focus on goodness and gratitude, but also notes potential issues with its approach to 9/11, suggesting a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges potential issues with the show's tone and focus, particularly for New Yorkers, but also states it doesn't trivialize the events. This suggests a mixed reaction, falling into the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: While acknowledging the show favors 'rambunctious' energy over deep examination and may not suit all NYC audiences, the critic defends its handling of sensitive material and praises its thematic focus on goodness, suggesting a qualified recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",

Whatever your cynicism levels around how that may sound on paper, resistance to the show-as-performed is pretty futile.\"\n\nRead more"
