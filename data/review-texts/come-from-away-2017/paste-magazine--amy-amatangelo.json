  "bwwExcerpt": "\"With nothing to distract the viewer's eye, the bare-bones set brings the incredible performances to the forefront. The actors never leave the stage, just switch up a few costume items (a jacket, a hat) and a few accents to portray different characters. They move with a precise, soothing, seamlessly choreographed rhythm. For a show with a foundation in tragedy, it has some truly funny moments-many of which lovingly mock Gander's kindness.\"",
