  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Yes, ‘Come from Away’ is heartwarming. One cannot help but be moved and inspired by seeing the citizens of a tiny island band together and selflessly open their doors to help thousands of strangers. And yet something is missing. Although it is based on true, unique stories from 9/11, the musical seems to glaze over the actual tragedy of the events…It would be a more successful show if it dug a little deeper for context and meaning.”\n\nRead more",
