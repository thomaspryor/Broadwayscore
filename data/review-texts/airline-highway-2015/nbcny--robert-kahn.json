    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a positive evaluation of Julie White's performance, describing her as 'just lovely'. However, due to the limited context and single excerpt, the confidence is low, and the score reflects a mildly positive sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on Julie White's performance and describes it as \"lovely,\" which suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic assessment. Given the single excerpt and lack of overall context, confidence is low, and the score is in the lower-middle of the Positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers mild praise for Julie White's performance ('lovely') but provides no overall verdict on the production; scoring at lower end of Positive range per instructions for curated excerpts with limited context.",
