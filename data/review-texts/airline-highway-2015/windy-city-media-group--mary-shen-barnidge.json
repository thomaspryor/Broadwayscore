However, single excerpt warning applies - this could be from a larger mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the play for failing to realize its potential and using a 'cheap plot device' for social conflict. The tone suggests disappointment and a negative outlook on the production. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses disappointment, stating the play \"shoot[s] itself in the foot.\" Given the negative tone and the truncated text, a negative score is appropriate, but with low confidence.",
