And in that regard, Airline Highway lets you think you’ve glimpsed it.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises cast performances and the play's ability to provide insight into characters' world, but notes structural issues with plot. Single excerpt warning requires cautious scoring in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast's performances and suggests the play offers a meaningful glimpse into a different world, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the performances and suggests the play offers a glimpse into a different world, but the lack of a strong overarching plot and the limited dialogue for characters suggest reservations. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring on the lower end of Positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the entire cast ('excellent performance') and suggests the play successfully immerses viewers in an unfamiliar world, indicating a clear recommendation despite the episodic structure.",
