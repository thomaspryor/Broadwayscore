Text appears cut off but the verdict is unambiguous. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'a road to nowhere' with 'contrived storytelling,' and suggests the only desirable action is to leave. This indicates a strongly negative review. However, given the single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly negative, describing the show as a \"road to nowhere\" and recommending the \"exit ramp.\" | Kimi: The critic delivers a devastating verdict, describing the show as a \"road to nowhere\" with contrived storytelling and explicitly recommending the \"exit ramp\" as the only desirable element, indicating a strong recommendation against seeing the production.",
