Their aimlessness might translate literally to some audiences while the refreshing lack of melodrama might entice others...Director Joe Mantello has wisely retained most of his first-rate Steppenwolf cast. They make 'Airline Highway' more than worth a one-night stay.\"\n\nRead more",

Despite noting some on-the-nose writing, the overall tone is enthusiastic about the production. | Gemini: The review states the show is \"more than worth a one-night stay,\" which indicates a positive recommendation. However, due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While criticizing the writing as 'on-the-nose' and noting the aimlessness may alienate some viewers, the critic ultimately delivers a clear recommendation based on the first-rate cast and refreshing lack of melodrama.",
