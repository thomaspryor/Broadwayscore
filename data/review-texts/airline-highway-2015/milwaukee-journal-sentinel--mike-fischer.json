    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows constructive criticism about pacing and structure issues, while acknowledging a 'solid cast'. The tone suggests potential but execution problems, placing it in mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights issues with pacing and the ending, suggesting a mixed review. The mention of a 'solid cast' indicates some positive elements, but overall, the critique of writing and structure suggests a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt points out issues with the writing and pacing, but also acknowledges a solid cast. The ending is also criticized. This suggests a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the cast ('solid') and stories ('textured') but criticizes the writing/directing for excessive detail, slow pacing, and a struggling conclusion. With only one curated excerpt available, the overall verdict is ambiguous but leans neither clearly positive nor negative.",
