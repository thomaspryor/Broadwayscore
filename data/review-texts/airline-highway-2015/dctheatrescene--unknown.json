  "bwwExcerpt": "There is a feel of improvisation, although everything is scripted. And, while the individual performers get their moments for solos, the play comes off as a collective composition of overlapping voices. The 16 performers work together so effectively in creating the community that hangs around the Hummingbird Motel, that they surely deserve a Tony Award for great ensemble acting...Director Joe Mantello...works hard to orient us to what approximates Robert Altman's style of fly-on-the-wall filmmak",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the ensemble as Tony-worthy and commends the director's work, indicating a positive recommendation. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential for cherry-picking positive moments from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the ensemble's performance and suggests a Tony Award, indicating strong approval. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low despite the positive tone. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the ensemble acting and direction, suggesting a strong positive experience. The mention of a Tony Award indicates high praise. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the ensemble cast, suggesting Tony-worthy performances, and compliments the director's effective work, indicating a clear positive recommendation despite the limited single-excerpt format.",
