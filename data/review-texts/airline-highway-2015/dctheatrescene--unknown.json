  "bwwExcerpt": "There is a feel of improvisation, although everything is scripted. And, while the individual performers get their moments for solos, the play comes off as a collective composition of overlapping voices. The 16 performers work together so effectively in creating the community that hangs around the Hummingbird Motel, that they surely deserve a Tony Award for great ensemble acting...Director Joe Mantello...works hard to orient us to what approximates Robert Altman's style of fly-on-the-wall filmmak",
