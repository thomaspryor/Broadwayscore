However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, calling it one of the best plays of the year and well worth the investment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt contains strong positive language, calling it one of the best new plays and well worth the time and money. The phrase \"a whole lotta fun\" further reinforces the positive sentiment.",
