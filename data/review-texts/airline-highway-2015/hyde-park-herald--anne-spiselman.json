  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"D’Amour’s play falls short in a variety of ways...The limited story line is contrived. The characters are more generic than compellingly individual. The stakes aren’t high enough for us to care about them. The quasi-poetic writing at times borders on pretentious and preachy. The hard-to-follow overlapping conversations become tiresome.

Clear negative recommendation despite performer praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights multiple shortcomings of the play, including a contrived storyline, generic characters, and pretentious writing. The only positive note is the acting, which is not enough to redeem the overall negative assessment. | Gemini: The review lists many flaws in the play, including a contrived storyline, generic characters, and pretentious writing. While the acting is praised, it's not enough to overcome the negative aspects. | Kimi: While the critic praises some performances as the 'main reason to see the show,' the review enumerates significant flaws including a contrived plot, generic characters, pretentious writing, and tiresome dialogue, indicating an overall negative assessment that does not recommend the production.",
