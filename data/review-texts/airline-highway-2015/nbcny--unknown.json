  "bwwExcerpt": "Drifting in and out of the crumbling Humming Bird Motel are a half-dozen friends, including Tanya, a prostitute (Tony winner Julie White)...For Tanya, who gave up her own biological children for adoption, the Humming Bird family has become an outlet for nurturing instincts, and White is just lovely as a woman who can't face the decisions of her own past. 'Airline Highway' also includes an excellent turn from K. Todd Freeman as Sissy Na Na, a trans bartender who is the play's requisite voice of spiritual wisdom. The raucous party organized by Tanya brings with it much of the energy we associate with the freewheeling city...There aren't any sort of tidy resolutions in 'Airline Highway,' and we never get the feeling these has-beens at the Humming Bird will pay Miss Ruby any due. They're stuck, but at least they're having a swell time.",
