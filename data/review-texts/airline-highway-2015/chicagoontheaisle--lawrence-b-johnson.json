  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Airline Highway is a sort of extended existential moment, a cross-section of life’s seamy side, an empathic montage of candid snapshots...I liked these well-drawn characters — all of them brought to multifaceted life by a skilled cast under the direction of Joe Mantello — better than I liked this often implausible and seemingly unfinished play. Imagine Jean-Paul Sartre’s “No Exit” without the despair: That’s the drama at hand.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Critic praises the performances and characters but finds the play itself 'implausible and seemingly unfinished.' Single excerpt warning applies - this balanced assessment suggests mixed reception without clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The review praises the characters and cast but criticizes the play as 'often implausible and seemingly unfinished.' The mixed sentiment suggests a lack of strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the characters and cast but criticizes the play itself as implausible and unfinished, resulting in a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and truncated nature of the text lower the confidence. | Kimi: The critic praises the performances and direction but explicitly states the play itself is 'implausible' and 'unfinished,' indicating significant reservations without a clear recommendation to see it.",
