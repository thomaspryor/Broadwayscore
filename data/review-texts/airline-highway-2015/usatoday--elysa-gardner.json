  "bwwExcerpt": "D'Amour does not burden her characters with pity, any more than the elderly burlesque queen who is their matriarch does. To Miss Ruby, made ravaged and regal by the great Judith Roberts, all are 'little duckies'...The playwright clearly shares Miss Ruby's compassion for her flock, and her respect for each member's individual dignity...directed with enormous warmth and wit by Joe Mantello, all are drawn with both haunting specificity and an utter lack of sentimentality...Julie White...makes Tanya painfully raw. Her vanity-free performance lets us see the worn, fragile creature lurking behind her forced glamour and genuine kindness...You may not want to join this family, but you will love and honor its members",
