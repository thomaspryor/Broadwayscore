  "bwwExcerpt": "Life spurts out all over the place in the first two thirds of Lisa D'Amour's Airline Highway...Although the characters are familiar in many ways, director Joe Mantello and his accomplished cast of 16 breathe spirit into most of them, and the big, boozy party scene has jazzy vigor. (Freeman and White are standouts.) But D'Amour's dialogue is short on the kind of poetry that might elevate her gallery of beautiful-loser types, and she can't sustain the wide focus she initiates; Airline Highway's multiple plot threads are pulled out (or forgotten) in a rushed, unsatisfying denouement that resorts to summarizing its message to the audience in the form of a (literal) high-school class presentation.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating clearly places this in Mixed territory. 'Messy, sprawling' are criticisms, but 'authentic detail and genuine compassion' show appreciation for the work's qualities. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review, and the text describes the play as 'messy' and 'sprawling' but acknowledges its 'authentic detail' and 'genuine compassion', indicating both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review uses the word 'messy' which indicates a mixed reaction. The critic's rating of 60 also supports a mixed classification. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 60 places this firmly in the Mixed bucket, reflecting the review's balanced assessment that acknowledges structural messiness ('sprawling') while praising the production's authentic detail and genuine compassion.",
