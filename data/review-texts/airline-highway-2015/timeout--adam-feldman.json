    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating clearly places this in Mixed territory. 'Messy, sprawling' are criticisms, but 'authentic detail and genuine compassion' show appreciation for the work's qualities. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review, and the text describes the play as 'messy' and 'sprawling' but acknowledges its 'authentic detail' and 'genuine compassion', indicating both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review uses the word 'messy' which indicates a mixed reaction. The critic's rating of 60 also supports a mixed classification. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 60 places this firmly in the Mixed bucket, reflecting the review's balanced assessment that acknowledges structural messiness ('sprawling') while praising the production's authentic detail and genuine compassion.",
