    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60/100 rating directly indicates Mixed territory. 'Messy, sprawling' suggests structural flaws, but 'beautiful chaos,' 'authentic detail' and 'genuine compassion' show appreciation for the work's qualities. | GPT-4o: The review describes the play as 'messy' and 'sprawling', suggesting a lack of coherence, but also praises its 'authentic detail' and 'genuine compassion'. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review uses the word 'messy' but also praises the play's authenticity and compassion, suggesting a mixed reaction. The original rating of 60 aligns with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 60 falls squarely in the Mixed range (55-69). While the review praises the play's compassion and authentic detail, describing it as 'messy' and 'sprawling' suggests structural issues that prevent a full recommendation.",
