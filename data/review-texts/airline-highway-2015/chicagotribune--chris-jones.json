  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A romantic treatment of the town's colorful loners and outliers and the spontaneous families that spring up among those let down by real relatives. A frequently poetic piece of writing and a fine match for an ensemble-oriented group of distinguished actors who imbue these characters with spunk, spirit and vulnerability.

Positive overall but qualified. | GPT-4o: The review praises the writing and performances, indicating a positive view, but notes a lack of edge and grit, suggesting some reservations. The text is an excerpt, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is mostly positive, praising the writing and actors, but notes a potential Disney-fication, indicating reservations. The overall tone suggests a recommendation with caveats. | Kimi: The reviewer praises the poetic writing and distinguished performances as 'so very good,' but criticizes the show for verging on 'Disney-fication' and lacking grit, indicating a positive but qualified recommendation.",
