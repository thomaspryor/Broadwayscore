    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows appreciation for the ensemble work and collaborative nature, but lacks strong superlatives or clear overall verdict. Low confidence due to truncated text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights effective collaboration among performers and a unique composition style, suggesting a positive view. However, the lack of a full review and single excerpt warning necessitates a cautious approach, placing it at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the performers working effectively together, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low, and the score is placed at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers specific praise for the effective ensemble work and collective composition ('work together so effectively'), indicating a clearly positive assessment. Score placed at the upper end of the Positive bucket per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, with low confidence due to limited context.",
