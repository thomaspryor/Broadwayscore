  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Airline Highway is strongly reminiscent of Lanford Wilson's The Hot l Baltimore and to his Balm in Gilead for its look at a community of losers. It's a good addition to the genre, though. New Orleans native D'Amour has a great sense for these people, and Joe Mantello has assembled a superb and mostly Chicago-based cast to bring them to life. \"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise ('good addition to the genre') and praises cast/director, but the comparative framing and 'though' suggest reservations. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a 'good addition to the genre' with a 'superb' cast, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review states that it is a 'good addition to the genre' and praises the cast and the playwright's sense for the characters. While it draws comparisons to other works, the overall tone is positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for both the playwright's character work ('great sense') and the casting ('superb'), calling it a 'good addition' to the genre. As a single curated quote with positive indicators, it scores in the upper Positive range per instructions, though confidence is low given the limited context.",
