'Not a bad lesson' is faint praise, suggesting neutral-to-slightly-positive mixed review. | GPT-4o: The review mentions both positive and negative aspects, describing the show as 'alternately stagnant and rousing' and critiquing its focus on a 'Big Lesson'. However, it acknowledges 'deeply compassionate performances', indicating a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review is mixed, noting both stagnant and rousing moments. It praises the performances and direction but criticizes the focus on teaching a lesson rather than developing characters. | Kimi: While the critic criticizes the book as didactic and characters as underdeveloped, the final assessment praises the direction and performances as deeply compassionate, providing 'ample reason to care.' Single excerpt limits confidence.",
