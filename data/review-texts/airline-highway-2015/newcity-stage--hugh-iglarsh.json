    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative assessment calling the show 'less than the sum of its parts' and 'a dead end' with no emotional impact. Single excerpt limits confidence but language is unambiguously critical. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a negative view, highlighting a lack of impact and emotional engagement. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review states the show has little resonance and is a dead end, indicating a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is medium. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers a clear negative verdict, describing the show as a 'dead end' with 'little post-curtain resonance' that fails to convey meaningful emotion. Given this is a single curated excerpt with no counterbalancing praise, it warrants a Negative classification, though confidence is reduced due to the limited context.",
