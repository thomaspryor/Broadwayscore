The directive to 'do yourself a favor' indicates a strong positive sentiment. | Gemini: The review uses phrases like \"incredible force\" and \"thrilling to watch\", and the final line is a strong recommendation to see the show. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains explicit recommendation ('Do yourself a favor: see') and strong praise for the ensemble ('incredible force', 'thrilling'), warranting upper Positive range despite limited context.",
