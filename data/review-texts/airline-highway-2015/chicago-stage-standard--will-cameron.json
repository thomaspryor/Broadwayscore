  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"There are moments when the many themes within the play are voiced strongly, clearly, and empathetically. But the rest of the point is muddled in the mass of ensemble on stage holding six conversations at once. It’s just that none of these conversations are very distinct. What is the play trying to say? Visually engrossing, but the true capacity for connection gets lost somewhere. You feel like a wallflower at a party where everyone thinks you’ve sold out.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Review acknowledges some strong moments and visual appeal but criticizes muddled themes, indistinct conversations, and lost connection. The 'wallflower' metaphor suggests alienation from the experience. Single excerpt warning applies - confidence is low as this could be part of a more positive or negative overall assessment. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges strong moments but criticizes the overall clarity and connection of the play. The excerpt suggests a mix of positive and negative elements, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review notes strong moments but overall finds the play muddled and indistinct, leading to a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production's visual elements and occasional strong thematic moments, but ultimately describes a confused, overwhelming experience where the narrative gets lost and the audience feels alienated. With only one curated excerpt available, the overall verdict remains unclear, but the tone suggests significant reservations outweighing the positives.",
