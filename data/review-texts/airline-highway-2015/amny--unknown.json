  "bwwExcerpt": "'Airline Highway' presents a lively, detailed portrait of a lower class community in the South. But nice as it is to have a wide assortment of colorful characters, the focus too often drifts away from the central players of the plot. It ends with many of the conflicts unresolved. It's no surprise that this production was previously seen at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre Company, which is renowned for its emphasis on ensemble acting. As directed by Joe Mantello ('Wicked'), the cast delivers detailed, sympathetic performances.",

The praise for the ensemble acting and direction is tempered by the lack of resolution, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers praise for the lively atmosphere and detailed ensemble performances but levels significant criticism at the unfocused plotting and unresolved conflicts, indicating a middle-ground verdict rather than a clear recommendation.",
