The puzzling amount of mixed messages coming across in \"Airline Highway\" are as fuzzy and aimless as the lives of the meandering characters that inhibit this play.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Critic acknowledges 'great work happening on stage' but finds the play fundamentally confusing and purposeless. Single excerpt warning applies - this suggests neither clear recommendation nor discouragement. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights confusion and lack of clarity in the play's message, suggesting a negative view. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review expresses confusion about the play's purpose and describes it as muddled and aimless. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt acknowledges 'great work' on stage and calls the show 'alluring,' but fundamentally criticizes the play as muddled, aimless, and lacking clear purpose. Without the full review, this reads as a qualified dismissal rather than a clear recommendation or pan. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",
