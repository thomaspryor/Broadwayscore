  "fullText": "Julie White, left, and Carolyn Braver in \"Airline Highway.\" (©2014 Joan Marcus) \"Airline Highway\" looks very good on paper.\n\nLisa D'Amour, the author, was a Pulitzer Prize finalist a couple years back for \"Detroit.\" Joe Mantello, the director, is a two-time Tony Award winner who toggles between plays and musicals. Julie White, who heads the ensemble cast, is a Tony winner who makes every performance exciting.\n\nYet with all that potential, \"Highway\" is a road to nowhere that's potholed with contrived storytelling and characters from Central Casting.\n\nThe only part of this long, meandering byway you'll want to use is the exit ramp.\n\nBlame two companies: Manhattan Theatre Club and Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre, where the show ran earlier this year.\n\nYes, \"Airline Highway\" is a nod to affectionate and human group portraits of everyday lives, such as Lanford Wilson's \"The Hot l Baltimore,\" but D'Amour's tale of modern-day, down-and-out New Orleans is missing a clear point and satisfying takeaway.\n\nIn the parking lot of the Hummingbird Motel, a motley array assembles to celebrate terminally ill Miss Ruby (Judith Roberts), a burlesque queen, with a classic Big Easy funeral before she's dead. The celebrants are fringe players barely holding on: Tanya (White) is a hooker with a pill problem and maternal regrets; Krista (Caroline Neff), a stripper with an abusive past; Sissy Na Na (K. Todd Freeman), a sassy drag queen; and Francis (Ken Marks), an armchair poet who's stuck in the 1970s.\n\nOnly the fine cast saves the play from being a complete waste of time.\n\nInto this mass of humanity walks Bait Boy (Joe Tippett), who had a six-year thing with Krista before getting out of the swamp and taking up with a well-off older woman in Atlanta. To show off his new life, he's brought his gal pal's daughter Zoe (Carolyn Braver), a high schooler doing a report on \"subcultures.\" It's as forced as it sounds. The minute she starts compiling her interviews and taking her photos, \"Highway\" goes off the road.\n\nD'Amour's idea is that everyone deserves being noticed and to have his or her story told. But a very dull road trip on \"Airline Highway\" is not the way to do it.",
