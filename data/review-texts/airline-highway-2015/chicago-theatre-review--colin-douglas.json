    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for direction ('genius and sensitivity') and performances ('extraordinary actors'), with positive thematic assessment. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but language is clearly positive without reservations. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the staging and performances, using words like 'genius', 'sensitivity', and 'extraordinary'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"genius\", \"sensitivity\", and \"extraordinary actors\", suggesting a positive review. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers effusive praise for the staging ('genius') and performances ('extraordinary'), describing the production as a 'celebration.' Following guidance for clearly positive single excerpts, scored at upper end of Positive bucket (80-84) due to cherry-picking risk.",
