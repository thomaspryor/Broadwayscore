The single excerpt and lack of a full verdict lower confidence. | Gemini: The review starts with praise for the playwright but then pivots to a negative assessment of the current production, indicating it lacks something despite a good cast and production. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the dynamic staging and capable cast but criticizes the play itself as 'rambling' and incomplete ('lack...'), indicating significant reservations about the material despite strong production values. Single truncated excerpt limits confidence.",
