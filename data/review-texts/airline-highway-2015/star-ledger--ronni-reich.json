  "bwwExcerpt": "In Lisa D'Amour's 'Airline Highway,' named for the home to the motel, a group of misfits take care of each other and hold one another back from the vices that tempt them. Each is something like an open wound, with harrowing pasts that have repercussions they can't seem to shake. If its characters can feel familiar, D'Amour's writing unsparingly, unabashedly gets at fundamental aspects of the human condition. There are patches of the drama that drag when everyone talks over one another. But this feels realistic and uncovers something about each character's desire to connect -- however scarred they may be -- over bonds they've formed and broken in the past. Director Joe Mantello creates a detailed world, with nuanced performances from an ensemble cast...",
