  "bwwExcerpt": "It makes sense to maintain what worked on film, but unlike the Broadway adaptation of 'Once,' the musical version doesn't ultimately transcend the movie. The score by Stephen Flaherty (music) and Lynn Ahrens (lyrics), the Tony-winning 'Ragtime' team, doesn't help that much. Songs are efficient, not memorable, as they channel contemporary pop, feelings-on-sleeve ballads and soulful and bouncy R&B. New numbers are complemented by the iconic 'Eye of the Tiger,' which loses something moving from film to stage.",
