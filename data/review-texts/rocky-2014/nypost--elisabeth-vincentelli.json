  "bwwExcerpt": "Something electric happens at the end of 'Rocky' that gets theatergoers on their feet and writers scuttling for exclamation points: A boxing ring descends from the rafters, then glides into the orchestra! There's hooks, punches and blood?-?and a Jumbotron! And then: 'Adriaaaaaaaan!' Director Alex Timbers ('Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson') earns his keep right there. If you could win a Tony based on just 20 minutes, 'Rocky' would be a shoo-in. Problem is, that finale is preceded by an hour and a half of less thrilling moments...As the Italian Stallion, Karl follows the Stallone model?-?a big galoot with a heart of gold?-?but he makes it his own. He has a cool-cat ease and a warm, evocative singing voice. We believe in this irrepressible Rocky and his glass-half-full philosophy...He's well matched with Archie's cocky Apollo and Margo Seibert's Adrian, even though she isn't as pathetically lonely as the movie's semi-recluse.",
