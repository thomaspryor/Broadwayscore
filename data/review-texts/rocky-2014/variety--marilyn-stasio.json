The phrase 'never gets off the mat' suggests a complete lack of impact or success, placing it firmly in the Pan bucket. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the show \"never gets off the mat\" despite the talent involved, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging the strength of the cast and creative team, the critic uses a boxing metaphor to deliver a definitive negative verdict, indicating the production completely fails to succeed.",
