  "bwwExcerpt": "With persuasive stage realism, the men take turns pounding one another bloody. But there's little sense of the actual drama of a long, close boxing match, with its ebb and flow, strategy and tactics and the fighters' desperate will to win.Though losing a split decision, Rocky achieves his goal of going the distance. It's a triumph that, theatrically speaking, is pretty hollow.",
