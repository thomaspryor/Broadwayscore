The phrase \"punches above its weight class\" suggests that the show exceeds expectations. | Kimi: The review offers solid praise for the show's emotional impact and successful adaptation from film to stage, using phrases like 'punches above its weight class' and 'emotionally satisfying' to indicate a clear recommendation without reaching ecstatic rave territory.",
