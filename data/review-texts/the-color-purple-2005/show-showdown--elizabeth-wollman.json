  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A deeply moving novel, 'The Color Purple' is a lot hokier and less convincing on the stage. Stripped from its literary moorings, the plot comes off as just as sad, but also more farfetched, which doesn't always work. Also, the score isn't bad, but it didn't much stick with me or compel me to take a deeper listen, either. Still, the cast is strong and the direction swift and engaging. And despite the moments that don't land quite right, I still teared up a bunch, and chuckled a bunch too.\"\n\nRead more",
