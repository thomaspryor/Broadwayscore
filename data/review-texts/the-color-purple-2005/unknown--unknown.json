Despite being a single excerpt, the consistent superlatives indicate a strong rave review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as 'glory to behold', 'beauty', and 'miracle on Broadway', indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a rave review. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"glory to behold\", \"deep wealth of power\", and \"miracle on Broadway\", indicating a positive review. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs superlatives like 'glory,' 'genius,' and 'miracle,' indicating strong enthusiasm for the production. As a single curated excerpt, the score is capped at the upper end of the Positive range per scoring guidelines. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
