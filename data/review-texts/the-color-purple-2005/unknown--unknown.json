  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'The Color Purple' has been born again, and its conversion is a glory to behold…The current version is a slim, fleet-footed beauty...There’s a deep wealth of power within its restraint…It takes hard work, ruthless editing and a spark of genius to make a miracle on Broadway. That’s certainly true of this 'Color Purple'...Celie may have started off cowed, but we’ve always sensed that there’s a rare spirit inside. That about sums up Mr. Doyle’s relationship, too, to this vitally reincarnated musical.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Uses rave language throughout: 'glory to behold,' 'miracle on Broadway,' 'vitally reincarnated.' Despite being a single excerpt, the superlatives and 'miracle' language clearly indicate a rave review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly positive language such as 'glory to behold', 'slim, fleet-footed beauty', and 'spark of genius', indicating a strong recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language such as \"glory to behold\" and \"fleet-footed beauty\", indicating a strong positive review. Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains highly enthusiastic praise ('glory to behold,' 'miracle on Broadway,' 'spark of genius'), indicating a strong recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence that this represents the full review's verdict. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
