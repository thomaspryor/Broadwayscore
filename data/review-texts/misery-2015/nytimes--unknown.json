The production that opened on Sunday night at the Broadhurst Theater, which stars a vacant Bruce Willis (in his Broadway debut) and a hardworking Laurie Metcalf, sustains a steady, drowsy room temperature throughout.\n\nNever mind that we start off in darkest, deepest winter in an isolated gothic farmhouse as thunder cracks and lighting flashes. You’re more likely to experience chills sitting in a tepid bath at home.\n\nThis lack of shivers may not bother theatergoers who have bought their tickets simply to see an action hero of the screen in the flesh. Portraying Paul Sheldon, a best-selling novelist who finds himself held captive by a deranged fan who wields a mean mallet, Mr. Willis behaves in much the same way as he does as the indestructible Detective McClane while being tortured, shot at and nearly blown to oblivion in the “Die Hard” film series, for which he is best known.\n\nThat is, he’s a wisecracking, sleepily charming stoic who occasionally flinches or roars when he is subjected to severe pain, but never, ever lets us see that he might be afraid. Even when he’s strapped to a bed, with both his legs broken while the psychopath, played by Ms. Metcalf, hovers over him with a hypodermic needle, we do not doubt that good old John McClane — I mean Paul Sheldon — will prevail.\n\nThe sense of security that such confidence inspires perhaps is not the best foundation for a show meant to be if not outright scary, then at least suspenseful. Mr. King’s original 1987 novel, which I read for the first time only recently, had me on edge for days after I’d finished it. And I knew what was coming, having seen (and leapt out of my seat during) Rob Reiner’s 1990 film, which starred Kathy Bates in an Oscar-winning turn as Annie Wilkes, the role assumed here by Ms. Metcalf.\n\nThe movie was a pretty good fright flick; the novel is something else — an airless, claustrophobic portrait of an egotistic writer pushed to the edge of madness by pain, pills, incarceration, the expectations of his reading public and a deadline like he’s never known before. In the book, our hero is as threatened by the demons within as he is by the madwoman beside his bed. Like him, you the reader can’t wait to escape; yet you can no more walk away from Mr. King’s tightly spun yarn than Paul can walk away from his captor.\n\n“Misery” runs through Feb. 14 at the Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, Manhattan; 212-239-6200, miserybroadway­.com. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt suggests the production feels distant and nostalgic rather than genuinely thrilling, with atmospherics described as 'gentle' rather than intense. However, with only one curated excerpt available, the full verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a playful, nostalgic take on the source material rather than a compelling theatrical experience. The tone is more reflective and amused rather than strongly positive or negative, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review describes the play as having a nostalgic distance from the source material, suggesting it's more of a gentle reminder than a truly thrilling experience. This indicates a mixed reaction, neither strongly recommending nor discouraging. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the production as relying on nostalgic affection for the source material rather than delivering its own thrills, with 'gentle, teasing' atmosphere replacing genuine tension. Without the full review context, this suggests a mixed reception that acknowledges the show's appeal to fans but notes its lack of dramatic urgency.",
