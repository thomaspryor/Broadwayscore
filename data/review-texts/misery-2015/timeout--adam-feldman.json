  "bwwExcerpt": "Willis's weirdly narcotized and passive Broadway debut goes above and beyond the drugged, physically diminished circumstances of his character. On a meta level, Misery is about Willis playing film star Willis being terrorized by Metcalf's superior acting talent. For any poor soul who shells outs $165 a ticket rather than, say, streams the flick while enjoying a nice cup of cocoa, there's partial compensation: a majestically loony turn by Metcalf as the deranged 'number-one fan' of Sheldon's Gothic romance series. Filling the vacuum left by a deadpanning Willis, Metcalf hoots, purrs, howls and tears around her kitsch-filled Colorado home, where Sheldon is imprisoned and forced to write her favorite character back to life.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. Review balances praise for Willis's nuance and Metcalf's excellence against criticism of Willis's inexperience. | GPT-4o: The original rating of 60 suggests a mixed review. The critic acknowledges strengths in performances but notes Willis's inexperience, indicating a balanced view. | Gemini: The review praises Metcalf's performance but notes Willis's inexperience. The critic's own rating is 60, which falls into the mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 60 indicates a mixed reception, and the extremely brief text offers only qualified praise for individual performances without a clear overall verdict on the production.",
