  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"William Goldman’s adaptation is too literal. The movie depended on close ups, of which there are none in the theater. And sadly no one has told Bruce Willis what to do. The direction by Will Frears is less than what I expected. He lets Willis just sit there, or lie there, on stage, like a flounder...Of course, part of the problem is the play itself. As a movie 'Misery' had its campy moments, and you could get away with them. As a play, 'Misery' just seems ridiculous, over the top, and in the end, pointless.\"\n\nRead more",
