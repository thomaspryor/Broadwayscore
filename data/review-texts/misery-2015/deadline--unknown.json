  "bwwExcerpt": "Annie, get your gun! How much more do you want to know about Misery, which hobbled to its opening Sunday night on Broadway? William Goldman wrote the script, as he did the screenplay for Rob Reiner's 1990 Castle Rock film based on Stephen King's novel. Bruce Willis is meh as super successful schlock writer Paul Sheldon... If you can put aside the fact that the show offers about five seconds of actual, thriller-type suspense during its 90 intermissionless minutes, you can see glimpses of a younger and extremely likable Willis in Misery.",
