  "bwwExcerpt": "Well-adapted by William Goldman, the horror-tinged thriller 'Misery' is popcorn theater - it's a carnival ride that piles on the twists and thrills, complete with ominous thunder and lighting during particularly tense moments. It's genre theater that's gotten rare on Broadway, which is too bad: The show is shameless, and that's what makes it so fun.",
