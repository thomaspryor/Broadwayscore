  "bwwExcerpt": "You can't help but feel for Bruce Willis, now making his Broadway debut in Misery (**1/2 out of four stars), a new adaptation of the Stephen King novel. ... But Misery isn't really Paul's play, any more than the 1990 screen version -- penned by William Goldman, who also wrote this play -- was his movie. You may remember that James Caan played Paul in that film, but he was vastly overshadowed by Kathy Bates as Annie Wilkes, the obsessive fan who retrieves the injured writer from the site of the crash. Annie brings Paul to her farmhouse -- conveniently close to the hotel in Silver Creek, Colorado where he has just finished his latest work -- and holds him captive, through a combination of psychological torture and physical violence.",

The contrast between individual praise and overall shortcoming places this in mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges a solid performance by Bruce Willis but notes the production falls short of the source material's terror, indicating a mixed assessment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a solid debut but notes the production doesn't fully achieve the terror of the source material, indicating a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers a qualified recommendation, praising Willis's performance as 'solid' while noting the production falls short of the source material's terror. The brevity suggests this is an excerpt. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
