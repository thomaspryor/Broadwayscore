    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Praises Willis's performance as 'solid' but immediately qualifies with 'though the production doesn't quite achieve' its goals. The contrast between individual praise and overall shortcoming places this in mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges a solid performance by Bruce Willis but notes the production falls short of the source material's terror, indicating a mixed assessment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a solid debut but notes the production doesn't fully achieve the terror of the source material, indicating a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers a qualified recommendation, praising Willis's performance as 'solid' while noting the production falls short of the source material's terror. The brevity suggests this is an excerpt. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
