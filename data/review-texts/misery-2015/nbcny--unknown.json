  "bwwExcerpt": "Watching Broadway's 'Misery' is like playing a 33 LP set to 45. It's Stephen King by way of the Chipmunks, and with as much gravitas. (The set, which I loved, is a turntable, by David Korins, of 'Hamilton'-it spins to reveal the bedroom where Annie imprisons Paul, and the kitchen, where Paul and Annie have a dinner that is a high point of this staging.) Don't blink, or you'll miss a lot... The thrilling cinematic climax, a protracted battle to the death, here is reduced to one good whack Paul gives Annie with his used typewriter, the one missing an 'N' key, and a few seconds of neck-throttling. Die-HARD? Die-easy is more like it.",
