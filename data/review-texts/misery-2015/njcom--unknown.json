  "bwwExcerpt": "In the New Jersey-reared actor's Broadway debut in 'Misery,' Willis delivers an underpowered, half-interested performance - all the more puzzling considering that he's playing a character being tormented by a psychopath. That 'Misery' succeeds is a testament to the ingenuity of King's original material, the deftness of director Will Frears' staging, and especially the roller-coaster force of Willis' co-star Laurie Metcalf (from TV's 'Roseanne'), who (almost) makes you forget the iconic stamp Kathy Bates put on the same part in the film version. Despite Willis' flat performance, 'Misery' turns out to be something Broadway hasn't seen in years: an old-fashioned chiller from the Ira Levin/'Deathtrap' school, where the gasps and the giggles are deliciously jumbled together.",
