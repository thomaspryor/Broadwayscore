  "bwwExcerpt": "The eek! factor is largely missing from 'Misery,' starring a laid-back Bruce Willis as the bed-bound author held hostage by his 'greatest fan,' played here by Laurie Metcalfe. Despite the physical intimacy imposed by its stage setting, William Goldman's theatrical version of the 1987 Stephen King novel lacks the stifling sense of claustrophobia that made Rob Reiner's 1990 movie version starring Kathy Bates and James Caan so unnerving. Or maybe the atmosphere of fear and dread was just wiped out by the show's undercurrents of arch humor.",

The description of the adaptation as 'effectively creepy' further supports a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic identifies Metcalf as the highlight and calls the production 'effectively creepy,' indicating a solid recommendation despite brief length.
