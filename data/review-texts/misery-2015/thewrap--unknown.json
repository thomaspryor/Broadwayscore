  "bwwExcerpt": "Watching Bruce Willis move around in his wheelchair in 'Misery,' which opened Sunday at the Broadhurst Theatre, is like watching 'Rope,' a film made in very long takes with next to no editing... Shouldn't there be cuts to Metcalf in a car as she races home to inflict further pain on her idol, a best-selling novelist? Of course, there are no cuts. It's a play! And that's just one of the major problems with William Goldman's stage adaptation of Stephen King's 1987 best-seller, which became a successful 1990 movie scripted by Goldman. Korins's turntable set keeps spinning around and around as Willis and Metcalf play crazy cat and injured mouse, but there's no suspense.",
