  "bwwExcerpt": "That changed dynamic is the other factor in the play's new spin. When I first saw it, the relative hush of the house seemed to favor Alex's arc, which was, at least superficially, more serious and perhaps more relatable: After resisting Georgie as a flake, and even after understanding that her motives in romancing him might be impure, he takes a flier with her in the hope that, sane or not, she can distract him from his profound loneliness. (His only confidant is a long-dead sister, who visits him in dreams.) But in that reading, Alex's influence on Georgie is imperceptible if not beside the point. Near the end, when she describes him as looking 'full of wonder,' you understand that his insistence on the primacy of observable fact over imputed concepts like mood or even personality have barely rubbed off on her. 'It's probably just my retinas,' he says. There is no such thing as 'wonder,' only dead cells floating in vitreous humor.",
