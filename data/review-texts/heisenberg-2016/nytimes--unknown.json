    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('vibrant and emotionally charged', 'thwarts expectations') despite initial skepticism. Single excerpt warning means this could be cherry-picked, but the praise is substantive enough to warrant upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production for being 'vibrant and emotionally charged' and highlights the creative team's ability to 'thwart expectations.' Despite initial reservations, the critic's tone is enthusiastic, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong praise such as \"sexiest couple,\" \"vibrant and emotionally charged,\" and \"thwarts expectations.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring it as positive with high confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's emotional charge, subtle writing, and creative direction, though the single-excerpt format warrants caution about whether the full review contains caveats.",
