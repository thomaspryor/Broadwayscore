  "bwwExcerpt": "Arndt is as amiable and dull while Parker is hyper and unhinged. He needs her eccentricity to reinvigorate his moribund life, if not his heartbeat. Alex says he likes being a butcher because animals have great \"seams.\" He also exhibits an extraordinarily eclectic interest in music. This guy listens to CDs the way some kids used to collect baseball cards. While Alex doesn't deserve Georgie's verbal abuse, you do wonder how she stays awake trying to make conversation with him.",
