  "bwwExcerpt": "For Mary-Louise Parker die-hards, \"Heisenberg\" won't disappoint. As the endearing, annoying, unknowable Georgie, half of a May-December odd couple brought together by an unexpected kiss, the ex-\"Weeds\" dope dealer looms very large. So much so there's just enough oxygen left for Denis Arndt as Alex, the generous and gentle seventysomething object of Georgie's affection.",
