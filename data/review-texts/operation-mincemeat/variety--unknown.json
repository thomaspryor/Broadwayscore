  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Think of it as Monty Python on speed, and then throw in some Ealing Studio wit and a bit of \"Beyond the Fringe\" slyness. Too British? Not if you want to laugh uproariously - and perhaps even unexpectedly shed a tear or two...The five performers take on an endless stream of characters, but each is assigned a principle character that solidly ground the tale...The second act becomes almost too much of a good thing, overstuffed with strange-but-true subplots, incidental characters and plenty of switcheroos. But by the end it all comes together as it builds for its glitzy finale, appropriately titled A Glitzy Finale.",
