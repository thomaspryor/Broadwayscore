  "fullText": "The new musical “Back to the Future” is certainly a blast from the past, with Bob Gale penning a book that sticks closely to his original 1985 screenplay written with Robert Zemeckis. Those familiar with the film will once again enjoy the adventures of Marty McFly (an energetic Casey Likes), and his zany, eccentric friend Doc Brown (a loveable Roger Bart), and be further entertained with the addition of several production numbers created with music and lyrics by Alan Silvestri and Glen Ballard. Of course, the main challenge involved in adapting this particular film for the stage is the vehicle and the technology used for the important aspect of time travel. In this production sound designer Gareth Owen, lighting designer Tim Lutkin and Hugh Vanstone, along with video designer Finn Ross assures that the audience goes along for the ride. If these elements are not enough to transport you “Back to the Future”, the creative illusions of Chris Fisher will certainly complete the task. Those not familiar with the story will be introduced to Doc Brown who invents a time travel machine using a DeLorean automobile powered by some plutonium stolen from terrorists. He fails at his first attempt to travel back in time, when his cohort Marty McFly accidently takes his place, trying to escape the angry pursuit of the terrorists. In doing this, he becomes stranded in the 1950’s, where he meets his parents who are teenagers in high school, as well as many other familiar faces from his hometown. After locating a then young Doc Brown, in his search to find a way “Back to the Future”, he faces the obstacle of interacting incorrectly with familiar characters, with the consequences of changing the future. All ends well as he is able to return but not without unintentionally changing things for the better. The cast of characters are easily recognizable since their appearance strongly resembles the cast of the original film, all due to the wigs, hair and makeup work of Campbell Young Associates, and the spot-on costumes of Tim Hatley. Mr. Likes provides an energetic and concerned Marty McFly but lacks some emotional dimension in his relationship with Doc. Hugh Coles embodies a pliable, gullible, and awkward George with grace, which provides the perfect underdog. Linda Hunt creates an enthusiastic, impressionable, and aggressive Lorraine Baines with a mild, wild side and Nathaniel Hackman infuses the ultimate bully into Biff Tannen. Then there is the incredible Roger Bart who delivers a remarkable performance as he portrays the lovable, zany, and scattered Doc Brown. The entire cast is vocally competent but never manages to transcend the forgettable and unremarkable music and lyrics of Mr. Silvestri and Mr. Ballard. Director John Rando moves the action along at a quick pace and maneuvers the inventive scenic design by Mr. Hatley with ease. Choreography by Chris Bailey hits its stride and is most enjoyable when executed in scenes from the 1950’s. One thing every actor should learn from this production is to never share the stage with a flying DeLorean, which at times manages to steal the spotlight and become the star of the show. This spectacular special effect created by Twin FX is well worth the price of a ticket. Once again what this newest addition to the Great White Way provides is a wonderful two and a half hours of pure, fun-filled entertainment. Fans of the movie may miss the tension of the plot and chemistry of the characters created in the film, but cannot deny that this production takes its audience along for the unforgettable ride “Back to the Future.” Yet another new production enters the current Broadway season boasting a well-known film and television star, a large movie screen, and several television screens that surround the proscenium to provide close-ups of the actor. It is an adaptation for stage, from a movie bearing the same name. The well-known star… Language and translation serve as powerful tropes for colonial ownership in Brian Friel’s “Translations” currently playing at Irish Repertory Company through Sunday.
