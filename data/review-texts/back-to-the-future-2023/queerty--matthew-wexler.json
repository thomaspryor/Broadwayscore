However, with only one excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the negative range. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for lacking essential elements of a successful musical, suggesting it fails to deliver a satisfying experience. The comparison to a previous production also implies a negative outcome. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the musical lacks key elements of a successful musical, indicating a negative assessment. The comparison to Rocky, another show at the same theater, further reinforces the negative sentiment.",
