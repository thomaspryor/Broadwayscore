    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic praises the combination of nostalgia and modern theatrical skill as 'winning,' and ends on a positive note about walking out with joy. However, they admit some numbers made them 'desperate for plutonium poisoning,' indicating significant reservations. Given this is a single excerpt that may not represent the full verdict, scored at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive experience overall, highlighting the show's charm and capability. However, the mention of 'desperate for my own little bout of plutonium poisoning' indicates some reservations. The single excerpt and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive experience overall, despite some reservations about certain numbers. The mention of 'winning combination' suggests a recommendation, but the caveat about plutonium poisoning implies it's not a rave. Given the single excerpt and potential for cherry-picking, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic calls the show a 'winning combination' and emphasizes leaving the theater with joy, even while joking that certain numbers were tedious enough to wish for 'plutonium poisoning.' The overall verdict favors seeing the show.",
