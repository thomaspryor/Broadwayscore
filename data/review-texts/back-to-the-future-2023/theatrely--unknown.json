When you take Tim Hatley's scenic design, and mix it with Finn Ross' video projection work and Tim Lutkin's lighting, there's no easier way to say it than it creates theatrical magic.",

However, the lack of a full review text and the absence of a clear final verdict lowers the confidence slightly. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the positive aspects of the production, specifically the scenic design, video projection, and lighting, describing it as \"theatrical magic.\" This suggests a positive overall experience, despite the limited context.",
