    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes it as a worthwhile 'theatrical experience' and 'nostalgic trip' which suggests positive recommendation, but the distinction between 'experience' vs 'production' implies some reservation. Low confidence due to single cherry-picked excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'theatrical experience' and 'nostalgic trip', which suggests some positive elements, but lacks strong recommendation language. The single excerpt warning and lack of clear positive or negative sentiment lead to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive experience, describing it as a \"nostalgic trip.\" However, due to the limited text available, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise calling it a 'nostalgic trip' and effective 'theatrical experience,' indicating a recommendation. Per the single-excerpt warning, scoring at the upper end of the Positive bucket due to the unambiguously favorable tone, though confidence is low given limited context.",
