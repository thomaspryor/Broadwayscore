    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic explicitly states it's 'not a good musical' while acknowledging it's entertaining and transporting. This direct contradiction places it in mixed territory, leaning toward the lower end due to the clear artistic reservation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that while the musical aspect may not be strong, the overall experience is enjoyable and transporting. This indicates a positive recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review states that it's not a good musical, but a good show, indicating a positive but qualified recommendation. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic offers a qualified recommendation, praising the immersive theatrical experience ('transporting,' 'traveling at 88mph') while explicitly stating the work fails as a musical. Given only one excerpt is available, this mildly positive verdict warrants the lower end of the Positive bucket.",
