    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: \"Serviceable if not particularly inspired\" suggests adequate but unremarkable quality. Single excerpt warning and damning with faint praise indicates mixed-to-lukewarm reception. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'serviceable' but 'not particularly inspired', indicating a middle-of-the-road experience. The reliance on nostalgia and spectacle suggests it may appeal to fans of the original film but lacks strong endorsement. | Gemini: The review uses the term \"serviceable\" which indicates a middle-of-the-road experience. The phrase \"not particularly inspired\" further reinforces a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic offers faint praise ('serviceable') while explicitly noting the production is 'not particularly inspired' and overly dependent on nostalgia, suggesting an average, unenthusiastic assessment rather than a clear recommendation.",
