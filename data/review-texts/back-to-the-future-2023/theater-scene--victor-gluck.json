  "showScoreExcerpt": "The new songs by Alan Silvestri (who wrote the famous background music for the original film trilogy) and Glen Ballard, his collaborator on the scores for Zemeckis’ \"The Polar Express\" and Disney’s live action version of \"Pinocchio,\" stop the show in its tracks as they do not forward the action but tells us what we already know in rather trite and repetitive fashion. The rhymes are simplistic rather than clever and several of the titles have been used before in earlier, more effective songs.\n\nRead more",

However, with only one negative excerpt available, the full review verdict remains uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the new songs for being trite, repetitive, and not advancing the story, which suggests a negative view of the production. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the negative impact of the songs, stating they stop the show and are trite and repetitive. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers specific criticism of the songs as repetitive and action-stalling, indicating a negative assessment of this key element, though the full review context is unavailable.",
