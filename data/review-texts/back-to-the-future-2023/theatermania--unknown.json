    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the visual/technical elements as 'eye-popping' and 'perfectly disorienting' in a positive way, but extremely limited text makes full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a 'perfectly disorienting sensory overload' with 'eye-popping illusions,' suggesting a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as a \"perfectly disorienting sensory overload\" and praises the illusions. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's illusions and sensory design using words like 'perfectly' and 'eye-popping,' indicating a clearly positive assessment of this element, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
