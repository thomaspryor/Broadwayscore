    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The phrase 'perfectly disorienting' and 'eye-popping illusions' suggests positive assessment of the production's visual elements, but with only one curated excerpt available, the overall verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the impressive visual aspects of the production, suggesting a positive experience. However, without more context, it's unclear if there are significant reservations, leading to a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights a positive aspect of the show (the illusions and sensory experience), suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt and lack of overall context, a score in the middle of the 'Positive' range is appropriate.",
