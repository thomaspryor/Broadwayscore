    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic calls the show 'vapid' and 'slavish,' criticizes the new songs as 'subpar,' and describes it as merely 'rehashing' the original. This is clearly negative assessment despite being only an excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'vapid' and a 'slavish tribute,' indicating a negative view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as a \"vapid, slavish tribute\" with \"subpar new songs\" and rehashing of the original screenplay, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous criticism, calling the production 'vapid' and 'subpar' with no redeeming qualities mentioned, indicating a clear recommendation against seeing the show.",
