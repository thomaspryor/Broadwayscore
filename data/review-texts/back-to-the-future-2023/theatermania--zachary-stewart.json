    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt praises one spectacular element (the car finale) but dismisses the overall musical as 'mostly wallows in the past.' This suggests mixed feelings - appreciation for innovation but criticism of the show's general approach. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the contrast between praise and criticism suggests genuinely mixed sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a single innovative element (the car) but suggests the rest of the musical is unremarkable, 'wallowing in the past'. The lack of a clear recommendation and the single excerpt warning suggest a mixed review. | Gemini: The review praises the car's finale as innovative but criticizes the rest of the musical for being stuck in the past, indicating a mixed assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the car's spectacular finale as the show's standout element but criticizes the musical itself for 'wallowing in the past,' indicating a divided verdict where technical innovation outshines dated, unoriginal material.",
