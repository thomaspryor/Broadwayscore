  "bwwExcerpt": "The show is lavish and, as directed by John Rando (Urinetown, Mr. Saturday Night), never slows down, at times coming off like something that might belong at Madison Square Garden. The whole thing is basically a big, flashy, speeding car, but it’s apt for today’s Broadway, since it combines a familiar title, a sampling of hit songs, and some slick special effects, while vaguely touching on the fantasy of changing eras in order to work things out and patch things up.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic uses positive descriptors like 'lavish' and 'slick special effects' while noting it 'never slows down', but describes it as formulaic ('big, flashy, speeding car') fitting 'today's Broadway' formula. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'lavish' and 'never slows down', suggesting a positive view of its energy and production values. However, the lack of a full review and the mention of it being like a 'big, flashy, speeding car' implies some reservations, leading to a mildly positive score. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"lavish\" and notes that it \"never slows down.\" While the comparison to Madison Square Garden might be a slight reservation, the overall tone suggests a positive, albeit somewhat qualified, recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production values and pacing, endorsing it as slick commercial entertainment apt for Broadway, though with a tone suggesting spectacle over depth. Given the single-excerpt limitation and mildly positive language, it scores in the lower Positive range.",
