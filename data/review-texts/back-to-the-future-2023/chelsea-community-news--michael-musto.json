  "bwwExcerpt": "The show is lavish and, as directed by John Rando (Urinetown, Mr. Saturday Night), never slows down, at times coming off like something that might belong at Madison Square Garden. The whole thing is basically a big, flashy, speeding car, but it’s apt for today’s Broadway, since it combines a familiar title, a sampling of hit songs, and some slick special effects, while vaguely touching on the fantasy of changing eras in order to work things out and patch things up.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show's entertainment value and production quality while suggesting it's commercial but well-executed. However, with only one excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'lavish' and 'never slows down,' suggesting an entertaining production. However, the mention of it being 'a big, flashy, speeding car' implies some reservations, leading to a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic score. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"lavish\" and \"flashy\" and \"apt for today's Broadway\", suggesting a positive, albeit somewhat qualified, recommendation. The aggregator context also indicates a positive reception.",
