However, given this is a single curated excerpt and the text cuts off mid-sentence, I'm scoring conservatively within the negative range. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly negative, citing issues with the roles, book, and score. The only positive mentioned is the spectacle, but it's framed as the only thing left due to the other failings.",
