    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Pan | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, the language is devastatingly negative: 'thankless roles,' 'hokey book,' 'abysmal score.' The critic systematically dismantles every element except spectacle. This reads as a clear pan, though confidence is low due to truncated text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is strongly negative, criticizing the book and score while noting the cast's roles as thankless. The focus on spectacle over substance suggests a poor overall impression. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly negative, describing the book as hokey, the score as abysmal, and the roles as thankless. This clearly indicates a pan. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers a harsh assessment of the book, score, and material while only praising the spectacle (the car) and the wasted talent of the cast, indicating a clear negative recommendation despite isolated bright spots.",
