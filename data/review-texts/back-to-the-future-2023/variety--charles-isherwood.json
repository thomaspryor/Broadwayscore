However, this is a very limited excerpt that may not capture the full verdict, warranting low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the show as a successful adaptation with impressive technical effects, but the lack of full context and potential reservations about its straightforwardness necessitate a cautious score. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation, highlighting the show's success as a 'cheerfully corny' adaptation. Confidence is low due to the truncated text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, highlighting that the production succeeds as crowd-pleasing entertainment with dazzling technical effects, though the conditional phrasing ('most successful when') suggests reservations about elements that stray from the simple adaptation approach.",
