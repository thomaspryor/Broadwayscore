  "fullText": "The creators of Back to the Future: The Musical weren't taking any chances.\n\nThe production, newly arrived on Broadway after a London engagement that snagged a 2022 Olivier Award for Best New Musical, begins with the stirring main theme of the 1985 film's score, garnering loud cheers from the audience. The book, with some minor exceptions, recreates the screenplay beat for beat and in some cases line for line. And the performances hew closely to those of the movie's lead actors, with Hugh Coles, playing Marty McFly's father George, imitating Crispin Glover so closely that it's hard to tell whether it's tribute or appropriation.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "It’s a terrifically fun and amusing story that works nearly as well onstage as it did on film, although the original songs, as is so often the case with these adaptations, mainly come across as superfluous. Not that they’re all that bad, mind you.",
