    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic acknowledges vocal competence but finds the music and lyrics 'forgettable and unremarkable,' indicating the show fails to achieve its artistic goals despite adequate performances. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the music and lyrics as 'forgettable and unremarkable,' suggesting a negative view of the production. The positive mention of the cast's vocal competence does not outweigh the negative assessment of the show's core elements. | Gemini: The review excerpt states that the cast is vocally competent but the music and lyrics are forgettable and unremarkable, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: The critic offers faint praise for the cast's vocal competence but strongly criticizes the music and lyrics as 'forgettable and unremarkable,' noting the performers cannot overcome the material's limitations. With only a single curated excerpt available, the overall verdict could range from mixed to negative, warranting low confidence.",
