    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic dismisses the show as 'less a musical' and compares it unfavorably to a theme park ride with excessive sensory overload. This is clearly negative assessment despite being a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, comparing the show to a theme park ride, implying lack of substance. However, with only one excerpt, the full context is unclear, leading to low confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt compares the musical unfavorably to a theme park ride, suggesting sensory overload and a lack of substance. Given the limited text, a negative score seems appropriate. | Kimi: The critic explicitly dismisses the show as a superficial theme park attraction rather than a legitimate musical, using 'sensory overload' as a pejorative to indicate the production prioritizes spectacle over substance.",
