It cruises along in a low gear for almost three hours.”",

The truncated text and aggregator context support this. | Kimi: While acknowledging lavish production values and effective staging of the DeLorean, the critic's verdict pivots on 'But' to condemn the show as failing to achieve liftoff, cruising in 'low gear' for three hours—a clear recommendation against seeing it.",
