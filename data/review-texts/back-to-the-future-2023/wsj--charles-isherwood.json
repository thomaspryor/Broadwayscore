  "showScoreExcerpt": "The musical has been staged in lavish style...And the DeLorean, with its glowing neon trim, has been glamorized effectively...But the musical as a whole never achieves liftoff, or even the stage equivalent of 88 miles an hour. It cruises along in a low gear for almost three hours.",
