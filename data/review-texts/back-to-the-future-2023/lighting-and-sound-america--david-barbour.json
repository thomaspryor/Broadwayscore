  "showScoreExcerpt": "“As theatrical vehicles go, it has a DeLorean body with an Edsel motor; it takes the audience on a fast, fun ride -- but be ready for some metal fatigue…To be sure, the special effects deliver big-time thrills, beginning with the DeLorean appearing out of nowhere -- Chris Fisher is the illusion designer -- and including the thrilling speed sequences paced by Finn Ross' double-layered projection design….It's the odd case of a so-so show put over by sheer determination and technique.” \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The review explicitly calls it a 'so-so show' while praising technical elements like special effects and projections. The DeLorean/Edsel metaphor suggests fun but flawed. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as having a 'DeLorean body with an Edsel motor,' indicating a mix of strengths and weaknesses. While special effects are praised, the overall show is described as 'so-so,' suggesting a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"so-so\" but praises the special effects and technical aspects, suggesting a positive but qualified recommendation. The single excerpt and \"read more\" truncation lowers confidence. | Kimi: While the critic calls the underlying material 'so-so' with an 'Edsel motor,' they emphasize the production delivers 'big-time thrills,' a 'fast, fun ride,' and spectacular technical effects that overcome the script's weaknesses—indicating a qualified but genuine recommendation to see the show. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
