  "bwwExcerpt": "'This place is lousy with ghosts, and the new ones are irritating,' says Robin Williams as the titular beast at the top of Act 2 in 'Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo,' Rajiv Joseph's weird and whacked-out, Pulitzer-nominated play. Unfortunately, that line describes the work itself, as well as the bizarre afterlife in which it is partially set. The fact that one of those annoying phantoms is played by a comic genius helps somewhat, but not enough.",
