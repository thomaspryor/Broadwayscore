  "bwwExcerpt": "'This place is lousy with ghosts, and the new ones are irritating,' says Robin Williams as the titular beast at the top of Act 2 in 'Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo,' Rajiv Joseph's weird and whacked-out, Pulitzer-nominated play. Unfortunately, that line describes the work itself, as well as the bizarre afterlife in which it is partially set. The fact that one of those annoying phantoms is played by a comic genius helps somewhat, but not enough.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic explicitly applies a negative character description ('lousy with ghosts') to the play itself, calling it 'weird and whacked-out' in a clearly pejorative way. While acknowledging Robin Williams as a 'comic genius,' the reviewer states this 'helps somewhat, but not enough' - classic performer praise that doesn't redeem an overall negative verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt describes the play as 'weird and whacked-out' and 'lousy with ghosts,' which suggests a negative tone. Although there is some praise for Robin Williams, it is not enough to redeem the overall negative impression. | Gemini: The critic uses a quote from the play to describe the play itself as \"lousy\" and \"irritating.\" This is a negative assessment, despite the mention of Robin Williams. | Kimi: The critic describes the play as 'irritating' and 'annoying,' finding that even Robin Williams's performance cannot redeem the 'weird and whacked-out' material.",
