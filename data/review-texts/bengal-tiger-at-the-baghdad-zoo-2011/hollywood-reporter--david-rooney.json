  "bwwExcerpt": "Williams has not given a performance this subdued in years. He commits to being part of an ensemble, never ramping up into a star turn. There's no comic shtick in his thoughtful Tiger, yet...the ripples of humor are rich and flavorful. This is not a predigested moral treatise that delivers bite-size conclusions, but a provocative and hauntingly surrealistic play from a distinctive voice.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises Williams' ensemble work and the play's provocative nature with distinctive voice. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the tone is clearly appreciative. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as 'provocative and hauntingly surrealistic' with 'rich and flavorful' humor, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review praises Williams' performance and describes the play as \"provocative and hauntingly surrealistic.\" While not a rave, it's a positive assessment, suggesting the play is worth seeing. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for both the lead performance ('subdued,' 'thoughtful') and the play itself ('provocative,' 'hauntingly surrealistic'), indicating a clear recommendation despite being a single curated excerpt.",
