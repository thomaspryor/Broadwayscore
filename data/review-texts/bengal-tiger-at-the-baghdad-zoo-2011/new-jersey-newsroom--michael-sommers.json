  "bwwExcerpt": "Depicting the philosophical tiger with grim humor, a gruff-voiced, soulful Williams submerges his bravura skills into the ensemble work of his fellow actors. Respectively playing the conflicted translator and increasingly cerebral Marine, Moayed and Fleischer unerringly chart their characters' evolutions. Titizian suavely portrays the amoral Uday's ghost - who totes his dead brother's head in a plastic bag - with a jaunty ferocity that's scary.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt consistently praises performances with detailed, appreciative language ('soulful', 'unerringly chart', 'suavely portrays'), but since it's only one curated excerpt about acting, I'm scoring in the upper Positive range while maintaining medium confidence due to incomplete text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and character development, indicating a positive view of the acting. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment might not be fully captured, leading to a lower confidence level. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on strong performances, indicating a positive, but not rave, review. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the acting using words like 'bravura', 'unerringly', and 'suavely', indicating a clearly positive assessment of the performances. However, as a single curated excerpt, the overall show verdict may differ.",
