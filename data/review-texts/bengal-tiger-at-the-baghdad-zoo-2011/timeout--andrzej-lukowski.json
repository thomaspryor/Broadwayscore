However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context necessitate a cautious approach, placing it at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the drama as a 'fine' and 'relevant' diagnosis, suggesting a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive tone warrants a score in the upper end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise, calling the show a 'fine drama' that has benefited from its delayed staging and finds it morally complex and relevant. However, confidence is low given this is a single curated excerpt that may not capture the full verdict.",
