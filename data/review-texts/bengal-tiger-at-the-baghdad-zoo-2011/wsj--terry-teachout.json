  "bwwExcerpt": "Mr. Williams's performance is equally predictable, but it's not his fault, for he's playing the tiger as written: The script calls for a superficial Hollywood-style performance, and he obliges, sounding not unlike Bruce Willis playing the wisecracking baby in 'Look Who's Talking.' It doesn't help that his one-liners aren't sharp enough, though Mr. Williams does his best to make them snap...'Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo' is still mediocre.",
