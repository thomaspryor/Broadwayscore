  "bwwExcerpt": "Rajiv Joseph's smart, savagely funny and visionary new work of American theater invites fanciful comparison to the titular beast. 'Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo,' for all the killing and suffering it contains, is buoyed by the vitality of its imaginative scope. Violence is not after all the only human activity that can have far-reaching, unforeseen effects, shaping lives far into the future. Mr. Joseph's richly conceived play reminds us that art can have a powerful afterlife too.",
