    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges the actors' quality but criticizes the material as 'stodgy' and suggests pacing issues. This indicates a negative assessment despite performer praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that while the actors are competent, the material is lacking, leading to a mixed impression. The single excerpt warning and lack of a clear recommendation contribute to a low confidence level. | Gemini: The review acknowledges good actors but criticizes the material as \"stodgy,\" suggesting a mixed experience. The single excerpt and truncated nature of the text lower the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the actors' abilities but explicitly criticizes the material as 'stodgy' and suggests pacing issues, indicating a mixed assessment where performance quality is undermined by weak writing. Single-excerpt caution applies.",
