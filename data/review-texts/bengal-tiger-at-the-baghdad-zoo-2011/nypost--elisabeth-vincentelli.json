  "bwwExcerpt": "Rajiv Joseph's 'Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo,' which opened last night on Broadway, blends black humor and surreal drama. Yet the comedian's portrayal of the title's big cat is so consistently understated that it becomes self-effacing. Like the show in general, it doesn't deliver on its promise.",
