    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating directly places this in Mixed territory. Praises the lead performance but finds the play itself lacking dramatic realization, calling it 'more like a thesis than a fully realized drama.' | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review. The performance is praised, but the play itself is critiqued as lacking full realization, indicating a balanced view. | Gemini: The review praises the performance but criticizes the play itself, suggesting a mixed experience. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 60/100 places this firmly in the Mixed bucket. The review acknowledges Williams' committed performance but ultimately criticizes the play as feeling academic rather than dramatically realized, indicating a middle-of-the-road verdict.",
