  "bwwExcerpt": "There are comic zingers scattered throughout Rajiv Joseph’s Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo, and it’s a good thing Robin Williams is around to lob them—but don’t expect guffaws. These punch lines are the kind that pummel, leaving bruises, bloody noses and cracked ribs. When you laugh, it’s the arid chuckle prompted by a cosmic irony, which this surreal war fantasia has in abundance. A gripping, ferocious new drama that includes a morally wracked ghost tiger, buckets of blood and generous swaths of gallows humor, Joseph’s play is a metaphysical thriller equally indebted to Thornton Wilder and Quentin Tarantino.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating directly places this in Mixed territory. Praises the lead performance but finds the play itself lacking dramatic realization, calling it 'more like a thesis than a fully realized drama.' | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review. The performance is praised, but the play itself is critiqued as lacking full realization, indicating a balanced view. | Gemini: The review praises the performance but criticizes the play itself, suggesting a mixed experience. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 60/100 places this firmly in the Mixed bucket. The review acknowledges Williams' committed performance but ultimately criticizes the play as feeling academic rather than dramatically realized, indicating a middle-of-the-road verdict.",
