    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the entire company and lead performance, describing an emotionally powerful evening. Single excerpt warning means this could be cherry-picked positive content, but the language suggests genuine recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the entire company as 'first-rate' and highlights Ammad's performance as emotionally impactful, suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the company and highlights Ammad's performance as an 'eviscerating evening's emotional centre,' indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given it's a single excerpt, I've placed it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the performances ('first-rate', 'eviscerating'), indicating a clear positive recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is low and the score reflects strong performance praise without claiming overall masterpiece status.",
