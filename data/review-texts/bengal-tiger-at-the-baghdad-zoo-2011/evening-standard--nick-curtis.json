    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with vivid language ('utterly compelling', 'massive swings... connect with profound force') suggests enthusiastic recommendation, though single excerpt warning requires caution about full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('utterly compelling', 'profound force') indicating a highly favorable view. The lack of full context and single excerpt warning reduces confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language like \"utterly compelling\" and \"profound force,\" suggesting a positive review. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('utterly compelling', 'profound force') indicating a strong recommendation. Per the single-excerpt guidance, this clearly positive quote warrants the upper end of the Positive bucket (80-84).",
