    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Rave | Claude: The critic explicitly calls it 'must-see theatre' and uses strong positive descriptors like 'adept,' 'funny,' and 'profound.' However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('funny, profound, must-see theatre') suggesting a highly favorable view. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the phrase \"must-see theatre,\" indicating a rave review. The description of the play as \"funny, profound\" further supports this classification. | Kimi: The excerpt contains explicit rave language ('must-see', 'profound', 'funny') indicating enthusiastic recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
