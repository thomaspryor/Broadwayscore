  "bwwExcerpt": "Rajiv Joseph's Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo, which is having its New York premiere at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, is certainly the most distinguished work to arrive on Broadway this season. This is true because of the across-the-board excellence of the artists who have contributed to this production, from the playwright to the director (Moises Kaufman), from the top-notch team of designers to the brilliant ensemble of actors on stage. Here is a play that's been crafted to entertain, to engage, to challenge, and to jolt its audience—and that succeeds in all of these endeavors, shatteringly. Joseph makes us confront the world we've made for ourselves in the past decade. By turns darkly comic, grotesque, horrifying, absurd, and deeply disturbing, Bengal Tiger demands to be seen by people who care about humanity and art and their troubling devolutions in the 21st century.",
