  "bwwExcerpt": "Bengal Tiger also marks the first Broadway outing for Joseph, whose previous works include the origami-themed Animals Out of Paper and the masochistic two-hander Gruesome Playground Injuries, which opened Off Broadway in February. He writes sharply and economically, and he certainly earns points for creating another original premise. I can't think of another Iraq-War play that involves a jungle animal eating a soldier's hand. However, I'm still waiting for one in which the soldiers are three-dimensional characters.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic praises the playwright's writing style and originality but expresses disappointment that the soldiers lack dimensional characterization. The excerpt suggests qualified appreciation with significant reservations. Single excerpt warning applies - reduced confidence due to potentially incomplete picture. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the originality and writing style but criticizes the lack of three-dimensional characters, suggesting a mixed evaluation. The single excerpt and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the writing and originality but expresses a desire for more developed characters, suggesting a mixed but somewhat positive assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic praises Joseph's sharp, economical writing and original premise, the significant criticism that the soldiers lack three-dimensionality creates a balanced, mixed assessment without a clear recommendation.",
