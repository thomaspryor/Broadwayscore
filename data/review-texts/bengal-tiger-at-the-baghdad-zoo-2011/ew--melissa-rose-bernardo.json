  "bwwExcerpt": "Bengal Tiger also marks the first Broadway outing for Joseph, whose previous works include the origami-themed Animals Out of Paper and the masochistic two-hander Gruesome Playground Injuries, which opened Off Broadway in February. He writes sharply and economically, and he certainly earns points for creating another original premise. I can't think of another Iraq-War play that involves a jungle animal eating a soldier's hand. However, I'm still waiting for one in which the soldiers are three-dimensional characters.",
