    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite praising the direction, the critic clearly finds the play itself fails to deliver, describing it as collapsing into pretentious confusion. Single excerpt warning and praise for direction keeps it from deeper negative territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the play for not holding up and collapsing into confusion, despite praising the director's work. This suggests a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review states that the play \"doesn't hold up\" and \"collapses in a muddle\", indicating a negative assessment despite the director's efforts. | Kimi: While acknowledging the director's adept work, the critic delivers a harsh verdict that the play fails to sustain its promise, describing it as collapsing into pretentious confusion. This represents a clear recommendation against seeing the show.",
