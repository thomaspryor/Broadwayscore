    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed praise - acknowledges flaws ('not always seamless') but concludes positively ('whole is stronger than its parts'). Low confidence due to limited text and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges unevenness but concludes that the overall production is stronger than its individual scenes, suggesting a positive recommendation despite some reservations. The humor is noted as a positive aspect that balances difficult subjects. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws but concludes that the whole is stronger than its parts, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges structural weaknesses and uneven scenes but ultimately finds the production cohesive ('the whole is stronger than its parts') and praises its effective use of humor to handle difficult subject matter, indicating a qualified recommendation. Confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
