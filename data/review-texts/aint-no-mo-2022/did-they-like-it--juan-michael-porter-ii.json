However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"ravishing\" to describe the play, which indicates a strong positive sentiment. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strong positive language ('ravishing,' 'revolutionary power') indicating an enthusiastic recommendation for this Broadway debut. Per the single-excerpt guidance, the score reflects the clearly positive tone while accounting for the limited context.",
