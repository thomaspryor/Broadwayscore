    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic uses 'uneven' as a central descriptor while acknowledging the show is 'vital' and praising its humor and anger. The mixed language suggests neither a clear recommendation nor dismissal. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'wild' and 'uneven', indicating a mixed assessment, but also 'undeniably vital', suggesting some positive elements. The overall tone is mixed with both positive and critical elements. | Gemini: The review uses the word \"uneven\" which indicates a mixed reaction. The critic also uses the word \"vital\" which indicates that the show is worth seeing, but the overall tone is mixed. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the show is 'uneven,' the use of 'undeniably vital' and praise for its thematic handling constitutes a recommendation to see it.",
