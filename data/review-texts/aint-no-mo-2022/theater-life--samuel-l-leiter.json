    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong enthusiasm with 'awesome artist' and 'extraordinary company,' plus eager anticipation for future work. Single excerpt warning noted, but language is clearly positive without reservations. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as 'vibrantly painted ideas', 'awesome artist', and 'extraordinary company', suggesting a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses strong enthusiasm for the artist and company, indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
