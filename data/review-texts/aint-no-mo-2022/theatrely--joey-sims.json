  "dtliExcerpt": "It feels almost rote to declare Ain’t No Mo’, a play so uproariously, daringly, and satisfyingly true to itself, as groundbreaking. It can start to even sound like a canned line, or an echo of a marketing pitch. But it’s simply true: this is both a powerful and remarkable play, and it is also like nothing ever seen on Broadway. Ain’t No Mo’ cannot be missed.",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"powerful and remarkable play\" and \"cannot be missed\", indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives like 'groundbreaking' and 'remarkable' and explicitly commands that the show 'cannot be missed,' indicating an unqualified, enthusiastic recommendation at the highest level.",
