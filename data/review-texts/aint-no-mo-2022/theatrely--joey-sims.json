  "dtliExcerpt": "It feels almost rote to declare Ain’t No Mo’, a play so uproariously, daringly, and satisfyingly true to itself, as groundbreaking. It can start to even sound like a canned line, or an echo of a marketing pitch. But it’s simply true: this is both a powerful and remarkable play, and it is also like nothing ever seen on Broadway. Ain’t No Mo’ cannot be missed.",
