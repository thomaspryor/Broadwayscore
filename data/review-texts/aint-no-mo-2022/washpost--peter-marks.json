    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('furious, funny and deeply affecting') with clear artistic merit recognition. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the praise is substantive and unqualified. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'furious, funny and deeply affecting,' indicating strong praise. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"furious, funny and deeply affecting\" to describe the play, indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I've placed it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly positive evaluative language ('deeply affecting', 'furious, funny') indicating a clear recommendation, but confidence is low as only one curated excerpt is available and may not represent the full review.",
