However, single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'raucous' and 'boundary-pushing,' indicating a strong positive reception. The use of 'fearless irreverence' suggests an enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"raucous\", \"boundary-pushing\", and \"fearless irreverence\", suggesting a positive recommendation. However, due to the limited text available, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the show's bold satirical approach and fearless tone, warranting a high-positive score, though the single-excerpt context necessitates low confidence.",
