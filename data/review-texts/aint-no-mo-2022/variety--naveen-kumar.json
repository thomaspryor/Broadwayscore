    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('daring and uproarious feat', 'thrillingly alive') indicates enthusiastic recommendation. Single excerpt warning applied - using upper Positive range due to clearly positive tone, but medium confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'daring and uproarious,' and 'thrillingly alive,' indicating strong enthusiasm. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"daring and uproarious feat\" and \"thrillingly alive\", indicating a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the language suggests a higher score within the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strong praise ('uproarious', 'thrillingly alive', 'daring'), indicating an enthusiastic recommendation for the current Broadway production. However, as only a single curated excerpt is available, confidence is reduced per scoring guidelines.",
