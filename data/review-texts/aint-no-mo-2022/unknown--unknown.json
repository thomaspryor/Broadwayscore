    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt suggests the show makes an initial impression but fails to deliver deeper impact. The 'but' construction indicates qualified praise that doesn't reach positive recommendation territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that while the show has an immediate impact, its commentary lacks lasting effect. This indicates a mixed review, acknowledging some strengths but also highlighting a significant shortcoming. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic assessment, indicating a recommendation with reservations. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, acknowledging the show's immediate impact and sharp commentary while criticizing its lack of lasting emotional resonance. With only one curated excerpt available per the warning, confidence is low. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
