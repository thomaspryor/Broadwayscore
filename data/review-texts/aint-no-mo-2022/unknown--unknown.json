    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt with mixed signals - acknowledges 'immediate impact' but suggests the show's commentary lacks depth or lasting power ('doesn't leave a bruise'). The 'but' construction indicates qualified praise at best. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show has an impactful start but lacks lasting depth or impact, indicating a mixed review. The limited excerpt and warning about potential cherry-picking reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive but somewhat qualified recommendation. The phrase \"immediate impact\" is positive, but the \"doesn't leave a bruise\" suggests the commentary might not be as impactful as it could be. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the show's immediate impact and sharp commentary but qualifies this with a reservation about its lasting effect, indicating a mildly positive recommendation with caveats. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
