    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('raucous, provocative and deeply funny', 'wild ride') suggests enthusiastic praise. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as 'raucous, provocative and deeply funny,' suggesting a strong positive impression. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language indicates a high level of enthusiasm. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language such as \"raucous, provocative, deeply funny\" and \"wild ride.\" Given that this is the only excerpt available, I am scoring it as positive with a high score in that bucket, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong unqualified praise ('deeply funny', 'wild ride', 'provocative') indicating a clear recommendation, though confidence is reduced due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
