  "showScoreExcerpt": "a dizzying mix of cheeky, poignant and enraged. The comedy is raw and broad, much of the time almost indistinguishable from sketch comedy,..paired with tragedy, ominous and barbed, often within the same scene…Cooper is more interested in using a series of metaphors to make pointed commentary on the current state of the country — and on Black pain — than in creating a consistent fictional world… What holds it all together is the extraordinary cast.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Mixed structural critique (inconsistent world, sketch-like comedy) but praises the 'extraordinary cast' that 'holds it all together.' Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mildly positive but truncated. | GPT-4o: The review describes a mix of comedy and tragedy with a focus on commentary rather than a consistent fictional world, suggesting a mixed experience. The praise for the cast suggests some positive elements, but the overall tone is mixed. | Gemini: The review praises the cast but notes the play's inconsistent fictional world. The overall tone suggests a qualified recommendation, placing it in the positive bucket but with a lower score due to the reservations and limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the 'extraordinary cast' as the element that holds the show together, suggesting a recommendation based on performance quality. However, it criticizes the playwright's prioritization of metaphor over 'creating a consistent fictional world' and compares the comedy to sketch comedy, indicating reservations. Given this is a single excerpt with mixed signals, it falls in the lower Positive range.",
