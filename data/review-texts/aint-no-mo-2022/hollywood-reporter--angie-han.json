    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the creator's achievement with vivid emotional language ('devastatingly sad', 'hilariously funny'). However, this is a single curated excerpt which may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for being both personal and resonant, with a strong emotional impact. The language suggests a highly positive reception, indicating a rave review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is very positive, describing the show as deeply personal, broadly resonant, funny, and sad. Given that this is the only excerpt available, I am scoring it as a strong positive, but with low confidence due to the limited information. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the show's emotional resonance and tonal sophistication, describing it as both funny and devastating. As a single curated quote, confidence is low, but the language indicates a clear recommendation in the upper Positive range.",
