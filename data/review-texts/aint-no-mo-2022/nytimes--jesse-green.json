    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic uses 'uneven' as the central descriptor, acknowledging both 'satirical brilliance' and 'heavy-handed messaging.' The qualified praise ('when it works, it's electrifying') suggests neither clear recommendation nor discouragement. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as 'wild' and 'uneven', with both 'satirical brilliance' and 'heavy-handed messaging'. The positive note of 'electrifying' moments suggests some merit, but overall, the mixed nature of the review is clear. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the play as \"uneven\" but also mentions \"satirical brilliance\" and being \"electrifying\" when it works, indicating a mixed assessment. Confidence is low due to the limited text available. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, acknowledging significant flaws ('uneven,' 'heavy-handed') while strongly praising the effective moments ('satirical brilliance,' 'electrifying'), indicating a mild recommendation.",
