However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive impression of the play's creative choices, but the lack of context and single excerpt makes it difficult to gauge the overall sentiment with high confidence. | Kimi: The critic expresses clear appreciation ('impressed me') for the production's artistic execution, indicating a positive reception. However, with only a single curated excerpt available, the overall verdict strength remains uncertain, warranting the lower end of the Positive range.",
