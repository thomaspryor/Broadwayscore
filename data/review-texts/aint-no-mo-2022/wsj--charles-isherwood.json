    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with superlative language ('blazing comic imagination') and emotional impact ('deeply moving'). However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the show, highlighting its entertainment value and emotional impact. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"blazing comic imagination,\" \"wildly entertaining,\" and \"deeply moving,\" suggesting a positive review. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('blazing comic imagination,' 'wildly entertaining,' 'deeply moving') indicating a clear recommendation, though the single-excerpt limitation prevents a higher confidence rating or Rave classification.",
