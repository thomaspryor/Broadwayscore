The phrase 'extraordinarily high level' indicates strong recommendation despite single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('extraordinarily high level', 'abandons caution') suggesting a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning indicates potential cherry-picking, lowering confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"extraordinarily high level\" and \"abandons caution to the winds,\" indicating a positive review. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the performances ('extraordinarily high level') and celebrates the show's uncompromising artistic ambition, indicating a strong recommendation despite the limited text available.",
