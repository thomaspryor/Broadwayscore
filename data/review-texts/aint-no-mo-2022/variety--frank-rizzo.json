    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Balances praise for the playwright's voice and satirical approach with significant structural criticism. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears to be a mixed assessment rather than clearly positive or negative. | GPT-4o: The review praises the boldness and depth of the satire but criticizes the lack of cohesion, suggesting a mixed experience. The single excerpt may not fully capture the overall sentiment, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review praises Cooper's voice and satire but notes the show feels like sketches rather than a cohesive experience, indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the bold writing and cutting satire but delivers a fundamental criticism that the show lacks cohesion, feeling like disconnected sketches rather than a unified theatrical experience. With only a single curated excerpt available, the review appears genuinely mixed rather than clearly recommending or discouraging attendance.",
