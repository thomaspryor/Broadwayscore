The 80/100 original rating combined with unqualified positive descriptors places this in the Rave category. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language such as 'brilliant' and 'necessary', indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. The original rating of 80 supports a high score within the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"brilliant\", \"funny\", and \"necessary\", indicating a strong recommendation. The critic's rating of 80 aligns with a positive assessment. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
