However, this appears to be just an excerpt - confidence is low due to extremely limited text. | GPT-4o: The review describes the play as 'fierce' and 'funny', indicating a positive reception, despite noting it is 'sometimes messy'. The tone suggests a recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review describes the play as \"fierce, funny\" but also \"sometimes messy\", indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers clear praise ('fierce, funny') with only a minor caveat ('sometimes messy'), indicating a solid recommendation. Confidence is low due to the extreme brevity of the excerpt.",
