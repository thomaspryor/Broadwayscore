    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for performances and production values, though acknowledging commercial risks. Single excerpt limits full verdict clarity but tone is appreciative. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the ensemble performers as 'superb' and highlights 'inventive and strikingly well realized' production values, indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the ensemble and production values, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence due to the limited information. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the cast ('superb') and production values ('inventive and strikingly well realized'), indicating a clear recommendation despite the show's non-traditional Broadway format.",
