    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic uses both positive ('wild, raucous', 'swings for the fences') and negative ('uneven') descriptors. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears to be setting up the show's ambitious scope rather than delivering a clear verdict. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'wild, raucous and uneven', indicating a mix of positive energy and inconsistency. The single excerpt suggests a mixed verdict with notable ambition but uneven execution. | Gemini: The review is described as \"wild, raucous and uneven,\" indicating a mixed reception. The phrase \"swings for the fences\" suggests ambition, but the \"uneven\" nature prevents a positive score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, admiring the show's energy and ambition ('wild, raucous,' 'swings for the fences') while noting significant flaws ('uneven'), suggesting a mild recommendation consistent with the lower Positive range.",
