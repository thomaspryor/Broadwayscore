  "dtliExcerpt": "As a director, Ellis is happy to put his trio of stars in the terrarium of a bland upscale apartment and let them go for the punch lines. All three are nimble with comedy, and it’s not that there’s nothing funny in Art; it’s that the material makes the atmosphere in the room too thin to work up the breath for a good laugh.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Reza, though, doesn’t get into it, apart from making some easy jabs at “conceptual art” and “deconstruction” and the chichi gallery world. These things aren’t legitimate concerns but coat hooks on which to hang generic contention and an overall icky view of human nature — which is why some of the play’s actually funniest stuff, in both writing and performance, occurs in a frantic two-page monologue delivered by Yvan, who hurtles into Serge’s apartment mid-meltdown over complications with his upcoming wedding. Corden makes big, broad, breathless work of the set piece, eventually crash-landing in a chair to well-earned applause. It works because it’s played well but also because it has nothing to do with the matter at hand. Neither does anything else, but at least here, the disregard is genuine.",
