  "dtliExcerpt": "The humor also feels dated, out of step with contemporary Broadway audiences who expect more depth and urgency. “Art” toys with questions of loyalty, taste, and compromise, but never pushes further. Despite three engaging performances, the show drags until its final minutes. In the end, this revival is less a masterpiece than a blank canvas.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "On paper, the new Broadway revival of Yasmina Reza’s “Art” sounds like a winner: three Tony Award winners — Neil Patrick Harris, Bobby Cannavale, and James Corden — trading barbs in a sleek comedy about male friendship and the value of modern art. The result is hardly terrible, but it is slight. The laughs are modest, the pacing drags, and the play never builds beyond its simple conceit.",
