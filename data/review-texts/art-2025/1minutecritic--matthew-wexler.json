  "bwwExcerpt": "One-Minute Critic, One-Minute Critic: David Rockwell’s minimalist scenic design in muted grey, punctuated by swift scene changes and Jen Schriever’s equally crisp lighting, nudges Art toward entertaining. However, some may be just as happy watching the famed video of Banskey’s “Girl With Balloon” shredded after it was auctioned in 2018 for $1.4 million—just a bit more than Art made during its first full week of previews.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt praises design elements that 'nudge' the show 'toward entertaining' but immediately undercuts this with a comparison suggesting audiences might be equally satisfied watching a video instead. Single excerpt with BroadwayWorld 'Flat' context suggests lukewarm reception. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights some positive elements like the scenic design and lighting but concludes with a comparison suggesting that viewers might find more satisfaction elsewhere. The mixed signals and lack of a full review lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review acknowledges some positive aspects (scenic design, lighting) but also suggests that some might find other activities more appealing, indicating a mixed overall impression. The single excerpt and aggregator verdict of \"Flat\" contribute to the low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers faint praise for design elements calling the show 'entertaining,' but undercuts this with a wry comparison to a shredded Banksy painting suggesting the show has questionable value. With only one curated excerpt available and a 'Flat' aggregator verdict, the overall impression is mixed.",
