  "dtliExcerpt": "If you saw “Art” back in its heyday, you likely forgot the finer points of the plot. It is forgettable. But there is no credible arguing with this level of audience-pleasing success. This very fun revival at least makes the case that forgettability can be an asset and “Art’ enjoyed over and over again.",
