  "bwwExcerpt": "With this script and a minimalist staging — every scene takes place in one of the men’s living rooms — Art is entirely reliant on the quality of its cast. Corden is, unsurprisingly, the stand-out: at one point he bursts in and unleashes a rib-cracking five-minute monologue about stepmothers and wedding invitations in which he barely pauses to breathe. Cannavale is a charismatic, flabbergasted straight man with hidden wounds; Harris, at times, felt a bit mannered.",
