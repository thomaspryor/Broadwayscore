  "bwwExcerpt": "With this script and a minimalist staging — every scene takes place in one of the men’s living rooms — Art is entirely reliant on the quality of its cast. Corden is, unsurprisingly, the stand-out: at one point he bursts in and unleashes a rib-cracking five-minute monologue about stepmothers and wedding invitations in which he barely pauses to breathe. Cannavale is a charismatic, flabbergasted straight man with hidden wounds; Harris, at times, felt a bit mannered.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt focuses on cast performances with mostly positive assessments (Corden as 'stand-out', Cannavale as 'charismatic'), but notes one performer 'felt a bit mannered'. BroadwayWorld aggregator shows 'Up' verdict supports positive classification. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances, particularly by Corden, which suggests a positive view of the production. However, the limited context and mention of Harris's mannered performance introduce some reservations. | Gemini: The review praises Corden's performance and Cannavale, but notes that Harris felt a bit mannered. Given the limited excerpt, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with reservations. | Kimi: Single excerpt praises Corden as 'stand-out' and Cannavale as 'charismatic' while offering mild criticism of Harris, suggesting strong acting compensates for minimalist staging but lacking full context for definitive verdict.",
