  "bwwExcerpt": "The play, as translated from its original French by Christopher Hampton, is still good. But sitting through Scott Ellis’ intermittently enjoyable revival at the Music Box, it was clear it needs perfect casting and a razor-sharp directorial vision to justify itself. This first Broadway revival promises luxury and stars; its black-and-white poster has Bobby Cannavale, James Corden and Neil Patrick Harris suited-up and laughing expensively, politely. That frictionless sheen also glazes over their onstage chemistry, however game each of them seem to be.",
