  "bwwExcerpt": "It's hard to discern such nuances, however, when Moss' deliberate portrayal is blown off the stage by her co-stars' more vibrant work. It's true that they have most of the amusing lines and better-defined characters, but Pinkham, in particular, gives a richly hilarious - and also rather touching - performance, while Biggs (who grew up in Hasbrouck Heights) provides a telling portrayal of a raging narcissist.",
