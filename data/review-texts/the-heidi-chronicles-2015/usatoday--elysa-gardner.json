  "bwwExcerpt": "Twenty-six years later, in director Pam MacKinnon's sensitive, impassioned new production (***1/2 out of four stars), Heidi's struggles can still seem dishearteningly familiar...The excellent company MacKinnon has assembled reminds us that Wasserstein's dialogue can be as funny as it is unsettling. Jason Biggs, of Orange Is the New Blackand American Pie fame, mines the arrogance of Scoop Rosenbaum, Heidi's aforementioned flame and foil, with delicious wit. As Heidi's more reliable confidante, the deeply compassionate but sometimes caustic Peter Patrone, rising stage star Bryce Pinkham delivers the show's breakout performance.",
