  "bwwExcerpt": "Pam MacKinnon ('A Delicate Balance') snappily steers a story that tracks Heidi Holland, a stand-in for the playwright, from her high school years through adulthood...Moss is an excellent actress with an accessible warmth. The discussions Heidi has with the friends in her life, about how trapped they are by gender roles, have an air of familiarity -- I think about all the women in my own life, and it's easy to imagine many of these conflicts still playing out. The biggest surprise here is Bryce Pinkham, the charismatic actor who originated the title role in 'A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder' and who is just marvelous as Peter, Wendy's gay confidante...'The Heidi Chronicles' never feels like a time capsule memento. The subject matter is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago.",
