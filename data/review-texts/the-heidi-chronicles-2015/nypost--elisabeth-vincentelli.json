  "bwwExcerpt": "...the talented Elisabeth Moss, who stars as pugnacious Peggy Olson on 'Mad Men' and now headlines this Broadway revival. But the role is tough, and Moss is still working on her own potential as an actress...For Moss, who works most effectively in small brush strokes, the challenge is carrying a show that demands a leading lady who can, well, lead...Both Pinkham and Biggs are very good at suggesting how these men change over the years, and Biggs (the spineless fiancé of 'Orange Is the New Black') even seems to fill out as his character gets older and more successful...The irreplaceable Tracee Chimo ('Bad Jews') also shines in four supporting roles...Pam MacKinnon's production sands off whatever edge there was to the play - and Wasserstein wasn't an edgy writer. And while the nostalgic element was there even in the '80s, it's pushed even further now, as we listen to 'We Got the Beat' and watch projections of newspaper headlines about Geraldine Ferraro. It's all very nice, but was feminism ever supposed to be nice?",
