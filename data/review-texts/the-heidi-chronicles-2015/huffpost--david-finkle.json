  "bwwExcerpt": "It occurs to me that because it's now 2015, some theatergoers will think Wasserstein's vision of a particular past quarter-century is now dated. If so, they're confusing the concept of 'dated' with the concept of indelibly recreating a specific date, time and place. The late and very much missed Wasserstein has impeccably done the latter.",
