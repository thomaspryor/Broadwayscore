  "bwwExcerpt": "...it was a savvy idea to cast Moss as Heidi in director Pam MacKinnon's mostly faithful, mostly pleasurable, sometimes frustrating revival of a play...Moss' performance focuses on Heidi's reticence, her inclination to stand back and observe, her disdain for conflict. All are part of Heidi, but this sometimes comes at the expense of the requisite backbone of steel that Joan Allen brought to the role when I first saw this show on Broadway in 1989 (it ran for more than 600 performances). In some ways, MacKinnon's production, aided by the charm of the actor, makes Scoop overly sympathetic and too much in control, when we need to see more of Heidi constantly matching his intelligence and his vivacity while exceeding his morality. On the other hand, Pinkham's Peter is a tad too much in the other direction, too detached, a bit unfeeling. And that means we don't fully see the relationship that might have been - in Heidi's head, at least.",
