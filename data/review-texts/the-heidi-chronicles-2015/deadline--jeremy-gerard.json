  "bwwExcerpt": "I think Elisabeth Moss was born to play Heidi Holland on Broadway. She couldn't possibly have had better preparation than her role as Peggy Olson...Pam MacKinnon (just off the revival of A Delicate Balance) has staged the play with a light touch, a very good thing, and she is well served by the three stars. Moss wears vulnerability and determination with equal appeal; Biggs tops his terrific performance on Orange Is The New Black in subtlety and humor; and Pinkham has catching warmth as the caring doc. Jessica Pabst's costumes are perfect and Japhy Weideman's lighting provides much of the atmosphere otherwise absent from John Lee Beatty's uncharacteristically sterile sets.",
