  "fullText": "Elisabeth Moss stars in \"The Heidi Chronicles.\" (©2014 Joan Marcus) Wendy Wasserstein's 1988 play \"The Heidi Chronicles\" was originally a bracing wakeup call about women's evolving lives. The Broadway revival is far less stirring.\n\nChalk that up to the passage of time and a middling performance by \"Mad Men\" star Elisabeth Moss.\n\nBookended by scenes set in the late 1980s, the story reverses to 1965 and moves ahead for drive-by looks at moments in the heroine's life. Friendships are forged, careers carved out, seductions achieved, protests enacted and nerves frayed. Through it all, maybe, there's hope for the future.\n\nFront and center is art professor Heidi Holland (Moss), often accompanied by one of the two men in her life — sometime lover Scoop (Jason Biggs), a hotshot publisher and lawyer, and BFF Peter (Bryce Pinkham), who becomes a doctor.\n\nSingle girl Heidi's life amounts to a big, aching irony. She's devoted herself to honoring women forgotten by history only to realize that she is adrift in her own time.\n\nIn its day, the play, which began Off-Broadway before transferring to Broadway and winning a Pulitzer and a Tony, was a heady blast of fresh feminist-themed consciousness-raising. Its landmark status is intact, but its impact has been blunted by the years: Such topics are now everywhere on stage, film, TV and even in Patricia Arquette's Oscar acceptance speech.\n\nPam MacKinnon's direction is heavy-handed and lacks nuance. MacKinnon, who won a Tony for the \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" revival in 2012, fails to summon the elegance and poignancy of the piece.\n\nWorse, the characters are one-dimensional, so often we feel as if we're not watching people, but caricatures — especially supporting roles like the butch feminist, the cobralike lady executive, the pushover wife and the oblivious female talk-show host.\n\nThe stars don't help much. Pinkham, a Tony nominee for \"A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder,\" is solid as Peter, who meets Heidi at a teenage dance. His breezy first scene makes his final one — when he reads Heidi the riot act — all the better.\n\nBut Biggs, seen on Broadway in \"The Graduate,\" is miscast as Scoop. He captures the newsman's arrogance, but lacks the charisma and charm to make such a loathsome character convincing.\n\nMoss gives a capable if starchy performance. The actress is at her best when onstage alone, addressing students jokingly during a class, and woundedly during a speech. But it's a rare moment when Heidi and her chronicles come fully alive.",
