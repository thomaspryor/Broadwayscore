  "bwwExcerpt": "So the current big-time revival does what its late creators -- composer Jim Wise, author/lyricists George Haimsohn and Robin Miller -- apparently wanted their modest takeoff to accomplish. The production, directed and choreographed by Randy Skinner, has a hard-tapping, hardworking cast of six and enough varieties of I-love-to-dance smiles to become their own emoticons. What the musical does not have -- in addition to a breakout ingénue to elevate the unrelentingly, cheerfully lame nonsense -- is charm. This is, to put it gently, a one-joke show. And we get the joke -- we get it, we get it -- over and over the tap-happy two hours.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite praising the cast's work ethic, the critic finds the show fundamentally lacking in charm, calls it 'lame nonsense' and 'a one-joke show' that becomes repetitive over two hours. Single excerpt warning noted, but the negative verdict is clear. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for lacking charm and being repetitive, describing it as a 'one-joke show'. Despite acknowledging the hardworking cast, the overall tone is negative. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the hardworking cast but criticizes the lack of charm and repetitive nature of the show. The overall tone suggests a mixed reaction, leaning slightly negative. | Kimi: While praising the hardworking cast's tap-dancing skills, the critic ultimately pans the material as 'unrelentingly, cheerfully lame nonsense' lacking charm, calling it a repetitive one-joke show that grows tedious over its two-hour runtime.",
