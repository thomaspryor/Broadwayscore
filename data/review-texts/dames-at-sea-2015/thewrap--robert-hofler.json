  "bwwExcerpt": "In 2015, how are we supposed to enjoy 'Dames at Sea'...?...With its modest cast of just six, the show doesn't even attempt to replicate Berkeley's big art-deco productions numbers...What we're left with in 'Dames at Sea' are the plots of movies like 'Footlight Parade' and 'The Golddiggers of 1933'...In the new revival of 'Dames at Sea,' Eloise Kropp and Cary Tedder play Ruby and Dick, respectively. Unlike Keeler, Kropp can sing and dance; unlike Powell, Tedder probably won't go on to play Philip Marlowe...Book writers George Haimsohn and Robin Miller make jokes that play on the leading man's name or that rhyme Louis XIV with V.I.P. It's not fun to feel superior to such material; it's numbing. As for Jim Wise's 'Dames at Sea' score, quick: Hum a tune from this nearly 50-year-old musical. The repetition of the music is in a contest only with the repetition of the Dick jokes.",
