  "bwwExcerpt": "So why bring this trifle to Broadway, for the first time, 49 years after its downtown premiere? Never mind; just check your cares and pretensions at the door of the Helen Hayes Theatre...and prepare to be thoroughly charmed...Through it all, happily, Skinner keeps everyone dancing, providing exuberant tap routines that his cast executes with joyful facility. Eloise Kropp, the appealingly wholesome and lavishly athletic performer who plays Ruby, may not have the kewpie-doll allure that Peters surely brought to the part; but it's hard to imagine many leading ladies who could provide the inexhaustible tap prowess demanded here -- or deliver the understated sweetness that makes Kropp a pleasure to watch even when she's standing still. Less is required, at least physically, of Lesli Margherita's Mona, though the actress plays the tyrannical vamp with infectious relish.",
