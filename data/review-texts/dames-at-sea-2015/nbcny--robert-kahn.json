  "bwwExcerpt": "'Dames at Sea' is a technicolor, tap dance-filled tribute to the movie musicals of the 1930s. It's delightful, and it doesn't take itself seriously for a minute...After an evening with the 'Dames' ensemble of dancers and singers, directed and choreographed by Encores! vet Randy Skinner -- he also worked on the 2001 revival of '42nd Street' -- you will surely agree. It works...'Dames at Sea' opens with Margherita in a flashy, affectionate and snark-free tribute to Wall Street. With that as a bar, it falls to Margherita to set a tone of ironic distance to everything that comes after...Six actors do all the work. 'Dames at Sea' is a small-scale musical, crammed into Broadway's teensiest theater, but with the gumption of a mighty battleship.",
