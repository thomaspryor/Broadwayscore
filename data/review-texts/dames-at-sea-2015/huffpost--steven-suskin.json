  "bwwExcerpt": "Skinner directs Dames at Sea as well, but it is his choreography which keeps the show on its toes from beginning to end. He has stacked the deck with an ingratiating cast, including two standout performances. So there is plenty for musical comedy audiences to be happy about, especially at a time when there is nothing else on Broadway in this category...The big joke, in the case of Dames at Sea, was that the creators -- along with a cast of six and designers working with a crimped budget in a crimped space -- were giving us a tongue-in-cheek, postage-stamp version of those Warner Bros. movie musicals of the 1930s...The surprise, today, is that the show remains viable; this first Broadway production is impeccably staged and loaded with entertainment, and should delight its target audience.",
