  "bwwExcerpt": "It's taken almost half a century for 'Dames at Sea' to come to Broadway. There really was no rush. This insubstantial musical, which sits awkwardly between celebration and parody, opened Thursday at the Helen Hays Theatre like a riff off a long-forgotten joke. And its bad identity crisis lets down one of the most hard-working casts in the business...It's the 1960s laughing at the 1930s, but in this century, it comes off as hopelessly hidebound. The music by Jim Wise is so light and derivative that it leaves no mark on the brain or heart...The show is weighed down by references to old stars...Randy Skinner directs and choreographs very tidily, keeping the hijinks bright, the hoofing electric and the 'Golly gee willickers' delivered at a rosy, Technicolor level...But while everyone is sweating up a storm, the purpose is unclear. The dames are all at sea.",
