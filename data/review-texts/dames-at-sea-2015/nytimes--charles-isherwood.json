  "bwwExcerpt": "Nearly 50 years on, however, with Broadway having thoroughly strip-mined the songs and styles of the shows that made up the so-called Golden Age of the musical, the little show that could, and did, seems to give off a faint whiff of mothballs. But it still provides lively diversions for those in search of yesteryear's delights, particularly the skillful pastiche songs by Jim Wise (music) and George Haimsohn and Robin Miller (lyrics)...And there's a whole lot of hearty hoofing, although the exuberant choreography by Randy Skinner, who also directs, had so many dance breaks that I eventually found myself pining for a break from all the breaks...While the producers' decision to cast relative unknowns in the principal roles is certainly in keeping with its little-big-show ethos, and the ensemble is entirely charming, none of the performers are likely to emerge with halos of stardust spinning around their heads.",
