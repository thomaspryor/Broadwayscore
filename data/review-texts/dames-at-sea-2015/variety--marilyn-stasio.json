  "bwwExcerpt": "How cruel, to make comparisons with a legendary star! How unkind! How unfair! Well, tough luck, because here it comes: the new leading lady of 'Dames at Sea' is no Bernadette Peters. There's nothing wrong with this revival that Peters, who played the role of Ruby in the original 1968 production, couldn't fix. But musical theater stars of her caliber don't grow on trees, and although newcomer Eloise Kropp is a power tapper par excellence, she hasn't the saucy charm of a Broadway Baby like Ruby -- or the magnetic appeal of a star like Peters.",

The tone is neither clearly positive nor negative. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"cheerfully silly\" and \"retro,\" suggesting it's enjoyable but not particularly groundbreaking. This places it in the mixed category. | Kimi: Only one sentence provided appears to be an excerpt or severely truncated review. While 'cheerfully silly' suggests light entertainment value, the absence of a concluding verdict or sufficient evaluative context prevents definitive classification higher than Mixed.",
