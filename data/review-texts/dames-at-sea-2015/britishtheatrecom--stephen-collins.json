Single excerpt warning suggests upper end of Positive bucket, but low confidence due to incomplete text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'terrific with a capital T' and praises the timing and style, indicating a strong recommendation despite the lack of plot or character depth. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"terrific with a capital T\" and describes the musical as \"sweet\" and \"catchy,\" indicating a positive recommendation. The single excerpt suggests a strong positive sentiment. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains enthusiastic superlatives ('terrific with a capital T', 'impeccable timing') indicating a strong recommendation. Per single-excerpt guidelines, placed at the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
