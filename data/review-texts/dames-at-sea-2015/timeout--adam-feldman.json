    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic calls it 'frothy fun' but questions whether it merits its Broadway transfer, indicating qualified enjoyment without strong recommendation. The 60/100 rating confirms mixed reception. | GPT-4o: The review describes the revival as 'frothy fun' but notes it doesn't fully justify its Broadway move. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review, indicating some enjoyment but not a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review is mixed, describing the show as \"frothy fun\" but questioning its Broadway run. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60/100 rating places this squarely in the Mixed bucket. While describing the show as 'frothy fun,' the reservation about its Broadway transfer indicates a qualified, middle-of-the-road assessment rather than a clear recommendation.",
