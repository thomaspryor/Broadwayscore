  "bwwExcerpt": "Dames at Sea was launched in 1966 at the downtown coffeehouse Caffe Cino, where its affectionate send-up of 1930s movie musicals tapped -- or, rather, tap-danced -- into nostalgia for the busily silly spectacles of yesteryear. Now it's on Broadway, where it lands like a harmless piece of wet fluff. The first 20 minutes of wide-eyed antics are cute; then your mind starts to wander. Dames at Sea's mild pastiche...is passable but passé -- imagine a revival, half a century from now, of a Fringe show about the '80s -- and it's presented with tongue so far in cheek that it can't say much at all. The cast of six works hard to sell it, though...Director-choreographer Randy Skinner gives them furiously fast tap numbers to perform, as though they were pumping invisible air pedals to keep the show from deflating. In the end, no such luck: pfffffft.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic calls it 'frothy fun' but questions whether it merits its Broadway transfer, indicating qualified enjoyment without strong recommendation. The 60/100 rating confirms mixed reception. | GPT-4o: The review describes the revival as 'frothy fun' but notes it doesn't fully justify its Broadway move. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review, indicating some enjoyment but not a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review is mixed, describing the show as \"frothy fun\" but questioning its Broadway run. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60/100 rating places this squarely in the Mixed bucket. While describing the show as 'frothy fun,' the reservation about its Broadway transfer indicates a qualified, middle-of-the-road assessment rather than a clear recommendation.",
