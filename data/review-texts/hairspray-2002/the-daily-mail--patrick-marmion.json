  "bwwExcerpt": "Jack O'Brien's production has jet fuel running through its veins, thanks to Jerry Mitchell's formation choreography, William Ivey Long's colourful costumes and David Rockwell's cartoon sets. Replacing the previously booked Paul Merton as Tracy's dad, Wilbur, Dennis is a perfect fit with Ball as Tracy's washerwoman mum. But this is Bea's show as gutsy Tracy. She can move, she can croon and she can light the show's blue touch paper - and possibly ignite the whole West End too.",
