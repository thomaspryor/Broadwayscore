  "bwwExcerpt": "Occasionally the words get swallowed up - possibly due to the vastness of the space - and there are moments when the energy seems to drop, but there's no denying the fun that Hairspray offers. With its witty and genuinely funny book from Thomas Meehan and Mark O'Donnell, and excellent, catchy numbers from writing duo Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, it might just be the tonic that we all need right now.",
