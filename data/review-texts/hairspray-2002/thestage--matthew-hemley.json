  "bwwExcerpt": "Occasionally the words get swallowed up - possibly due to the vastness of the space - and there are moments when the energy seems to drop, but there's no denying the fun that Hairspray offers. With its witty and genuinely funny book from Thomas Meehan and Mark O'Donnell, and excellent, catchy numbers from writing duo Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, it might just be the tonic that we all need right now.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear recommendation ('the tonic that we all need') with minor reservations about sound/energy issues. Limited text warrants lower confidence and cautious positive score. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some issues with sound and energy but ultimately highlights the fun and entertainment value of the show, recommending it as a tonic for audiences. | Gemini: The review acknowledges some issues with the production, but ultimately concludes that \"there's no denying the fun that Hairspray offers.\" Given that this is a single excerpt, I am scoring it as positive with reservations. | Kimi: Despite noting occasional issues with acoustics and energy drops, the critic offers clear praise for the witty book and excellent score, ultimately framing the show as a necessary and fun escape.",
