However, this is a single curated excerpt that cuts off mid-sentence, making it impossible to assess the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Lizzie Bea's performance as 'instantly adorable' and describes Michael Ball's transformation positively. However, Les Dennis is described as 'pallid', indicating some reservations. With only one excerpt available, the confidence is low, and the verdict is mildly positive. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the performances of Lizzie Bea and Michael Ball, suggesting a positive experience overall. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low.",
