  "bwwExcerpt": "There's super work throughout the cast, Jonny Amies lovable as Link, Rita Simons vicious as Velma and Mari McGinlay and Ashley Samuels delightful as the colour-bar crossing sweethearts, Penny and Seaweed. A frisson of excitement crackles from those in the know when Dreamgirls alumna Marisha Wallace embarks on \"I Know Where I've Been\".

Single excerpt warning requires caution - this sounds clearly positive so scored in upper Positive range, but low confidence due to incomplete context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances and a standout musical number, suggesting a positive impression. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the cast performances and highlights a specific song, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
