    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Clear rave language calling it 'absolutely one of the best' of the season with praise for the director's work. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, calling it 'one of the best' of the season, with the director's work surpassing previous accomplishments. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly positive verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"loveliest\" and \"one of the best\", indicating a positive recommendation. The comparison to Floyd Collins suggests the show is unconventional but in a positive way. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives calling the show 'absolutely one of the best' and 'loveliest musicals,' alongside praise for the director's surpassing work, indicating an enthusiastic rave recommendation.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "But most impressive is what Durand and the entire production achieve in insisting on dignity for even the briefest and most unremarkable of lives. As absurd as true life, as macabre as a freak show, as blunt as a bullet to the gut, Dead Outlaw also manages to afford Elmer McCurdy something better than dignity, it offers remembrance. Yes, he’s dead. But so’s your mama, and so’s Abe Lincoln, and so’s Balzac, and so’s Anne Frank, and, inevitably, so are you. Say the names.",
