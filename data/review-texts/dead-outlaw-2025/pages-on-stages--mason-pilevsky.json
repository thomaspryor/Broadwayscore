However, with only one curated quote available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the originality of the content and score, indicating a strong positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the show's originality and score, indicating a positive recommendation. Due to the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive sentiment suggests a score in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt provides clear praise for the show's originality and musical quality, warranting an upper-range Positive score per the single-excerpt guidance. Confidence is low due to the truncated text and limited context of a single curated quote.",
