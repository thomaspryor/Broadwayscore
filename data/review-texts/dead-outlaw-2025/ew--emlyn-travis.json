  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "As adaptations of popular, already-established franchises continue to pop up on Broadway, it's thrilling to see original, truly one-of-a-kind productions like Dead Outlaw rise up to meet them. Eccentric, silly, and moving, the tale of Elmer McCurdy is one that truly needs to be seen to be believed."
