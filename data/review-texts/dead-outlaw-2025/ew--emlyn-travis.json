However, confidence is medium due to limited excerpt text. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt uses strong positive language ('thrilling', 'one-of-a-kind', 'truly needs to be seen to be believed'), indicating an enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"thrilling\" and \"truly one-of-a-kind\" and states that the show \"needs to be seen.\" | Kimi: The excerpts express enthusiastic praise for the show's originality and emotional impact, calling it 'thrilling' and 'one-of-a-kind' with a clear directive that it 'needs to be seen,' indicating strong rave-level recommendation despite limited text availability. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
