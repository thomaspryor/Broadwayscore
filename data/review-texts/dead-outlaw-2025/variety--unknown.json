  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Following its well-received Off Broadway run produced by Audible last year, the musical retains its wickedness, vibrancy and nerve, as well as its extraordinary ensemble of actors. It also has Arnulfo Maldonado's giant cube of a set, housing its kick-ass band, honkytonk ambiance and much of the action.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('wickedness, vibrancy and nerve', 'extraordinary ensemble', 'kick-ass') suggests enthusiastic recommendation. Single excerpt warning noted - scoring in upper Positive range due to clearly enthusiastic tone. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's vibrancy, nerve, and ensemble, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the musical's wickedness, vibrancy, nerve, and ensemble, indicating a positive assessment. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's energy, cast, and design, using words like 'extraordinary' and 'kick-ass,' indicating a strong positive recommendation despite the limited single-excerpt context.",
