  "bwwExcerpt": "I wish the show had something more revelatory to say about America’s fascination with the macabre, it’s obsession with minor celebrities, or the fact that greedy bastards lurk in and around every corner than it actually does. Perhaps if it did, I would have found “Dead Outlaw” significantly more rewarding.",
