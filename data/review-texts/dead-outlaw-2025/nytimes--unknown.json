  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "That's the gorgeously perverse opening of Dead Outlaw,' the feel-good musical of the season, if death and deadpan feel good to you. As directed by David Cromer, in another of his daringly poker-faced stagings, the show is to Broadway what a ghost train is to an amusement park, with screams and laughs but much better music.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear enthusiasm calling it 'the feel-good musical of the season' with praise for direction and music. Single excerpt warning means this could be cherry-picked positivity, but the tone is genuinely appreciative of the show's unique qualities. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'the feel-good musical of the season' with positive comparisons to an amusement park ride, suggesting an entertaining experience. The tone is clearly positive, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt is positive, calling the show the \"feel-good musical of the season\" and praising the direction and music. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive tone warrants a score in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise, calling it the 'feel-good musical of the season' and complimenting Cromer's 'daringly poker-faced' direction and the quality of the music, warranting a high Positive score despite the single-excerpt limitation.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "And in part it’s the respect the authors show the audience by leaving us to assemble the jokes for ourselves, using the components they provide: contrast, surprise, pattern and disruption. Though that is already surpassingly rare on Broadway, even rarer is the way the show forces us, through pure entertainment and with no pathos, to think about things our intelligence busily helps us avoid. Why are we alive? As long as we are, what should we do about it? And do we have our papers in order? “Dead Outlaw” does. It should have a hell of an afterlife.",
