  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "At one point, Cromer and his gifted lighting designer, Heather Gilbert, combine for what must be the best lighting cue of the entire Broadway season as a pinhole spot lands on Durand's face for what feels like several minutes as the audience holds its breath, not knowing whether the corpse will speak, stay dead or break into song, the show fully understanding the possibilities posed by the magic of theater. It's consummate Cromer and indicative of a highly unusual and highly skilled performance by a very game actor who also sings beautifully while his character is alive.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with high praise for direction ('consummate Cromer'), lighting design ('best lighting cue of the entire Broadway season'), and lead performance ('highly skilled'). However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's lighting and performance, describing it as 'consummate' and 'highly skilled', suggesting a strong positive impression. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the lighting design and the actor's performance, calling it \"consummate Cromer\" and \"highly unusual and highly skilled.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it as a strong positive within the bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise for the lighting design ('best of the season') and acting performance, indicating strong enthusiasm for the production despite the limitation of having only a single excerpt available.",
