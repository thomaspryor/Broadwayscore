  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "At one point, Cromer and his gifted lighting designer, Heather Gilbert, combine for what must be the best lighting cue of the entire Broadway season as a pinhole spot lands on Durand's face for what feels like several minutes as the audience holds its breath, not knowing whether the corpse will speak, stay dead or break into song, the show fully understanding the possibilities posed by the magic of theater. It's consummate Cromer and indicative of a highly unusual and highly skilled performance by a very game actor who also sings beautifully while his character is alive.",
