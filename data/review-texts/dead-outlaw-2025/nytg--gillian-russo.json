  "bwwExcerpt": "Dead Outlaw moves through its plot like a speeding train, most of Itamar Moses's script leaning on narration as the remaining seven actors, all but Andrew Durand (as McCurdy) embodying multiple characters, act it out on the periphery of a raised platform on which Brown and his onstage band play. The show's setup and bevy of characters leaves little breathing room to emotionally invest in most of them, but for better or worse, that's not the point.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show is entertaining enough for audiences, implying a mild recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests the show is entertaining, but the phrase \"after all\" implies some reservations. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as slightly positive with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt provides faint praise suggesting the show meets minimum entertainment standards for ticket buyers, but lacks enthusiasm or strong recommendation language. Scored at lower end of Positive bucket per instructions for mildly positive isolated quotes.",
