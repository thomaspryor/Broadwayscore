    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it a 'smart, rare gem' that 'bears repeating' with positive carryover from acclaimed off-Broadway run. Single excerpt limitation requires medium confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a 'smart, rare gem' and notes its successful transition to Broadway, indicating a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt and lack of a full review text lower confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses strong praise, calling the show a \"smart, rare gem\" and noting its success off-Broadway. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a score in the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('smart, rare gem', 'pointed and playful') and references the show's acclaimed pedigree, indicating a clear recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence.",
