  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "His mortal thread is cut, and Durand spends the rest of the musical being moved around inertly in what might be the most impressive deadpan performance in history. He's staggeringly still: You can't even catch him blink. That same level of commitment extends to all of Dead Outlaw. The writing is piquant and sly, the songs have verve and resonance, and every element of Cromer's production seems to fit exactly in place.",
