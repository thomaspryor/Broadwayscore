He's staggeringly still: You can't even catch him blink. That same level of commitment extends to all of Dead Outlaw. The writing is piquant and sly, the songs have verve and resonance, and every element of Cromer's production seems to fit exactly in place.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for writing, songs, and direction with no caveats in this excerpt. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the writing, songs, and production, indicating a solid recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the writing, songs, and production. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it as a strong positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers comprehensive praise for performances, writing, music, and direction with enthusiastic language ('most impressive,' 'staggeringly,' 'verve'). Following single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this scores at the high end of Positive, though confidence is reduced due to potential cherry-picking.",
