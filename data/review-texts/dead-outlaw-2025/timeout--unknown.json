  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "His mortal thread is cut, and Durand spends the rest of the musical being moved around inertly in what might be the most impressive deadpan performance in history. He's staggeringly still: You can't even catch him blink. That same level of commitment extends to all of Dead Outlaw. The writing is piquant and sly, the songs have verve and resonance, and every element of Cromer's production seems to fit exactly in place.",

Single excerpt limits full assessment, but praise is unqualified and specific. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the writing, songs, and production, suggesting a highly positive view. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the writing, songs, and production, indicating a positive assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language warrants a score on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers enthusiastic, unqualified praise across all production elements—heralding the lead performance as 'the most impressive deadpan performance in history' while commending the writing, music, and direction—indicating a strong recommendation despite limited context.",
