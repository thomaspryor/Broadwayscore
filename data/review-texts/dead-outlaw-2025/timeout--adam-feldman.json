He's staggeringly still: You can't even catch him blink. That same level of commitment extends to all of Dead Outlaw. The writing is piquant and sly, the songs have verve and resonance, and every element of Cromer's production seems to fit exactly in place.",

However, due to the text quality warning and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the writing, songs, and production, indicating a positive recommendation.
