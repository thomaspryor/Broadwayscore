    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides praise for a specific performance but lacks a broader evaluation of the production. With only one quote available, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The single excerpt praises a performance, suggesting a positive but potentially limited recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers specific, elevated praise for the lead performance using the term \"artform,\" indicating a clearly positive assessment of this element. However, as a single curated excerpt, it may not represent the full review's verdict on the overall production.",
