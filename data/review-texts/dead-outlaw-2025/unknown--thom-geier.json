    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('infectious', 'elevating') and frames the show as successfully transforming source material into meaningful art. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential for cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for its unique storytelling and engaging musical style, suggesting a positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low and the score reflects a mildly positive tone. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, describing the show as infectious and elevating the story. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the show's infectious score and its artistic elevation of the material into a sophisticated elegy, indicating strong enthusiasm for the production despite the limited context of a single curated quote.",
