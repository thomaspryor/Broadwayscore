  "bwwExcerpt": "“Outlaw” reminds me of the rebel rock musical “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” crossed with a bone-dry Coen Brothers film. There’s room for something ​s​o subversive on Broadway. But not when the production’s energy level is that of a funeral parlor at 8 a.m.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed assessment - acknowledges quality material ('diamonds in the rough') but criticizes poor execution by director. Without full review context, this reads as disappointed but not entirely negative. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges positive elements ('many diamonds in the rough') but criticizes the staging as 'haphazard and diffuse'. The excerpt suggests a mixed verdict with potential, but the single quote limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates potential but criticizes the staging, suggesting a mixed assessment. Given only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges quality elements ('diamonds in the rough') but finds the direction 'awfully haphazard,' suggesting unfulfilled potential. With only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment is ambiguous but leans mixed due to the sharp staging critique.",
