  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "And now, over 100 years since he died, McCurdy is the subject of a Broadway musical, where audiences are encouraged to be both horrified and humored by his story. As striking a musical as Dead Outlaw is, and for all a Broadway theater's fancy surrounds, we're still really at the funfair gawping at the strange life-in-death of Elmer McCurdy. Only in America.",

The tone is mixed, with both positive and critical elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the musical's striking qualities but also suggests a somewhat detached, gawking perspective, indicating a mixed or neutral stance. The single excerpt makes it difficult to determine a clear recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise ('striking') but undercuts it with criticism about the sensationalistic nature of the show ('funfair gawping'), creating a genuinely mixed assessment. Single excerpt limits confidence.",

Playing the daughter of a movie director who buys the corpse at one point, Knitel sings at McCurdy all her teenage heartbreak and trivialities.",
