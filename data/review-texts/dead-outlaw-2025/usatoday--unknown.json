  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Durand delivers the most indelible performance of the season as McCurdy: motionless, flat-eyed and unblinking as he stands upright in a wooden coffin for much of the show, reduced to a rifle-toting rag doll. It's a mind-blowing physical feat, to be clear, but he also imbues the tetchy character with a potent, devastating undercurrent.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance ('most indelible of the season', 'mind-blowing', 'devastating') suggests positive recommendation, but single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Durand's performance as 'indelible' and 'mind-blowing,' suggesting a strong positive impression. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context necessitate a cautious approach, placing the score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a standout performance, calling it \"indelible\" and \"mind-blowing,\" suggesting a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the praise warrants a score at the higher end of the Positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Durand's performance ('indelible', 'mind-blowing'), suggesting a positive verdict, though the single-excerpt limitation warrants low confidence.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "In the staggering “Dead Outlaw,” death is both commodified and desensitized; a cruel fact of life that we are pummeled with repeatedly throughout the musical. (“Your friends are dead / your dog is dead / and so are you,” Brown growls in the cheeky, name-dropping finale.) But in facing our bleak mortal coil with a laugh and a song, McCurdy’s hair-raising, pulse-racing resuscitation helps us all feel a little more alive.",
