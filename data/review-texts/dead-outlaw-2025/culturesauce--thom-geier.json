  "bwwExcerpt": "The overall result is a visual and aural delight, an affectionate dive into a forgotten chapter from the American past that recalls the having-fun-with-history energy of Bloody, Bloody Andrew Jackson, but in a way that’s both more grounded and less weighty. Dead Outlaw unearths the corpse of forgotten history — elevating a twisty little yarn into a bizarro-world elegy to how the American Dream can curdle into violence, cruelty, and casual indifference.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review uses positive descriptors like 'infectious' and 'elevating,' presenting the show as successfully transforming dark material into compelling theater. However, confidence is low due to limited excerpt availability. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view with phrases like 'infectious rockabilly beat' and 'elevating a twisty little yarn.' However, the text is limited and lacks a full verdict, leading to a 'low' confidence rating. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses positive language like \"infectious\" and \"elevating\", suggesting a positive recommendation. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the show's infectious score and thematic ambition, using words like 'elevating' and 'elegy' without any visible reservations.",
