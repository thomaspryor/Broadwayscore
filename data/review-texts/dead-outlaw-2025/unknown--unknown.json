    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it 'the feel-good musical of the season' which is positive praise, but adds a qualifying caveat about its dark humor. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive recommendation with a humorous tone, indicating it may appeal to those who appreciate its unique style. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence. | Gemini: The phrase \"feel-good musical of the season\" suggests a positive recommendation, but the caveat \"if death and deadpan feel good to you\" indicates a reservation. Because this is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic bestows a seasonal superlative on the show, calling it the 'feel-good musical of the season' despite its dark subject matter, indicating a strong recommendation.",
