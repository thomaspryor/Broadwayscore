    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with mild positive language ('enhanced') but very limited context. The phrase suggests appreciation for the production's unique approach, but without more text, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the show, highlighting how the cast's unique traits enhance its peculiarities. However, without more context, the recommendation seems mild. | Gemini: The single excerpt is positive, but the lack of context and the warning about cherry-picked quotes necessitates a lower score within the positive range and low confidence. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers mild, specific praise for how the production uses its cast's unique qualities, suggesting the show works on its own terms. However, with only one curated quote available, the overall verdict remains unclear, warranting a lower score within the Positive range and low confidence.",
