  "bwwExcerpt": "Much talent has been squandered on this stale confection, starting with that of Ms. Murphy, who switches from youth to old age and back again so deftly that you'll smile each time she does it. The cast is full of pros (it's always a joy to see Lewis J. Stadlen at work), and Andy Blankenbuehler, lately of 'In the Heights,' has staged the musical numbers with pleasing skill. If you have an unusually high tolerance for sentiment, you might find 'The People in the Picture' barely endurable.",
