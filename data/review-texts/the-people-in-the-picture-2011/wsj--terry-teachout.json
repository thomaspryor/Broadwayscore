This is a clear negative assessment. | GPT-4o: The review indicates that the musical's good intentions are its downfall, suggesting a significant failure in execution. The phrase 'fatal case' implies a strong negative assessment. | Gemini: The review states that the musical \"suffers from a fatal case of good intentions,\" indicating a negative assessment despite acknowledging good intentions. | Kimi: While acknowledging the show's noble subject matter, the critic delivers a dismissive verdict using the oxymoron 'fatal case of good intentions' to indicate the production is undone by its own earnestness, making a clear recommendation against seeing it.",
