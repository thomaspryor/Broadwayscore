  "bwwExcerpt": "Everything ultimately comes together in a scene of great emotion, but one that's out of step both with the tone of the rest of the play and with what we've learned of Raisel as a character. \"The People in the Picture\" seems to have been a labor of love for Dart, but, without freshness, wit or dramatic imagination, it's not much of a musical.",
