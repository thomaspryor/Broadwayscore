  "bwwExcerpt": "Murphy, as usual, loses herself in the part, which requires her to shift between time periods, often while remaining on stage...Unfortunately, the book and lyrics - by 'Beaches' novelist and first-time Broadway story writer Iris Rainer Dart - and music - by Mike Stoller ('Smokey Joe's Cafe') and Artie Butler (who wrote the pop standard 'Here's to Life') - don't always rise to Murphy's high standard.",
