  "bwwExcerpt": "Above all, star Donna Murphy is a Tony winner who's lit up the likes of \"Passion\" and \"Wonderful Town.\" Here, she works tirelessly to perform CPR on a DOA show...it's not just the music that's subpar: The book is full of holes, and pulls at the heartstrings without earning its pathos, ensnaring good supporting performers like Alexander Gemignani (Paul's son), Nicole Parker, Chip Zien and Christopher Innvar into a gooey mess.",
