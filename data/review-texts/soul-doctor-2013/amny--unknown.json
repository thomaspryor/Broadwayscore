  "bwwExcerpt": "Is there a doctor in the house? Not a medical doctor, or even a 'soul doctor,' whatever that is, but what is known on Broadway as a 'show doctor,' a playwright or director who can step in and salvage a musical with serious book problems. 'Soul Doctor' - a new musical about the life of rabbi and singer-composer Shlomo Carlebach that comes off as a sanitized, overstuffed mix of 'The Jazz Singer,' 'Fiddler on the Roof' and 'Hair' - is badly in need of such help...Despite all of these problems, one is still tempted to cut 'Soul Doctor' some slack in light of its openhearted and accepting tone...As Carlebach, Eric Anderson provides an energetic performance that captures the character's spirit and sensitivity.",
