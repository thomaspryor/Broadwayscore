  "bwwExcerpt": "Actually, that hackneyed vibe applies to the whole show, from Benoit-Swan Pouffer's vague choreography to the groan-inducing dialogue. You often wish 'Soul Doctor' had called a script doctor - especially when Shlomo's warned that he's 'gonna do the horah/In Sodom and Gomorrah.' To which even a gentile might sigh, 'Oy vey.'",
