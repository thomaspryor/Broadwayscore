  "bwwExcerpt": "Eric Anderson as Shlomo and Amber Iman as Nina spiritedly lift 'Soul Doctor' beyond Old and New Testament realms...Shlomo and Nina's first encounter is worth even the Broadway price of admission...Neil Patel's Wailing Wall set moves us seamlessly to the jazz and hora beats of Seth Farber's orchestra and Benoit-Swan Pouffer's go-with-the-flow choreography...But we're most disappointed in the final tableaux -- phonier even than presidential candidates hugging after a primary slugfest. Zealots don't forgive perceived infidels. This is a biographical musical, not a Disney fantasy.",
