    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt describes show as 'passionate' (positive) but 'uneven' (negative qualifier), suggesting mixed verdict. Low confidence due to limited text from curated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'passionate' but 'uneven', indicating a mixed review. The lack of full context and the warning about cherry-picked excerpts suggest a cautious approach, hence a score on the higher end of the Mixed range. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as \"passionate, if uneven\", which indicates a mixed reaction. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as a 'passionate celebration' while acknowledging it is 'uneven', suggesting a qualified positive recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
