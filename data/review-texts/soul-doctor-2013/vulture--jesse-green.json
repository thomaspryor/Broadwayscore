    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt describes show as 'passionate' (positive) but 'uneven' (negative qualifier). The mixed language suggests neither clear recommendation nor discouragement. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'passionate' but also 'uneven,' indicating a mixed review. The lack of full context and the single excerpt warning suggest caution in assigning a higher score. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as \"passionate, if uneven,\" which indicates a mixed assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as a 'passionate celebration' but qualifies this with 'if uneven,' indicating a positive but qualified recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
