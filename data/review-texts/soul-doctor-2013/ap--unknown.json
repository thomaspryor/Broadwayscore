  "bwwExcerpt": "The new Broadway musical 'Soul Doctor' examines the life and times - and music - of Shlomo Carlebach in a unique, if plodding, study of a charismatic holy man who finds himself stuck between an unstoppable force and an immovable object. Carlebach, widely considered to be the modern era's father of Jewish popular music, makes for a fascinating biographical subject, even if the re-orchestrations of his staid, folksy compositions aren't quite lively or diverse enough to fill a two-hour, 30-minute musical...In the lead role, Anderson displays a formidable presence - and beard - with a disarming mix of placid shyness and childlike bursts of kinetic energy.",
