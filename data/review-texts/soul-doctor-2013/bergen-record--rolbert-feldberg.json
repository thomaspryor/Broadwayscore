  "bwwExcerpt": "Sloppily, the show fails to mention that he eventually marries, in his late 40s, and has two daughters. Another misstep in the production is a big revival scene in a black storefront church: The excitement is undercut by having the parishioners played by square-looking white people (the result, no doubt, of a limited budget, which has actors playing multiple roles). The music of Shlomo Carlebach is appropriately honored in \"Soul Doctor,\" but the show is wanting in almost every other aspect.",
