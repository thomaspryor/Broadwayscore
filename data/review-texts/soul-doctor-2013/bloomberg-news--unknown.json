  "bwwExcerpt": "Combine 'Fiddler on the Roof' with 'Jersey Boys,' add some 'Hair' and hokum and you get a taste of 'Soul Doctor,' a lively, occasionally cartoonish new musical on Broadway. For fans of Carlebach, the bushy-bearded, guitar-strumming singer-songwriter who mixed contemporary genres with traditional Jewish music, the show has dozens of his songs to recommend it...Given its anemic sales, 'Soul Doctor' may not be practicing for long. Those intrigued by this passionately performed niche entertainment shouldn't dawdle. For the less choosy of the chosen people, the musical hits the spot.",
