  "bwwExcerpt": "How good can a jukebox musical be? As good as 'Bullets Over Broadway,' Woody Allen's new stage version of his 1994 film, directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman ('The Producers'). The book is funny, the staging inventive, the cast outstanding, the sets and costumes satisfyingly slick. All that's missing is a purpose-written score, in place of which we get period-true arrangements of pop songs of the 1920s and '30s. Does that matter? It did to me-a lot-but I doubt that many other people will boggle over the absence of original songs from 'Bullets Over Broadway.' Except for a flabby finale, it has the sweet scent of a box-office smash.",
