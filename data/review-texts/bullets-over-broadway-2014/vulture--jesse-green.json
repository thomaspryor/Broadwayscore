    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative verdict stating the musical adaptation failed by losing what made the original wonderful, with the critic explicitly saying you 'risk losing' the magic when trying to adapt perfection. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the musical fails to capture the essence of the original, implying a negative view of the adaptation. However, the tone is not strongly negative, hence a moderate score within the Negative range. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the musical fails to live up to the original, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic argues that the musical adaptation fails to capture what made the original film wonderful, suggesting the show is an unnecessary and inferior version that should not have been attempted.",
