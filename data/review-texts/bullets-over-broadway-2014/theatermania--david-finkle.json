Mixed signals without clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's entertainment value but suggests a lack of depth or purpose, leading to a mixed recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges entertainment value but questions the substance, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The review acknowledges the show succeeds at entertainment but undercuts this with a fundamental criticism about its lack of purpose or coherence. The backhanded compliment structure suggests the critic finds it watchable but not truly recommendable, placing it in Mixed territory.",
