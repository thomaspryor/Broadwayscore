The word 'essential' suggests the critic finds it skippable. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges positive elements like songs, costumes, and dancing but ultimately suggests the show lacks a sense of necessity or cohesion, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive elements but ultimately finds the show lacking in overall impact, indicating a mixed recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic praises specific production elements like songs, costumes, and choreography, the concluding clause indicates the show fails to cohere into a meaningful or essential whole, resulting in a lukewarm assessment that neither recommends nor discourages attendance.",
