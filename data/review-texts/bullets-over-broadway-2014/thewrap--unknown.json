  "fullText": "“Rocky” and “Bullets Over Broadway” would seem to have nothing in common, but the vastly different films have now been turned into stage musicals this season, and suddenly they make strange bedfellows, if not legit twins.\n\nThe Woody Allen musical, which opened Thursday at the St. James Theatre, possesses the infinitely superior pedigree, the classic 1994 movie send-up of theater egos and pretensions that Allen directed and co-wrote with Douglas McGrath.",

  "rejectionReasoning": "claude: This appears to be an introductory paragraph that sets up a comparison between two shows but contains no actual evaluation or critique of either production.; openai: The text is about 'Bullets Over Broadway' and 'Rocky', not a review of a specific Broadway show.; gemini: This is a brief introduction comparing two musicals, 'Rocky' and 'Bullets Over Broadway,' but it doesn't offer a critical evaluation or recommendation of 'Bullets Over Broadway.' It's more of a setup than a review.",
  "promptVersion": "5.2.0",
  "bwwExcerpt": "Allen has pulled something of a Sylvester Stallone in his Broadway book-writer debut: His book never really abandons his screenplay sufficiently to reinvent itself for the theater. For most of the evening, some great dance numbers and many old tunes have simply be inserted into this tale of a young writer (Zach Braff) who willingly allows a mobster (Nick Cordero) to rewrite his play, much to the play's improvement...'Bullets,' the musical, is loaded down with old ditties that wore out their welcome sometime during the run of 'Arthur Godfrey Time' and only vaguely refer to Allen's story...'Bullets' on Broadway rarely breaks free of the movie, and fond memories keep taking us back to the original.",
