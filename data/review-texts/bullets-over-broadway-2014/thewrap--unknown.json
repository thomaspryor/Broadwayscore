  "fullText": "“Rocky” and “Bullets Over Broadway” would seem to have nothing in common, but the vastly different films have now been turned into stage musicals this season, and suddenly they make strange bedfellows, if not legit twins.\n\nThe Woody Allen musical, which opened Thursday at the St. James Theatre, possesses the infinitely superior pedigree, the classic 1994 movie send-up of theater egos and pretensions that Allen directed and co-wrote with Douglas McGrath.",
