  "fullText": "Showgirls dressed like frisky tigers shake their moneymakers near the beginning of Woody Allen’s “Bullets Over Broadway” — and they’re a symbol, for this musical certainly works its tail off to tickle and delight.\n\nIt’s too bad that the comedy about a playwriting hit man is a bit of a miss. On the plus side, director and choreographer Susan Stroman’s dance numbers pack sure-footed pizzazz. And the good-looking production depicts 1929 New York with wit and grace notes. A theater proscenium decorated with living angels is a lovely little touch.\n\nBut working in tandem with Allen, who recycled the screenplay of his Oscar-winning 1994 comedy while dealing with anything-but-amusing personal issues, Stroman doesn’t match the zany, out-of-this-world wow factor of her collaboration with Mel Brooks on “The Producers” — though a tip of the hat goes to the tastelessly delicious dancing-hot-dog number.\n\nAllen’s showbiz and gangland eccentrics stiffen into cardboard when they’re amplified from two to three dimensions. A sense of nuance and humanity goes missing. It doesn’t help that key actors shoot blanks, including Zach Braff, of “Scrubs” fame, and Helene Yorke, of “Masters of Sex.” Both need infusions of charm for their roles as a morally iffy writer and the tootsie ruining his play.\n\nBeyond mediocre acting is the poor choice at the center of this jukebox musical: Instead of coming up with new tunes, Allen shoehorned period songs — hits like “I’m Sitting on Top of the World” and “Let’s Misbehave,” plus lesser-known novelties like “I Ain’t Gonna Play No Second Fiddle” — into the existing plot. But all this does is throw the show into neutral whenever the orchestra swells. Even well-performed, the oldies simply underline what’s going on.\n\nThe script is faithful to the film, but a tad raunchier. It summons and tweaks the old theater adage: You can’t make a living on Broadway, but you can make a killing.\n\nDavid Shayne (Braff) gets his play produced — but it’s a Faustian bargain to get money from a gangster backer: He must cast the mobster’s moll, Olive (Yorke), in the show. David’s woes deepen when he falls for boozy stage diva Helen Sinclair (Marin Mazzie) and gets upstaged — as a writer! — by Cheech (Nick Cordero), a mob enforcer who’s good at both dramaturgy and homicide.\n\nMazzie does not eclipse Dianne Wiest’s big screen portrayal of Helen, but she’s gutsy, goofy and glamorous as the needy neurotic. Cordero lends loads of presence and charisma as the criminally talented thug. The show’s zenith comes when he and nimble goons rat-a-tap-tap their way through a rollicking “T’ain’t Nobody’s Biz-ness If I Do.”\n\nFor all the singing about sitting on top of the world, “Bullets Over Broadway” doesn’t take you to such heights — but to the Equator, or the middle of the road.\n\nALLEN’S ROUGH ROAD TO BROADWAY\n\nA New York writer faces a barrage of personal strife as he nervously readies his Broadway show. David Shayne, the made-up scribe in “Bullets Over Broadway”? No, it’s Woody Allen, whose musical debut on the Great White Way has been marred by controversies:\n\n— After Allen was honored at the Golden Globes in January, his ex Mia Farrow and her son Ronan Twitter-bombed him with renewed allegations that he molested adopted daughter Dylan 20 years ago. Allen has denied the allegation and was never charged.\n\n— In February, print reporters were uninvited from the musical’s media day to prevent questions about the most famous person involved in the production: Allen.\n\n— In March, cast members — anonymously, of course! — said they were unhappy with the musical’s finale, the silly song “Yes! We Have No Bananas.” But Allen insisted.\n\n— On Thursday, Allen was criticized for allegedly demanding there be no black actors portraying the musical’s gangsters.",
