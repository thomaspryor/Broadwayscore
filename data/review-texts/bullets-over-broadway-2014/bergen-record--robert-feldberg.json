  "bwwExcerpt": "'Bullets Over Broadway' is Stroman's second bite of the apple this season. In October, she directed and choreographed 'Big Fish,' a musical about the evolving relationship of a father and son. It wasn't the right show for her fizzy style. With 'Bullets Over Broadway,' she's gotten a perfect match. And the result couldn't be more joyful.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive verdict calling it a 'perfect match' and 'couldn't be more joyful', but low confidence due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking bias. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the production, describing it as a 'perfect match' and 'joyful,' indicating a highly positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic states that the show is a 'perfect match' for Stroman's style and that the result 'couldn't be more joyful,' indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt expresses enthusiastic praise for the director's perfect fit with the material, describing the result as maximally joyful. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the upper Positive range (80-84).",
