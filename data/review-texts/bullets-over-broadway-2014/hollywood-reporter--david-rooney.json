While noting it differs from the source material, the tone is appreciative of what the adaptation offers. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'lavish' and 'crowd-pleasing' but also notes a loss of the movie's 'bittersweet edge', suggesting a trade-off rather than a clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review describes the show as a \"lavish, old-fashioned Broadway entertainment,\" which is positive. However, it also notes that it trades the movie's \"bittersweet edge\" for \"crowd-pleasing razzle-dazzle,\" indicating a reservation. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as 'lavish' and 'crowd-pleasing' with 'razzle-dazzle,' indicating a recommendation, while noting it sacrifices the original film's 'bittersweet edge,' suggesting qualified enthusiasm rather than unqualified praise.",
