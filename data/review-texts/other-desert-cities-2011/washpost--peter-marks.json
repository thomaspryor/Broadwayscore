  "bwwExcerpt": "The refined caliber of acting gives the playwright's words their satisfying potency. Griffiths and Sadoski excel as the alternately aggressive and defensive progeny of parents far more conservative than they. Keach, continuing in the path of the fine Lear he portrayed at Shakespeare Theatre Company, conveys the fading leonine strength of a prideful patriarch. And Channing's turn as a Nancy Reagan acolyte, stoic and seething at the very same time, is remarkable.",
