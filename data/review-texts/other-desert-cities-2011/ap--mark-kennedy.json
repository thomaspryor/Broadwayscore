  "bwwExcerpt": "We've all heard this scenario before: Family members gather for a fraught holiday reunion in which embarrassing family secrets - lubricated by booze and resentment - tumble out. But Jon Robin Baitz has taken that cliche and somehow made it vibrant in 'Other Desert Cities,' which had its world debut last year at Lincoln Center Theater and has now made the jump to Broadway. It opened Thursday at the Booth Theatre. The script crackles with life and so do the performances.",
