  "bwwExcerpt": "Baitz's initial banter is fun, but in Act Two dimensions are added and the play becomes Tennessee-Williams-like in its recriminations, revelations, and shifting loyalties, going beyond the scope of the usual 'Someone's spilling the beans' drama. As the rage boils to a head, the characters (two of whom love saying 'I know myself') find that they never really knew each other, and they're in for a few shocks that are well played by a cast of well-knowns.",
