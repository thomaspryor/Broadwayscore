  "bwwExcerpt": "'Cities,' directed with a masterly combination of shadow and shimmer by Joe Mantello, emerges as stronger, more sincere and more credible in its Broadway reincarnation... The Wyeths' competitive hyper-articulateness seems to come more naturally to them now. Always balanced on a razor's edge of affection and aggression, this studied cleverness is what allows them to continue to communicate with one another.",

  "fullText": "Other Desert Cities Rachel Griffiths and Thomas Sadoski play siblings in an affluent, fractious family that has a troubled history in this Jon Robin Baitz drama.\n\nAll family reunions should be this satisfying. Having spent months apart and suffered losses that might have leveled a less resilient clan, the Wyeths of \"Other Desert Cities\" have reassembled on Broadway at the Booth Theater, and absence and adversity (as they're supposed to but so seldom do) have made them closer than ever. This means they have even more power to nurture, delight and wound one another and, not incidentally, move to tears anyone who visits them.\n\nFollow @NYTimestheater for theater news and reviews from Broadway and beyond.\n\nFrom left, Stockard Channing as Polly, mother of the Wyeth family in “Other Desert Cities”; Stacy Keach as Lyman, the father; and Thomas Sadoski as Trip, the son.\n\nThere was much rejoicing when this Jon Robin Baitz play had its premiere Off Broadway at Lincoln Center in January. It was not only the most thoroughly integrated and sustained work from Mr. Baitz, who had been regarded as a promising wunderkind for long past his sell-by date. This witty, deeply enjoyable family drama also had a five-member cast of top-flight virtuosos. Expectations were that the show would beat a fast path to Broadway with its marvelous cast intact.\n\nBut the wheels of New York show business grind slow. And by the time little details like a theater to appear in had been worked out for a transfer, the production had lost its flashiest stars, Elizabeth Marvel and Linda Lavin. And there were worries the show might also have lost its momentum and the accumulated interest on all that buzz from last season.\n\nYet \"Cities,\" directed with a masterly combination of shadow and shimmer by Joe Mantello, emerges as stronger, more sincere and more credible in its Broadway reincarnation. There were whispers last winter (though not from me) that as pleasurable as \"Cities\" was, it had more sparkle than substance, and that the members of the affluent, fractious family it portrayed didn't seem to share the same performance styles, let alone the same blood.\n\nThis new version should silence those objections. With Rachel Griffiths and Judith Light assuming the roles originally played by Ms. Marvel and Ms. Lavin — and Stacy Keach, Thomas Sadoski and a peerless Stockard Channing having only grown in theirs — \"Cities\" is now less of a showoff than it was, and its ensemble more of a piece. It has, in other words, settled comfortably into its own skin, which makes its characters' discomfort all the more palpable.\n\nHigh anxiety, of that virulent strain that erupts at Christmas when grown children visit their parents, is what fuels \"Cities,\" which is set in the desert-toned, tastelessly tasteful digs of Lyman and Polly Wyeth (Mr. Keach and Ms. Channing) in Palm Springs, Calif., in 2004. (John Lee Beatty designed the spot-on set.)\n\nLyman, a former movie star and former United States ambassador (during the presidency of a kindred spirit, Ronald Reagan), and Polly (who shares the behind-the-velvet-curtains powerfulness of Nancy Reagan) have chosen to live here in luxurious exile. There are aspects of their past they would rather not be reminded of, though it is hard to forget them with Silda Grauman (Ms. Light), Polly's sharp-tongued sister, in residence.\n\nAnd now, as a special holiday treat, here comes Brooke (Ms. Griffiths), the Wyeths' daughter, a depressive writer bearing the manuscript of a memoir about what Mom and Dad don't want to remember. Though their youngest child, Trip (Mr. Sadoski), a television producer, is present, it's their absent son — a Weather Underground-style political revolutionary who killed himself decades earlier — who looms largest at this gathering.\n\nMr. Baitz has always specialized in demon parents (\"The Substance of Fire,\" \"A Fair Country,\"), and at first it appears that Lyman and Polly are but the latest additions to that gallery. But Mr. Baitz is looking deeper and more clearly into Mom and Dad than he did before. He's not just giving the devils their due; he's also suggesting that they may not be all that satanic.\n\nOne of the virtues of \"Cities\" on Broadway is that it lets Polly and Lyman take center stage in a way they couldn't before. That's because Ms. Marvel and Ms. Lavin were giving intense star performances that hijacked your attention. Ms. Marvel's Brooke was a kamikaze daughter, forever on the attack and on the verge of explosion. As Silda, a wisecracking alcoholic, Ms. Lavin was a meticulously carved font of salty wisdom, a lovable truth teller even when her character was being dishonest.\n\nMs. Light dares to be less than lovable. A deteriorating coat hanger for David Zinn's bargain-rack look-at-me costumes, her Silda is a burnt-out case, scrawny, bitter and ill. When Polly says, \"Families get terrorized by their weakest member,\" you look at Ms. Light and know exactly what she means.\n\nAs portrayed by Ms. Griffiths (\"Six Feet Under\") in a beautifully modulated Broadway debut, Brooke is more conspicuously fragile now. Her careful, straight-back posture is that of a reed that might snap if it bends. Her resistance to her parents' charm is obviously hard won. And with her thorned passivity, she's a walking case of emotional blackmail.\n\nA New York Mets knuckleballer reveals a love of Haruki Murakami and red velvet cake.\n\nSpain took so long to rejoin Europe, only to find its future tethered to German wishes again.",
