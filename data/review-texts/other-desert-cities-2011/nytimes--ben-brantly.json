  "bwwExcerpt": "'Cities,' directed with a masterly combination of shadow and shimmer by Joe Mantello, emerges as stronger, more sincere and more credible in its Broadway reincarnation... The Wyeths' competitive hyper-articulateness seems to come more naturally to them now. Always balanced on a razor's edge of affection and aggression, this studied cleverness is what allows them to continue to communicate with one another.",
