  "bwwExcerpt": "There's 'Dead Accounts' and then there's 'No Accounts', which is a more apt title for this dramatically lifeless play in which there's no accounting for structure, theme or purpose. There is, however, lots of ice cream and a dazzling central performance from Norbert Leo Butz. But no ands, ifs, or buts about it: the play is DOA.",
