  "bwwExcerpt": "Katie Holmes is ideally cast in 'Dead Accounts.' Not because she's that Katie Holmes, but because the fresh-faced star effortlessly projects the Midwestern virtues of honesty and moral integrity that scribe Theresa Rebeck celebrates. These values are kicked around in an amusing if aimless way in this comedy about a rogue hero (the perfect role for Norbert Leo Butz) who throws himself on the family bosom after behaving badly in New York. Rebeck opens up some smart arguments about old-time values in a modern world, but these circular conversations are too shallow to rock the boat.",

Lionsgate distributed that pic day-and-date, and it earned about $11 million on VOD — one of the biggest successes in simultaneous release strategies.\n\n“Every time a movie actually works on a day-and-date model, then I think the flip side of the argument is going to be ‘Should it have gone out on a traditional method?’ ” Taylor said of criticism that “Arbitrage,” a film he repped, should have had a more traditional release strategy. “I think you would have had to triple or quadruple your P&A spend to go out on a traditional method … and I’m not sure you would have done any better.”\n\n“More than likely, if an enterprising distributor stood up and said, ‘Don’t go day-and-date, I’ll give you a legitimate theatrical release with a real minimum guarantee and P&A commitment, I’m guessing you would have taken it,” Ortenberg added. “But nobody did.”\n\nExclusive Media recently purchased a minority stake in home entertainment shingle Millennium Entertainment. The experience, according to Sinclair, has helped teach him the importance of knowing the strategies of companies like Redbox and Walmart.\n\n“If you’re in the business that I’m in, in creating films, you have to know what they’re wanting, what it is they’re thinking. If we sell the film to Tom, ultimately (it’s going to them).” Sinclair said.Panel, moderated by Akin Gump partner John Burke, was also asked what percentage of the budget presales need to cover to leave indie producers on good footing. The general consensus: 60% to 75%, which includes tax incentives, would not leave filmmakers scrambling for too much equity. Only 40%, Sinclair pointed out, and you’re in trouble.\n\nPanelists also pointed out the benefits of social media, both in defraying marketing costs and promoting art house pics.\n\n“Not to say you don’t need to do TV spots or newspaper spots,” Taylor said. “(Digital convergence) should help level the playing field.\n\nAs a California consumer, you have the right to opt-out from the sale or sharing of your personal information at any time across business platform, services, businesses and devices.
