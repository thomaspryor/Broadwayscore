  "bwwExcerpt": "Given the many outstanding plays that premiered Off-Broadway last month and really deserve to be seen (including Samuel D. Hunter's 'The Whale' and Christopher Durang's 'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike'), it's depressing to have yet another insubstantial, uneventful and pointless play by Theresa Rebeck on the stage…Rebeck offers just a tiny sliver of a plot, undeveloped characters and a few themes that are superficially explored…The real attraction of 'Dead Accounts' is seeing Katie Holmes in her first professional gig after deserting Tom Cruise. Oddly enough, she only has a supporting, rather uninteresting role as Butz's homely-looking, stressed-out sister.",
