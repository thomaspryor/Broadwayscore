  "bwwExcerpt": "...how did Holmes and a bushel of theater talents, including director Jack O'Brien, take a wrong turn into this slim screech of a sitcom, a scattershot slice of stereotypical life with characters as unbelievable as they are unlikeable? Written on commission by a theater in Rebeck's hometown of Cincinnati, the script pretends to embrace Midwest over New York values but flattens both into insults...On the plus side, audiences coming to see a miscast Holmes will be introduced to Norbert Leo Butz. The actor, actually the star of the play, does yet another of his nonstop hyperactive eccentrics with which he won Tonys in 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' and 'Catch Me If You Can.' Sure, he starts at manic and revs up from there. If he seems to be working too hard this time, notice, please, how little there is to push against him.",
