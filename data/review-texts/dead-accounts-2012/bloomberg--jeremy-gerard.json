    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic describes the show as 'phoned in' and compares it to bad TV sitcoms, clearly negative language. However, this is only one excerpt, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, describing the show as 'phoned in' and likening it to a TV sitcom, which implies a lack of depth or quality. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is negative, comparing the show unfavorably to a TV sitcom. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the tone is clearly critical. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a clear dismissal of the show as uninspired ('phoned in') and formulaic (comparing it to a mediocre TV sitcom), indicating the critic does not recommend it. Score reflects the lower end of the Negative bucket given the strongly negative language in this single available excerpt.",
