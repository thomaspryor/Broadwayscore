  "bwwExcerpt": "As scenery and the stage floor glide, it's as though the audience is pulled along with Anna toward the gleaming palace and a new life. We're there with her. And just like that, this splendid revival emerges as majestic and intimate simultaneously...O'Hara more than delivers in her sterling star turn. She conveys Anna's feistiness and fair-mindedness in her acting and silky singing...You believe that Anna knows of romance when she sings 'Hello, Young Lovers'...Japanese star Ken Watanabe...gives O'Hara plenty to play off as the proud Siamese monarch...Watanabe's appealing take is looser and lighter. His English is a work in progress, so sometimes his lines and lyrics are blurry. It sort of works for a story of cultural collisions and changing times. O'Hara and Watanabe share warm chemistry, and when Anna and the king clasp each other tight for the joyous 'Shall We Dance?' no words are needed.",
