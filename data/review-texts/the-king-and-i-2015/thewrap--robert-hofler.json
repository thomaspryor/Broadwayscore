  "bwwExcerpt": "..Sher once again reveals the musical's own enormous qualities without imposing an arbitrary interpretation...right from the opening of 'The King and I,' we know we're in the same confident hands when the glorious Kelli O'Hara takes the stage...In fact, if anything in this revival shakes up our preconceptions of 'The King and I,' it's that Anna must undergo almost as much re-education as the king (Ken Watanabe). Plus, O'Hara's Anna is nearly as headstrong as he...Watanabe doesn't dominate the show like Brynner. He's regal, but he's also far more vulnerable, and as performed here, he wills his own death, almost as if a suicide. Seven years, it's too long to wait for another reunion of Rodgers and Hammerstein, LTC, and Sher.",
