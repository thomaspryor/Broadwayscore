  "bwwExcerpt": "Sher's vision subtly augments tradition, with lifelike details of the new world in which Anna Leonowens finds herself...As Anna, O'Hara is a terrific fit, with an exquisite, melting soprano as well as dignity and quick wit. Ken Watanabe...is a captivating actor, blazing-eyed and sharp as he portrays the virile character's single-mindedness, playful side and the childlike temper of one who has never been contradicted...Watanabe's diction could occasionally be clearer, his singing more confident and his bearing imbued with more gravity. For her part, although O'Hara builds a rich, likeable character, she does not sound quite as vocally lush as she did last season in 'The Bridges of Madison County.' Still, as they find their ideals in conflict, they make worthy adversaries, and also find real chemistry. Watanabe and O'Hara enchantingly convey the sparks of intelligence and will that bring their characters together...This remains a production in which all aspects have been satisfyingly thought out, and a work that stands the test of time.",
