  "bwwExcerpt": "You can't overstate how stunningly beautiful, how achingly well sung this new revival of 'The King and I' is...Kelli O'Hara...gives yet another finely calibrated performance as the 'I' of the title. Her warm, occasionally bemused poise makes her a fine fit for Anna Leonowens...The music is simply divine. The cast appears to be just as transported as we are, their voices ringing with heartfelt emotion. And yet we're one element short of perfection -- and that's the king. Watanabe...cuts an imposing figure but plays the ruler broadly, overemphasizing a comic petulance that leaves little room for stately gravitas...There's not even a hint of a romantic spark with Anna...But so strong is the rest of this show that, even with a relatively weak performance by the king, you're still getting the royal treatment.",
