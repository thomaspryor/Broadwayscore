However, this appears to be a brief excerpt which limits confidence in capturing the full critical assessment. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language ('gorgeous', 'sumptuous', 'fresh and relevant') indicating an enthusiastic recommendation without reservations. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"gorgeous\" and \"sumptuous\" and states that the revival honors the original while feeling fresh and relevant. | Kimi: Unqualified enthusiastic praise using superlatives ('gorgeous', 'sumptuous') and noting the production feels 'fresh and relevant' indicates a strong recommendation despite the brevity of the text. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
