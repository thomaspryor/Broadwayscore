  "bwwExcerpt": "Now comes The King And I, in one of the most elegantly beautiful and beautifully sung productions I've ever seen, and the Beaumont looks like a living treasure chest for a director with the right vision and a company that can command a vast space and make it feel like your living room...Sher and his collaborator in dance Christopher Gattelli honor the originators of these shows while breathing fresh life into them...O'Hara is supremely comfortable in these R&H roles of independent-minded women in extraordinary predicaments, whether Ensign Nellie Forbush or Anna Leonowens. Her singing seems effortless and her Anna is determined yet tender...Watanabe...is strong, sexy and bewildered in a role forever owned by Yul Brynner. It takes a long time for this King and Anna to generate real electricity, but when it comes, in 'Shall We Dance?' it's shiver-inducing.",
