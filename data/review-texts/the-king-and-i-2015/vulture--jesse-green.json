  "bwwExcerpt": "...the revival that opened tonight...is too beautiful to miss...Sher's production is the frankest, and sexiest, I've ever seen. It is also the saddest...The degree to which you want the characters to acknowledge and act on their attraction is a bit of a shock, considering the personal and cultural implications...It takes extraordinary acting and singing to build and sustain such moments. No surprise that O'Hara handles the singing easily; she has perhaps the most naturally beautiful voice on Broadway. But Anna also gives her the opportunity to dispense with the niceness that has sometimes threatened to flatten her stage persona. She has a terrific sparring partner in Watanabe...Though he's occasionally unintelligible, I never failed to understand him, and his conception of the king as a complicated blend of spoiled teenager and spiritual striver made a more convincing case for him than I've previously experienced.",
