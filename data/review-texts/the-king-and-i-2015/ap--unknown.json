  "bwwExcerpt": "There's an opulent, almost operatic feel to this production...Five-time Tony Award-nominated O'Hara...gives a warm, loving persona to young widow Anna Leonowens, who must navigate sexism and cultural differences to get along with the capricious king...O'Hara is perfectly suited to her role as a prideful Englishwoman, and sings rapturously throughout the show, especially on her poignant renditions of 'Hello, Young Lovers.' Watanabe...delivers a layered performance despite some difficulties enunciating English...His king is, by turns, mischievous and morose, and generally commanding except for some distractingly childish moments...Watanabe is quite natural in the role, and creates a pleasing chemistry with O'Hara as their characters establish a friendship despite obstacles...If you can accept the king's personality quirks, this production of 'The King and I' is definitely something wonderful.",
