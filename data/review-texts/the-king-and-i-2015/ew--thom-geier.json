The original rating of 87 supports a high score within the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The critic uses positive language like \"sumptuous\" and \"visual feast\" and states that the show \"mostly delivers on its promise,\" indicating a strong positive recommendation. The original rating of 87 supports this classification. | Kimi: The critic's own 87 rating and descriptors like 'sumptuous revival' and 'visual feast' indicate enthusiastic praise with only minor reservations ('mostly delivers'), placing this firmly in the Rave category.",
