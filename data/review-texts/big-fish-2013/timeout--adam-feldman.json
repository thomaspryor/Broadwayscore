  "bwwExcerpt": "Big Fish feels like the show that got away. Adapted by John August from his own 2003 screenplay, the musical is built around the tall-or at least well-stretched-tales of an Alabama-born traveling salesman, Edward Bloom (Butz), who has a penchant for embellishing his life...Yet the show is hobbled by a major flaw: Andrew Lippa's thoroughly mediocre score. The music suggests a cross between familiar, inflated Broadway pop and 1970s AM radio; the lyrics vacillate, sometimes line to line, between banal colloquialism and stiltedness... Big Fish has lovely sequences, and earns some sniffles at the end. But it could have been a real catch",

The final line 'could have been a real catch' implies disappointment with what it is. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some positive aspects, such as 'lovely sequences,' but criticizes the score as 'thoroughly mediocre,' suggesting a mixed verdict with both strengths and weaknesses. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like \"lovely sequences\" and emotional impact, but criticizes the score as \"thoroughly mediocre\" and the lyrics as inconsistent. This suggests a mixed experience. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges 'lovely sequences' and an emotional ending but identifies the score as a 'major flaw' that hobbles the show, suggesting it failed to reach its potential.",
