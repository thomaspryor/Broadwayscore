  "bwwExcerpt": "Norbert Leo Butz, as Edward, is as charismatic as ever in this father-and-son fable, based on Tim Burton's 2003 film about a traveling salesman who tells far-fetched stories...The two-time Tony winner leaps, swaggers and sweats his way through more than two-and-a-half hours of fair-to-middling show tunes with enough visual spice to keep us engaged, if not quite tapping our fingers along in our armrests....Where 'Big Fish' gets stuck in the shallows is with its score, by Andrew Lippa ('The Addams Family'). A brash musical demands you leave the theater wanting to buy the cast recording, or at least humming a song. 'Big Fish' doesn't, though 'Be the Hero,' which bookends the production, is catchy enough, in spite of its been-there-heard-that message: you should 'be the hero of your own story.",

Mixed assessment with no clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review praises Norbert Leo Butz's performance and the visual elements but criticizes the score for lacking memorable tunes. The overall tone suggests engagement but with significant reservations about the music. | Gemini: The review praises Norbert Leo Butz's performance but criticizes the score as \"fair-to-middling\" and not memorable, leading to a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and lack of clear recommendation lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises Norbert Leo Butz's charismatic performance and visual elements but criticizes the score as fair-to-middling and unmemorable, resulting in a neither-here-nor-there assessment.",
