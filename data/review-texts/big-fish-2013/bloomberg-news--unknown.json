  "bwwExcerpt": "I doubt Broadway has ever seen a prettier, more sensuously kinetic musical than Susan Stroman's adaptation of 'Big Fish' set to music by Andrew Lippa ('The Addams Family.') It's enchanting, especially once it slows down a bit to catch its breath. That doesn't happen until the second act, but it won't matter much, even to fans of the Tim Burton movie (or the Daniel Wallace novel that started it all). When the brooding trees begin their laconic dance before morphing into swamp witches, you know you're watching a Stroman show. By then, we've already fallen under the spell of Edward Bloom, Alabama homeboy, teller of tall tales and creaky jokes, absentee husband and father.",
