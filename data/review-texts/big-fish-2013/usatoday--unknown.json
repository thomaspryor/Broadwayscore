  "bwwExcerpt": "When Edward proposes to his future wife, Sandra, hundreds of yellow daffodils sparkle against a clear blue sky.Somehow, though, the effect isn't as dazzling, or as moving, as you would hope -- particularly given the talented players involved in this production, which opened Sunday at the Neil Simon Theatre...Butz, Baldwin and Bobby Steggert, as the grownup Will, all bring a sense of genuine humanity to their roles. In the end, though, this Big Fish lacks the imagination or cohesion to reel you in like one of its hero's yarns.",

The final verdict clearly does not recommend. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a lack of dazzling effect and cohesion, despite praising the actors' performances. The overall sentiment is negative, suggesting disappointment with the production. | Gemini: The review acknowledges talented players but ultimately finds the production lacking in imagination and cohesion, suggesting a mixed experience. | Kimi: While the critic praises the cast's 'genuine humanity,' the final verdict clearly states the production fails to deliver emotionally or cohesively, recommending against seeing it.",
