  "bwwExcerpt": "While acknowledging that the show is about a self-consciously rambling and absurdist hero, the bloated 90-minute Act 1 threatens to derail as visual gags, projections and busy scenes - plus a book that uneasily mixes whimsy and cancer - bombard the senses....Butz proves he's simply in a league of his own, able to switch from middle-aged to teenager in a snap, offering a complex portrait of a Southern man while avoiding good 'ol boy cliches, and he even spends some of the night lying in a hospital bed, not the most expected way to lead a musical. But then there are lots of other fun surprises at 'Big Fish,' including elephant fannies.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt contains significant structural criticism ('bloated Act 1 threatens to derail', 'bombard the senses') balanced by strong praise for Butz's performance ('in a league of his own'). Single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked from a more positive or negative full review. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges both positive elements, such as Butz's performance, and significant negatives, like the bloated Act 1 and uneasy mix of themes. The single excerpt and lack of a clear overall verdict lead to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The review highlights a strong performance by Butz but also points out issues with the show's structure and book. The overall impression is mixed, with both positive and negative aspects. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the bloated first act and uneasy mix of tones in the book, but offers strong praise for Norbert Leo Butz's performance and notes 'fun surprises,' suggesting a mixed verdict that acknowledges significant flaws while finding redeeming qualities.",
