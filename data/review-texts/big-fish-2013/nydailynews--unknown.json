    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed assessment - criticizes choreography as 'pedestrian' and lacks showstoppers, but praises lead casting. With only one curated quote available, the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the choreography as polished but pedestrian, lacking a showstopper. However, it praises the casting of Butz as a winning choice, indicating a mixed verdict with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a mixed assessment, praising the casting of Butz while criticizing Stroman's dances as \"polished but a bit pedestrian\" and lacking a showstopper. This suggests a lukewarm overall impression. | Kimi: The critic criticizes Stroman's choreography as 'pedestrian' and lacking a 'showstopper', but praises the casting choice as a 'winner'. This balance of negative and positive elements places it in the Mixed bucket. Low confidence due to availability of only a single excerpt.",
