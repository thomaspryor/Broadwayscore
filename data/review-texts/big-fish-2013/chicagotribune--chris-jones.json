The language is positive ('heart-warming', 'mostly successful') with strong praise for Butz's performance, but 'earnest' and 'family-friendly' suggest qualified enthusiasm rather than strong recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Norbert Leo Butz's performance and describes the show as 'earnest, family-friendly, heart-warming and mostly successful.' The tone is clearly positive, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is mostly positive, highlighting Norbert Leo Butz's performance and describing the show as earnest and heartwarming. However, the sentence is cut off, so confidence is low. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
