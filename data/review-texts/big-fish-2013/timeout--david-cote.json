    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. While acknowledging significant flaws ('clunky book scenes and overly busy staging'), the review concludes the show 'succeeds' in its core mission, indicating qualified approval rather than a clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges flaws in the book and staging but ultimately finds the show successful in its emotional themes, aligning with the critic's original rating of 60. | Gemini: The review acknowledges both positive and negative aspects, with the critic finding it a 'heartfelt meditation' but also noting 'clunky book scenes and overly busy staging.' This indicates a mixed reaction. | Kimi: The critic's provided rating of 60/100 places this firmly in the Mixed range. While the review concludes the show ultimately 'succeeds' as an emotional meditation, substantive criticisms of 'clunky book scenes' and 'overly busy staging' prevent a clear recommendation.",
