  "fullText": "New musical's opening night party fetes tall actors, tall tales\n\nBroadway musical “Big Fish” is all about fathers and children and tall tales, so it was hard not to talk about all those things at the show’s opening night party at Roseland Oct. 6.\n\nMost of the cast is notably tall, too, but none are tall as Ryan Andes, the 6’4″ (and then some) actor who plays Karl the Giant on two-foot stilts. His own tall tale — true, he swears — is that his grandfather, Keith Andes, opened a show at the very same theater (then the Alvin, now the Neil Simon) in 1960, starring as Lucille Ball’s leading man in “Wildcat.”\n\nAfter the opening night perf, lead thesp Norbert Leo Butz didn’t want to spill any of his own tall tales. “All the ones I know are dirty!”\n\n“But with my own daughters — I have three, the oldest is 16 — I try to do text-speak with them,” he said. “I’ll text one of them, ‘YOLO, it’s yo popz,’ and they’re like, ‘Dad! So embarrassing!'”\n\nJohn August, who wrote the screenplay of the 2003 movie as well as the book for the musical, has an eight-year-old daughter but saves the stories for the screen. “Some of these songs are older than she is!” he said.\n\n“Big Fish” is August’s first musical, and there are lots of differences between writing a movie and penning a stage musical. The biggest? It’s not just actors who perform the show.\n\n“With this, Andrew [Lippa, the composer] and I had to perform the musical 100, 150 times for producers to show what we’d got,” he said. “I’ve sung these songs. I wasn’t a singer. But I am now!”",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Resisting the usual Broadway tendency toward over-production, this show is perfectly scaled to the modest level of Edward's boyish daydreams. Invention, not excess, seems to be the dominant house rule, from the tight choreography, which is quick and clever and never over the top, to the primary-color projections by Benjamin Pearcy that make a comic-book universe of Julian Crouch's sets. William Ivey Long captures the playful vibe with ingenious costumes that move in unexpected ways (like the fishtail of a mermaid's silvery costume) and contribute their own magic to the storytelling (like the witches that materialize from the trees in a forest). The main thing missing from this show - and might have taken the edge off its unlikable hero and unpalatable message - is the mystical sensibility that flavors Southern storytelling. Although supposedly set in Alabama, there's not a hint here, musical or otherwise, of the traditional magic found in regional folktales. The kind of magic that might transform a selfish character like Edward Bloom into the hero of his own dreams.",

The lack of 'theatrical footing' suggests a negative verdict. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive elements (performance, score) but ultimately states the adaptation \"never finds its theatrical footing,\" indicating a negative overall assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is medium. | Kimi: While the critic praises the lead performance and score, the verdict that the show 'never finds its theatrical footing' constitutes a clear recommendation against seeing the production.",
