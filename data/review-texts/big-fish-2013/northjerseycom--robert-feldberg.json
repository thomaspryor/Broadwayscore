  "bwwExcerpt": "As the sequences of Edward's fantasies play out, however, the father-son story is frequently lost in the whimsicality rather than enhanced by it. It's only near the very end, when Will learns what Edward has accomplished and comes to appreciate the value of a man telling stories, that all the elements properly converge.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows structural criticism about story elements not converging properly until the very end, suggesting uneven execution despite acknowledging some payoff. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt indicates that the whimsical elements often overshadow the core father-son story, suggesting a mixed experience. The positive note about the convergence at the end suggests some redeeming qualities, but overall it points to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests that the show has issues with its narrative structure, but ultimately finds some redemption towards the end. This indicates a mixed reaction. | Kimi: The critic indicates the father-son narrative is overwhelmed by whimsy for most of the production, only converging properly near the end, suggesting significant structural issues.",
