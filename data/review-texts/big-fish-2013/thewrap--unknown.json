  "fullText": "Very early in the new stage musical “Big Fish,” director Susan Stroman delivers a splashy ensemble number, “Be the Hero,” that effectively introduces us to many of the fantastical characters we know from Tim Burton’s 2003 film version and the original novel by Daniel Wallace.\n\nThe difference, however, between seeing them onscreen or reading about these mythic figures is that when they’re forced to sing and dance right off the bat with no introduction, there’s a distinct feeling of the wrong kind of déjà vu.",
