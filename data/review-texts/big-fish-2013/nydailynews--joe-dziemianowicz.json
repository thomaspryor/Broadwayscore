    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Excerpt criticizes choreography as 'pedestrian' and lacks showstoppers, but praises casting Butz as a 'winner.' Single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked criticism from a more positive review. | GPT-4o: The review highlights a lack of standout moments in the choreography, describing it as 'polished but a bit pedestrian'. However, it acknowledges a positive aspect in the casting of Butz. The mixed tone and lack of a clear recommendation suggest a mixed review. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a mixed assessment, praising the casting of Butz while criticizing Stroman's dances as \"polished but a bit pedestrian\" and lacking a showstopper. This suggests a show with both strengths and weaknesses, placing it in the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: While criticizing Stroman's choreography as 'pedestrian' and lacking a 'showstopper,' the reviewer explicitly calls the casting a 'winner' and uses 'Lucky for us,' indicating the strong lead performance justifies seeing the show despite staging limitations.",
