  "bwwExcerpt": "There's a huge gap between what you see and what you hear in 'Big Fish.' Visually speaking, this new Broadway musical is inventive, playful and often downright magical. But then, we expect nothing less from director Susan Stroman, the whiz behind 'The Producers' and 'The Scottsboro Boys.' Unfortunately, Andrew Lippa's score is a hack job stringing one banal non-tune after another. Every time Broadway takes one step forward musically ('Matilda,' 'Once'), it takes two back with safe, witless junk like this. Those who heard Lippa's disposable contribution to 'The Addams Family' can't say they weren't warned.",
