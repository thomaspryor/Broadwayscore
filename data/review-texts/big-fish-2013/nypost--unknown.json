  "bwwExcerpt": "There's a huge gap between what you see and what you hear in 'Big Fish.' Visually speaking, this new Broadway musical is inventive, playful and often downright magical. But then, we expect nothing less from director Susan Stroman, the whiz behind 'The Producers' and 'The Scottsboro Boys.' Unfortunately, Andrew Lippa's score is a hack job stringing one banal non-tune after another. Every time Broadway takes one step forward musically ('Matilda,' 'Once'), it takes two back with safe, witless junk like this. Those who heard Lippa's disposable contribution to 'The Addams Family' can't say they weren't warned.",

The overall verdict is clearly negative despite visual strengths. | GPT-4o: The review praises the visual aspects but heavily criticizes the score as 'hack job' and 'banal non-tune', suggesting the overall experience is not recommended. | Gemini: The review praises the visuals and direction, but strongly criticizes the score, calling it a \"hack job\" and \"safe, witless junk.\" This indicates a negative overall assessment despite the positive aspects. | Kimi: While praising Susan Stroman's direction as 'magical' and 'inventive,' the critic devastatingly pans Andrew Lippa's score as a 'hack job' and 'witless junk,' suggesting the poor music undermines the visual strengths of this musical.",
