Despite the caution about the pacing, the overall tone is clearly positive. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the musical as \"prettier\" and \"enchanting,\" indicating a positive recommendation. The phrase \"sensuously kinetic\" further supports this assessment. | Kimi: The critic offers high praise for the show's visual and kinetic qualities ('prettier, more sensuously kinetic'), calling it 'enchanting,' though with a specific reservation about the first act's pacing before the positive verdict cuts off.",
