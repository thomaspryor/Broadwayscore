    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Pan) - using median score | Claude: Excerpt lists multiple serious criticisms (poor songs, slow pace, failed comedy, clumsy structure, ugly set) comparing unfavorably to source material. However, single excerpt warning requires caution - this could be from a longer mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a strongly negative evaluation of the production, criticizing the songs, pacing, sentimentality, humor, structure, and set design. The tone suggests a deep dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of the show. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly negative, citing poor quality songs, slow pace, clumsy structure, and an ugly set. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the content points to a negative assessment. | Kimi: The single excerpt delivers comprehensive condemnation of the production's music, pacing, humor, structure, and design using harsh descriptors ('ugly', 'clumsy', 'fail to land'), indicating a strongly negative pan. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Pan",
