This suggests a qualified positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's intention and theatrical appeal but frames it as a 'saving grace,' suggesting mixed feelings overall. The tone is neither fully positive nor negative. | Gemini: The review identifies the show as a \"feel-good musical\" and its \"saving grace,\" indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
