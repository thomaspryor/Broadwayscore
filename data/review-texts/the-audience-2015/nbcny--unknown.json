  "bwwExcerpt": "Polished visual images aside, we have less a personal sense of Queen Elizabeth than we do so many members of American political 'royalty.' How often do we ever even hear Elizabeth's voice? Through a variety of often workaday anecdotes over two-plus hours, Mirren fills in the blanks, crafting a portrait of a tough and empathetic woman who has survived thanks to personal warmth, good humor and a profound sense of duty.",
