  "bwwExcerpt": "Aside from giving the redoubtable Helen Mirren another chance to essay Queen Elizabeth II - a necessarily reclusive character with whom this actress is now so closely allied that the two verge on a coalition, with Mirren doing all the talking - Peter Morgan's 'The Audience' succeeds because it intuits the heavy price a monarch must pay in a constitutional democracy... Daldry, like Morgan, knows how to mix the serious and the flashily theatrical, and thus 'The Audience' is neither dull nor dry... It's a coup de theater of the old school, and watching Mirren seem to peel off years and cares is nothing short of a dazzling experience.",
