  "bwwExcerpt": "Yet in Peter Morgan's play, which is deftly directed by Stephen Daldry and gorgeously designed by Bob Crowley, the subtle transformations are just as compelling as the grand ones, thanks to a consummate performance by the lead actress. This is Mirren's show, and she fully lives up to the expectation created by the buzz from her Olivier Award-winning turn in the West End production of the play in 2013.",
