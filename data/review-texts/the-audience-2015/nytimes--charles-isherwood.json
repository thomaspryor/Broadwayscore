  "fullText": "That’s the implicit — and for royalty-worshiping Anglophiles, thrilling — promise of “The Audience,” Peter Morgan’s history-skimming chat show about a monarch and her prime ministers, which opened on Sunday night at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater. Yes, that most private of highly public figures, Queen Elizabeth II, is currently receiving visitors on Broadway.\n\nWhat’s more, her celebrated majesty is being embodied by the same majestic celebrity who won an Academy Award for portraying her on screen: Helen Mirren, who picked up a mantelpiece’s worth of prizes for playing Elizabeth in the 2006 film “The Queen” (which had a screenplay by Mr. Morgan). Even if she’s not the real royal deal, this is still about as close as most of us are going to get to a cozy tête-à-tête with the best loved of the regal Windsors.\n\nThe possibility of privileged access to the glamorously inaccessible is one of the greatest marketing lures there is these days. (Check out any newsstand or bookstore.) And “The Audience,” staged with intimate stateliness by the pedigreed director Stephen Daldry and the designer Bob Crowley, is offering a sort of two-for-one bargain in that regard.\n\n“The Audience” not only provides the illusion of observing, firsthand, how Queen Elizabeth operates behind the scenes, as she meets with British prime ministers from Winston Churchill (Dakin Matthews) to David Cameron (Rufus Wright) in weekly sessions of which — the script assures us — only the two participants know what really happened. The show also allows the smashing Ms. Mirren to demonstrate her quick-change virtuosity in becoming the queen at different ages, from 1951 to the present, before our very eyes.\n\nThose transformations, accomplished with sleights of hand worthy of a master magician, are probably the most entertaining and satisfying aspects of “The Audience.” It is somehow deeply reassuring to see Ms. Mirren, who turns 70 this year, step back in time as Elizabeth and persuade us that she is whatever age she wants to be. Such time-defying ease feels appropriate to the portrayal of a national ruler perceived as all but immortal.\n\nYou can also expect a lively and expansive tutorial on a number of subjects, including the constitutional monarchy of Britain (and the role of the queen in government), the central crises — political and personal — during Elizabeth’s reign, and the provenance of paintings and furniture in rooms at Buckingham Palace and Balmoral Castle.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",
