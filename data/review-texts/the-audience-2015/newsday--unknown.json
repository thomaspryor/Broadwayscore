  "bwwExcerpt": "What could have been an acting stunt is instead a rich, deep portrait of a woman who, somehow, is deeply revealed without giving much of her mysterious self away. Mirren, her legs demurely crossed at the ankle and hands folded, expresses layers of depth with just a tilt of her head. Neither a Shakespearean tragedy nor a fairy-tale fantasy, the poignant power of this royal story comes from its extraordinary ordinariness.",
