  "bwwExcerpt": "With its nonlinear format, the play was bound to be choppy. Some scenes are more dramatically charged than others, and some characters are more fully developed. There is also no overall conflict or plot. But taken as a whole, 'The Audience' is a fascinating meditation on the historic and present day role of the English monarch. Mirren, whose recent film credits include 'The Hundred-Foot Journey' and 'Hitchcock,' capably handles the challenging role, constantly altering her appearance while conveying the Queen's firm respect for tradition, a sympathetic ear and a witty sense of humor.",
