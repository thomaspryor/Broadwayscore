  "bwwExcerpt": "To the surprise of exactly no one, Helen Mirren is absolutely terrific as Queen Elizabeth II in 'The Audience'... The physical transformation itself is a lot of fun - how can you not see something that happens right in front of your eyes?! But it pales compared with the way Mirren switches roles from an established, aging ruler to a young woman - not yet crowned - who holds her own against a colossal statesman swinging his weight around. The voice is more girlish, the body language less confident, but the will and character are already there.",
