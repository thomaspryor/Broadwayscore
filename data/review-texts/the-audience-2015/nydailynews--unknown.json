  "bwwExcerpt": "Helen Mirren is so good as Queen Elizabeth II in 'The Audience' that the star of stage, film and TV never needs to worry about a scene being stolen from her. Effortlessly and consistently commanding and composed, Mirren can't be upstaged. She's the jewel in this crown. Still, her portrait never quite ascends to that elusive level of transcendence - or indelibility... Don't blame Dame Helen. The Broadway star vehicle she's driving lacks the high-octane fuel to take her there, even though it's stylishly directed by Stephen Daldry and eloquently designed by Bob Crowley.",
