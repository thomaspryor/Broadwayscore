  "bwwExcerpt": "It's why Mirren and Morgan have to spend all of act two trying to reestablish some audience empathy with a figurehead who barely registers as a human being despite Mirren's valiant efforts to distract us with several quick-costume changes. If you've seen Mirren in 'The Queen,' also written by Morgan, there's no reason to see 'The Audience.' Princess Diana provides the dramatic conflict that drives the movie, and her presence is sorely missed in the play, where's there's absolutely no dramatic conflict.",
