Single excerpt makes full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a 'patchy production' but praises performances by Odenkirk and McKean. The mixed signals and lack of a clear recommendation suggest a mixed review. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review states that the production is \"patchy\" but praises Odenkirk and McKean. The overall impression is mixed, with some good elements but significant flaws. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production as 'patchy' and finds the main characters ('winners') disappointing with 'nothing new to show us,' while praising specific performances (Odenkirk, McKean, and the 'losers'), indicating a mixed assessment with significant reservations.",
