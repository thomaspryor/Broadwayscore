  "bwwExcerpt": "Dialed to a slightly lower register, the delicacy and intricacy of the language here lands with a punch whose impact comes on the subway ride home. “Glengarry Glen Ross” is a part, now, of our shared canon; a production that sheds light by emitting slightly less noise allows its performers to probe all its contours, and to make it fresh for a new audience.",
