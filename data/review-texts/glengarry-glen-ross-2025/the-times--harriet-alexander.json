  "bwwExcerpt": "This being Trump’s America, the play hits hard. The casual racism of 1980s real estate — “Patel? Ravidam Patel? How am I going to make a living on these deadbeat wogs?” — is deeply uncomfortable. Remember Trump’s reference to migrants from “shithole countries”? Real estate offices of the 1980s are, of course, where the president learnt his trade. There is no need to labour the point, though. The play zips along without any overt political ploys. And it doesn’t need them. Mamet’s script is as fresh today as it was 40 years ago and Marber has assembled a cast worthy of its revival.",
