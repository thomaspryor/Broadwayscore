    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Critic calls the revival 'slick but shallow' - praising production values while criticizing substance. This suggests disappointment, placing it in Negative range. Low confidence due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'slick but shallow,' indicating a mixed assessment. The lack of full context and the single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach, leading to a low confidence score within the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The single excerpt available states that the revival is \"slick but shallow\", which indicates a negative assessment. Given the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges technical competence ('slick') but emphasizes a significant flaw ('shallow'), suggesting style without substance. As the only available excerpt from a curated selection, confidence is reduced. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",
