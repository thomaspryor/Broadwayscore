However, due to the lack of full text, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The quote indicates extremely high praise, suggesting a rave review. However, the excerpted nature of the text lowers the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise describing the production as potentially the playwright's best work, indicating a rave recommendation. Confidence is low due to limited available text.",
