    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic explicitly states the production 'never quite makes a successful pitch,' indicating it fails to deliver. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may contain more nuanced assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, indicating the production fails to deliver on its promises. However, with only a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is negative, indicating the production doesn't succeed. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Using a pun on the play's sales-themed subject matter, the critic delivers a clear verdict that the production falls short and fails to successfully make its case, indicating a negative assessment despite the limited excerpt available.",
