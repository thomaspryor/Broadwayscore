    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review acknowledges the show 'works' and 'hooks you in' but concludes it 'doesn't seal the deal' - a clear mixed verdict with both positive and negative elements. Single excerpt warning applies, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the play's strengths in writing and acting but ultimately suggests it falls short of being fully compelling. The single excerpt and lack of a clear positive or negative rating contribute to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The review states the play \"still basically works\" and \"hooks you in\" due to the writing and acting, but it \"doesn't seal the deal,\" indicating a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the production's strengths (taut writing, good acting) and confirms it 'basically works' and 'hooks you in,' but the decisive caveat that it 'doesn't seal the deal' indicates a mild, qualified recommendation at the lower end of the positive range.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "After intermission, the play moves from the Chinese restaurant to the salesmen’s shabby office: plywood in part of the window, rust from a pipe bleeding down an upper wall. (Scott Pask’s sets for both acts are unimprovable, as are his costumes; the pale green shirt under Burr’s brown suit is a miniature triumph.) Culkin’s performance improves in this brighter environment, with greater mobility and action to play, but he’s still all wrong for Roma. When he loses control, there’s no menace to his anger; it’s just a peevish tantrum. To the extent that Marber’s job as a director here is, like John’s, to “marshal the leads,” it is only partly accomplished.",
