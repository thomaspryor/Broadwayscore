    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising ensemble cast as 'brilliant' with 'authenticity and believability' indicates positive assessment, but extremely limited text and potential cherry-picking requires caution and lower confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the ensemble cast's performance, indicating a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment of the review is uncertain, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The single excerpt is strongly positive about the ensemble cast, suggesting a positive overall experience. Given the limited text, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single excerpt provides strong praise ('brilliant') for the ensemble performances, placing it in the Positive bucket per instructions for clearly positive excerpts, though the limited context warrants low confidence.",
