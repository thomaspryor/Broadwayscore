    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative language ('disappointing', 'poorly directed', 'oddly paced') but excerpt is extremely brief and may not represent full verdict. Single excerpt warning applies - setting confidence low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a negative impression of the show, highlighting poor direction and pacing. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"disappointing\" and criticizes the direction and pacing, indicating a negative review. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The sole excerpt offers explicitly negative criticism ('disappointing,' 'poorly directed,' 'oddly paced') and dismisses the playwright's craft as a 'con,' with no positive counterpoints mentioned.",
