    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed sentiment, acknowledging the return of a 'masterpiece' but criticizing it as 'self-defeating'. The lack of full context and single excerpt warning lowers confidence. | Gemini: The phrase \"self-defeating ambition\" suggests a mixed or neutral assessment, as it acknowledges both positive and negative aspects. Given the limited excerpt, a mixed score is most appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges the quality of Mamet's script ('masterpiece') but the phrase 'self-defeating ambition' criticizes the production approach, suggesting the staging undermines itself despite star casting. With only one excerpt available, the full verdict remains unclear.",
