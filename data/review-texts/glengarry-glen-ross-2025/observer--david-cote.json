    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed assessment - acknowledges problems (uneven casting) while noting positive aspects (strong message). With only one curated quote available, the overall verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates uneven casting, which suggests a mixed assessment. The mention of a strong message implies some positive elements, but without more context, it leans towards a mixed review. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests mixed feelings about the casting but acknowledges the message's impact. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges significant flaws in casting but emphasizes that the show's message lands with clarity and impact ('billboard size'). As a single curated excerpt potentially cherry-picked from a larger review, this suggests a mildly positive, qualified recommendation warranting the lower end of the Positive range.",
