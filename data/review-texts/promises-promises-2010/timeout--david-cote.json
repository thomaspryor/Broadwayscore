    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating indicates mixed territory, and the excerpt focuses only on positive performer praise without broader show evaluation - likely truncated text missing the full verdict. | Gemini: The review focuses on Chenoweth's performance and her chemistry with Hayes, but doesn't offer a broader assessment of the show's overall quality. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with a mixed classification. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 60 places this firmly in the Mixed range, and while the excerpt offers praise for the lead performances, it is too brief to suggest a stronger recommendation for the production overall.",
