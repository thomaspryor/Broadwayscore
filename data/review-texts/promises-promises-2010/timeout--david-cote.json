    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this directly at the Mixed/Positive boundary. The text fragment praises the lead performances but appears truncated, lacking overall verdict context. | Gemini: The review focuses on praising Chenoweth and her chemistry with Hayes, but doesn't offer a clear recommendation for the show as a whole, suggesting a mixed assessment. The original rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's original numerical rating of 60 falls squarely in the Mixed bucket (55-69). While the excerpt offers warm praise for the lead performances, the brief length and middling score suggest significant reservations about the production overall.",
