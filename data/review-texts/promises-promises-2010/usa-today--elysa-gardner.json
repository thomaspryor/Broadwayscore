  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Playing the beleaguered corporate climber Chuck  \"C.C.\"  Baxter, the role introduced on stage by Orbach (and on screen by Jack  Lemmon), Sean Hayes has some endearing  moments. But Simon's quaint  zingers stretch the limits of his charm and  comic panache. Kristin  Chenoweth  is cast as the object of Chuck's unrequited affection, Fran  Kubelik, a  drippy damsel in distress who in no way accommodates the  actress'  natural effervescence. Chenoweth does at least manage",
