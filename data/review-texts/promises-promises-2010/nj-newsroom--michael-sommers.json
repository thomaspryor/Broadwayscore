  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Far from being silly on \"Will & Grace,\" an immensely  appealing  Sean Hayes is terrific in a nice guy hero role created by  Jerry Orbach. A  miscast if winsome Kristin Chenoweth creates a few  lovely moments as  Hayes' leading lady but her positive Breck Girl  presence and unwise  tinkering with the script and score throws the show  off balance.\"",
