The phrasing suggests it's worth seeing for the star performances. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the performances of Chenoweth and Hayes positively, indicating a recommendation to see the show. However, the lack of detailed evaluation limits the strength of the recommendation. | Gemini: The review highlights the charm and skill of the leads in tackling the score, indicating a positive experience overall. However, it doesn't express overwhelming enthusiasm, suggesting a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: Brief but clear positive assessment recommending the revival based on the cast's charm and skill with the score, though the brevity limits evaluative depth.",
