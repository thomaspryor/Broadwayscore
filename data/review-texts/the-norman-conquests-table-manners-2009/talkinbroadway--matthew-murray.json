    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'farce of the highest caliber' with appreciation for both craft and humanity. Single excerpt limitation requires low confidence, but the superlative language suggests upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'farce of the highest caliber' with 'maximum comic effect,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is highly positive, calling the show \"farce of the highest caliber\" and praising its comic effect and humanity. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unambiguous superlatives ('highest caliber', 'maximum comic effect') indicating strong enthusiasm, warranting the upper end of the Positive range, though the single-excerpt limitation necessitates low confidence.",
