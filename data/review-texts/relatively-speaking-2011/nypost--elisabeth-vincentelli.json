  "bwwExcerpt": "“comedies” implies humor, wit and gags, and they’re in short supply in the show, flatly directed by John Turturro. Subpar at best, these efforts -- I use the term loosely, because it looks as if nobody tried very hard -- come nowhere near the authors’ best. This is an egregious case of selling your audience short.",
