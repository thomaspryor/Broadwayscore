  "bwwExcerpt": "While it's true that Allen’s one-act is not very good, it is considerably better than the ones written by Ethan Coen and Elaine May that also comprise “Relatively Speaking,” a truly dreadful triple-bill of comedy sketches directed by John Turturro with a pretty strange cast that includes Marlo Thomas and Steve Guttenberg...This is just an old-fashioned, third-rate farce and is hardly worthy of being done on Broadway.",
