    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges positive elements (clever premise, witty dialogue) but delivers a significant criticism that it 'feels more like a lecture than a living piece of theater,' suggesting it fails as theatrical entertainment. With only one excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be setup for a more positive or negative overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges a clever premise and witty dialogue but ultimately criticizes the show for lacking vitality, comparing it to a lecture. This suggests a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like a clever premise and witty dialogue, but ultimately finds the play lacking as a piece of theater, leaning towards a more academic experience. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges a clever premise and witty dialogue, the decisive verdict compares the show unfavorably to a lecture, criticizing its lack of theatrical vitality and life. This represents a clear recommendation against seeing the production. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
