  "bwwExcerpt": "Ms. Lauper, who is better known as a singer than a songwriter, has written the score of 'Kinky Boots' all by herself, and it sounds like it came off a boxed set called 'Cyndi: The Deservedly Forgotten Late-'80s B-Sides.' Jerry Mitchell, the director and choreographer, has done his best to make something out of nothing, but he is incapable of coaxing an interesting performance out of Mr. Sands, who is a good singer and a dull actor. Mr. Porter, more or less conversely, is a good actor and a just-about-adequate singer. Who cares? You won't.",
