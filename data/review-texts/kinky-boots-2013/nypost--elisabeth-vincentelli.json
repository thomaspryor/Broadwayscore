  "bwwExcerpt": "There are few things theatergoers love more than musicals about persistence and self-acceptance. Cyndi Lauper's taken those themes to heart, too, in songs such as 'True Colors,' so it's no surprise that her first score, 'Kinky Boots,' finds her at ease on Broadway. And since Lauper teamed up with book writer Harvey Fierstein, the man behind 'La Cage aux Folles,' rahrah empowerment gushes out of the likable but heavy-handed show as if from a broken pipe.",
