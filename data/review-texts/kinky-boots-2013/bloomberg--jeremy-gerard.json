  "bwwExcerpt": "Based on the genial 2005 film of the same name, 'Kinky Boots' is feel-good theater, a cut above similar recent shows like 'Priscilla, Queen of the Desert' and 'Sister Act.' Lauper's songs are smart and funny, if not always memorable, though Porter kills in 'Sex is in the Heel,' a number that pretty much sums up the show.",
