  "bwwExcerpt": "When it's good, 'Kinky Boots,' the new Broadway musical with the rocking Cyndi Lauper score, is sweetly, vivaciously, irresistibly good. And when it's not so good - well, let's not dwell for the moment on the not-so-good. The show, which opened Thursday night at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre, is the sort of party for which you will be more than pleased to find yourself on the guest list.",

The \"formulaic\" aspect brings the score down. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise, describing the show as 'sweet' and appreciating its ability to be 'both brazen and innocent,' but the explicit 'formulaic' caveat indicates significant reservations that prevent an unqualified recommendation.",
