  "bwwExcerpt": "At first glance, 'Kinky Boots' would appear to contain all the ingredients of a hit musical...So why does this musical, which looks and acts like a crowd-pleaser, still feel so unsatisfying? The biggest problem is that Lauper's electric-pop songs are generic. Furthermore, Jerry Mitchell's production resembles a slick but uninspired rehash of all his earlier shows such as 'The Full Monty' (the working class environment), 'La Cage aux Folles' (flashy drag queens and Harvey Fierstein's one-liners) and 'Hairspray' (a spunky spirit). But there is a saving grace to 'Kinky Boots' and it's Billy Porter, who imbues the role of Lola with fierce diva attitude in a Tony-worthy performance. 2.5 stars",
