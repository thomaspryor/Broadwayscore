  "bwwExcerpt": "Porter ('Dreamgirls') is a force of nature as Lola. Sands ('American Idiot'), in the tamer role, makes Charlie wonderfully appealing. Annaleigh Ashford ('Dogfight') turns her musical lament about choosing the wrong men into a sweet highlight. Andy Kelso is terrific as Charlie's old pal; it's too bad he has just one scene.",
