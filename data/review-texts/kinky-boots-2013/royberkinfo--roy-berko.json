  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'Kinky Boots' is the kind of musical that seeing it once is not enough. The music, the storyline, the humor, the stage excitement makes this a very, very special theatrical experience. The touring production of the show is as good as the Broadway show. This is one staging that deserves a standing ovation, not just the automatic polite Cleveland one, but a real, well-deserved one. Bravo!\"\n\nRead more",
