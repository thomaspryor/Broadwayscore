  "bwwExcerpt": "So, okay, it's not Company-nobody's reinventing the form here. That's all right. What we have, in Kinky Boots, is a well-fitted, well-staged toe-tapper in the contemporary big-Broadway idiom. It's never boring; it's never shocking; you are likely to leave entirely entertained and satisfied. Can't argue with that. The Boy George musical Taboo, which went down some of the same yellow brick roads in 2002, was a somewhat more ambitious show that never cohered; Kinky Boots is clearer, brighter, and much, much better.",
