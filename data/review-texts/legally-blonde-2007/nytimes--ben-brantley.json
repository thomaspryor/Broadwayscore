Given single excerpt warning and mild praise, scoring at lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the musical as 'sweet-tempered' with only occasional flaws, suggesting a generally positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive (\"sweet-tempered\") but qualified (\"only occasionally toe-curling\"). Given the limited text, I'm scoring it at the lower end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers faint praise, describing the show as pleasant but qualified by the concession that it is only occasionally not cringe-worthy, indicating a lukewarm recommendation.",
