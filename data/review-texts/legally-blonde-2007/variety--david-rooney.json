    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt describes show as pleasant but insubstantial ('goes down easily' vs 'cotton candy'). The 'though' signals reservation about depth, suggesting mixed feelings rather than clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as enjoyable but lacking substance, suggesting a mixed impression. The excerpt is limited, so the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"frothy\" and \"goes down easily,\" but also notes it's \"more cotton candy than substantial fare,\" indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring on the lower end of positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers faint praise ('goes down easily enough') but emphasizes the show's lack of substance ('cotton candy,' 'not substantial fare'). Without a clear recommendation to see it and with the metaphor suggesting triviality, this reads as neither endorsement nor rejection, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty.",
