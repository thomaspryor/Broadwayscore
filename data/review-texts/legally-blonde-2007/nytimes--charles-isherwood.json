    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: This appears to be only the opening line of a review. The description could be read as either praise (shiny, peppy) or subtle criticism (demanding of attention like a fame-seeker). Without the full review, the verdict is unclear. | Gemini: The review describes the musical as \"shiny, peppy and demanding of attention\", which suggests a positive, albeit potentially superficial, experience. This leans towards a positive recommendation, but not overwhelmingly so. | Kimi: The brief excerpt describes the show with mildly positive adjectives suggesting energy and appeal, but the text appears truncated and lacks a definitive verdict.",
