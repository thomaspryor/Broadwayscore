    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic acknowledges significant flaws ('don't always measure up to Broadway standards') but ultimately finds the show succeeds in delivering 'genuine entertainment value.' This is a qualified positive recommendation, placing it in the lower end of the Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates that the show is entertaining despite some shortcomings. The positive note on entertainment value suggests a recommendation, but the mention of not meeting Broadway standards tempers enthusiasm. Given the single excerpt warning, the score reflects a cautious, barely positive assessment. | Gemini: The review suggests the show is entertaining despite some shortcomings, indicating a positive but not rave recommendation. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show has elements that fall short of Broadway standards but finds it ultimately succeeds and delivers genuine entertainment value, indicating a qualified recommendation.",
