  "fullText": "Broadway's new jukebox musical is a mess, but with these songs, most audiences won't care\n\nThe Broadway faithful (at least, the part that covers the Baby Boomer demographic ranging from “mature” to “doddering”) will have its mantra ready when cooler heads point out that “Motown: the Musical” is a hot mess. Should anyone note that Berry Gordy’s kissy-face tribute to himself has no shape, depth, thematic point or dramatic continuity, the proper aud response should be: “We don’t care!” And why should any nostalgic music-hound care, when this jubilant jukebox musical comes loaded with great singers, tons of energy, and dozens of classic Motown roof-raisers?\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n There’s More to Rotterdam Than ‘Edgy and Unconventional Cinema,’ Say Festival Heads Vanja Kaludjercic and Clare Stewart: ‘We Want to Be Accessible’ \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n 'Take Me Home' Review: Sundance Award-Winner Paints an Intimate Portrait of a Family in Crisis\n\nEverything about this show is big and brash and in your face, from the reputed $17 million price tag to the 36-member cast, the 20 guys in the pit, and the 60 (or is it 600?) songs from the Legendary Motown Catalog, as it is properly billed in the program. (And you gotta love the chutzpah marketing coup the producers pulled off by scoring a ride to the theater — “imported from Detroit,” as it were — in a showy Chrysler ad.)\n\nThe scribe and his traffic-cop director, Charles Randolph-Wright (along with “script consultants” David Goldsmith and Dick Scanlan), have tried to organize all these moving parts around the final dress for the big blowout held in 1983 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of Motown Records. As the Four Tops square off (with “I Can’t Help Myself / Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch”) against the Temptations (“Ain’t Too Proud to Beg”) in a classic battle of the clans — and with Diana and Michael and Stevie and a bevy of other superstars waiting in the wings for their cues — the event organizers are panicked because the man behind the Motown miracle refuses to show up for his own party.\n\nBerry Gordy (take your bow, Brandon Victor Dixon, but don’t overdo it), meanwhile, is home in L.A., framed by his gold and platinum records and brooding at the injustice of it all, that this tribute should come from the “family” of musicians he discovered, but who deserted him for the big labels once they became famous and wanted to make real money.\n\nIn this bitterly reflective mood, Gordy recalls the beginning of “the dream,” on the memorable day in 1938 when Joe Louis became the first black heavyweight champ and fired his own ambitions. That’s the signal for David Korins’ set (with an assist from Daniel Brodie’s projections) to do its clunky job of transporting Gordy to a series of clumsy book scenes that show Gordy in the most saintly light possible while recounting both the triumphs and setbacks of building Motown Records. (The name, by the way, comes to him in a blush of inspiration as he searches for “something that captures our roots, like The Motor City, but it feels more like a town to me … Motortown … Motortown … Motown.”)\n\nBut there’s no need to dwell on these embarrassing exposition scenes, since nobody really cares how all those lawsuits and countersuits came out in the end. This crowd just wants to watch immortals like Smokey Robinson (Charl Brown), Marvin Gaye (Bryan Terrell Clark) and Jackie Wilson (Eric LaJuan Summers) come sliding onstage in their shiny suits and slick cummerbunds (Esosa gets a golden needle for those costumes) and rock the house. Not to mention grand ladies like Gladys Knight (Marva Hicks, a divinity in her own right), Mary Wells (N’Kenge), and Martha Reeves (Saycon Sengbloh). Or little Raymond Luke, Jr., who does an amazing Michael Jackson.\n\nThe less said about the acting the better. (Diana Ross could sue for defamation for Valisia LeKae’s grisly rendering of her.) But there are some great, big, glorious voices in this show, LeKae’s among them, so it doesn’t seem fair to condemn good singers for being lousy actors.\n\nThe real crime, though, is how frequently the singers and their songs are badly served. Some of the lead-ins to the individual numbers are truly atrocious — the most egregious being the case of erectile dysfunction that for some reason inspires Diana Ross to serenade Berry Gordy with “I Hear a Symphony.” But even when someone knocks a song out of the park, they’re manhandled by Ethan Popp’s arrangements, which tend to chop off a song at the end and leave it bleeding into the next number. Somebody around here should know that Broadway does buttons, not fadeouts. And honestly, people, one simply does not cut off Mary Wells.\n\n(Lunt-Fontanne Theater; 1,507 seats; $147 top)\n\nA Kevin McCollum, Doug Morris and Berry Gordy presentation of a musical in two acts with book by Berry Gordy, based on the book \"To Be Loved: the Music, the Magic, the Memories of Motown\" by Berry Gordy, music and lyrics from the Motown catalog, by arrangement with Sony/ATV Music Publishing.

The review balances significant structural criticism with recognition that the music makes it worthwhile for target demographics. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's messy structure and poor acting but highlights the energy and classic songs that may appeal to audiences. It suggests a mixed experience with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show is a \"hot mess\" with no depth, but ultimately suggests that audiences won't care because of the great music and energy. This makes it a mixed review, leaning slightly positive for fans of Motown music. | Kimi: While the critic harshly criticizes the book, acting, and direction as a 'mess' with 'no shape, depth, or dramatic continuity,' they acknowledge that the classic songs, great voices, and high energy make it an enjoyable experience for the target audience who 'won't care' about the structural flaws.",
