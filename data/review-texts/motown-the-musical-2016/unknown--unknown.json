But who’s coming to see 'Motown' for anything other than the fabulous songbook?”\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt with clear positives but notable reservations. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt describes the show as 'sparkling and enjoyable,' indicating a positive experience despite some reservations ('lumpy'). The focus on the songbook suggests that the entertainment value outweighs the lack of dramatic depth. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"sparkling and enjoyable\" but also \"lumpy\", indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. The truncated nature of the text lowers the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise ('sparkling and enjoyable, if lumpy') for the direction and performances, acknowledging narrative weaknesses but endorsing the show as a vehicle for the Motown songbook.",
