  "bwwExcerpt": "But while there's no denying the quality of the music...the show hangs the hits on a perfunctory storyline...The singers and the hits just keep coming and it seems they and Gordy (played here by Cedric Neal) can do no wrong...Vital plot points are given scant attention making it confusing for those who don't know the story already...Because what people have come for is the music, of course, and the songs are certainly performed with enough energy to get the audience on their feet.
