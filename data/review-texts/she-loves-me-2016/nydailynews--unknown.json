  "bwwExcerpt": "Broadway's bewitching new 'She Loves Me' is as sweet and exhilarating as a first kiss...There's very little that's confused about Scott Ellis' sparkling straight-up staging for the Roundabout. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's score packs yearning and humor as it caresses the ears and heart. The boutique and its colorful characters are brought to life beautifully...'She Loves Me' has its dark plot twists, but the star turns are all bright. Benanti...reminds that she can do anything, given her incandescent soprano and comic timing. The show lifts off when she sings 'Vanilla Ice Cream' and 'Will He Like Me?' Levi...brings good-looking boyish gusto to the catchy title song. Georg's exuberant cartwheel is a cherry on top.",
