  "bwwExcerpt": "She Loves Me is probably the best Broadway musical you've never heard of (unless you're a Broadway nerd). It's an unassuming, Old World charmer, testament to craft, witchcraft and romance that echoes the operettas of Romberg and Friml...and I'm thrilled to say that while I have aged, She Loves Me has not, not one bit. The score remains enchanting...This time the unlikely lovers are played by the infinitely appealing Laura Benanti (ABC's Nashville and a Tony winner for Gypsy) and Zachary Levi (NBC's Chuck), delightful as irritated co-workers in Maraczek's Parfumerie by day, swoony epistolary confidants by night...The team of Scott Ellis (director) and Warren Carlyle (choreography) let the show breathe.",
