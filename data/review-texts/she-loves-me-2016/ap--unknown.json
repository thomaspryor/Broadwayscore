  "bwwExcerpt": "An astounding cast, a nifty story and memorable songs turn this revival into a celebration of classic musical construction. It's worth skipping work to see...Benanti charms from the moment she steps onstage but never coasts even though the role is firmly in her wheelhouse. She's genuinely buffeted by emotions that swing from disgust to fondness, and she is vocally in a league of her own, flawlessly knocking back the near-operatic demands of the part. Levi turns out to be no slouch either. The part requires a singer who can act and has comedic chops, and Levi nails it. He has the unenviable task of immediately following Benanti's triumphant, bed-bouncing 'Vanilla Ice Cream' with the title song and yet he owns the stage as a heel-clicking giddy man suddenly in love. He even does a cartwheel.",
