  "bwwExcerpt": "Exuberance, thy musical name is 'She Loves Me'...The orchestra conducted by Paul Gemignani and the cast led by Laura Benanti, Zachary Levi and Jane Krakowski prove to be scrupulous custodians of the luscious score, and none of them more polished than Benanti. Her Amalia Balash is a worthy successor to the role's originator, Barbara Cook -- and that includes her skill at hitting that gorgeous, high B-flat in the song 'Vanilla Ice Cream.'",
