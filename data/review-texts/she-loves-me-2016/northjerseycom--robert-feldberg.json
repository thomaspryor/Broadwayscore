  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The cast, led by Benanti and Levi, is lively and funny, Ellis' direction is charming, and the story and songs are as fresh and vital as they were when the show debuted. This is a musical about romance that, especially in this production, is genuinely romantic...the show gives everybody in the winning cast at least one number in which to shine...You wouldn't call 'She Loves Me' a dance musical, but it's physically alive...In every theatrical way, 'She Loves Me' is a treat.\"\n\nRead more",
