  "bwwExcerpt": "Levi and Benanti make a winning pair, even if their characters don't realize it until long after everyone else does. Her operatic voice soars in Amalia's most emotional moments, bringing depth to the character's naïveté and yearning for love, when she's wondering about her love interest in 'Will He Like Me?,' awaiting their starcrossed meeting, and, later, giddy over a certain someone bringing her vanilla ice cream. Levi's songs require less vocal theatrics but he manages them well, cranking up the charm throughout but most winningly in the show's title number, which has him bounding across the stage, jumping on benches, and cartwheeling with joy.",
