  "bwwExcerpt": "The Roundabout Theater Company's enchanting Broadway revival of 'She Loves Me' is so charming, you kind of wish it would follow you home. The show is a special triumph for director Scott Ellis...Laura Benanti and Zachary Levi are endearing as the shy lovers in this intimate romantic comedy, the supporting cast (including Jane Krakowski) constitutes a dream team, and the stagecraft is absolutely flawless...In addition to her glorious soprano voice, Benanti has great comedy chops...She's at her best here in a part that has been waiting for her to come along, a part that seems to love her. The songs 'Vanilla Ice Cream' and 'Where's My Shoe?' have her name on them -- and that's that.",
