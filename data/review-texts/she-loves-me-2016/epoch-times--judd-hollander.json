  "showScoreExcerpt": "“While ‘She Loves Me’ was never intended to be a very deep show, there are times when its lack of depth hurts the production...All of the actors do a superb job with the various roles...As for Levi and Benanti, both are quite appealing in their performances and each comes off as extremely likable.
