  "bwwExcerpt": "The production, again directed with tender exactitude by Scott Ellis, now has the unstoppably appealing Laura Benanti and the equally winning Zachary Levi as the warring perfume sales clerks who don't know they're secret pen pals...By no means, however, is this a two-person show. Benanti and Levi are surrounded in the '30s Budapest shop by Jane Krakowski, delightfully adroit as the naughty-and-nice, unapologetically sexual co-worker, Gavin Creel as her dashing cad of a lover and Michael McGrath as the less theatrically assertive but no less essential salesman...And there are plenty of florid operetta demands for Benanti, who wears a role created by Barbara Cook with a lyrical yet sturdy sense of her character's worth and sense of humor.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The production, directed with tender exactitude by Scott Ellis, now has the unstoppably appealing Laura Benanti and the equally winning Zachary Levi as the warring perfume sales clerks...About these songs: They have melodies that tumble against one another as if Bock and Harnick are giddy with the overlapping rush of spirited ideas and dance rhythms from waltzes to the habanera...Nothing is flashy or pushy. Everything is lovely.\"\n\nRead more"
