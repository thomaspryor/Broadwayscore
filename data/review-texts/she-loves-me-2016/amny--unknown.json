  "bwwExcerpt": "I dare you to find a flaw in 'She Loves Me,' Harnick and Bock's intimate, tender-hearted, altogether exquisite 1963 musical comedy/romance...With her superb vocal abilities and comedic instincts and open emotionality, Benanti scores a homerun as the hopeful but staunch Amalia, and the same can be said about Krakowski as Ilona, the gal pal who's been around the block one too many times. Levi...is likable but underwhelming as the hardworking, affable clerk Georg, but that hardly matters. The overall impact of this winning production leaves you teary-eyed and overjoyed.",
