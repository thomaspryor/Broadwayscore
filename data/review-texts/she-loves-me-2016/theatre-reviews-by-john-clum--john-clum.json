  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"This revival is the best production of the show I have seen including the original...'She Loves Me' has a great score, up there with the best scores that the American musical has produced...Laura Benanti sings her gorgeous songs as well as Barbara Cook did fifty-three years ago. That's high praise, but Benanti deserves it...I saw the second preview and was surprised at what good shape the show is already in. It can only get even better. A fabulous production of one of my favorite musicals.\"\n\nRead more",
