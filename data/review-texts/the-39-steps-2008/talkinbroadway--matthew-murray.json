    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('thrilling and hilarious') with clear appreciation for the production's approach. Single excerpt warning suggests caution, but the tone is enthusiastic enough for upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'thrilling and hilarious,' suggesting high praise and a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, calling the show \"thrilling and hilarious\" and praising its approach to the source material. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt displays clear enthusiasm with praise like 'thrilling and hilarious' and 'lovingly send it up', warranting upper Positive range despite limited context.",
