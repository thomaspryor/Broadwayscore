    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Brantley praises the adaptation for exceeding expectations and being 'more substantial' than typical spoof theater, indicating a solid positive recommendation despite the brief excerpt. | GPT-4o: The review describes the adaptation as more than a standard spoof, suggesting a positive evaluation with some depth. However, the lack of strong superlatives or explicit recommendation keeps the score in the mid-positive range. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"cheeky\" and turning a spoof into something more substantial, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The critic praises the adaptation for transcending mere spoof to become a substantial meditation on illusion, indicating a clear recommendation despite the brevity of the excerpt.",
