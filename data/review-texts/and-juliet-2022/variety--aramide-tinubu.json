    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - acknowledges lack of originality but recommends for entertainment value and themes. Low confidence due to single curated quote that may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'incredibly fun and energetic,' suggesting a strong positive tone despite acknowledging it doesn't break new ground. The focus on celebration and energy indicates a positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review states that the musical is \"incredibly fun and energetic\" and celebrates female friendship, which indicates a positive recommendation, though it also notes that it doesn't break new ground, suggesting some reservations. Given that this is a single excerpt, I'm scoring it towards the middle of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('incredibly fun', 'energetic') while acknowledging the show isn't groundbreaking, indicating a solid positive recommendation in the upper range of the Positive bucket.",
