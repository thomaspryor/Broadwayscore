The tone is analytical rather than recommending. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the show's charm, engaging performances, and its appeal to a younger demographic, despite noting its lack of depth. The overall tone suggests it's an enjoyable experience worth seeing. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's flaws and unsubtlety, but ultimately suggests it's an enjoyable experience, especially for its target demographic. The critic highlights the engaging leads and the clever shift in the jukebox musical aesthetic, indicating a positive, albeit qualified, recommendation.",

William Shakespeare still occupies his storied place in high school English classes, but the Elizabethan dude is under attack.
