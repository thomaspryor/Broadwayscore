    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic praises the performances, particularly highlighting the lead's strong delivery, though acknowledges the material is 'slightly tricky.' The single excerpt warning requires conservative scoring within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights strong performances, particularly by Courtney, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, the mention of 'slightly tricky material' implies some reservations, leading to a moderate positive score. | Gemini: The review highlights a strong performance and the absence of bad performances, suggesting a positive experience. However, the mention of \"slightly tricky material\" implies some reservations, placing it in the positive but not rave category.",
