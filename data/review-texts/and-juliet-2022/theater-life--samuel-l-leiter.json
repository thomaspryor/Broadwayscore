  "showScoreExcerpt": "& Juliet is a visual and musical fest whose technical expertise deserves appreciation, even if you sometimes find it banal, monotonous, and unfunny. The cast is extremely adept at making a silk purse out of a sow’s ear (no, Shakespeare didn’t say that), with Queens girl Lorna Courtney (West Side Story)giving a star-making performance as Juliet. An exceptional dancer and awesome singer, she has enough energy to light up the Sondheim even if the lights go out.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges technical merits and praises Courtney's 'star-making performance' but finds the show itself 'banal, monotonous, and unfunny.' Single excerpt warning requires caution - this could be from a more positive overall review. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges technical expertise and a standout performance but also describes the show as 'banal, monotonous, and unfunny.' The mixed tone and lack of a clear recommendation place it in the Mixed bucket. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review acknowledges some negative aspects (banal, monotonous, unfunny) but praises the technical expertise and, especially, Lorna Courtney's performance, suggesting it's worth seeing despite the flaws. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows strong praise for technical elements and a star-making lead performance, but significantly criticizes the material as banal and unfunny, suggesting a qualified recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
