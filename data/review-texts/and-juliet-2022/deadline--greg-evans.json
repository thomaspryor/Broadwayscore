  "fullText": "Lorna Courtney and '& Juliet' cast Matthew Murphy What if Juliet had lived? What if she had not given her 14-year-old life for a wild boy she barely knew? What if she had not let brash youthful narcissism deformed by the patriarchy and male violence overtake her better judgment and lived a full, happy, maybe even quiet life well into whatever passed for adulthood in 14th Century Verona. Directed by Luke Sheppard and choreographed by Jennifer Weber, & Juliet, the new jukebox musical of songs written by super-producer Max Martin (&#8220;and friends,&#8221; as the credits read), with a book by Schitt&#8217;s Creek writer David West Read, posits an answer to all those questions, though &#8220;quiet&#8221; never quite enters the equation. No, had Juliet lived, this musical, opening tonight on Broadway at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre, suggests she and her pals would spend a great deal of their time belting ballads of empowerment and lecturing all within earshot about pride, identity and other important takeaways of the 21st Century. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article1-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid-article\",\"300x251\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[2,2],[300,250],[620,350],[300,251],[501,282],[3,3],[2,4],[4,2],[620,366]]) .exemptFromSleep() .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Related Stories Casting &#039;Just In Time&#039;: Jeremy Jordan To Succeed Jonathan Groff As Broadway&#039;s Bobby Darin",
