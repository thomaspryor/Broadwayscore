    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt suggests the show prioritizes spectacle over substantive storytelling ('less about narrative'). This reads as lukewarm - acknowledging production values but implying narrative weakness. With only one curated quote available, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a focus on the production's strengths in singing, dancing, and staging, indicating a positive view despite narrative issues. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the singing, dancing, and staging, implying a positive experience despite narrative weaknesses. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, and I'm placing it in the lower half of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates the show transcends its narrative weaknesses through strong production values (singing, dancing, staging), suggesting a qualified recommendation typical of jukebox musical reviews. Single-excerpt limitation warrants conservative scoring and low confidence.",
