  "showScoreExcerpt": "& Juliet is a visual and musical fest whose technical expertise deserves appreciation, even if you sometimes find it banal, monotonous, and unfunny. The cast is extremely adept at making a silk purse out of a sow’s ear (no, Shakespeare didn’t say that), with Queens girl Lorna Courtney (West Side Story)giving a star-making performance as Juliet. An exceptional dancer and awesome singer, she has enough energy to light up the Sondheim even if the lights go out.\n\nRead more",
