However, confidence is low due to limited text from curated excerpt that may not represent full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive experience with strong emotional impact ('joyful, healing wonder'). However, due to the single curated quote, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes a positive audience reaction, suggesting an enjoyable experience. Given that it is the only excerpt, I've placed it in the upper end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic language ('joyful', 'healing', 'beautiful') to describe a positive audience response, indicating a solid recommendation. However, as a single curated quote, it may not represent the full review's nuances.",
