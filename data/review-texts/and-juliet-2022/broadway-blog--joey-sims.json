The tone is enthusiastic, aligning with a Positive bucket on the upper end. | Gemini: The review states the show is \"immensely satisfying and just a ton of fun\" and encourages the reader not to resist seeing it, indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: Despite acknowledging the show is 'dumb,' the critic delivers an enthusiastic recommendation with phrases like 'immensely satisfying' and promises the audience 'will have a blast,' indicating a strong positive verdict.",
