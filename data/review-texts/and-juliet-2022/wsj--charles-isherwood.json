    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as 'surprisingly sweet' which is positive, but 'silly' and 'candy-colored confection' suggest lighter entertainment rather than strong praise. With only one curated quote available, confidence is low and score reflects cautious positive assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'silly and surprisingly sweet,' indicating a positive tone. However, the single excerpt warning suggests the possibility of cherry-picking, so the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review describes the show as a \"candy-colored confection\" that is \"silly and surprisingly sweet,\" indicating a positive, though perhaps not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. Given the single excerpt, a mid-range positive score is appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise, describing the show as a delightful 'confection' that succeeds in being 'surprisingly sweet,' indicating a clear recommendation. Score reflects the upper range for a clearly positive single excerpt, with low confidence due to limited text availability.",
