  "bwwExcerpt": "Enter &quot;&amp; Juliet,&quot; a savvy if stunningly unsubtle mashup of a musical from London that aims to redress that balance for Broadway fun and profit. This nonstop party-empowerment show gets its theme of feminist revisionist British history from &quot;Six,&quot; its Shakespearean humor from &quot;Something Rotten,&quot; its nonbinary savvy from &quot;Head Over Heels,&quot; and its collage-like spectacle from &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot;",
