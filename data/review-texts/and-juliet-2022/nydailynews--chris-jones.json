    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls the show 'savvy' and acknowledges its 'fun' factor, but the qualifier 'stunningly unsubtle' suggests significant reservations. Single excerpt from curated quotes limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'nonstop party-empowerment show' with positive comparisons to other successful musicals, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"savvy\" and aiming for \"fun and profit,\" suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. The \"stunningly unsubtle\" comment indicates a reservation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, acknowledging the show as 'savvy' and a 'nonstop party' while criticizing it as 'stunningly unsubtle' and derivative of other musicals, suggesting a mild recommendation.",
