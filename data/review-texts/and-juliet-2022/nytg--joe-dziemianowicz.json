Given the single excerpt warning and positive content, scoring in lower-positive range due to incomplete context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights positive aspects such as 'zippy energy' and 'vibrant visuals,' suggesting an enthusiastic recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning indicates possible cherry-picking, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights the show's \"zippy energy\" and \"vibrant visuals,\" suggesting a positive experience, but without the full review, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt highlights multiple strengths including 'zippy energy,' 'vibrant visuals,' and inventive staging by director Luke Sheppard, clearly indicating a positive recommendation. However, the score reflects the upper end of the Positive bucket per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, while confidence is low due to limited available text.",
