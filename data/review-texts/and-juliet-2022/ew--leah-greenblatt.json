  "bwwExcerpt": "As much as the show feels directed toward a strenuously young demographic - some of them possibly not even born yet when Backstreet were singing about their fire, or their one desire - the script makes several knowing nods, much like a Pixar movie, to the ancient grown-ups in the room. There's something a little relentless about & Juliet's dogged eagerness to entertain, but nakedly joyful too: a violent delight, flipped for the TikTok era. Grade: B+",

The grade of B+ further supports a high positive score. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's flaws but ultimately describes it as \"nakedly joyful\", suggesting a positive, albeit qualified, recommendation. The B+ grade further supports this classification.",
