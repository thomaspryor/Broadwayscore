  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"& Juliet,\" the latest jukebox musical, is a delightful and witty reimagining of Shakespeare’s \"Romeo and Juliet\" told from a revisionist and feminist point of view. The show is wrapped around the song catalog of Max Martin, the Swedish songwriter and record producer who may just be the third most successful practitioner of all time with 25 Hot 100 number-one song hits since 1998, just behind Paul McCartney and John Lennon. These were written with or for such singers as Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Ariana Grande, Pink, Ellie Goulding, Backstreet Boys and Justin Timberlake. \n\nRead more",
