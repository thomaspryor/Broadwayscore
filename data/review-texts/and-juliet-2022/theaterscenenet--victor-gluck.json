  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"& Juliet,\" the latest jukebox musical, is a delightful and witty reimagining of Shakespeare’s \"Romeo and Juliet\" told from a revisionist and feminist point of view. The show is wrapped around the song catalog of Max Martin, the Swedish songwriter and record producer who may just be the third most successful practitioner of all time with 25 Hot 100 number-one song hits since 1998, just behind Paul McCartney and John Lennon. These were written with or for such singers as Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Ariana Grande, Pink, Ellie Goulding, Backstreet Boys and Justin Timberlake. \n\nRead more",

Given single excerpt warning and positive tone, scoring upper end of Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as \"delightful and witty,\" which indicates a positive recommendation. Given that this is the only excerpt available, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise describing the show as 'delightful and witty,' indicating a clear recommendation, though the single-excerpt format and truncation warrant low confidence.",
