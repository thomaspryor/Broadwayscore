Low confidence due to limited text and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights positive aspects like entertaining characters, eye-popping staging, and audience engagement, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as fun, entertaining, and eye-popping, suggesting a positive experience. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is medium. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the show's eye-popping staging, fun characters, and enthusiastic audience response, indicating a clear positive recommendation despite the limited context.",
