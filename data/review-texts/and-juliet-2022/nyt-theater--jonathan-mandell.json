  "bwwExcerpt": ": The Bard takes a back seat to the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears in &quot;&amp; Juliet,&quot; a jukebox musical that is being billed as a sequel to Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; imagining Juliet&#39;s life if she hadn&#39;t killed herself when Romeo did. The plot winds up more busy and berserk than that description, and, in any case, the show is primarily a vehicle for the hits of Max Martin.",
