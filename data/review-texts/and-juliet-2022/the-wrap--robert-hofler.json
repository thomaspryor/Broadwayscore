  "bwwExcerpt": "Luke Sheppard&#39;s direction of his actors effectively showcases many of the more appealing quirks in Read&#39;s characters. When Read&#39;s book turns conventional with the nonbinary May, Sheppard turns on the automatic pilot to strand Sullivan in a swamp of schmaltz. Unfortunately, that sticky morass claims many more victims in Act 2. Why do sophisticated TV and film writers resort to hackneyed tropes when they write for the musical stage? Rather than continuing to lampoon the treacly bombast",
