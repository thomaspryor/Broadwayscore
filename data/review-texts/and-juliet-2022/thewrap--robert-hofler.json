He skewers the genre, especially the female-empowerment theme that has not only dominated the songbook musical but Broadway in general ever since the deafeningly ponderous “Defying Gravity” first brought down the Act 1 curtain of “Wicked” in 2002.\n\nRead’s best creation is Hathaway, especially as played by Wolfe, who brings a wonderfully anachronistic Midwestern hausfrau no-nonsenseness to lampooning her husband’s reportedly misogynistic plot. In the title role, Courtney is also expert at parody, effortlessly sending up every spunky princess weighed down by a Disney tiara.\n\nThe only major character misfire in Act 1 is when Read attempts to deliver a Big Message. While he has no problem sending up feminism and hetero heroes, he turns insufferably sentimental as soon as he introduces a nonbinary character named May (Justin David Sullivan), who quickly becomes a serious threat to Juliet’s new romantic interest, Francois. While it’s fun to see how Read crams “I Want It That Way” and “Baby One More Time” into the storyline, that bulldozing approach turns mawkish when Sullivan sings the Britney Spears hit “I’m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman” without a smidgen of irony. One would have to go back to the Joe Taylor character in “Jagged Little Pill” to find a showcase of such unwarranted bathos. It’s not progressive to treat LGBTQ characters with undue reverence. It&#8217;s patronizing.\n\nThe humor returns near the end of Act 1 when Romeo (Daniel J. Maldonado, subbing for Ben Jackson Walker at the performance I saw) is resurrected from the grave, and “& Juliet” returns to its satiric roots. Maldonado is even better than Courtney at replicating the over-emotive singing style of “American Idol” stars.\n\nLuke Sheppard’s direction of his actors effectively showcases many of the more appealing quirks in Read&#8217;s characters. When Read&#8217;s book turns conventional with the nonbinary May, Sheppard turns on the automatic pilot to strand Sullivan in a swamp of schmaltz. Unfortunately, that sticky morass claims many more victims in Act 2. Why do sophisticated TV and film writers resort to hackneyed tropes when they write for the musical stage? Rather than continuing to lampoon the treacly bombast of most new musicals, writers like Read and Cameron Crowe (“Almost Famous”) fall prey to it. Even the Hathaway character turns into a Celine Dion manqué, right down to the Vegas echo-chamber amplification to deliver “That’s the Way It Is” as some kind of anthem of oppression.\n\nBy the time Szot sings “Everything,” this musical is less kitsch than schlock. And very loud schlock at that. Near the end of the show, the musical numbers under Gareth Owen&#8217;s sound design include what feel like gunshots to enhance climactic chords. The sets and costumes are by Soutra Gilmour and Paloma Young, respectively, and the whole thing looks more than ready for a cross-country tour.",
