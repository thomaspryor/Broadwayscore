  "fullText": "For aficionados of the poster art at Joe Allen restaurant, there is now the Broadway kitsch of seeing Paulo Szot play the very senior member of a boy band in “& Juliet.” This jukebox musical opened Thursday at Broadway’s Stephen Sondheim Theatre after a run on London’s West End.\n\nSzot, an erstwhile star of the Metropolitan Opera, won a Tony for playing Emile de Becque in “South Pacific, and he successfully recycles his French accent from that 2008 revival to play the father of Juliet’s love interest in this new musical with a book by David West Read and hit...",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Luke Sheppard's direction of his actors effectively showcases many of the more appealing quirks in Read's characters. When Read's book turns conventional with the nonbinary May, Sheppard turns on the automatic pilot to strand Sullivan in a swamp of schmaltz.

Praises some performers but condemns the overall execution and sound design as assault-level loud. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the musical for its lack of irony, patronizing treatment of characters, and reliance on hackneyed tropes. Despite some praise for performances, the overall tone is negative, describing the show as 'schlock' and 'very loud schlock.' | Gemini: The review is mixed, praising some aspects like the parody and performances, but criticizing the sentimentality and loudness. The overall impression is that it's uneven, with moments of enjoyment but also significant flaws. | Kimi: While the critic praises several performances and the first act's satirical edge, they ultimately pan the show's second act as 'hackneyed,' 'mawkish,' and 'schlock,' criticizing the book's sentimental handling of the nonbinary character and its surrender to the very tropes it initially satirizes.",
