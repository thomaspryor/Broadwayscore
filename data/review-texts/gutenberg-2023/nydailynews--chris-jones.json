  "dtliExcerpt": "But the reality here is that this is a show relying on two skilled comic actors and their contrasting relationship. These two stars could do this kind of thing in their sleep, should they so choose, and I suspect their challenge will come from messing with each other and keeping everything fresh.",

However, with only one curated quote available, this may not represent the full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the skill of the actors but suggests a lack of challenge and freshness, indicating a mixed impression. The aggregator context supports a neutral stance. | Gemini: The review focuses on the reliance on the two actors, suggesting the show's success hinges on them. The phrase 'could do this kind of thing in their sleep' implies a lack of challenge or depth, leading to a mixed assessment.",
