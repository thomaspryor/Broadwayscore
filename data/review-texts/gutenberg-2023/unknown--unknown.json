The phrase 'far from heinous' suggests it is not bad, but 'not a 100% laugh riot' implies it doesn't fully succeed as a comedy. | Gemini: The review states the show is \"far from heinous\" but also \"not a 100% laugh riot,\" indicating a mixed reaction. The \"rich dish\" comment suggests it can be overwhelming, further supporting a mixed assessment.",
