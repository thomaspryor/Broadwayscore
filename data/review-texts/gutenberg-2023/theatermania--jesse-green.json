However, this is only a single excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as both a 'loving parody' and 'genuinely touching', indicating a positive reception. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive view, highlighting both the comedic and touching aspects of the show. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as both a successful parody ('loving') and emotionally effective ('genuinely touching'), indicating clear approval without reaching the ecstatic superlatives of a rave.",
