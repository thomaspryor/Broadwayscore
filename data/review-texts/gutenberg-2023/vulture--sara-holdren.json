The Musical! before the show even gets underway, and it’s a question the production dances with but isn’t quite able to resolve.",

Given the single excerpt warning and 'Flat' aggregator context, scoring conservatively in mixed range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the production has potential but ultimately does not fully succeed in its execution. The mention of the production 'dancing with' a question it 'isn’t quite able to resolve' indicates a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the production grapples with a central question but doesn't fully resolve it, indicating a mixed or ambivalent assessment. The 'Flat' aggregator verdict reinforces this classification.",
