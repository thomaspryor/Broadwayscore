  "bwwExcerpt": "With Mr. Gad and Mr. Rannells pinballing around the stage under the direction of Alex Timbers (“Here Lies Love,” “Moulin Rouge!”), working up visible sweat as they dash between characters, “Gutenberg!” proffers much comic ingenuity. The silly accents are a delight. Cockney in 15th-century Germany? Why not? Still, even at a fairly pacey two hours the fun eventually turns to wheel-spinning, since the central gag—the ludicrous mismatch between content and form—is established from the start and then",

Mixed assessment with both positive and negative elements. Low confidence due to limited excerpt. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt suggests that while there is some initial enjoyment, the show becomes repetitive and lacks development. This indicates a mixed review, with some positive aspects but significant reservations. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests that the show's central joke becomes repetitive, indicating a mixed or lukewarm assessment. The 'wheel-spinning' implies a lack of development or sustained engagement. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show is pacey and initially fun but criticizes it for becoming repetitive ('wheel-spinning') and failing to develop beyond its initial concept. The excerpt indicates significant reservations about the show's sustainability despite some positive qualities.",
