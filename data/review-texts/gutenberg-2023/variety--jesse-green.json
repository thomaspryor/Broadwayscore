  "fullText": "As backers' auditions go, \"Gutenberg! The Musical!\" — a wildly delusional conceit so full of itself that it boasts two exclamation points — doesn't stand a chance of making it to Broadway. That is, unless it can convince an audience of potential producers that it is witnessing the greatest creation since, well, the printing press.\n\nIt greatly helps that this starry-eyed writer-composer duo from Nutley, New Jersey who are desperately selling their show — emphasis on desperately — are played by Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells, reunited 12 years after their terrific pairing in \"The Book of Mormon.\" It almost makes it all worthwhile — almost.",
