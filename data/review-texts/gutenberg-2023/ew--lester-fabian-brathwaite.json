  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"This is a two-man show that puts on full display just what makes Gad and Rannells such special performers. They're clearly having a great time and hope you are, too. Certainly, other performers could endeavor to make their marks on the roles — and have — but one of the major selling points of 'Gutenberg!' is the 'reunion' of Gad and Rannells. And, boy, do they sell it. Exclamation point.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performers with enthusiastic language ('boy, do they sell it. Exclamation point'), but single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of Gad and Rannells, highlighting their enjoyment and ability to sell the show. The tone is clearly positive, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the strengths of the performers and their chemistry, suggesting a positive experience. The phrase \"boy, do they sell it. Exclamation point\" indicates enthusiasm. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt enthusiastically praises the two leads as 'special performers' who effectively sell the show, indicating a strong positive recommendation based on their star power, chemistry, and evident enjoyment.",
