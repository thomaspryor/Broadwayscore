  "bwwExcerpt": "The musical that is “Gutenberg! The Musical” will never be mistaken for “West Side Story,” but that is really not the point. Brown and King have packed the show with numbers that manage to be both entertaining and as clunky as a ’67 station wagon. And composed a piece that might be a bit more fitting in a cabaret than a Broadway theater. That is, of course, until you secure the services of the cutest couple on Broadway.",
