The lack of a full review text and the mixed nature of the provided quote lead to a medium confidence level. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests that the show's initial appeal diminishes over time, indicating a mixed assessment. The phrase 'wheel-spinning' implies a lack of sustained engagement.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "With Mr. Gad and Mr. Rannells pinballing around the stage under the direction of Alex Timbers (“Here Lies Love,” “Moulin Rouge!”), working up visible sweat as they dash between characters, “Gutenberg!” proffers much comic ingenuity. The silly accents are a delight. Cockney in 15th-century Germany? Why not? Still, even at a fairly pacey two hours the fun eventually turns to wheel-spinning, since the central gag—the ludicrous mismatch between content and form—is established from the start and then",
