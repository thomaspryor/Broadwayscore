  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The only thing wrong with Gutenberg! The Musical! is, as it happens, Gutenberg! The Musical! This isn't as sweeping a statement as it looks, but it points to the problem at the heart of a brash entertainment that wears a forced grin of faux innocence, determined to keep the fun going even as its essential energy runs down. It's an ultra-high-concept comedy, and if the title doesn't make you laugh, steel yourself: You'll be looking for amusement in the action's many sidebars and byways. Sometimes, you'll even find it.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic describes fundamental problems with the show ('forced grin', 'essential energy runs down') but acknowledges occasional amusement. Single excerpt with 'Read more' suggests this may be cherry-picked from a longer review. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt suggests a mixed sentiment, noting the show's forced energy and reliance on sidebars for amusement. The lack of a strong recommendation or discouragement places it in the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review identifies a central problem but also suggests amusement can be found. The tone is mixed, not outright negative. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as wearing a 'forced grin' with energy that 'runs down,' warning audiences to 'steel yourself' unless the title alone makes you laugh, with amusement only occasionally found in 'sidebars and byways.'",
