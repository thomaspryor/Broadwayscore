    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it 'delightfully silly' and praises how it 'makes the most of' its aesthetic choices, indicating clear approval. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'delightfully silly' and praises its aesthetic, suggesting a positive reception. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper range for Positive reviews. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as a \"delightfully silly enterprise,\" which is a positive assessment. Given that this is the only excerpt available, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic language ('delightfully silly') and praises the production's execution, indicating a clear recommendation. Scored at the upper end of the Positive bucket per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, though confidence is low given only one curated quote is available.",
