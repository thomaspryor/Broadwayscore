However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, and the score is set at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the show's humor and the performers' abilities, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers clear praise for the show's humor and lead performances, warranting a score in the upper Positive range per instructions for clearly positive isolated quotes, though confidence is reduced due to limited context.",
