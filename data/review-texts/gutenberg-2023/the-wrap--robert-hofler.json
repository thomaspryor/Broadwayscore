  "bwwExcerpt": "Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells bring a great Oscar-and-Felix chemistry to the stage. They also work tirelessly and exert their considerable charm, but in the end, they’re asking us to be entertained by a two-hander staging of an absolutely dreadful musical. Yes, the songs and the book for this parody of a musical within a musical that is “Gutenberg!” are witless and relentlessly repetitive, which is to be expected from the team of Scott Brown and Anthony King, who gave us one of the worst Broadway",

    "reasoning": "Claude: Despite praising the lead performances, the critic clearly condemns the musical itself as 'absolutely dreadful' with 'witless' songs and book, indicating the strong performances cannot save a fundamentally flawed show. | GPT-4o-mini: The review strongly criticizes the musical's book and songs while only mildly praising the performances, leading to a clear pan recommendation.",
