    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - calls it 'worthy' and says 'fun really takes off' but conditions recommendation on seeking 'daft goofiness.' Low confidence due to limited text and conditional nature of recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a positive view of the second act's fun and chaos, suggesting it is a highlight. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show is \"worthy\" and the \"fun really takes off\" in the second act, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers clear praise for the second act's 'pandemonium' and explicitly calls the show a 'worthy entry,' indicating a solid positive recommendation, though the limited context necessitates low confidence.",
