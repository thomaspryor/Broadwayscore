  "bwwExcerpt": "Putting on my curmudgeon's hat for just a moment, I did find the production to be sluggishly paced at times. Director Adam Meggido is best known for his work in improv theater, but while slapstick may look improvised, it does require precise timing in order to seem unpredictably spontaneous to an audience. Yet, especially in the overlong first act, the humor comes off as forced and repetitive, along with too much of J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan and not enough of the 'Goes Wrong' part. The narrative also incorporates some backstage drama that bleeds into the silly stuff and threatens to sour the fun. That being said, however, if you are looking for a hefty serving of daft goofiness, or if you loved The Play That Goes Wrong and would relish more of the same, you will get what you are looking for in the second act when general pandemonium is the order of the day. That's when the fun really takes off and makes this a worthy entry into the 'Goes Wrong' franchise.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - calls it 'worthy' and says 'fun really takes off' but conditions recommendation on seeking 'daft goofiness.' Low confidence due to limited text and conditional nature of recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a positive view of the second act's fun and chaos, suggesting it is a highlight. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show is \"worthy\" and the \"fun really takes off\" in the second act, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers clear praise for the second act's 'pandemonium' and explicitly calls the show a 'worthy entry,' indicating a solid positive recommendation, though the limited context necessitates low confidence.",
