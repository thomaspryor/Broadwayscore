  "bwwExcerpt": "Mr. Maggido's entire ensemble, similarly, proves as facile as Cornley's is hopeless. Messrs. Shields and Lewis respectively imbue Chris and Robert with a droll haughtiness that only makes the characters' incompetence funnier. Greg Tannahill and Charlie Russell make spry mischief as the energetic dude and coquettish ingenue who play Peter Pan and Wendy Darling, and frolic offstage, and Nancy Zamit nimbly plays a character actress who juggles two more mature roles with that of Tinker Bell - and comes closest to meeting the kind of fate that befell those 'Lord of the Flies' actors.",
