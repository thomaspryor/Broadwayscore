    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The wordplay strongly suggests the critic enjoyed how the show succeeds at its intended comedic premise of theatrical disasters. However, this is only a single curated excerpt, so confidence is low despite the positive tone. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive evaluation through clever wordplay, indicating the show succeeds by intentionally 'going wrong'. The tone is enthusiastic, implying a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates that the reviewer enjoyed the show, stating that it 'goes right by going very wrong'. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers enthusiastic praise for the show's meta-theatrical premise, indicating the production succeeds 'exceedingly well' at its intentional comic failure. Per the single-excerpt warning, scored at the upper end of the Positive bucket.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Scripted by Lewis, Shields and Jonathan Sayer (who plays a forgetful actor fed his lines through an ill-tuned headset), all this farcical insanity would be impossible without inspired design, masterfully directed by Adam Megiddo. Simon Scullion's multi-location turntable set collapses magnificently; Roberto Surace's outfits attain the perfect level of tacky cliché (and rip away nicely on cue); and, finally, lights (Matthew Haskins) and sound (Ella Wahlström) complete the illusion of abject and total mechanical breakdown. You will not find craftier theatrical silliness this season. Not sure I believe in fairies, but groin hits? Definitely.",
