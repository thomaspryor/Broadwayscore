    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show positively achieving its intentional comedic goals ('delivers exactly what it promises', 'gleefully'), but the qualified nature and limited text warrants lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive reception, highlighting the humor and fulfilling its promise. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review states that the show delivers on its promise, finding humor in theatrical catastrophe, which suggests a positive, albeit qualified, recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it in the middle of the positive range. | Kimi: While limited to a single excerpt, the critic clearly endorses the show's successful execution of its farcical premise, praising it as 'gleefully bungled' and effective at finding humor, indicating a solid recommendation.",
