    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises the show's technical precision as 'most impressive' and highlights the cast as 'comedy acrobats,' indicating clear appreciation. However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the precision and impressive nature of the show's demolition aspect, suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the \"precision\" of the show, suggesting a positive experience, but the limited text and the phrase \"most impressive aspect\" implies potential reservations. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: Single available excerpt uses clearly positive language ('most impressive') to praise the show's technical execution and staging, warranting upper-end Positive score per excerpt guidelines.",
