  "bwwExcerpt": "Bang, crash! Watch out for the falling light! Don't stand under that toppling tree! Those trapeze wires don't look very reliable! There should be at least one special Tony Award for Mischief Theatre's Peter Pan Goes Wrong (Ethel Barrymore Theatre, booking to July 9)-not just for its technical brilliance, and the raucous, daffy, side-splitting pleasures it delivers to the audience, but also as a badge of proof that the British may have finally, successfully exported pantomime to America.",
