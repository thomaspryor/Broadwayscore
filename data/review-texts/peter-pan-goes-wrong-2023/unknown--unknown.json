    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified positive assessment - acknowledges the show is 'still funny' but notes diminished impact ('not quite as magical'). Lower end of Positive range due to reservations and single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates that the show is still funny, suggesting a positive experience, but notes a decrease in magic compared to a previous experience. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the show is still funny, but less magical than before. This indicates a positive, but not rave, review. Confidence is low due to the limited text. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates qualified approval—finds humor intact but less impactful than prior iterations, suggesting a mild rather than enthusiastic recommendation.",
