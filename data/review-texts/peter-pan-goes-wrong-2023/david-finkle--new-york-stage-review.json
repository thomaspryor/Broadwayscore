  "bwwExcerpt": "It's a pleasure to report that those of us - our number is growing mightily, especially among kids - arriving primed to find out the answers to these important questions and carloads more won't be disappointed. Lewis, Sayer, and Shields show up (doubling and tripling, like everyone else in the hilarious cast) offering hilarious answers. They've imagined abundantly gratifying fiascos, such as a narrator repeatedly running into trouble when the winch on which he's perched fails to retreat to the wings smoothly, such as a character unable to remember lines that must be fed him through headphones, such as doors failing to open, such as a pirate ship unable to remain level.",
