    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises the ensemble's comedic skill at intentionally bad performances. 'Hilariously' suggests successful comedy, but limited text and potential cherry-picking warrant low confidence and upper positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the ensemble's ability to perform humorously, suggesting a positive view of the performances. However, the limited text and lack of clear overall verdict reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive experience, highlighting the performers' ability to be \"hilariously bad\" in a disciplined manner. Given that this is the only excerpt available, the confidence is low, and the score is in the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic offers clear praise for the performers' ensemble work and comedic discipline. While the excerpt focuses only on the acting, the tone is distinctly appreciative with no caveats present in the available text.",
