  "bwwExcerpt": "I'd feared that Nwandu's intimate three-hander would lose much of its impact going into a big Broadway house. Too often plays performed in large theaters have an audio mush that makes it difficult to decipher from which actor's mouth the words are coming. Fortunately, Justin Ellington's expert sound design solves that problem. In fact, when each of the three actor's sheds his pesky body mic at play's end, Taymor's direction turns it into a witty act of liberation.",
