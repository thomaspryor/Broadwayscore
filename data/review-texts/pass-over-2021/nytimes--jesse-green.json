  "bwwExcerpt": "In rewriting for Broadway, [Nwandu] has gone even further. Not only has she decided to push the play past tragedy into something else, but she has also, in its last 10 minutes, let its innate surrealism fully flower in a daring and self-consciously theatrical way. (The transformation is gorgeously rendered in Wilson Chin's scenic design, Marcus Doshi's lighting, Justin Ellington's sound and even, in their removal, Sarafina Bush's costumes.) Somehow Nwandu gives us the recognition of horror that has informed drama since the Greeks while also providing the relief of joy - however irrational - that calls to mind the ecstasies of gospel, splatter flicks and classic musicals, all of which are sampled.",

The critic seems to appreciate the play's unapologetic nature. | Kimi: The critic praises the play's clear artistic vision and authentic, uncompromising voice, describing it as a 'righteous yell of pain and defiance.' While the tone is strongly appreciative, the extreme brevity of the excerpt necessitates low confidence.",
