  "bwwExcerpt": "Well, while Holliday was alternately woozy and growling, Arianda takes it to a higher pitch. Using a Cyndi Lauperish voice and accent, she laughs loudly and barks even more so. Her emotions are full throttle, whether she's being a child, seductress, or whistleblower. Fortunately, Arianda's got the comic chops to pull this off, especially when she can't think of her own real name or uses her foot to count.",
