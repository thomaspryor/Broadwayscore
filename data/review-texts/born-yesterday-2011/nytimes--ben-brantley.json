    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: This excerpt shows deep appreciation for Arianda's nuanced performance, suggesting skilled acting that goes beyond surface-level portrayal. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall show verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Ms. Arianda's performance, indicating a positive view, but the single quote and lack of full context suggest a cautious, mildly positive score. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a positive aspect of the performance, suggesting a recommendation, but the lack of context makes it difficult to gauge the overall sentiment. I'm placing it in the lower end of the positive range due to the limited information. | Kimi: The excerpt contains specific, admiring praise for Nina Arianda's committed performance and technical skill. Following instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, this falls in the upper Positive range (80-84) with low confidence due to limited context.",
