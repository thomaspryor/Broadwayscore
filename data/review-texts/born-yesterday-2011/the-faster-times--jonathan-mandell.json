  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Still, \"Born Yesterday,\" at 65, need not be retired. It still works when there is the right chemistry among the three principal actors. (It is a measure of how old this play is that its cast numbers 15: hotel staff, advisers, the senator and his wife.) Both Jim Belushi and Robert Sean Leonard are playing familiar characters for them - Belushi (now star of the TV show \"The Defenders\") brash, easily annoyed; Leonard (best-known now for \"House\") intelligent and",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic states the play 'still works' and 'need not be retired', indicating a positive assessment, but the excerpt is too brief and appears cut off mid-sentence to determine the full verdict strength. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the play can still be effective under certain conditions but does not offer a strong recommendation. The lack of a clear positive or negative verdict and the single excerpt warning suggest a mixed review. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the play still works, but the lack of further context and the truncated nature of the text make it difficult to determine a definitive recommendation. It lands in the mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified approval, stating the play 'still works' but emphasizing it depends on cast chemistry; phrases like 'need not be retired' suggest mild rather than enthusiastic endorsement. Single excerpt availability and truncation warrant low confidence. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
