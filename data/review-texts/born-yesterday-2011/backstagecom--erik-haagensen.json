  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Definitely a play of its time, \"Born Yesterday\" moves at a more leisurely pace than contemporary works and is unembarrassed by its idealized political message concerning a democracy's need for an informed citizenry. I hope that won't stop younger audiences from enjoying it. Me, I had a ball.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic explicitly states 'I had a ball' which is enthusiastic personal endorsement. Despite noting the play's leisurely pace and idealized message, the overall verdict is clearly positive enjoyment. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses personal enjoyment ('I had a ball') despite the play's leisurely pace and idealized message, suggesting a strong positive experience. | Gemini: The critic states they \"had a ball\" which indicates a positive experience. However, the reservations about the play being \"of its time\" and moving at a \"more leisurely pace\" suggest a score in the middle of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic expresses unambiguous personal enjoyment ('had a ball') and actively encourages attendance, while acknowledging the play's dated pacing and political idealism. The enthusiastic tone warrants the upper range of the Positive bucket despite caveats.",
