    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises lead performance as 'star-making' with 'comedic timing and surprising depth.' However, only one excerpt available makes full verdict uncertain - confidence set to low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Nina Arianda's performance, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, with only a single excerpt available, the full sentiment of the review is uncertain, warranting a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt highlights a \"star-making performance\" which suggests a strong positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong unqualified praise for the lead performance ('star-making', 'surprising depth'), indicating a clear positive recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits assessment of the full production.",
