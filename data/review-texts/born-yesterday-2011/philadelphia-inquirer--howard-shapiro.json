    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - 'fun enough' is lukewarm but 'serve up on silver platters' suggests strong performances elevate the material. Limited to one excerpt reduces confidence significantly. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as 'fun enough' with a simple plot, indicating a mild positive sentiment. The performances by Belushi and Arianda are highlighted positively, suggesting a recommendation with reservations. | Gemini: The review states the play is \"fun enough\" and praises the performances of Belushi and Arianda, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. The phrase \"serve up Born Yesterday on silver platters\" suggests a high quality performance. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise for the play itself ('fun enough,' 'simple plot,' not a 'laff-riot') but strongly commends the lead performances, suggesting the actors elevate the material. As a single excerpt, this represents a mild, qualified recommendation.",
