  "bwwExcerpt": "\"The play is fun enough -- a simple plot and not what you'd call a laff-riot -- but Belushi, the veteran of Second City, Saturday Night Live and scores of movies, and Arianda, debuting on Broadway after an acclaimed Off-Broadway coming-out last season in David Ives' Venus In Fur, serve up Born Yesterday on silver platters.\"",
