    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performance with 'tour de force' language suggests positive recommendation, but this appears to be a brief excerpt focusing only on one element, limiting full assessment of the production. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"tour de force\" and \"fresh life\" to describe the performance, indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives ('tour de force') to praise the lead performance, indicating strong approval. However, as a brief excerpt focused solely on one performance, it lacks the broader verdict needed for higher confidence or a 'Rave' classification.",
