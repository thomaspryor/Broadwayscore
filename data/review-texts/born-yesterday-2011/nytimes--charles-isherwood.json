In counterpoint comes a rumbling bellow at a volume requiring no help from the electronic listening devices that are almost as ubiquitous as cellphones in Broadway theaters.\n\nBut even the babel of fierce combat between the American theater’s definitive dumb blonde, Billie Dawn (Nina Arianda), and her abusive lover Harry Brock (Jim Belushi), cannot obscure the occasional sound of creaking at the Cort Theater, where a solid but inessential revival of Garson Kanin’s comedy “Born Yesterday” opened on Sunday night.\n\nThe celluloid shadow of the wondrous Judy Holliday, who played Billie in the original 1946 Broadway production and the movie directed by George Cukor, inevitably looms large over any revival of “Born Yesterday.” (Madeline Kahn starred in the only previous Broadway revival, in 1989.) To her immense credit Ms. Arianda, who made a spectacular Off Broadway debut last season as the actress-seductress in David Ives’s “Venus in Fur,” colors this cartoon role with her own set of Crayolas.\n\nWith her luscious pout and sweep of peroxide curls Ms. Arianda banishes Holliday’s pop-eyed, chirpy naïveté to evoke the surly molls of 1930s gangster flicks. Her Billie Dawn, streetwise and complacent in her illiteracy, is like a cross between Jean Harlow at her tough-blondest and the pop singer Cyndi Lauper, with her Queens-bred rasp.\n\nChafing at her bondage to the junk tycoon Harry, who has come to Washington to throw his considerable financial weight around, Ms. Arianda’s leggy Billie prowls their plush hotel suite like an unruly feline, as likely to scratch as to purr. Although she acts the docile girlfriend when Harry is putting on a show for the senator in his pocket (Terry Beaver) and his patronizing wife (Patricia Hodges), Billie gives as good as she gets when she and Harry are alone together.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",

However, as a brief excerpt focused solely on one performance, it lacks the broader verdict needed for higher confidence or a 'Rave' classification.",
