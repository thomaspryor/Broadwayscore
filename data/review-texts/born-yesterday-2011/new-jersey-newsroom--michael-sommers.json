  "bwwExcerpt": "Cynics may feel they're watching an animated civics lesson, but the play's plentiful humor drowns their doubts in laughter. Kanin’s potent mix of mirth and truth is expertly served by Frank Wood as the glib, self-hating attorney, Terry Beaver as the uneasy Senator up for sale and Patricia Hodges as a sporty Congressional matron. Never removing his fedora in the 'cherce' role of the junkman's cousin and slavey, Michael McGrath lopes around like a guy out of Damon Runyon.",
