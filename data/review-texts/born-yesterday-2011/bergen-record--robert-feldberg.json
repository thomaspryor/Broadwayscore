    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Critic acknowledges potential in the material but finds this production only moderately successful with dated elements outweighing positives. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the play is not as effective as it could be, with limited laughs and an overall sense of being outdated. The tone implies a negative assessment, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review suggests the play has some redeeming qualities (\"some laughs\") but is largely dated, indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic finds the production fails to maximize the material's potential and feels dated after 65 years, offering only 'some laughs' amid largely stale results. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
