  "bwwExcerpt": "Definitely a play of its time, 'Born Yesterday' moves at a more leisurely pace than contemporary works and is unembarrassed by its idealized political message concerning a democracy's need for an informed citizenry. I hope that won't stop younger audiences from enjoying it. Me, I had a ball.",
