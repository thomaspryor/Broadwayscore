  "bwwExcerpt": "The sound that you're hearing at the Cort Theatre these days is one of the rarest in the world: It's the collective purr of an audience falling in love with a brand-new face. Nina Arianda made a huge impression on everyone who saw her make her professional stage debut last year in the Off-Broadway premiere of David Ives's 'Venus in Fur.' Now she's playing the not-so-dumb-blonde in a Broadway revival of Garson Kanin's 'Born Yesterday,' the play that put Judy Holliday on the map in 1946 and is going to do the same thing for Ms. Arianda. Ms. Arianda is a charismatic comedienne who is as funny as she is sexy, and anyone capable of resisting her charms is both blind and deaf.",
