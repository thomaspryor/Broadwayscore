  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Doug Hughes (Doubt) doesn't try to goose the 1946 comedy with contemporary perspective. (Anyone who sat through the egregious 1993 screen remake with Melanie Griffith knows that updating this plot doesn't work.) Instead, he lets the play stand on its own idealistic, mid-century terms in its certainty that honesty and Constitutional integrity will always win out over big-money muscle and corporate and political self-interest. Even if many in the audience are likely to roll their eyes and think, 'Yeah, good luck with that,' it's pleasurable to escape into the fantasy of less cynical times.",

While the tone is clearly positive about Arianda's performance, there's no assessment of the overall production, direction, or whether the show itself is worth seeing. Limited to 'low' confidence due to brevity and lack of complete verdict.",

When promoter Bill Graham found out, he ordered the bottles uncorked.\n\nBackup plans.\n Even after his solo album, Standing Hampton, hit it big in 1982, Hagar still didn’t think he would have a long career as a singer, so he got his contractor’s license and invested in apartment buildings. After persuading officials in Fontana, Calif., to let him install sprinklers in a building rather than build a fire hydrant, Hagar started American Fire Chief Inc. It became the second-largest fire-sprinkler company in the U.S.\n\nVan Hating.\n He wants to settle scores with Eddie and Alex Van Halen. He uses the occasional nice word (Eddie was “one of the sweetest guys I ever met”) to stick the shiv in and twist. The brothers are greedy, paranoid and jealous. They are crappy businessmen who only make money when Hagar joined the band, and only occasionally are good businessmen.\n\nBusiness mogul.\n In 2007, he sold 80 percent of Cabo Wabo, the tequila brand he started in the late 1990s, to Campari for $80 million.",
