  "bwwExcerpt": "And then there's Arianda, the play's animating ambrosia and, without a doubt, the most exciting find of the Broadway season. To my regret, I missed her in last season's Venus in Fur, but seeing her now, I understand the already radiant reputation this absurdly talented performer has quickly and justly earned. Channeling just a dram of Judy Holliday's legendary performance-her original Billie's strangled Betty Boop soprano, her ditzy-like-a-fox scene pivots-Arianda takes the physical comedy further, but never too far: Whether she's trying to outrun the train of her peignoir or pouring herself a brimming water glass of gin, she invests everything she touches with comic energy.",

Single excerpt warning applies but the enthusiasm is clear and strong. | GPT-4o: The excerpt offers high praise for Arianda's performance, describing her as 'the play's animating ambrosia' and 'the most exciting find of the Broadway season.' This suggests a strong positive evaluation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses almost entirely on Amanda Arianda's performance, calling her the \"most exciting find\" and praising her talent. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it as positive, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for Nina Arianda's performance using superlatives like 'animating ambrosia' and 'most exciting find,' indicating a clearly positive assessment. However, as a single curated excerpt focused primarily on one performance element, confidence is reduced regarding the overall show verdict.",

Photo: Carol Rosegg/?CarolRosegg A lot’s changed since Born Yesterday opened in 1946. Back then, a heartfelt social comedy could delight audiences for four solid years with wiseacre patriotism, pleasantly pedantic digressions on social justice, and some good-natured knuckle-rapping of thuggish profiteers and the venal Washington politicians who enable them. Writing at the daybreak of postwar American empire, playwright Garson Kanin (who’d go on to pen Adam’s Rib and similarly high-minded stuff) could scarcely have imagined the great betrayals of Vietnam and Watergate, not to mention the unofficial subordination of democracy to a newly deified free market, the Humpty Dumpty splintering of the electorate, the business lobby’s consolidated thrall over know-nothing populism, and the breezy advancement of privatization as a cure-all for the crumbling public trust. But a few things are still the same: The notion of Washington as an open-air farmers’ market of corruption, for example, seems evergreen, as does the indignation of a dazed, buggered American public struggling to both wise up and preserve its innocence. And here’s something that’s thankfully unaltered: the power of a bravura performance to reclaim a classic that’s well past its expiration date, transforming it into a night of (hell, let’s call it what it is) inspirational entertainment. For this reason, I hereby nominate the luminous laugh-goddess Nina Arianda for president, running on the Ditz Savant ticket.\n\nYour product is saved!
