However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be opening setup before a more nuanced assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a negative assessment, describing the revival as a 'disappointment' and failing to capture the original's qualities. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the revival is a \"disappointment\" and fails to capture the original's success, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic explicitly labels the production a 'disappointment' that fails to capture the essential qualities of the original, indicating a clear negative recommendation despite the limited excerpt available.",
