  "bwwExcerpt": "It’s an acting challenge that’s sunk many a decent actress, but rising star Nina Arianda nailed it. With a bow to Holliday’s sweet naiveté, Arianda makes the role her own. She gets a huge assist from costume designer Catherine Zuber, who drapes her fabulously svelte figure in elegantly ostentatious fashion.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance ('nailed it') and production elements (costume design), but single excerpt warning means full verdict unclear. Scored in upper Positive range due to unqualified praise in available text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Nina Arianda's performance and costume design, suggesting a positive view of her role. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence in the overall review sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the positive aspects of the performance and costume design, indicating a favorable view of the production. The phrase \"nailed it\" suggests strong praise. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the lead performance ('nailed it,' 'makes the role her own') and costume design. Per instructions for single clearly positive excerpts, scoring at the higher end of the Positive bucket with low confidence due to limited available context.",
