Strong positive language despite being only an excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the timeliness of the play and the excellence of the production and acting, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"excellent\" and \"couldn't be better or more thrilling,\" indicating a strong positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
