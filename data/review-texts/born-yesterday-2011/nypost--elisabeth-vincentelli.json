However, confidence is low due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses strong enthusiasm for the performances, suggesting a highly enjoyable experience. However, with only one curated quote available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt expresses strong enjoyment, suggesting a positive recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the enthusiasm warrants a higher score within the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt expresses strong enjoyment ('so pleasurable') and an immediate desire to see the show again, indicating clear enthusiasm for the production, though the single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
