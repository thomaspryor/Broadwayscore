  "bwwExcerpt": "The play, which opened Sunday at the Cort Theatre and is directed with calm elegance by Doug Hughes, is riven with '40s sayings - 'Make it snappy,' 'Don't get excited,' 'So long, kid' - and yet has a very relevant, if somewhat, ham-fisted indictment of politics awash in corrupting money.
