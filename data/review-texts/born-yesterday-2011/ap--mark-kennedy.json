  "bwwExcerpt": "The play, which opened Sunday at the Cort Theatre and is directed with calm elegance by Doug Hughes, is riven with '40s sayings - 'Make it snappy,' 'Don't get excited,' 'So long, kid' - and yet has a very relevant, if somewhat, ham-fisted indictment of politics awash in corrupting money. It has a message campaign finance reformers would find swell.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt praises the direction as 'calm elegance' but criticizes the writing as 'ham-fisted.' With only one excerpt available, this mixed assessment suggests qualified appreciation but significant reservations. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt notes the play's relevant message but describes it as 'ham-fisted,' suggesting a mixed reception. The positive note about direction and relevance is tempered by the critique of execution. | Gemini: The review excerpt notes the play's relevance and message, but also mentions a 'somewhat ham-fisted indictment,' suggesting a mixed but overall positive assessment. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the direction as 'calm elegance' and finds the political themes relevant, though qualified by 'ham-fisted' criticism and faint praise ('swell'). Single excerpt availability limits confidence. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
