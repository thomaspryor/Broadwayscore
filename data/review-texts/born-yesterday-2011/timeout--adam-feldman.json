  "bwwExcerpt": "Directed with an elegant touch by Doug Hughes, Arianda’s Billie Dawn is a take-charge dame, carnally aggressive and self-delighted. Clomping around in Catherine Zuber’s exuberant costumes, on John Lee Beatty’s beauty of a set, she’s a sex toy by way of Shirley Booth; this braying, unapologetic bimbo—“I’m stupid and I like it!”—may be a cousin of Jennifer Tilly’s sour Olive in Bullets Over Broadway, but she’s utterly adorable instead of appalling. This is the part that made Judy Holliday’s career, and Arianda claims it all to herself. She succeeds where many would-be Billies, such as Madeline Kahn and Melanie Griffith, have failed: This is the era of a new Dawn.",
