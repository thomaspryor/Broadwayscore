Given the single excerpt warning, the score is near the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"excellent\" and \"better or more thrilling,\" indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise ('excellent', 'couldn't be better', 'thrilling') indicating a strong recommendation for the production and performances. However, confidence is low due to limited available text.",
