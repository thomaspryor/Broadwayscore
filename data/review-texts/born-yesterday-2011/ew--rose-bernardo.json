  "bwwExcerpt": "\"There are very few shows in which the set earns more applause than its top-billed TV stars, but the breezy Broadway revival of the 1946 comedy Born Yesterday is one of them. John Lee Beatty has designed a radiant art deco gem of a hotel suite with gilded fixtures, glimmering onyx woodwork, ruby-red upholstery, and satiny sapphire walls.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with backhanded praise - calling it 'breezy' is positive but noting the set outshines the stars suggests performance issues. Truncated mid-sentence limits full verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the set design as the standout feature, implying that the performances may not be as impressive. The lack of praise for the actors suggests a mixed review, but the positive note on the set design prevents it from being negative. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses heavily on the set design, suggesting it's a highlight of the production. The phrase \"breezy Broadway revival\" indicates a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, sentiment. Given the single excerpt and focus on set, I'm scoring it as mildly positive with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic describes the revival as 'breezy' and lavishes praise on the Art Deco set design as a 'radiant gem,' indicating a clearly positive if design-focused reception.",
