  "bwwExcerpt": "The play is part 'Snooki Comes to Washington,' part 'Pygmalion.' Without a fabulously clever ditz in the tootsie role, however, this can be just a familiar old vehicle that confronts power ethics with the innocence of a sweet old civics lesson.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic makes a conditional statement suggesting the show could work with the right performance but describes it as 'just a familiar old vehicle' and 'sweet old civics lesson,' which carries dismissive undertones. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a lack of originality and excitement, comparing it to a 'familiar old vehicle.' The absence of a standout performance seems to limit its appeal, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review suggests the play's success hinges on the lead performance, implying it could be either good or just a familiar vehicle. This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt characterizes the play as a dated, simplistic vehicle that requires a exceptional lead performance to transcend its 'familiar old' material. The conditional critique and 'sweet old civics lesson' dismissal suggest significant reservations about the production's inherent quality, though it implies the right casting could redeem it. With only one excerpt available, confidence is reduced.",
