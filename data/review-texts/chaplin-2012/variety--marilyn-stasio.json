    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Praises McClure's 'knockout performance' but criticizes the show as 'overstuffed' and trying to 'cram too much' - classic mixed review pattern with positive performer praise but negative structural critique. | GPT-4o: The review praises McClure's performance but criticizes the show for being 'overstuffed'. The tone suggests a balanced view without a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the lead performance as a \"knockout\" but notes the show is \"overstuffed,\" indicating a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers high praise for the lead performance ('knockout') but explicitly criticizes the show's structure as 'overstuffed' and trying to 'cram too much' material into one evening. Without a clear recommendation to see it despite these flaws, this balances between praise and criticism.",
