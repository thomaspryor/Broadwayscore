  "bwwExcerpt": "Chaplin seems to be dragging some ghostly vestiges of its road self. (Under another title, Limelight, it underwhelmed at La Jolla Playhouse.) The first act relies heavily on a creaky film conceit. (We’re supposed to be on a bare soundstage, watching Chaplin’s film of his own life — though the only meaningful sign of this is a recurring slate boy, calling out scene changes.) This frame feels entirely unnecessary; worse, it means the actors have to wear unevenly applied “silent-film” greasepaint.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt focuses entirely on negative aspects: 'underwhelmed' previous production, 'creaky film conceit', 'entirely unnecessary' framing device, and poor makeup application. However, with only one excerpt available, the full review verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt criticizes the production for relying on a 'creaky film conceit' and describes the frame as 'entirely unnecessary,' indicating a negative assessment. The mention of 'underwhelmed' at a previous venue suggests continued issues. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on negative aspects of the production, such as a \"creaky film conceit\" and \"unevenly applied greasepaint.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production's central framing device as 'creaky' and 'unnecessary' while noting technical flaws in the makeup execution, indicating a clear negative assessment of the show's staging.",
