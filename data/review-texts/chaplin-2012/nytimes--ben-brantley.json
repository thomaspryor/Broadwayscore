Most obviously and extravagantly, there’s the first-act finale in which our identity-challenged hero, the pioneer movie star Charlie Chaplin (Rob McClure), finds himself surrounded by dancers dressed, as he is, as the Little Tramp, his on-screen alter ego.\n\nWhile Mr. McClure is often center stage in this sequence, you still have to look hard to distinguish the real from the mock. There are also occasions in which Mr. McClure is hard to spot in a crowd that is not populated by look-alikes. More broadly, though, this sour-smell-of-success story, which features songs by Christopher Curtis and a book by Mr. Curtis and Thomas Meehan, is steeped in a sense that Chaplin the person, as opposed to Chaplin the fabled silent comedian, has gone missing in action, devoured by a swarm of man-eating clichés.\n\nThis is the kind of show in which the leading man says to one of his several leading ladies: “You didn’t want to marry me. You just wanted to marry Charlie Chaplin.” And in which the star’s 11 o’clock number begins with the lyrics, “Once upon a time, I had the world upon a string/Once they stood in line to see my face upon a screen.”\n\nTo the show’s dubious credit, there is no conscious camp in such moments, which were threadbare back in the days of “Valley of the Dolls.” Directed and choreographed by Warren Carlyle, “Chaplin: The Musical” takes itself very seriously as it delivers the unsurprising news that a clown cries. Designed largely in shades of gray by Beowulf Boritt (sets) and Amy Clark and Martin Pakledinaz (costumes), “Chaplin” presents life at the top as “la vie en gris.”\n\nChaplin, of course, took himself seriously. He should have. He was one of the most significant and influential artists in both the history of film and of international stardom. Almost a century after he made his debut in movies, his profoundly wistful Little Tramp remains a recognizable image. Even for those who know that image only out of context, it conjures up an affecting blend of forlorn pathos and comedy triumphant.\n\nAs Walter Kerr wrote in “The Silent Clowns,” describing the 1921 film “The Kid,” Chaplin allowed his audiences “to see and to feel what is realistically distressing about life through the magnifying glass, and only through the magnifying glass, of humor.” Scenes that might read mawkish in other hands feel fresh, piquant and hilariously sad.\n\nKerr goes on to dissect the opening gag in “The Kid,” in which the Little Tramp, finding an abandoned baby in an alley, immediately looks upward to see where it came from. That may not sound funny, but it is on screen. And it is onstage when Mr. McClure skillfully replicates the moment in a moviemaking sequence.\n\nThe laughter that erupts at the Barrymore has relief in it; it’s honest laughter. The same sound is heard during a scene inspired by “The Great Dictator,” Chaplin’s daring 1940 spoof of Adolf Hitler. In both cases, we’re looking through Chaplin’s magic magnifying glass, and its focus hasn’t dimmed.\n\nThe lens through which we see most of “Chaplin,” though, is blurred, as if with Vaseline. In his 1964 autobiography Chaplin made it clear that he had little use for most interpretations of his psyche, whether high-brow (via Freud or W. Somerset Maugham) or low (the gutter press and fan magazines). So I shudder to think what he might have made of the psychiatrist’s couch he’s been plopped on for “Chaplin: The Musical.”\n\nBorrowing from concept musicals of the past several decades — including “Nine,” “Chicago” and “Cabaret” — this production uses the circus (as well as the movies and the nightclub) as a central metaphor. Our first view of Mr. McClure finds him on a tightrope, in Little Tramp drag, while the people who counted in his life call out to him from below, “What’cha gonna do when it all falls down?” They could just as easily be singing the Stephen Sondheim lyric “How did you get to be here?”\n\nIn any case, we soon learn the answers. Flashback! It’s the East End of London at the turn of the 20th century, and little Charlie (the immensely appealing Zachary Unger) is being encouraged by Hanna (Christiane Noll), his loving but mentally unstable mother, to observe the passers-by on the streets.\n\n“Look at all the people,” she sings, in a melody that evaporates as you listen to it. “Then look inside the heart.” She adds helpfully, “There you’ll find the story/And then you can play your part.”\n\nAs it is, Charlie remains haunted — in song and ad nauseum — by the mother he loves but is ashamed of. He soldiers on through many flashbacks, and flashbacks within flashbacks, and movies-within-movies-within-the-musical, marking rungs on the wobbly ladder to the top: the London music hall, the Hollywood of Mack Sennett (an underused Michael McCormick), his own moviemaking empire. It turns out that the whole show is a movie, Chaplin’s story of his life, which he screens for Oona O’Neill (Erin Mackey), his fourth and last wife, and the only one who loves him for himself.\n\nWhat with all this metamovie stuff — and the arty gray color scheme, which extends to the makeup — it’s not always possible to know where you are in relation to time or reality. Yet a stolidly conventional heart beats beneath these airy trappings: a by-the-book rags-to-riches-to-loneliness saga, underscored by vaporous music (which includes, I swear, celestial choruses of “aahs”) and vaguely period dances that go on forever without going anywhere.\n\nThe cast, which includes Wayne Alan Wilcox as Chaplin’s abidingly loyal big brother and Jim Borstelmann as his long-suffering aide-de-camp, mostly gets lost in the mist. A revved-up Jenn Colella, as a nasty, witch-hunting Hedda Hopper, manages to make the sharpest impression, but then meanies often do.\n\nMr. McClure, a relative unknown when he created this role two years ago at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, does a lovely impersonation of the Little Tramp that captures the heartbreaking grace in that character’s embattled dignity. Delivering the anguished lines of the self-destructive egotist that Chaplin became, he perversely tends to fade into the gray. This may be a mercy, given the lines he has to say. It’s hard not to sympathize with the character who tells him, “I miss the days when you didn’t speak.”",
