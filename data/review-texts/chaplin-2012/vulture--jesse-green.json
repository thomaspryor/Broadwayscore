    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Pan) - using median score | Claude: Clear negative assessment stating the musical fundamentally fails at its core purpose, with the critic calling it both bad and pointless. | GPT-4o: The review strongly criticizes the show for missing the essential element of humor, likening it to a meal that fails to nourish. This indicates a fundamental flaw, placing it in the Pan category. | Gemini: The review states that the show 'often is' bad and uses a strong analogy to express its disappointment. | Kimi: The excerpt condemns the show as categorically failing at its essential purpose (being funny) and dismisses it as irrelevant ('beside the point'), representing a total rejection with no positive elements mentioned. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Pan",
