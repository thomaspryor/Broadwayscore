The phrase 'hits more often than it misses' suggests solid approval with some reservations, fitting the upper-middle positive range. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 83 places it firmly in the Positive bucket. The review highlights a strong lead performance and suggests the show is generally successful, with some reservations. | Gemini: The review is positive, highlighting McClure's performance and stating the musical \"hits more often than it misses,\" indicating a recommendation with some reservations. Given the original rating of 83, a score of 79 is appropriate. | Kimi: The critic praises McClure's winning performance and judges the show to succeed more than it fails, consistent with their own 83/100 rating indicating a solid positive recommendation.",
