  "bwwExcerpt": "Whether a broad Broadway public will take to Once is an open question, even if the brilliance of its constituent artistry will surely slay those who most appreciate this form of expression. The music, although beautiful, does not come with the usual tricks. There is neither digital scenery nor spectacle — although I swear I saw the streets of Dublin and the possibilities of the world beyond. This is a show that demands that its audience listen. But then, how can you love if you're not willing to allow someone, something, to be heard?",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Clear positive language ('emotional authenticity', 'magic just happens to be occurring') with enthusiastic tone about the experience, though brief excerpt limits higher scoring. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 suggests a mixed review. The text highlights positive aspects like emotional authenticity and musical intimacy, but the score indicates some reservations or lack of strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review highlights the show's emotional authenticity and intimacy, but doesn't offer a clear recommendation. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 60/100 places this firmly in the Mixed bucket (55-69). While the excerpt praises the show's authenticity and staging, its brevity suggests this is truncated text lacking a clear verdict statement, and the moderate numerical rating indicates significant reservations tempering the positive observations.",
