However, the lack of detailed praise or strong superlatives keeps it from being a rave. | Gemini: The review uses a positive analogy to a good song, suggesting a favorable impression despite the lack of overt enthusiasm. | Kimi: The critic employs an appreciative metaphor comparing the show to a memorable song that lingers, indicating a warm recommendation based on its lasting emotional resonance, though the single-sentence excerpt limits assessment scope.",
