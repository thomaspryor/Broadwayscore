The language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review states that the show \"succeeds\" as a love story and a meditation on music, indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers unambiguous praise stating the show 'succeeds' as both narrative and thematic work, indicating a solid recommendation, though the brief excerpt limits certainty about recommendation strength.",
