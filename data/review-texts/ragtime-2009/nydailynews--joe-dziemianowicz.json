    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic's own 80 rating directly indicates Positive bucket. The excerpt uses strong positive language ('magic', 'intimate and epic') suggesting clear recommendation, so I align with the critic's 80 score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is clearly positive, highlighting the revival's success in capturing both the music and magic of the original. The critic's original rating of 80 supports a strong positive classification. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, using words like \"magic\" and \"epic,\" and stating that the revival \"brings back\" the good qualities of the original. Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic superlatives ('magic', 'epic') and aligns with the critic's original 80 rating, indicating a strong positive recommendation for this revival, though the single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
