  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The work is a masterpiece, performed by a masterful trifecta...This is a play with little action and a lot of talk and it is mesmerizing to watch...After a 23-year absence from the stage, Jackson grabs energetically onto Albee's challenging emotional, intelligent dialogue...This production is the play's Broadway debut, a triumph for the late Edward Albee, for Joe Mantello and the welcome return of Glenda Jackson, authoritative Laurie Metcalf and skillful Alison Pill.\" \n\nRead more",
