  "bwwExcerpt": "Existential dread comes very well-upholstered in the Broadway revival of Edward Albee's dismaying and luxurious Three Tall Women. This is probably Albee's most personal play, a barbed-wire wreath laid at the grave of his adoptive mother, but he has filtered his experience through an absurdist lens. The play's vision of life aligns with Beckett's: darkness on one side, darkness on the other, some pain and disappointment in the middle. 'That's it,' one character says. 'You start and then you stop. Don't be so soft.'",
