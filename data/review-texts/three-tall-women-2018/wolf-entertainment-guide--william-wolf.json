  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Mantello demonstrates that he understands the play perfectly and that he knows how to make the staging sharp, as well as knowing how to highlight the performances of his special cast. Thus this production is an excellent revival, and an example of theater at an exceptionally mature and entertaining level. Jackson is to be welcomed wholeheartedly, Metcalf and Pill also deserve high praise, and although Albee is gone, the cleverness and originality of his work is still with us.\"\n\nRead more",
