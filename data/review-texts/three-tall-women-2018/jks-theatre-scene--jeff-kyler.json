  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"This brilliant masterpiece is the best play I have seen in years...And the same can be said for the entire production of the play, as well...The biggest thrills come from Albee's often hilarious, always sharp, and thoroughly thought-provoking script, some of the tightest direction...and three Tony-worthy star turns by three generations of actresses...A riveting, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, the kind often reserved for the latest roller coaster.
