  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Mantello (The Humans, Wicked) knows his way around this play, finding the action - yes, action - in a work that's mostly, wonderfully talk. He orchestrates the conversation and guides his first-rate cast with an effortlessness matched point by point throughout this production. Miriam Buether's bedroom set design, to pick one example, begins the play as the very illustration of confinement - grand and lovely confinement, but still - before transforming itself into something as expansive as memory.",
