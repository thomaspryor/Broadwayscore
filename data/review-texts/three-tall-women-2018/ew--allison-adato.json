  "bwwExcerpt": "Having its Broadway premiere nearly a quarter-century after its Off-Broadway debut, Three Tall Women is far from an easy evening of theater, despite being a swift, intermission-less hour-and-a-half. In the first act a woman in her 90s (played by Glenda Jackson and identified in the program only as 'A,'), strong of will but failing of mind, is tended to by a woman in her 50s (Laurie Metcalf, 'B') and visited, for vague legal reasons, by a woman in her 20s (Alison Pill, 'C'). The text, by turns poignant and funny, can also be, like Jackson's character, prickly and distant.",
