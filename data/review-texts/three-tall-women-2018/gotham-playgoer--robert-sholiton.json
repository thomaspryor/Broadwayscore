  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Jackson is absolutely mesmerizing. Her embodiment of the indignities of advanced age is painful to see..Joe Mantello's direction is fluid.

I feel that Laurie Metcalf is miscast...I also thought it was a mistake to omit the intermission between acts...My reservations should in no way discourage you from rushing to get tickets. The experience of seeing Glenda Jackson onstage is not to be missed.\" \n\nRead more",
