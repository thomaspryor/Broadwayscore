  "bwwExcerpt": "Everyone going to 'Three Tall Women' at the Golden Theatre hopes for a great revival. Good news: There are actually two. One is the superb new production of Edward Albee's 1994 Pulitzer Prize-winning drama that's been directed with a sure hand and more than a touch of class by Joe Mantello. The other is the breathtaking Broadway reboot of Glenda Jackson, a two-time Oscar winner and four-time Tony nominee who's been away from the New York stage since starring in 'Macbeth' in 1988. Four years later, she traded acting for U.K. politics and just recently returned to performing.",
