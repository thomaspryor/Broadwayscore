  "bwwExcerpt": "In 'Three Tall Women,' the 1991 Edward Albee play finally making its Broadway debut at the Golden Theatre this week, the women are identified very simply: A, B and C. But, oh, such women director Joe Mantello has brought together. Glenda Jackson, making a welcome return to the New York stage after serving in Parliament for 23 years, is A, the 92-year-old (admitting only to 91) grande dame hovering on senility, lashing out at the other two at every opportunity. Laurie Metcalf, hard to miss these days with her recent Oscar nomination for 'Lady Bird' and her return to TV in 'Roseanne,' is B, the put-upon caretaker, and Tony nominee Alison Pill ('The Lieutenant of Inishmore') is C, the lawyer.",
