  "bwwExcerpt": "What the blues are, exactly, is a preoccupying concern in this musical tribute, which opened Thursday at Broadway's Lyceum Theatre. They can be, Joplin tells us at different points, 'a good woman feelin' bad,' or 'the want of something,' or occasionally 'the devil himself.' Speaking these lines, Mary Bridget Davies, who plays the late '60s rock goddess, is utterly credible as a hippie icon, from her alternately blissed-out and earnest vibe to her groovy period costumes (the latter provided by designer Amy Clark). Yet under the direction of Randy Johnson, who also wrote the book, Night offers a distinctly post-American Idol version of the blues. Davies is accompanied on stage by a band and four other spectacularly gifted female vocalists, who alternate as the backing 'Joplinaires' and various artists whose work inspired Joplin's; and the fireworks they provide can border perilously on crowd-pleasing caricature.",
