    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performance with vivid language ('searing intensity', 'makes you believe'). However, this appears to be a brief excerpt focusing only on one element, so confidence is medium due to incomplete assessment of the overall production. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly positive, focusing on the lead performance and its impact. The critic uses strong language like \"searing intensity\" and \"vocal power\" to describe the performance, indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the central performance using superlatives like 'searing intensity' and 'vocal power,' indicating a clear recommendation, though the single-sentence length suggests this is an excerpt from a potentially longer review.",
