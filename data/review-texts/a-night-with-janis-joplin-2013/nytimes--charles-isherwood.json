  "fullText": "The party onstage at the Lyceum Theater, where “A Night With Janis Joplin” opened on Thursday night, turns out to be more crowded than you might expect. This latest in Broadway’s endless stream of boomer-bait musical tributes isn’t just a matter of a big-voiced singer, her backup band and a bottle of Southern Comfort.\n\nMary Bridget Davies, whose positively uncanny vocal impersonation of Joplin keeps the house rocking for much of the show’s running time, is joined by a quartet of talented performers playing famous singers who influenced her style, from Bessie Smith to Odetta to Nina Simone to Etta James. Oh, and let’s not forget the queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, who blazes onstage sporting more feathers than the titular star — no small achievement, given Joplin’s fondness for them.\n\nPerhaps odder still, there are, in a sense, not one but two Janis Joplins present in this celebration of a woman who lived hard and died young. One is the soulful singer who poured her heart, guts and loins into her vocal cords every time she stepped onstage, howling forth her own distinctive blend of rock ’n’ roll and the blues. The other Janis is a friendly and unexpectedly even-tempered young woman from Port Arthur, Tex., who offers us an amiable tour of her upbringing, along with thoughtful reflections about her musical idols.\n\nMs. Davies portrays both sides of Janis, I should add. And while she bears a notable physical resemblance to Joplin, and her speaking voice has the same whisper of a twang and down-home earthiness, I’m a little suspicious of that second character. If the real Joplin had the kind of sensible perspective on her life and career that she exhibits in this show — happily reminiscing about her youthful love of painting, or giving a learned docent tour of blues history — she would probably not have died of an overdose of heroin and alcohol at 27.\n\nInstead — who knows? — she might even today be teaching music at a university, or croaking out jokes on late-night chat shows, or doting on grandchildren.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",

However, the truncated nature means the overall show verdict may be missing, warranting low confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the lead performance as exceptional, suggesting a strong reason to see the show, but it focuses primarily on the performance rather than the overall production. | Kimi: The critic offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performer's intensity and vocal ability, using superlatives like 'searing' and suggesting a transcendent, believable portrayal. However, the text appears to be a brief excerpt focusing solely on one performance element rather than the full production.",
