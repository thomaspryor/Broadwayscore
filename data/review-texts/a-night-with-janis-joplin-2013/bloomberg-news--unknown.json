The heroin-addicted, Southern Comfort-swilling, sexually ambiguous Joplin arrives on Broadway essentially stripped of her rough edges.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with 'exuberant' and 'phenomenally well-executed' indicates clear recommendation. However, single excerpt warning applies - this appears to be cherry-picked positive content, so confidence is medium rather than high. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'exuberant' and 'phenomenally well-executed', suggesting a strong positive impression. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt is positive, describing the show as \"exuberant\" and \"phenomenally well-executed.\" However, the excerpt also mentions that Joplin is \"stripped of her rough edges,\" which suggests a reservation or potential criticism. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive with reservations and low confidence. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
