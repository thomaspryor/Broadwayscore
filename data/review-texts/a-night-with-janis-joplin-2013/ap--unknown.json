  "bwwExcerpt": "Legendary blues and soul singer Janis Joplin was an astounding force of nature onstage and off. A new concert musical on Broadway provides a rockin' good time while imaginatively evoking her impassioned, thrilling talent...Soulful and genuine, Davies gives a lively, energetic performance. She captures much of the exuberance and uniquely raspy wailing that made Joplin a musical legend, though she lacks Joplin's raw onstage sexuality and brash, raunchy persona...With dynamic use of lighting, projections, sound design and the choreography of Patricia Wilcox, Johnson creates a high-caliber spectacle around the compelling story of a uniquely talented singer-songwriter who embodied her generation's passionate attitudes.",

Single excerpt warning applied - this reads as solidly positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the show as a 'rockin' good time' and highlights the energetic performance and high-caliber spectacle, indicating a strong positive impression despite some minor reservations about capturing Joplin's full persona. | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"rockin' good time\", \"impassioned, thrilling talent\", \"soulful and genuine\", and \"high-caliber spectacle\" to describe the show, indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production's spectacle and lead performance, describing it as a 'rockin' good time' and 'high-caliber spectacle,' though the single-excerpt limitation requires cautious confidence.",
