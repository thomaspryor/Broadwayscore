    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the show's music as its core strength. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt is positive, focusing on the power of the music. Given the limited information, a low-end positive score is appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the music as the show's 'real power,' indicating a qualified positive recommendation focused on the score. Confidence is low due to the risk of cherry-picking with only a single curated quote available.",
