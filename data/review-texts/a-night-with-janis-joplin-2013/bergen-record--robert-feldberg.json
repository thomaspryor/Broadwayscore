  "bwwExcerpt": "On a set oddly decorated with clusters of small table lamps, she pierces the air with primal, lung-bursting screams and screeches, storming through such Joplin hits as 'Me and Bobby McGee,' 'Mercedes Benz,' 'Piece of My Heart' and 'Ball and Chain,' as well as a deconstruction of Gershwin's 'Summertime' that's deeply emotional, if barely recognizable. Davies' fervent singing italicizes Joplin's role as a rock pioneer, a strong-willed, free-spirited performer who was as tough and distinctive as the most notable male singers.",
