  "bwwExcerpt": "'A Night With Janis Joplin' is more or less a concert, with some patter in-between the songs that could be called monologues. In these, we learn that Janis's mother was a talented singer in Port Arthur, Texas who decided not to move to New York for a professional career, and thereafter listened incessantly to Broadway albums like West Side Story and My Fair Lady, whose songs Janis memorized. Janis herself at one point wanted to be a painter; her artwork appear behind her. She also read a lot as a child; her favorite was F. Scott Fitzgerald. And she loved the blues, a subject she tells us about with almost scholarly disquisition.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt appears descriptive rather than evaluative, providing biographical context without clear judgment. The neutral tone and lack of recommendation language suggests middle-mixed range, but low confidence due to limited text. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as a concert with monologues, providing context about Janis Joplin's background. Without a clear recommendation or strong evaluative language, it's difficult to classify it as definitively positive or negative, suggesting a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and lack of a clear verdict lower the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers purely descriptive content about the show's format and biographical narrative without providing evaluative language regarding quality, performances, or whether the show is worth seeing.",
