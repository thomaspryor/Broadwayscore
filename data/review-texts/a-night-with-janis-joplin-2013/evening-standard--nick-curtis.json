    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Pan | Claude: The Frankenstein metaphor with 'ugly and obvious' stitching is a devastating critique suggesting fundamental structural problems. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a longer mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses a metaphor that suggests the show is poorly constructed and unappealing, indicating a strongly negative view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single quote available is negative, describing the show as a poorly constructed \"Frankenshow.\" Given the limited information, a negative score is appropriate, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic deploys a devastating metaphor comparing the production to Frankenstein's monster with visible, unsightly seams, suggesting fundamental structural failure. While only a single excerpt is available, the language is unambiguously condemnatory.",
