  "bwwExcerpt": "Where the script goes irritatingly wrong is Joplin's near-lecturing on the blues. 'I got the blues because I don't have my baby,' she says. 'I got the blues because I don't have the quarter for a bottle of wine, I got the blues because they won't let me in that bar ...' Enough. She brings up the blues so much that she wrings the color and potency out of the idea and has you seeing red. Better to let the music do the talking.",
