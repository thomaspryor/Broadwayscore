    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performance with vivid descriptors ('raw, powerful and poignant'), but this appears to be a brief excerpt focusing only on one element of the production. Low confidence due to very limited text. | Gemini: The review praises the performance of Mary Bridget Davies, highlighting her voice and portrayal of the character. This indicates a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic delivers strong praise for the central performance, describing it as raw and poignant. While the excerpt is too brief to assess the overall production quality, the enthusiastic tone regarding the lead suggests a positive recommendation.",
