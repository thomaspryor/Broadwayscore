    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise ('exuberant, phenomenally well-executed') with positive comparison to other shows. Single excerpt limits confidence, but tone is clearly enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'exuberant' and 'phenomenally well-executed', indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the execution but notes the stripping away of rough edges, suggesting a positive but potentially sanitized portrayal. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the show's execution ('phenomenally well-executed,' 'exuberant') while noting it sanitizes Joplin's rough edges. Given only one curated excerpt is available per the warning, confidence is low but the evaluative language clearly recommends the production.",
