    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the lead performance as 'astonishing.' Given the single excerpt warning and the strong praise word choice, scoring in upper Positive range, but low confidence due to lack of full review context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the lead performance, which suggests a positive view of the show. However, the lack of additional context or evaluation of other aspects of the production limits confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The single excerpt is strongly positive about the lead performance, suggesting a positive overall review. Given the limited information, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt uses the superlative 'astonishing' to praise the lead performance, indicating clear enthusiasm. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the upper Positive range (80-84).",
