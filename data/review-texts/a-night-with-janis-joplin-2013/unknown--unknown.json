    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong praise ('astonishing') for the lead performance suggests positive recommendation, but extremely limited text makes full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for Mary Bridget Davies' performance, indicating a positive view of her role. However, the lack of context about the rest of the production and the single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach, resulting in a lower-end Positive score. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is highly positive about the lead performance. Given the limited information, a positive score is warranted, leaning towards the higher end due to the strong praise. | Kimi: The single available excerpt contains strong superlative praise ('astonishing') for the lead performance, indicating a positive recommendation. Following the guidance for clearly positive single excerpts, the score falls in the upper Positive range (80-84), though confidence is low due to limited context.",
