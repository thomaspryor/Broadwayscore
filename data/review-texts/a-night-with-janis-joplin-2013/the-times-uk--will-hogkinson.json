    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Single excerpt describing the show as 'sanitised' suggests disappointment with the treatment of the subject matter. However, with only one curated quote available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, describing the show as 'sanitised', implying it fails to capture the complexity of its subject. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt indicates a negative sentiment, suggesting the show lacks depth and authenticity. Given the limited information, the score is in the negative range with low confidence. | Kimi: The sole available excerpt offers a specific criticism that the show presents a 'sanitised' version of its subject, suggesting a lack of complexity or edge. Given only one curated quote is available, confidence is low, but this criticism indicates a mixed or disappointing assessment rather than an enthusiastic recommendation.",
