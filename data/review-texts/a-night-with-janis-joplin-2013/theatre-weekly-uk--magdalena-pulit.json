    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt uses strong positive language ('triumphant celebration') but is extremely limited and potentially cherry-picked. The qualification 'should be appreciated by fans' suggests some targeting rather than universal recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses the word 'triumphant', indicating strong praise, and suggests that fans of music will appreciate the show. The lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning necessitate a low confidence level. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"triumphant\" which indicates a strong positive sentiment. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strong affirmative language ('triumphant celebration') indicating clear enthusiasm, though the qualification limiting it to 'fans of music' and the single-excerpt format suggest a solid recommendation rather than an unqualified rave.",
