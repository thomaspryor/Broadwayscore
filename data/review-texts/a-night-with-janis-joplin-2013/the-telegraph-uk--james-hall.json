    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the lead performance as 'astonishing' and noting she 'carries the show' suggests positive recommendation, but limited text and potential cherry-picking warrants lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the lead's performance, suggesting a positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of broader context, the confidence is low and the score is at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single quote available focuses entirely on the lead performance, suggesting that this is the primary reason to see the show. Given the limited information, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with a score reflecting strong praise for the lead. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performer's voice and her ability to carry the production, warranting a score in the upper Positive range per the single-excerpt guidance. Confidence is low due to the limited scope of available text.",
