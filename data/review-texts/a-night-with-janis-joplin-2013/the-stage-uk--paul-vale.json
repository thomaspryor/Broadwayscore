Given the warning about cherry-picked quotes and the unqualified positive language, scoring in upper Positive range but with low confidence due to lack of full review context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and vocals as 'stellar' and 'powerhouse', indicating strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is strongly positive, praising the performances and vocals. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive sentiment warrants a score in the upper end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The single available excerpt uses strong positive language ('stellar', 'powerhouse') praising the cast, indicating a clear recommendation, though the limited context prevents higher confidence or a Rave classification.",
