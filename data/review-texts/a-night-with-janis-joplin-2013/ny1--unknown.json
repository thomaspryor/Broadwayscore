However, single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked positive content from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Davies' performance as an 'instant jolt' and 'the next best thing' to seeing Joplin live, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt strongly suggests a positive recommendation, particularly for fans of Janis Joplin. The phrase \"the next best thing\" indicates high praise. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the lead's 'glorious sandpaper voice' and explicitly recommends the show as 'the next best thing' for fans, indicating a clearly positive verdict despite minor reservations about physical resemblance.",
