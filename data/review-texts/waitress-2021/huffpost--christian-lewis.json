  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A somewhat decent musical that is fun, enjoyable, and comedic...May not be a radical musical that challenges the genre as a whole, it does have an important lesson about feminism, empowerment, and sweetness...The musical itself, while filled with hilarious support characters, emotional ballads...still falls somewhat short compared to the other new musicals this season...Quite enjoyable, it just was not exemplary...The songs all sort of melded into an I've-heard-this-before sound.\"\n\nRead more",
