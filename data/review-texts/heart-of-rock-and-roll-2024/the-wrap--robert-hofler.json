  "bwwExcerpt": "Gordon Greenberg directs and Lorin Latarro choreographs, achieving some kind of immortality with all that bubble wrap.

Lee’s wacky rocker, Tamika Lawrence’s un-PC HR director and Billy Harrigan Tighe’s bleach-blond ukulele-playing male bimbo invariably deliver laughs despite the paper-thin material.",
