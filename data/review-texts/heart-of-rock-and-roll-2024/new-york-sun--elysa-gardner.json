The lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach, placing it in the mixed bucket with low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt acknowledges shortcomings but suggests they become assets. Given the limited text, it's hard to gauge the overall recommendation, but it leans towards mixed. | Kimi: The critic suggests the show succeeds by avoiding typical jukebox musical pitfalls, describing its limitations as 'assets of a sort'—qualified but genuine praise indicating a mild recommendation.",
