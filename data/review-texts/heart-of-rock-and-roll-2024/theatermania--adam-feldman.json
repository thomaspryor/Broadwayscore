    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review acknowledges the show celebrates the music but criticizes it for struggling to find its own identity. This suggests neither a recommendation nor a strong discouragement, placing it in mixed territory. Single excerpt warning applies - confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that while the musical celebrates familiar music, it lacks originality or a strong identity of its own. This indicates a mixed review, as it neither strongly recommends nor discourages seeing the show. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the celebration of Huey Lewis' music but also points out the musical's struggle to find its own identity. This suggests a mixed assessment, leaning towards the lower end of the 'Mixed' bucket due to the critical tone. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges the show successfully celebrates Huey Lewis's music, but emphasizes that it fails to develop its own identity or vitality ('struggles to find its own heartbeat'), indicating an uneven, middling assessment rather than a clear recommendation.",
