Single excerpt warning requires conservative scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a nostalgic appeal but lacks strong positive or negative language. Given the single excerpt warning, the review likely falls into a mixed category, with a conservative score due to potential cherry-picking. | Gemini: The phrase \"may indulge your 1980s nostalgia\" suggests a positive but not overwhelming experience. Given the limited text, a score in the middle of the positive range is appropriate.",
