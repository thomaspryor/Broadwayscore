The single excerpt and lack of a clear original rating lead to a conservative score within the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show isn't high art but praises its \"easygoing good spirits\" and \"solid craftsmanship,\" suggesting a positive, albeit not rave, recommendation. The phrase \"it'd be silly to turn up our noses at that\" implies it's worth seeing despite not being groundbreaking.",
