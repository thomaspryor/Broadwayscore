Single excerpt warning requires conservative scoring within positive range. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'warm-hearted' and potentially a 'sleeper hit', indicating a positive reception. The mention of a 'witty book' and 'winning lead performances' further supports a positive recommendation, though the language suggests some reservations about the scale of the production. | Gemini: The review suggests the show is \"ideal fodder\" and a potential \"sleeper hit,\" indicating a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. The limited text and lack of a clear rating from the critic lead to a slightly lower confidence.",
