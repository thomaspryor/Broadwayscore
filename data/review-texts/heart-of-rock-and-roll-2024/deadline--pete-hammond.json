Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review states that the jukebox musical 'works' and is a 'feel-good show', indicating a positive recommendation. The use of 'solid' and 'irresistible' further strengthens this assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as a successful 'feel-good' production with a 'solid book' and 'irresistible' music, indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited single-excerpt context.",
