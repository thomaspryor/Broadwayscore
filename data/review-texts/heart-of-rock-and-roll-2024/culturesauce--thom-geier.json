    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear enthusiasm with 'delight' and vivid positive descriptors, but low confidence due to truncated text with only one line available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'foot-tapping, candy-colored delight', indicating a positive and enthusiastic tone. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is very positive, describing the show as a \"foot-tapping, candy-colored delight.\" Given the limited information, I'm placing it in the upper range of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly positive language ('delight,' 'foot-tapping'), indicating clear enthusiasm for the production. As a single curated quote, it suggests an upper-range Positive verdict, though the limited context prevents higher confidence.",
