'Gets by' suggests adequacy rather than enthusiasm. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the production's strengths in star power and craft but notes that the material feels dated. This suggests a mixed recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like star power and craft but also notes that the material is dated, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic genuinely praises the production's star power and polished craftsmanship, offering a recommendation despite acknowledging that the source material feels dated.",
