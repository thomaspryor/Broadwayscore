    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: The metaphor of a 'treasured family heirloom' lovingly polished suggests appreciation and care in the production, indicating a positive recommendation, though the excerpt lacks explicit evaluative language about performances or overall impact. | GPT-4o: The review uses highly positive language, comparing the revival to a 'treasured family heirloom' that is 'lovingly polished,' indicating a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"shimmering, golden patina\" and \"treasured family heirloom\" to describe the revival, indicating a positive, though perhaps not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs glowing metaphors comparing the production to a lovingly polished, treasured heirloom in the best possible light, indicating unambiguous enthusiasm. However, confidence is limited given the brevity of the excerpt. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
