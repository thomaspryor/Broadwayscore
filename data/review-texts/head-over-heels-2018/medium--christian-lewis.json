  "showScoreExcerpt": "“May be a period piece but it certainly isn’t stuffy or old fashioned in any way...The musical embraces it’s own ridiculousness, playing into every campy element possible...It is hard to look past some of its larger flaws. Most odious among them are its book...The failures of this musical seemed avoidable...This musical is a bit messy, but it’s fun and it is doing some very important work for representation and visibility on Broadway.”\n\nRead more",
