  "bwwExcerpt": "The new musical 'Head Over Heels,' which opened Thursday on Broadway, takes the songs of '80s American girl group the Go-Go's, plops them in a British story from the 16th century and adds a bunch of modern, self-referential jokes. It's an idea that's so crazy, it just might work! It doesn't. This indulgent show is wackier than it is fun, and elicits more 'huh?' than 'ha'. Worse, it treats the catchy pop music like a side of spinach.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic uses distinctly negative imagery comparing the show to excessive, artificial elements ('craft store explosion', 'plastic'). The tone is dismissive and suggests the production is overdone and inauthentic. | GPT-4o: The review uses hyperbolic negative comparisons to describe the show, indicating a strong negative verdict with no redeeming qualities mentioned. | Gemini: The review uses negative comparisons (craft store explosion, Pacific Ocean plastic) to describe the show, indicating a negative overall impression. | Kimi: The critic uses vivid negative metaphors (environmental pollution, chaotic explosion) to condemn the production aesthetic as cheap, excessive, and artificial. No positive elements are mentioned in this brief excerpt.",
