  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Feels as timid and awkward as the new kid on the first day of school...'Head Over Heels' lacks the courage of its contradictions. It mutters deferentially when what you want is a rebel yell...What’s lacking in the musical performances here is the go-for-broke exuberance that made the Go-Go’s so irresistible...Its audience might leave the theater less hungry if this oddly earnest show could really kick up its heels and let the message take care of itself.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Review criticizes the show as 'timid and awkward,' lacking the energy and exuberance needed. Multiple negative descriptors ('mutters deferentially,' 'oddly earnest') indicate clear disappointment with the production's execution. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt criticizes the show for lacking energy and being timid, indicating a negative assessment. However, given the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review points out flaws and lacks enthusiasm, suggesting a mixed experience. The truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The critic finds the production lacks the necessary exuberance and courage, describing it as 'timid,' 'awkward,' and failing to deliver the 'go-for-broke' energy needed. With only a single excerpt available and no mention of redeeming qualities, this reads as a clear non-recommendation, though not a complete disaster.",
