  "bwwExcerpt": "It's really hard to laugh when somebody's holding a gun to your head. That's the way this Go-Go's feels in 'Head Over Heels,' an over-written, over-designed, and generally overdone production directed by Michael Mayer. From the sets and costumes to the performance style, the basic principle seems to be: Less is boring and more is never enough. Thanks, no doubt, to the Oracle of Delphi (played here by the impishly funny Peppermint), it's a miracle that at least some of the wit in Jeff Whitty's original book gets through.",

The tone is approving but not ecstatic, fitting the Positive bucket.",
