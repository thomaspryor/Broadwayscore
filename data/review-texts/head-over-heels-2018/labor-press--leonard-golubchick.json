  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"All the actors work hard, have good voices, and attempt to put a jukebox musical across so it is pleasing and entertaining...A silly but lively show, an over-the-top production with disparate parts that are not tied tightly together to enable it to be an impressive whole...If you enjoy a silly farce with music but which can be confusing, you will enjoy this musical...Adults who enjoyed the Go-Go’s music in the 1980s will find 'Head Over Heels' a worthwhile venture.\"\n\nRead more",
