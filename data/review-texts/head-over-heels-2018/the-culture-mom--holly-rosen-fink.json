  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The show is ground-breaking. It’s about sexual identity and the struggles that come along with it...It’s about freedom. Liberation. Acceptance. And the theme weaves in and out of the story effortlessly, all the way to the dancers and choreography...The songs are wonderful, as you’d expect them to be, and they are well sung by a skilled cast. The show is a bit campy, but there is nothing wrong with that, particularly at a time when we all need a dose of positivity and inclusion.”\n\nRead more",
