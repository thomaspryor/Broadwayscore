  "bwwExcerpt": "For better or worse, Broadway's Head Over Heels is stuck with being known as 'the Go-Go's musical' - better because of the good will floating on stage with all those lighter-than-air hits by Belinda Carlisle, Jane Wiedlin, et.al., worse because the hard-working new production can't seem to keep itself from popping those effervescence tune bubbles one by one.",
