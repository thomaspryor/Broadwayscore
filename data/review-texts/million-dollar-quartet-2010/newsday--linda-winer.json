  "bwwExcerpt": "Really, this is little more than a glorified club act, a concert of terrific formative rock and roll loosely held together with conversational connective tissue and telescoped rock history. Considerable care has clearly been taken to cast more for sound-alikes than look-alikes, and the musicians - especially Levi Kreis as irrepressible newcomer Jerry Lee - convey the raw, rough energy of guys raised dirt-poor and riding a comet to unknowable cultural change...[Sam] Phillips urges on his fine musicians: 'My God, this is where the soul of music never dies.' Well, perhaps it does turn over in its grave a bit.",
