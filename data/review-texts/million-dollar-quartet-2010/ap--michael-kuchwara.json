  "bwwExcerpt": "Eric Schaeffer, who runs the Signature Theatre in Washington's Virginia suburbs, has staged the show with a minimum of fuss. The book heads toward a glum confrontation between Phillips and several of the singers, who are leaving Sun Records for more lucrative contracts with larger recording labels. Yet the gloom is dispelled quickly when 'Million Dollar Quartet' finishes up its curtain calls with high-voltage renditions of 'Hound Dog,' 'Ghost Riders in the Sky,' 'See You Later Alligator' and the appropriately titled 'Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On.' Of course, they get the cheering audience to its feet.",
