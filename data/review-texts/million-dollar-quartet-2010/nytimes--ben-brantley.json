Very brief excerpt limits confidence in scoring. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the strong musical performances as the show's strength, suggesting it is worth seeing for those moments, despite some reservations about its structure as a play. | Gemini: The review indicates that the show is enjoyable when the music takes center stage, suggesting a positive experience overall, but with the caveat that the non-musical parts are less successful. | Kimi: The critic finds the dramatic structure flawed but delivers strong praise for the musical moments and ensemble chemistry, suggesting the production's highlights justify attendance despite uneven book scenes.",
