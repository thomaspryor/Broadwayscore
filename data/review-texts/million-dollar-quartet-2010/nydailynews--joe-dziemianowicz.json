The critic's own 80 rating confirms this is solidly positive territory. | GPT-4o: The review provides a positive assessment, highlighting the show's engaging and lively nature. The critic's original rating of 80 aligns with a solid recommendation without extreme enthusiasm. | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"authentic spirit\" and \"rollicking tunes\" and states that it will have you tapping your toes and clapping your hands, indicating a positive experience. The original rating of 80 aligns with a positive classification. | Kimi: The critic's explicit 80/100 rating confirms a strong Positive recommendation, while the enthusiastic language ('rocks', 'rollicking') supports scoring at the higher end of that range.",
