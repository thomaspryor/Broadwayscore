  "bwwExcerpt": "One day in December 1956, four future musical legends -- Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins -- happened to gather together for an impromptu jam session at the Memphis studio of Sun Records. Don't look for 'Million Dollar Quartet,' the new musical about this fortuitous event, to show what really happened that day. But this wildly entertaining show wonderfully captures the spirit of these seminal figures who would go on to change the course of popular music.",
