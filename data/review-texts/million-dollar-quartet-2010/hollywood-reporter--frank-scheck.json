  "bwwExcerpt": "One day in December 1956, four future musical legends -- Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins -- happened to gather together for an impromptu jam session at the Memphis studio of Sun Records. Don't look for 'Million Dollar Quartet,' the new musical about this fortuitous event, to show what really happened that day. But this wildly entertaining show wonderfully captures the spirit of these seminal figures who would go on to change the course of popular music.",

Single excerpt warning noted - positioning in upper Positive range due to unqualified praise, but medium confidence given limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'wildly entertaining' and praises its ability to capture the spirit of iconic musicians, indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is positive, calling the show \"wildly entertaining\" and praising its capture of the spirit of the musicians. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strong positive language warrants a score in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: While the critic notes the show takes liberties with historical accuracy, they describe it as 'wildly entertaining' and praise how it 'wonderfully captures the spirit' of the musicians, indicating a strong recommendation.",
