    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance with superlative language ('bravura', 'highest order'), but single excerpt warning means full review verdict unknown. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Mr. Byrnes' performance highly, indicating a positive view of his role. However, the single excerpt warning suggests this may not represent the full review sentiment, leading to a cautious score on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a \"bravura performance\" and \"acting of the highest order,\" indicating a positive assessment of at least one key element of the production. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with high end score, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified superlatives ('bravura', 'highest order') for the lead performance, indicating strong recommendation, though single-excerpt limitation prevents Rave classification.",
