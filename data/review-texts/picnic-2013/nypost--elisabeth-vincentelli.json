  "bwwExcerpt": "Maggie Grace ('The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn,' 'Taken') has a coltish, leggy elegance as Madge Owens. Sebastian Stan ('Captain America'), the dreamy outsider Hal Carter, isn't shy about showing off his chiselled torso, which is good because Hal's keeps losing his shirt or having it torn off him. Too bad they share youth and good looks, but no sizzle - there's more sexual chemistry among the cast of 'Old Jews Telling Jokes.'",
