  "bwwExcerpt": "Stan ('Gossip Girl,' 'Captain America') has the right rugged looks for Hal, played by William Holden in the '55 film. He's a character built to be objectified as beefcake and to sizzle in shirtless scenes. Beefy Stan rivals the porterhouses at Peter Luger's and he brings out Hal's vulnerable side. Even better is Grace, a coltish blonde known for movies, including 'Taken' and 'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn.' She's a natural onstage. Her work is assured and understated and brings an air of introspection to Madge.",
