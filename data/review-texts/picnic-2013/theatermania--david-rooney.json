Brief excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review highlights positive aspects such as 'sensitive direction' and a 'mostly strong cast,' suggesting a recommendation despite potential minor reservations. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"handsome\" and \"benefits\" and mentions \"sensitive direction\" and a \"mostly strong cast,\" indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers clear praise for the production values ('handsome'), direction ('sensitive'), and performances ('mostly strong'), indicating a solid recommendation despite minor reservations. The extreme brevity of the text warrants low confidence.",
