The 'museum piece' metaphor and 'little sense of why we should be looking at it now' indicate the critic does not recommend seeing it. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the revival lacks relevance and purpose, indicating a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the play feels like a museum piece, suggesting it lacks relevance or impact for a modern audience, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the revival as a pointless 'museum piece' that lacks contemporary relevance or justification for its existence, despite acknowledging the care taken in its production.",
