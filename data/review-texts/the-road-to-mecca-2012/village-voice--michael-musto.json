  "bwwExcerpt": "At 84, [Harris] is at the top of her game in the revival of Athol Fugard's 1984 play The Road To Mecca, about an eccentric widow who lives among her concrete statues in a South African village where she's been ostracized and misunderstood. Harris is riveting, even when sitting still and absorbing the other two characters' thoughts. (And there are a lot of them.)",
