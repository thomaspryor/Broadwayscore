  "bwwExcerpt": "Fugard's delicate three-person work has a great deal of talk and very little action. The drama turns on small moments and subtle subtext and requires intimacy. Despite sterling performances from Carla Gugino, Jim Dale, and the luminous Rosemary Harris, it's a bit of a slog to 'Mecca' as the show tries to punch its way across the footlights in the Roundabout Theatre Company's too-large American Airlines Theatre.",
