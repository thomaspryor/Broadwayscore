  "bwwExcerpt": "Credit the Roundabout Theatre Company for selecting one of South African playwright Athol Fugard's more unknown works, 1984's The Road to Mecca. Credit Roundabout, actually, for selecting one at all: The last Fugard production on Broadway was in 2003, a revival of his 'Master Harold'...and the Boys. After all, the prolific Fugard has penned nearly three dozen dramas. Yet this Road to Mecca, at the American Airlines Theatre through March 4, is long, winding, and, in the end, more than a little unsatisfying.",
