So it's heavy going for much of the first act...[Miss Helen finds her voice] in a speech that Harris delivers with an incandescent flame in her eye. It's a long time coming, and for too much of the play thesp is constrained by Miss Helen's fragility. But when the moment comes, Harris lights her candles and sets the stage ablaze.",

The pic is stuffed with famous French faces, if not necessarily famous French feet, as the game footage keeps cutting between shots of upper and lower bodies. Each celebrity comedian provides a variation on his own shtick, with Dahan and the limping screenplay struggling to move away from the pic’s mini-showcases toward something akin to teamwork. Star power delivered socko results locally, with nearly 2.5 million admissions.\n\nFiftyish Orbera (Jose Garcia) is an alcoholic whose last shot at redemption involves convincing some equally down-and-out ex-colleagues to play for a Breton island that needs a big-money win to keep the local fishing cannery from closing. Franck Dubosc, Gad Elmaleh, Ramzy and “The Intouchables” thesp Omar Sy all do their familiar (occasionally) funny thing, though the only one who really convinces as more than a 2D caricature is rapper-turned-thesp Joeystarr (“Polisse“), conspicuously not a comedian. The story is as predictable as the tech credits are big-budget smooth."
