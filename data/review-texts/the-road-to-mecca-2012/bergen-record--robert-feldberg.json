  "bwwExcerpt": "Harris is a luminous and appealing Helen, and Dale gives a wisely subdued, nuanced portrayal of Marius. Gugino is a bit overstated at times as Elsa, but she also gives the play a welcome jolt of energy. Ultimately, though, this is a play in which the acting can't surmount a story that's awkwardly told, and, under Gordon Edelstein's tame direction, doesn't build any theatrical urgency.",
