  "bwwExcerpt": "In the absence of all suspense - though not of pacing, which is fairly fleet, almost brisk - the show is taken over by spotlight supporting roles, most notably Jayne Houdyshell, who steals the show as Juliet's nurse. Houdyshell is, of course, a brilliant stage performer, but when the Nurse runs off with yourR&J, chances are it wasn't secured properly in the first place. Mercutio's another matter: As the only brilliant person in this rather dull crew of partisans, prigs and puppy-lovers - and thus the only crazy person, as well - he's designed to walk away with the whole shootin' match. Christian Camargo doesn't disappoint: A skinny-jeaned, leather-jacketed apparition, he's like some Billyburg poseur driven mad by the dawning recognition of his waning powers of bullshit. As a verbal duelist, Camargo's the very butcher of a silk button - he speaks in short stabbing motions, milks nothing, hits everything, jumps back before he's worn out his welcome.",
