  "bwwExcerpt": "The most mesmerizing of the lot is Christian Camargo. As Romeo's disenchanted, provocateur pal, Mercutio, he languidly delivers his razor-sharp lines. It's as if the character was fatigued by life itself - yet he energizes the stage whenever he's on. And he doesn't even need to ride a motorcycle.",

Low confidence due to very brief excerpt with no overall recommendation. | Gemini: The review offers a mixed assessment, praising Rashad's Juliet while criticizing Bloom's Romeo. This suggests a production with both strengths and weaknesses, falling into the 'Mixed' category. | Kimi: Brief excerpt provides contrasting assessments of the two leads without an overall production verdict, criticizing the title performance while praising the co-lead.",
