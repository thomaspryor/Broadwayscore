  "bwwExcerpt": "Bloom throws himself thoroughly into the role of the lovestruck Italian - ticket-holders get to see him shirtless, climbing walls and flexing his gymnastic abilities. More importantly, he speaks Shakespeare's poetry capably. But he lacks the gravity to really grab you. Together, he and Rashad are warm, not hot. If Romeo and Juliet don't blaze, why bother?",
