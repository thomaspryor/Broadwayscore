    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Acknowledges positive elements (design, casting) but the core criticism that it feels like a 'museum piece' rather than living theater suggests a disappointing experience that neither strongly recommends nor completely dismisses. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges positive aspects like design and casting but ultimately suggests the production lacks vitality, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (design, casting) but ultimately finds the production lacking in vitality, suggesting a mixed or neutral overall assessment. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges strong production values and casting, the core verdict is that the show fails as a living tragedy, instead feeling static and inert—a clear recommendation against seeing it.",
