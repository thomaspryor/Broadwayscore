    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt describes the show as 'briskly uproarious' which is clearly positive praise, but with only one cherry-picked quote available, confidence is low. The enthusiastic tone suggests upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'briskly uproarious', indicating a strong positive reaction. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as \"briskly uproarious,\" which indicates a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic language ('uproarious') to describe the show as highly entertaining, with praise for the supporting cast's contributions. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the upper Positive range (80-84).",
