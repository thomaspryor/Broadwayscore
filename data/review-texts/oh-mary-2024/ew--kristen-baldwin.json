    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic uses unqualified superlative praise ('absolutely hilarious') and describes the comedy as 'outrageous' in a positive context. The original rating of 87 confirms this is in the Rave bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is clearly positive, describing the show as 'absolutely hilarious' with an 'outrageous comedy'. The original rating of 87 suggests a strong positive review. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The single excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, calling the show \"absolutely hilarious.\" Given the lack of full text, confidence is low, but the strong positive sentiment warrants a score in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single available excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('absolutely hilarious') and strong recommendation, but limited text availability necessitates conservative scoring at the upper end of Positive bucket with low confidence.",
