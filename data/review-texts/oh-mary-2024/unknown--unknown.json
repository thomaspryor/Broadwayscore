The phrase 'real theater' suggests some appreciation, but without the complete verdict, the score remains uncertain in the mixed range. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the stylized nature and theatrical quality of the production, suggesting it has artistic merit. However, the lack of a full verdict and the mention of a potential sketch-like structure imply it may not fully satisfy all audiences. | Gemini: The truncated text makes it difficult to determine a clear recommendation. The description of the play as \"comedy-turned-drama-turned\" suggests an unevenness, leading to a mixed assessment.",
