  "fullText": "“For God’s sake, Mary!” Abraham Lincoln says to his wife in “Oh, Mary!,” Cole Escola’s unhinged historical fantasia that imagines its protagonist as an alcoholic cabaret singer married to a gay guy. “How would it look for the first lady of the United States to be flitting around a stage right now in the ruins of war!”\n\n“How would it look?!” she responds. “Sensational!”\n\nIt’s a moment reminiscent of Escola’s early YouTube humor, like in the sketch “Bernadette Peters Does Her Taxes.” An accountant exasperatingly asks for a ballpark figure, and Escola’s Bernadette, wiggling like a charmed snake with their hands on their hips, asks, “Is this a ballpark figure?”\n\nSo stupid. So campy. So unexpected. And yes, like Mrs. Lincoln, even sensational.\n\nThere’s little else in New York theater right now quite as surprising as “Oh, Mary!” Written by and starring Escola, it’s a bit taken to an 80-minute extreme that’s silly, nasty, tasteless and, in the end, good theater — the kind of show that will leave you gagging, both in the sense that you’ll be losing your mind with joy, and that you might just be grossed out.\n\nEscola’s humor is tailored like a Bernadette Peters concert gown to New York gays who were brought up on a diet of alt-cabaret and “Strangers With Candy.” Mary Todd Lincoln would scowl comfortably alongside the Hollywood starlets of Charles Busch and the manic guests of “At Home With Amy Sedaris.”\n\nTo this lineage Escola adds a sensibility that’s queer and crass; you often get the impression that their ideas start with a wig in search of a story, inspired by tropes from pop culture — mainly, vintage TV and commercials that begin with “I’m a mom.” Out come characters like Donna Germaine, the sweetly hapless real estate agent of “Pee Pee Manor,” and Fifi, the saloon singer of “Our Home Out West,” a parody of 1970s Christmas specials.\n\nEscola commits to a bit with demented physicality and a cherubic face deployed to unthinkable acts of offbeat comedy, whether as a talking head on a true crime mockumentary or as a fetus pleading for its life in Bridget Everett’s “Rock Bottom.” Hence the premise of “Oh, Mary!,” which is neither accurate nor solemn — it’s as educational as Mel Brooks’s “History of the World” series — but rather recasts the first lady as a messy diva who longs for the days when “people traveled the world over for my short legs and long medleys.”\n\nWith Lucille Ball expressions that are punchlines on their own, Escola’s Mary is a chaotic force who wreaks havoc on the White House. She’s bored out of her mind as the Civil War winds down, and she and her husband look forward to a night out at Ford’s Theater, where, in the sole moment taken from real history, he is assassinated.\n\nThe cast surrounding Mary speaks in the elevated tone of melodrama: Tony Macht bright and eager as Abe’s assistant, Simon; Bianca Leigh draggy and affectedly prim as Mary’s chaperone, Louise. Conrad Ricamora, as Abe, and James Scully, as Mary’s acting teacher, couldn’t be further from their performances in the movie “Fire Island.” Gone is Ricamora’s Mr. Darcy-like reserve and Scully’s bland kindness, replaced by comically feverish intensity and passion.\n\nIt’s all highly stylized, and it’s all real theater. “Oh, Mary!” could have been a single sketch, or a succession of them, but instead it’s a clearly plotted comedy-turned-drama-turned … actually, let’s not spoil the climax other than to say there are gasp-worthy twists.\n\nThe scenic design, by the collective Dots, has the cheesy naturalism of community theater until it is stripped nearly bare for a finale by way of “Chicago” by way of “Gypsy” by way of, well, Cole Escola. Sam Pinkleton’s direction is breathlessly athletic, never letting the script sag as the actors leap across the stage and over furniture; the presidential desk alone gets quite the workout.\n\nPay close attention to the theater’s lobby, which has been decorated with a fake retrospective of Martha Swope-like photographs: of Escola as a Cassie on crutches in “A Chorus Line,” as the star of a John Doyle “Death of a Salesman,” as a mane-haired Deirdre O’Connell in “Dana H.”\n\nNot only funny, these amount to Escola’s act of planting a flag in queer theater, after years of wickedly dancing on its periphery. And thank God, in a moment of so much comedy and theater that aspires to relevance, Escola follows the example of “Dicks: The Musical” and “Spamalot” in going for something more timeless: stupidity.\n\nOh, Mary!Through May 5 at the Lucille Lortel Theater, Manhattan; ohmaryplay.com. Running time: 1 hour 20 minutes.\n\nJoshua Barone is the assistant classical music and dance editor on the Culture Desk and a contributing classical music critic.",

However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The phrase \"real theater\" suggests a positive assessment, but the truncated nature of the text and the single excerpt available makes it difficult to gauge the overall sentiment with high confidence. The description of the play's structure as \"comedy-turned-drama-turned\" suggests a potentially engaging narrative arc.",
