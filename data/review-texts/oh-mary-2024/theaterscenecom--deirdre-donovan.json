Brilliantly directed by Sam Pinkleton, and starring Escola in the eponymous role, it is an uproariously funny\nshow that delivers a wild and wooly version of American history.\n\nThe\npremise: Oh, Mary! centers on the miserably frustrated Mary Todd\nLincoln who reveals her hopes and dreams in the months leading up to her\nhusband's assassination. A former cabaret star, she is utterly bored in her\nrole as First Lady.� While everybody expects her to be a devoted wife and\nmother, she simply yearns to return to her former showbiz haunts. And, oh yes.\nMary frequently over-imbibes in alcoholic beverages, which prompts her husband\nto keep liquor under lock and key at the White House. Or as he puts it: \"No\none is safe while my wife has access to booze. The last time this happened she\nscaled a clock tower, derailed a freight train, and took a piss all over the\nsenate floor.\n\nIndeed, the\ndelicate-souled may well be forewarned that Ecola follows in the artistic\nfootsteps of David Mamet, heavily peppering four-letter words into their dialogue. This is not a family-friendly\nshow. That said, it is, at this writing, one of the hottest tickets in\ntown.� In fact, Oh, Mary! broke the all-time box office record at the\nLyceum house in July, surpassing the former record holder, A Strange Loop.\n\nEscola's\nMary acts with all the sound and fury of a leading lady who fiercely insists on\nhaving her own way, however inappropriate it may be during wartime.� Although\nher husband's (Conrad Ricamora) political reputation is at stake as he\nendeavors to preserve the Union, Mary appears not to have a clue about what's\ngoing on in the country. When her spouse mentions the South to her, in fact,\nshe naively retorts: \"The south of what?\"\n\nEscola\nis supported by 4 superb actors who bring their own theatrical magic to the\nproduction. There's the aforementioned\nRicamora as her husband Abraham, who struggles with his homosexual tendencies,\nand James Scully (making his Broadway debut), who plays Mary's dashing acting\nteacher. Bianca Leigh is Mary's proper chaperone Louise, and Tony Macht is\nMary's husband's loyal assistant Simon.\n\nBeyond\nits crackerjack acting, the creative team do a terrific job at bringing you\nback to the Civil War days. The theater design\ncollective dots provides the authentic-looking 19th century\nset, replete with an expansive presidential desk and an imposing portrait of\nGeorge Washington, hung on the back wall.� An olive-colored sofa and chairs add\na bit of warmth to the Oval Office, as does\nthe rectangular rug positioned at center stage.\n\nConrad Ricamora, Cole Escola, Bianca Leigh (Photo: Emilio\nMadrid)\n\nNothing but\npraise can be offered for Holly Pierson's costumes. Whether it's Mary's black hoop-skirted dress, her\nhusband's smartly tailored suit and signature top hat, or the acting teacher's\nmore understated outfit, Pierson's wardrobe choices are in perfect synch with\neach characters' personality.\n\nA\nshout out to wig designer, Leah J. Loukas, for purposefully creating an\noutlandish hairdo for Mary, which can best be summed up as a profusion of dark\nsausage curls that alternately frame or swish around Escola's face.� Loukas\ncrafts a more matronly styled wig for Mary's chaperone Louise.� But, make no\nmistake, big hair definitely is in for the play's distaff characters.\n\nConrad Ricamora, Tony Macht (Photo: Emilio Madrid)\n\nIt's\nimpossible to pick a \"favorite\" scene, as the play's power is in its cumulative\ndramatic effect.� But theatergoers should know that Escola plays fast and loose\nwith history and likes to spring one surprise after another in their 80-minute\ndrama. In fact, the element of surprise is vital to this theater piece.� So,\nsuffice it to say, that yours truly won't provide you with too many plot\ndetails as it would spoil the fun.\n\nStill,\nwhenever Escola's Mary is on stage, all eyes are on her. What makes Mary so\nwickedly delicious to watch and listen to is that she does precisely what is in\nbad taste and against all the rules of polite society. She is a harpy to end\nall harpies, and a terrible burden to her husband who is already weighed down\nwith the guilt of his homosexual dalliances in a pre-Stonewall era.\n\nWhile\nsome theatergoers might be offended by Escola's fast and loose handling of\nAmerican history, most will likely delight in the play's wacky logic. Of\ncourse, the only real way to find out why this play is generating so much buzz\naround Broadway is to head to the Lyceum and see it for yourself.\n\nAt the Lyceum\nTheatre, 149 W. 45th Street, Midtown Manhattan.\n\nFor more\ninformation, visit www.ohmaryplay.com\n\nRunning\ntime:� 80 minutes with no intermission",
