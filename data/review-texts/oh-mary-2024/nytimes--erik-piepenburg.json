    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a campy portrayal without clear positive or negative evaluation. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious, mixed classification. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a campy and potentially entertaining portrayal, but lacks a clear recommendation. The tone is somewhat neutral, leaning slightly towards positive due to the \"enchant\" aspect. | Kimi: Single excerpt uses mildly positive language ('enchant') to describe the campy characterization, suggesting appreciation for the comedic portrayal, but lacks the clear recommendation or superlatives needed for a higher score.",
