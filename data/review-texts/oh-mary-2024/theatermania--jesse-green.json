    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong positive language ('deliriously funny', 'exactly what Broadway needs') suggests enthusiastic recommendation, but limited text requires caution. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('deliriously funny', 'exactly the kind of unhinged comedy Broadway needs'), suggesting an enthusiastic recommendation. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, calling the show \"deliriously funny\" and stating that it's exactly what Broadway needs. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong unqualified praise ('deliriously funny,' 'exactly what Broadway needs'), indicating a clear recommendation, though confidence is reduced due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
