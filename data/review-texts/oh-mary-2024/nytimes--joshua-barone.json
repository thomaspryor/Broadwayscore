    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'real theater' and highlights its stylized nature, suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, calling it \"real theater\" and a \"clearly plotted comedy-turned-drama-turned\". However, it also suggests it could have been just a sketch, indicating some reservations. Given the single excerpt and the reservations, I'm scoring it as a low positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the show's theatricality and construction, validating it as 'real theater' with a 'clearly plotted' structure that transcends sketch comedy. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt limitation and text truncation mid-sentence.",

  "wrongFullText": "“For God’s sake, Mary!” Abraham Lincoln says to his wife in “Oh, Mary!,” Cole Escola’s unhinged historical fantasia that imagines its protagonist as an alcoholic cabaret singer married to a gay guy. “How would it look for the first lady of the United States to be flitting around a stage right now in the ruins of war!”\n\n“How would it look?!” she responds. “Sensational!”\n\nIt’s a moment reminiscent of Escola’s early YouTube humor, like in the sketch “Bernadette Peters Does Her Taxes.” An accountant exasperatingly asks for a ballpark figure, and Escola’s Bernadette, wiggling like a charmed snake with their hands on their hips, asks, “Is this a ballpark figure?”\n\nSo stupid. So campy. So unexpected. And yes, like Mrs. Lincoln, even sensational.\n\nThere’s little else in New York theater right now quite as surprising as “Oh, Mary!” Written by and starring Escola, it’s a bit taken to an 80-minute extreme that’s silly, nasty, tasteless and, in the end, good theater — the kind of show that will leave you gagging, both in the sense that you’ll be losing your mind with joy, and that you might just be grossed out.\n\nEscola’s humor is tailored like a Bernadette Peters concert gown to New York gays who were brought up on a diet of alt-cabaret and “Strangers With Candy.” Mary Todd Lincoln would scowl comfortably alongside the Hollywood starlets of Charles Busch and the manic guests of “At Home With Amy Sedaris.”\n\nTo this lineage Escola adds a sensibility that’s queer and crass; you often get the impression that their ideas start with a wig in search of a story, inspired by tropes from pop culture — mainly, vintage TV and commercials that begin with “I’m a mom.” Out come characters like Donna Germaine, the sweetly hapless real estate agent of “Pee Pee Manor,” and Fifi, the saloon singer of “Our Home Out West,” a parody of 1970s Christmas specials.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access."
