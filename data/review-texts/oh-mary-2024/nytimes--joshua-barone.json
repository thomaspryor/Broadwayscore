    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'real theater' and highlights its stylized nature, suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, calling it \"real theater\" and a \"clearly plotted comedy-turned-drama-turned\". However, it also suggests it could have been just a sketch, indicating some reservations. Given the single excerpt and the reservations, I'm scoring it as a low positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the show's theatricality and construction, validating it as 'real theater' with a 'clearly plotted' structure that transcends sketch comedy. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt limitation and text truncation mid-sentence.",
