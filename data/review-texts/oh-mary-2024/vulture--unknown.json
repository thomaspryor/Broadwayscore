However, the lack of a full review and potential cherry-picking necessitate a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the director and cast, suggesting a positive experience. The comment about 'crazy political chaos' implies the show is relevant and engaging, further supporting a positive, though not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation.",
