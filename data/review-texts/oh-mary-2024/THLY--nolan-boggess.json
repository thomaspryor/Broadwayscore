  "bwwExcerpt": "n as camp. Elder viewers reared on the comparatively subtle writing and performance style of Charles Busch are likely to find Escola’s slapdash artistry crude, but there’s no denying he snags laughs. Nolan Boggess, Theatrely: With the world finally catching up with Escola’s work, let’s hope more people travel all over the world to see Mary’s “short legs and long medleys.” Or at least enough to turn a strictly limited run into a Broadway mainstay. Austin Fimmano, New York Theatre Guide: Together with James Scully as Mary’s handsome drama teacher, Bianca Leigh as Mary’s long-suffering chaperone, and Tony Macht as Abe’s extremely pliant assistant, the entire ensemble elevates very silly jokes into a work of art that keeps you riveted from start to finish. Suffice it to say that when the lights went up after the curtain call, my guest and I agreed we had literally laughed until our faces hurt.
