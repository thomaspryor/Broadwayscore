  "dtliExcerpt": "Escola stars as Mary Todd Lincoln in this gut-busting revisionist history.\n\nShe enters snarling, thirst on her lips and murderous rage in her eyes. This is Mary Todd Lincoln, as played by actor-playwright Cole Escola in their Broadway debut,\n\nAbe conspires to distract Mary by hiring her a handsome young acting teacher (James Scully), but this only fuels her determination to return to the stage — especially when he seems to secure her an audition for\n\nA fixture of the downtown cabaret scene and a writer on the television series\n\nIt’s Escola’s razor-sharp instincts as an actor, however, that really seal the deal. With impeccable comic timing and expressions that could be read from space (the stank face is epic), Escola grabs hold of our attention from the first beat and refuses to let go.\n\nThe supporting performances rise to the high bar Escola sets. Ricamora’s Lincoln is equal parts pathetic and menacing, his cruelty derived from real and lingering insecurity about his carnal urges. The adorable Tony Macht plays Simon, the president’s assistant and object of the great emancipator’s lecherous gaze. It's a performance that tells a clear story about Washington courtiers: Degrading sexual acts are a small price to pay for a resume bump.\n\nHandsome and furtive, Scully artfully conceals several of the script’s biggest secrets, unleashing the fury of Medea as the play hurtles toward its fateful conclusion. And Leigh, of all the actors, most comfortably inhabits the 1860s world of courtly manners and sexual repression. She makes an ideal foil for Escola’s demon child of a first lady.\n\nDirector Sam Pinkleton’s production is delightfully analog. The set (by dots) looks like it belongs onstage at Ford’s Theatre circa 1865, its fakery proudly worn like costume jewelry to a drag ball. Holly Pierson’s costumes are similarly stagey in a way that really complements the performances (Escola is having so much fun abusing that hoop dress).\n\nCha See’s lighting accentuates the comic beats, reddening with the president’s face. Sound designers Daniel Kluger and Drew Levy subtly amplify the performers so that we don’t miss a single brilliant line. And Kluger’s stormy piano music during blackout scene transitions reinforces the Victorian feeling of a play that is an intoxicating cocktail of old and new sensibilities.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.
