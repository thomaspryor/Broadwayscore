And the technical aspects, though also enlarged, remain smarter than they are lavish, recalling the roots of the drag aesthetic in the handmade ethos of community and school.",

However, due to the single excerpt and potential cherry-picking, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive audience reaction and appreciation for the technical aspects, suggesting a recommendation, but the lack of a definitive statement warrants a score in the lower end of the positive range.",
