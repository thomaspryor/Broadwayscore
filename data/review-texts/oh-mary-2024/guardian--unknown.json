Oh, Mary! is an uproariously inaccurate and queer romp through history without the tiring anachronistic politics of, say, fellow historical romps Hamilton or Six, or even contemporary TV shows like Dickinson or the current sleeper summer hit My Lady Jane.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic uses very positive language like 'brought the house down' and 'uproariously' while favorably comparing it to other successful shows. However, with only one excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'uproariously inaccurate and queer romp' and highlights moments that 'brought the house down,' indicating a positive reception. However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning suggest scoring conservatively within the Positive range. | Gemini: The phrase \"brought the house down\" suggests a positive audience reaction and implies the show is enjoyable. The comparison to other popular historical shows, while noting differences, doesn't detract from the positive implication.",
