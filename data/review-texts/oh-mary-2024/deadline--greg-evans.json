The tone and language clearly indicate a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"riotous,\" \"brings more laughs,\" and \"deliriously campy.\" Despite acknowledging the ahistorical nature of the play, the overall tone is highly enthusiastic and recommends seeing the show for its comedic value.",

A couple houses, in fact.\n\nWhen we first set eyes on Mary, she’s gone absolutely feral in search of the bottle her husband has hidden from her. “No one is safe while my wife has access to booze,” Abraham (Conrad Ricamora, Fire Island, Broadway’s Here Lies Love) says to his ever-present Union soldier assistant (Tony Macht). “The last time this happened she scaled a clock tower, derailed a freight train, and took a piss all over the senate floor.”\n\nFor her part, the self-absorbed Mary insists she wouldn’t need to drink if she wasn’t so damned bored. “Our country is at war!,” says her incredulous chaperone Louise. “Thousands are being ravaged by typhoid. Your own son perished just last year!”\n\nSnaps Mary, “It's no use trying to make me laugh, Louise.”\n\nEven if she isn’t quite sure what all the national fuss is about, Mary is counting the days till Abe (and post-war decorum) permits her return to her one true love: the stage. She once was, she brags, “a rather well-known niche cabaret legend.”\n\nSays she, \"People traveled the world over for my short legs and long medleys!\"\n\nTo keep her preoccupied and off the hooch, Abe promises Mary that once the war is over she can return to the stage, but only legitimate theater, and only if she takes acting lessons in the meantime. In fact, Abe’s hired her a teacher already, a handsome mustachioed young actor (James Scully, Fire Island) in need of work.\n\nBefore long, Mary and the teacher are besotted with one another, at least as much as Abe is besotted with that young soldier (somewhere Larry Kramer is smiling).\n\nTo reveal much more of the plot would risk spoilers and rob Escola’s whiplash storyline of its great pleasures. A few teases: Watch for the moments when Mary gleefully torments her prim chaperone (Bianca Leigh) with all manner of indignities, especially the betrayal of a lewd confidence involving the application of ice cream somewhere between kneecaps and heaven.\n\nOr watch as Mary repeatedly attempts to restrain herself from interrupting her blowhard husband in an extended back-and-forth of flawless comic timing. While Escola is the no-doubt-about-it star here, the rest of the impeccable cast keeps pace, from Ricamora as the only-sometimes repressed Abe to Scully as the lovesick hunk, Leigh as the hardly prissy chaperone and Macht as the not-so-dumb presidential boytoy.\n\nThe rest of the creative team is on point, too: the great scenic design collective known as dots has fashioned a look that delights in community theater aesthetics – until it doesn’t – and Holly Pierson’s period costumes are a joy, particularly Mary’s black hoop skirt that twirls like it has an engine (the better to see Mary’s heart-dotted bloomers). No matter that you’ll come to expect those skirt twirls at regular intervals – like everything else in Oh, Mary!, it’s all in the timing.\n\nOr as Mary says when asked by Abe how it would look for the first lady to be flitting around a stage in the ruins of war, \"Sensational!\"\n\nTitle: Oh, Mary!Venue: Broadway's Lyceum Theatre (through Sept. 15)Written By: Cole EscolaDirected By: Sam PinkletonCast: Cole Escola, Conrad Ricamora, James Scully, Bianca Leigh, Tony MachtRunning time: 1 hr 20 min (no intermission)\n\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\n\nDeadline is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2026 Deadline Hollywood, LLC.
