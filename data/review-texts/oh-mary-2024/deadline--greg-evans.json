  "dtliExcerpt": "Cole Escola in 'Oh, Mary!' Emilio Madrid There&#8217;s funny, there&#8217;s very funny, and then there&#8217;s Oh, Mary! , Cole Escola 's riotous new comedy that brings more laughs to Broadway than all the Gutenberg!s, Edelmans and Birbiglias combined. You can throw in Shucked for good measure. Escola, low-key famous these last few years through YouTube videos, late night appearances and gigs for TV&#8217;s The Other Two and Difficult People , ups the career stakes immensely with Oh, Mary! , opening tonight at Broadway&#8217;s Lyceum Theatre. With nods and hints to Charles Busch, the late, great and forever Ridiculous Everett Quinton, the Sedaris siblings, Carol Burnett, Pee-wee Herman and Absolutely Fabulous, Escola squeezes just enough juice from their influences for a mix that is entirely fresh and not to be missed. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article1-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid-article\",\"300x251\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[2,2],[300,250],[620,350],[300,251],[501,282],[3,3],[2,4],[4,2],[620,366]]) .exemptFromSleep() .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Related Stories Casting &#039;Just In Time&#039;: Jeremy Jordan To Succeed Jonathan Groff As Broadway&#039;s Bobby Darin",
