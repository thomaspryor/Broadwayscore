However, without a full review or original rating, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates the show is \"laugh-out-loud funny,\" which suggests a positive experience, but the limited text and single excerpt warning suggest a conservative score within the positive range.",
