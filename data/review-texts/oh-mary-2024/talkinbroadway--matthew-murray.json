Given single excerpt warning and mild positivity, scored at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a positive view of the comedy's humor and willingness to embrace ridiculousness, though it notes a lack of depth. The single excerpt warning suggests using the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive but qualified recommendation. The show is described as \"consistently funny\" and successful, but also \"not always particularly deep.\" | Kimi: The excerpt offers a qualified recommendation, praising the show as consistently funny and successful in its ridiculousness while noting it lacks depth. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
