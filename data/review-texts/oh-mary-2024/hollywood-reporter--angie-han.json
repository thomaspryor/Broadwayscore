    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: This single excerpt is purely descriptive of the show's premise and tone, with no evaluative language or clear verdict. Given the excerpt warning and lack of recommendation language, this appears neutral/descriptive rather than critical assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show's premise but lacks clear evaluative language indicating a positive or negative verdict. With only one curated quote, the overall sentiment is ambiguous, leading to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The single excerpt describes the premise and tone, but offers no clear evaluative statement about the show's quality or recommendation. It's intriguing, but not enough to recommend without reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt characterizes the show as an 'irreverent comedy' with a distinctive premise, implying an engaging and inventive quality, though explicit evaluative or recommendation language is absent from this single curated quote.",
