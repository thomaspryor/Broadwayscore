    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the lead performer's talent and entertainment value suggests positive recommendation, but extremely limited text requires low confidence and conservative scoring within Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the talent of Cole Escola and suggests the show is entertaining. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment is uncertain, leading to a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt is highly positive, praising Cole Escola's talent and entertainment value. Given the limited information, I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Escola's performance ('immense talent') and explicitly states the show entertains, placing it in the upper Positive range. However, as a single curated excerpt that may be cherry-picked, confidence is low regarding the full review's verdict.",
