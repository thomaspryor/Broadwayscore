Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive experience for fans of specific elements (camp and Cole), indicating a recommendation with some reservations. The single excerpt and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt is a clear recommendation, though limited in scope. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of positive. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic language ('splendid time') to recommend the show, though it qualifies the endorsement for specific audiences (camp enthusiasts and Cole Porter fans). As a single curated excerpt with clearly positive wording, it falls in the upper Positive range.",
