    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show is entertaining and camp, but the 'but like an overlong sketch' qualifier suggests significant reservations about its substance and length, placing it in mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as entertaining but also criticizes it as being like an 'overlong sketch,' suggesting a mixed review. The single excerpt and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review describes the show as entertaining but also criticizes it as being like an overlong sketch, suggesting a mixed reaction. The single excerpt and truncated nature of the text lowers the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a qualified recommendation: while explicitly calling the show 'entertaining' and appreciating its camp qualities, the critic undercuts this with the criticism that it feels like an 'overlong sketch,' suggesting it overstays its welcome.",
