However, the lack of a full review text and explicit recommendation language lowers confidence slightly. | Gemini: The phrase \"splendidly nasty\" and the fact that it moved from a sold-out run to Broadway suggests a positive, though perhaps unconventional, recommendation. The phrase \"goosing a sleepy Broadway summer\" implies that it is a welcome addition.",
