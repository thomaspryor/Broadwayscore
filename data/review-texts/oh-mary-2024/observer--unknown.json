    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The phrase 'splendidly nasty' is clearly positive praise, and describing it as goosing a sleepy Broadway summer suggests it's bringing energy and excitement. However, with only one excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'splendidly nasty' and notes its successful transition from a sold-out run, suggesting a positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The phrase \"splendidly nasty\" and the mention of a sold-out run suggest a positive, though perhaps not rave, review. The phrase \"goosing a sleepy Broadway summer\" further implies that the show is a welcome and enjoyable addition.",
