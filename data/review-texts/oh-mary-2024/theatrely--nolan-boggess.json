  "fullText": "The show is also a piece of history. While transferring a peculiar Off-Broadway jewel to a commercial run is not unusual, Oh, Mary! does stand apart from its peers on Broadway. When our Chief Critic Juan A. Ramirez reviewed the show Off-Broadway, he said, if he were inclined to look for a deeper meaning in Oh, Mary!, “it is a rebuttal against the legitimacy, good taste, and ‘straightness’ (if you can believe it) of most self-serious art.” If I were inclined to look further, and verge on sentimentality (yuck), the fact that this piece of radically queer comedy has become the buzziest show of the season is a hopeful sign of work to come.",
