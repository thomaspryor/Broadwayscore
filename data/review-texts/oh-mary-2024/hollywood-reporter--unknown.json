    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Rave | Claude: Despite the single excerpt warning, the critic explicitly calls the show 'a work of genius' and describes '80 minutes of almost uninterrupted laughter' - this is unambiguously enthusiastic praise that overrides any conservative scoring approach. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'work of genius' for its comedic impact, suggesting a strong recommendation. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language used is highly positive, indicating a rave review. | Gemini: The review excerpt strongly suggests a positive experience, highlighting the show's comedic value and ability to provide relief. The phrase \"work of genius\" indicates a strong recommendation, although the qualifier \"almost\" suggests a slight reservation.",
