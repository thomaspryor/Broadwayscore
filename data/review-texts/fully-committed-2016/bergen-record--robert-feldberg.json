  "bwwExcerpt": "He's not the world's greatest impersonator, and, especially at the beginning of the 80-minute show, some of the characters blur together. It's also distracting when he jumps out of his chair to briefly mimic the gestures of the unseen callers. But the show, directed by Jason Moore, soon settles down, and, despite not being a virtuoso of voices, Ferguson uses his performing skill and endearing personality to create a very engaging evening.",
