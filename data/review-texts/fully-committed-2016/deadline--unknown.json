  "bwwExcerpt": "As it happens, I was once married to a restaurant like Sam's, and I can say with some authority that the hilariously aptly named Ms. Mode knows whereof she speaks...Tyler Ferguson navigates these human mountains and valleys, major torrents and tricky rivulets, with precision and even empathy; it's a virtuosic performance and the audience, you should pardon the expression, eats it up...At barely 70 minutes, Fully Committed is not so much a meal as an amuse-bouche, that clever little thingy the chef sends out before your meal to tickle your palate and show off his inventiveness, and is made of stuff you never heard of. A gulp and it's gone.",
