  "bwwExcerpt": "The play by Becky Mode...has been updated for a world that's slightly less obsessed with the 'it' restaurant of the moment...Mode doesn't chase stinging satire, just laughs -- and snags a few good ones. Director Jason Moore keeps things moving briskly and as dynamically as possible...Ferguson has proven himself a likable clown in Shakespeare plays and musicals like 'On the Town' and 'The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.' But that's not the same as being a chameleon capable of shifting instantaneously from one vivid character to another. Ferguson lisps, growls and crosses his eyes gamely, but people on the other end of the phone line are rarely remarkable. The actor is fully committed, yes, but the production isn't totally satisfying.",

The single excerpt suggests a mixed verdict, and the lack of a full review text lowers confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the director's pacing and the playwright's humor, but finds Ferguson's performance lacking in character differentiation, leading to an overall 'not totally satisfying' experience. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the lead's commitment and that the play 'snags a few good ones,' the review ultimately finds the central performance lacking in versatility and the overall experience unsatisfying, with no recommendation to see it.",
