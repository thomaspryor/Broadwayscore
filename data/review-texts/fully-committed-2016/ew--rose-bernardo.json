  "bwwExcerpt": "No prime-time sitcom star returns to the theater more faithfully than Jesse Tyler Ferguson...It's a smart move: a one-man, 30-plus-character, 90-minute comedy where he can flex his impressive comic muscles in four-walled, air-conditioned comfort...Ferguson juggles all of these personalities rather deftly, making only a few fumbles. It takes about three calls for the ego-tastic chef to really take shape, and reservations manager Bob never really becomes instantly identifiable...Fully Committed is",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Excerpt praises Ferguson's performance as 'deft' with only minor criticisms about character development. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mildly positive but may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Ferguson's performance and the show's concept but notes some minor issues with character development. The overall tone is positive, though the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review praises Ferguson's performance and the concept, but notes some characters don't fully land. Given the truncated text, I'm scoring it as a positive with reservations. | Kimi: Single excerpt strongly praises Ferguson's comic abilities and deft character work while noting minor technical fumbles; clearly recommends the show for his performance despite specific characterization issues. Truncated ending and single-excerpt format warrant low confidence.",
