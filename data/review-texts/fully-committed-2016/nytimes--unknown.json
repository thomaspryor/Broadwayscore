  "fullText": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/theater/review-fully-committed-on-how-the-elite-dine-has-a-different-flavor-now.htmlShare full article21Advertisement\n\nAs a struggling actor who earns a living taking reservations for one of Manhattan’s high-end food temples — once known as restaurants — Jesse Tyler Ferguson, the sole performer in Becky Mode’s “Fully Committed,” is a comic dynamo with seemingly endless energy. Bounding around the stage of the Lyceum Theater, where the play opened on Monday, he jousts with not one or two but three different phones, nearly sweating through his gingham shirt as he gives voice to more than 40 characters, among them the harried but even-tempered central character, Sam; an imperious French maître d’; a patronizing bully of a chef; a chipper assistant to Gwyneth Paltrow; a socialite with a manner even more imposing than her name; and a lively menagerie of other New York types.\n\nMr. Ferguson, who began his career in the theater but sources his Broadway-headliner status from his role on ABC’s “Modern Family,” brings such warmth and variety to his performance that you may not notice that in the more than 15 years since the play opened Off Broadway, it has acquired a slightly sour aftertaste.\n\nBack in 1999, the words “income inequality” were not on the lips of every economist, pundit and politician, and Ms. Mode’s dizzy riff on the absurdities of scoring a table at a fashionable restaurant could be enjoyed for what it was: a biting (sorry) comedy about the loopiness of the flowering foodie culture. It remains that, of course, and the trends Ms. Mode was wittily skewering have only increased over the years. Explaining to an out-of-towner the restaurant’s elaborate timing for opening up reservations, Sam patiently says: “We work about three months in advance. On the sixth day of every month, the third month out opens up for reservations.” Gotcha.\n\nBut in the latter days of the last century, you’d have been hard pressed to spend almost $3,000 for dinner for four, even at one of the city’s most expensive restaurants (assuming that you were not a banker who took pride in ordering the most expensive magnum of red). Now that you could probably do so at a few restaurants here — and elsewhere — the harassed and humiliated Sam has a nimbus of pathos around him that lets a little helium out of the humor balloon.\n\nIt’s not so much fun today watching a member of the 99 percent being kicked around by the representatives of the 1 percent. When Sam is forced by the chef to clean up a feces-fouled bathroom, just before arranging the chef’s helicopter pickup, you may feel that guffaw strangled in your throat.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",

Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review praises the lead performance and humor but notes a diminished impact in the Broadway setting. The excerpt suggests a mixed verdict, with positive elements countered by significant reservations. | Gemini: The review praises Ferguson's performance and the play's humor, but notes that it feels 'shrunken' on Broadway and has acquired a 'sour aftertaste'. This suggests a mixed experience, not a clear recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic praises Jesse Tyler Ferguson's warm, lively performance and the show's humor, they ultimately find the material has acquired a 'sour aftertaste' and the production feels 'shrunken' on Broadway, suggesting the transfer from Off-Broadway diminishes the work.",
