  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Mr. Ferguson brings such warmth and variety to his performance that you may not notice that in the more than 15 years since the play opened Off Broadway, it has acquired a slightly sour aftertaste. Back in 1999, the words 'income inequality' were not on the lips of every economist, pundit and politician...Lively as Mr. Ferguson is, and as frequently hilarious as ‘Fully Committed’ can be, it feels shrunken in a Broadway theater.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review praises the lead performance and humor but notes a diminished impact in the Broadway setting. The excerpt suggests a mixed verdict, with positive elements countered by significant reservations. | Gemini: The review praises Ferguson's performance and the play's humor, but notes that it feels 'shrunken' on Broadway and has acquired a 'sour aftertaste'. This suggests a mixed experience, not a clear recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic praises Jesse Tyler Ferguson's warm, lively performance and the show's humor, they ultimately find the material has acquired a 'sour aftertaste' and the production feels 'shrunken' on Broadway, suggesting the transfer from Off-Broadway diminishes the work.",
