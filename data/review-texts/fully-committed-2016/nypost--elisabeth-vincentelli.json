Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Ferguson's performance, suggesting a positive view of his role. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment of the review is unclear, leading to a low confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the lead performer's range and ability to carry the show. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with a lower score and confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Ferguson's ability to carry the production and his impressive range, indicating a clear recommendation based on the lead performance. However, confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation.",
