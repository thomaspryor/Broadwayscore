    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising lead performance with specific detail about his range and transformative ability. However, with only one curated quote available, this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review, so scoring conservatively in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Ferguson's performance, indicating a positive view of his role in the show. However, without more context, it's unclear if the review is overwhelmingly positive or if there are reservations, leading to a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the lead performer's range and ability to carry the show. Given the limited text, it's difficult to gauge the overall recommendation strength, but the positive assessment warrants a score in the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the lead performer's capabilities and range, using words like 'impressive' and noting he can 'carry a show on his own.' However, as a single curated excerpt, it may not reflect the full review's assessment of the overall production.",
