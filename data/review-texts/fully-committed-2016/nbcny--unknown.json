  "bwwExcerpt": "'Modern Family' star Jesse Tyler Ferguson plays 40 roles-some male, some female; some civilized, others obnoxious-in 'Fully Committed,' a riotous one-man Broadway comedy set in the basement of a trendy Manhattan restaurant...This blissfully frenetic expedition takes things to a whole new level...Ultimately, we behold a fascinating evolution, as the beleaguered fella turns the tables on those who've been wounding his spirit. Everyone gets their just, uh, desserts? Revenge is a dish best served cold? Yes, and yes. 'Fully Committed' wraps on a note more satisfying than anything we imagine is actually cooked up at this ridiculous restaurant.",
