Bounding around the stage of the Lyceum Theater, where the play opened on Monday, he jousts with not one or two but three different phones, nearly sweating through his gingham shirt as he gives voice to more than 40 characters, among them the harried but even-tempered central character, Sam; an imperious French maître d’; a patronizing bully of a chef; a chipper assistant to Gwyneth Paltrow; a socialite with a manner even more imposing than her name; and a lively menagerie of other New York types.\n\nMr. Ferguson, who began his career in the theater but sources his Broadway-headliner status from his role on ABC’s “Modern Family,” brings such warmth and variety to his performance that you may not notice that in the more than 15 years since the play opened Off Broadway, it has acquired a slightly sour aftertaste.\n\nBack in 1999, the words “income inequality” were not on the lips of every economist, pundit and politician, and Ms. Mode’s dizzy riff on the absurdities of scoring a table at a fashionable restaurant could be enjoyed for what it was: a biting (sorry) comedy about the loopiness of the flowering foodie culture. It remains that, of course, and the trends Ms. Mode was wittily skewering have only increased over the years. Explaining to an out-of-towner the restaurant’s elaborate timing for opening up reservations, Sam patiently says: “We work about three months in advance. On the sixth day of every month, the third month out opens up for reservations.” Gotcha.\n\nBut in the latter days of the last century, you’d have been hard pressed to spend almost $3,000 for dinner for four, even at one of the city’s most expensive restaurants (assuming that you were not a banker who took pride in ordering the most expensive magnum of red). Now that you could probably do so at a few restaurants here — and elsewhere — the harassed and humiliated Sam has a nimbus of pathos around him that lets a little helium out of the humor balloon.\n\nIt’s not so much fun today watching a member of the 99 percent being kicked around by the representatives of the 1 percent. When Sam is forced by the chef to clean up a feces-fouled bathroom, just before arranging the chef’s helicopter pickup, you may feel that guffaw strangled in your throat.\n\nMs. Mode has updated the play to reflect changes in the restaurant world. Sam now works in a shrine to molecular gastronomy — an exotic, if not unknown, term in 1999 — for a chef who makes appearances on the “Today” show. He fields family calls on a cellphone — it looks as if he will be forced to work over Christmas — which he must place atop a pipe in the cramped basement where he works in order to get any reception. And a rejected caller sweetly threatens him: “Ever heard of a little thing called Yelp?”\n\nBut mostly, the laughs derive from the original source: the frenzied circus that Sam must oversee as he jumps from phone line to phone line, trying to placate callers who really must must must have a table tonight, preferably any time between 7:30 and 8. (And don’t you know who I am?) Sam’s challenge today is particularly formidable because he’s the only reservation taker who managed to show up for his shift.\n\nLike the originator of the role, the terrific Mark Setlock (who helped create the characters, drawn from his own experience), Mr. Ferguson has a wonderfully pliant voice that allows him to change personas within seconds — sometimes less — as he gives us both sides of tense, terse conversations. His snooty maître d’ is as persuasive as his brutish boss. He’s as funny as the assistant to Gwyneth (who needs a table for 15 on Saturday, no “female wait staff,” no legumes) as he is playing the steamroller socialite Carolann Rosenstein-Fishburn, who’s appalled that she has been on hold for fully two minutes and even more disgusted at the execrable music she has been forced to endure while waiting. Some of Ms. Mode’s additions to the menu, as it were, are priceless, as when Sam patiently reads a few of the items being presented tonight: “smoked cuttlefish risotto in a cloud of dry ice infused with pipe tobacco” or “nitro-frozen shaved foie gras enshrouded in a liquid chicken-filled orb.” Preposterous as they sound, I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that she’d culled them from actual dishes.\n\n“Fully Committed” — the trade term for “Sorry, buddy, no table for you” — has been directed by Jason Moore in the necessary pedal-to-the-floor manner. But Mr. Ferguson also has a few legato passages to define the central character with sympathetic grace notes, as in a deflating conversation with a fellow actor boasting about an audition, or, more happily, when Sam learns that he himself has scored a callback from Lincoln Center Theater.\n\nLively as Mr. Ferguson is, and as frequently hilarious as “Fully Committed” can be, it feels shrunken in a Broadway theater. The elaborate set, by Derek McLane, featuring a gleaming backdrop of wine bottles encased behind glass and caressed by light as if they were holy relics, paradoxically exacerbates the problem. Ms. Mode’s small-scale play struck a more succulent note when it was first presented on the small stage of the Vineyard Theater in a much more modest production.\n\nThe production’s top ticket price is $147. Nearly $300 for a pair on the aisle for a 90-minute solo show is not exactly comparable to a $3,000 dinner for four, but it’s uncomfortably close.",
