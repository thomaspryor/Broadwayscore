    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the lead performance as 'appealing' with 'surprising emotional depth,' but lack of full review context and potential cherry-picking requires caution and lower-end Positive scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the lead performance, indicating a positive view of the show. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of broader context, the confidence is low, and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the lead actor's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall recommendation strength is uncertain, so I've assigned a score on the lower end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers warm praise for the lead's solo turn, citing appealing presence and emotional depth. For a one-person show, this constitutes a solid endorsement, though the single-excerpt limitation prevents a higher confidence assessment.",
