However, confidence is low due to limited text from one curated quote that may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Ferguson's performance and describes the show as 'entertaining'. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt calls the show \"entertaining\" and praises Jesse Tyler Ferguson's performance, indicating a positive recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am placing the score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for both the lead performance ('master of quick-change artistry') and the overall production ('entertaining'), clearly recommending the show. However, confidence is reduced due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
