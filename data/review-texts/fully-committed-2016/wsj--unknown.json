  "bwwExcerpt": "The immensely likable Mr. Ferguson doesn't quite have the vocal flexibility necessary to impersonate so widely varied a gallery of characters, and so the tour-de-force aspect of 'Fully Committed' isn't fully realized. Even so, his acting crackles with physical energy and comic life, and it won't take long for you to shelve your doubts and buy into his performance. The play itself is a piece of very well-made fluff, a solo farce whose principal subject is the bottomless vanity of the restaurant's customers (and chef) and in which the laughter is pretty close to nonstop. If it's light entertainment you crave, you're in luck.",
