  "bwwExcerpt": "There are some 40 people in the play and Ferguson voices all of them, from a mafia wiseguy to an imperious Bon Appetit magazine staffer, to an 86-year-old furniture maker to a Park Avenue socialite. He goes from stuffy French to surfer-guy cool in milliseconds. The 90-minute show...is a triumph of voices and athleticism from Ferguson...The amount of concentration required by Ferguson is impressive and director Jason Moore runs a tight ship. One stray ring or bobbled cue could set the whole thing off, but Ferguson runs through 'Fully Committed' surefooted like an Olympian on an obstacle course.",

The language is enthusiastic, indicating a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"triumph\" and praises Ferguson's performance and athleticism. The comparison to an Olympian suggests a high level of skill and success. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise, calling the show a 'triumph' and the performer 'impressive' and 'surefooted like an Olympian,' indicating strong approval. Confidence is low due to the single-excerpt warning about potentially cherry-picked quotes.",
