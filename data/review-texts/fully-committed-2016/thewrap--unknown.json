Which is most theatergoers.\n\n“Fully Committed” receives its first Broadway production, which opened Monday at the Lyceum Theatre, after becoming a surprise Off Broadway hit back in 1999.\n\nFans of this restaurant-reservationist comedy will not be disappointed, and fans of “Modern Family” will be delighted to see Jesse Tyler Ferguson live on stage playing not one character but a few dozen.",
