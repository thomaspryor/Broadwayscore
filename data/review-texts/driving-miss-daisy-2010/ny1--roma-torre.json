    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses highly positive language ('promised land', 'dream team', 'second coming') suggesting strong enthusiasm. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly enthusiastic language, comparing the production to 'the second coming' and describing it as reaching 'theater’s promised land,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, with only a single excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language, suggesting a strong recommendation. Given that it is the only excerpt, the confidence is low, but the language is strong enough to place it in the positive bucket with a high score. | Kimi: The excerpt employs highly enthusiastic language ('promised land', 'dream team', 'second coming'), indicating strong praise. Following the single-excerpt guidance, this is scored at the high end of the Positive bucket, though the language borders on rave territory.",
