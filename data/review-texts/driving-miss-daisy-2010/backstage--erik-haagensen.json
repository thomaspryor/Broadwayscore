  "bwwExcerpt": "It seemed like such a good idea on paper: Vanessa Redgrave and James Earl Jones in 'Driving Miss Daisy.' When the excellent Boyd Gaines was announced to complete the three-person cast of Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize–winning 1987 drama, the project sounded even more promising. So it's with tremendous regret and disappointment that I have to report that, under the puppy-soft direction of the usually reliable David Esbjornson, this 'Daisy' never fully blooms.",
