  "bwwExcerpt": "Ms. Redgrave plays the title character, and Mr. Jones her chauffeur, in David Esbjornson's revival of Alfred Uhry's 1987 play. If the production's stars feel squeezed or confined by what is a very slender work, they never let on. They give responsible, intelligent performances that are infused with two old pros' joy in the mastery of their craft. And they pull off the deft trick of registering as big as we want them to be without making the play in which they appear seem even smaller than it is.",
