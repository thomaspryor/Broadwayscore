  "fullText": "That’s clearly an opportunity not to be missed by canny producers, not when it’s such a beloved property and scene-stealing showcase for older actors — thus the new Broadway production co-starring Vanessa Redgrave and James Earl Jones, with four-time Tony winner Boyd Gaines thrown in for extra insurance. The results are box-office catnip, with the production already racking up hefty weekly grosses.\n\nThe surprising aspect of Alfred Uhry’s work is that it’s such a deceptively simple creation. Running 90 minutes and featuring three characters and a single set, it subtly depicts over many brief scenes spanning about 25 years the slowly evolving friendship between an elderly Southern Jewish white woman and the black man hired to be her chauffeur. Set during the 1950s and ’60s in Atlanta, it can be viewed as a microcosm of the Civil Rights movement that dominated the era.\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Movies\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n 'Cold Storage' Review: Joe Keery, Georgina Campbell and Liam Neeson Make Goofy Sci-Fi Horror Throwback Painless, if Not Priceless \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Movies\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Liam Neeson Stays on the Comedy Path With 'Cold Storage' Trailer, Packed With Zombie Splatter \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n The Bottom Line\n \n \n Vanessa Redgrave and James Earl Jones bring significant star power to this revival of Uhry's perfectly calibrated comic drama.\n\nBut what audiences mostly respond to are the wonderfully rich characters: The proud and flinty Daisy Werthan, the endlessly polite but richly self-assured Hoke Coleburn and Daisy’s exasperated but loving son Boolie.\n\nThe play is a pretty well-indestructible audience-pleasing vehicle, and director David Esbjornson’s production, only slightly more elaborate than the bare-bones 1987 off-Broadway original, does nothing to tamper with it.\n\nThat being said, it should be pointed out the casting is somewhat problematic, especially for those with strong memories of Dana Ivey and Morgan Freeman in the original stage production and Freeman and the Oscar-winning Jessica Tandy in the film.\n\nRedgrave certainly is perfectly suited to portray Daisy’s steely self-determination and willful stubbornness, but the still physically imposing actress far less credibly conveys the fragility and vulnerability that afflict the character as the years pass, and her Southern accent has a way of coming and going.\n\nJones, too, seems a little off. His Hoke is much less initially courtly and deferential than Freeman’s, displaying a self-assured bluster from the beginning. The result is that there is less dramatic impact in pivotal scenes like when Hoke, ordered by Miss Daisy to keep driving even though he has to go to the bathroom, finally rebels and asserts his independence.\n\nStill, despite any quibbles, it remains a pleasure to watch these two old pros at work, and Gaines, as usual, is an absolute delight, more than keeping up with his older co-stars.\n\nAlready selling out for its limited engagement, this “Daisy,” with the proper recasting, could be driving on Broadway for a long time to come.\n\nVenue: Golden Theatre, New York (Through Jan. 29)\n Presented by: Jed Bernstein, Adam Zotovich, Elizabeth Ireland McCann, Roger Berlind, Beth Kloiber, Albert Nicciolino, Jon B.

The text is truncated, so the final verdict may be missing, lowering confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges casting issues but ultimately concludes it's a pleasure to watch the leads. The final line suggests it could run longer with recasting, indicating a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic identifies significant casting weaknesses in Redgrave and Jones compared to previous productions, he ultimately praises the play as 'well-indestructible' and the production as a 'pleasure to watch,' indicating a positive recommendation with reservations.",
