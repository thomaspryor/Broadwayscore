  "bwwExcerpt": "In Mr. Esjornson's staging, the final scene—Daisy revealed, alone in a wheelchair—is stunning; it brings a tear to even a hardened theater critic's eye. Throughout, indeed, one's heart is warmed. But there's also nothing in the play that's tough or unexpected or genuinely thrilling. But that's what Miss Daisy likes: a smooth, easy ride.",
