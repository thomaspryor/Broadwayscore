  "bwwExcerpt": "A 'little play' in that its emotions are understated and its brief scenes are mostly everyday situations, 'Driving Miss Daisy' could easily be overwhelmed by actors of such magnificence as Redgrave and Jones, but they unerringly provide honest and nicely-detailed performances that befit the modest story.",
