  "bwwExcerpt": "Jones gives a performance that I'd classify as one of the ten or so best I've ever seen in the theatre. Hoke is in his blood, it seems, and he reveals this man with respect and compassion and a deep understanding that helps us appreciate not just his place in the play but the place of men like Hoke in our country's history. His Hoke is certainly funny, wise, and canny; but he's so much more than that! Moments when Hoke feels Miss Daisy's thoughtless bigotry are galvanizing. Moments when he exposes himself, out from behind a pose of subservience that's second nature to him, are wrenching. He gets Hoke's dialect exactly right, to my ear, and also his posture and walk, which slows ever so gradually as time passes and Hoke becomes an octogenarian himself. It's a privilege to see this fine, fine actor at work.",
