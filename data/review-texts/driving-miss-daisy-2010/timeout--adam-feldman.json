  "bwwExcerpt": "Vanessa Redgrave is a world-class actor, but she has little business playing Daisy Werthan—or rather, she has too much business, in the sense of fussy stage activity. From the first scene, which she spends whipping up a cake, to the last, in which she screws her face into a cartoon of wizened mischief, she never quite jells into personhood. Her deracinated Daisy verges on hokey; and so it falls to Jones’s slightly dazed Hoke to give their relationship the requisite depth. Hale and booming, the actor is in fine fettle—though, at nearly 80, long-toothed for the part—and his imposing presence lends poignancy to Hoke’s solicitude and dignity to his growing self-respect. His scenes with the reliable Boyd Gaines, as Daisy’s son, have an enjoyable rhythm. But without a strong connection between the odd couple at its core, the play putters along as little more than a star vehicle, and one in which Jones does most of the driving.",
