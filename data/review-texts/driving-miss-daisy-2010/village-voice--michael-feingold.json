  "bwwExcerpt": "What unbalances David Esbjornson's sensitively shaped production is, improbably, Redgrave: Her painstakingly detailed quietude and delicacy as Daisy, carefully underplayed to fit what's probably a quite valid concept of the era's notion of ladylike gentility, put the character in a softer focus, reducing her power. And though Daisy can't drive the car, she must drive half the play. Instead, Redgrave's results, though never false, seem cautious and deferential. She leaves the way open for Jones, who builds from his own distinctive persona a spectacularly solid performance of Hoke, wholly different from Freeman's unforgettable work yet every bit as convincing. Even more surprisingly, Redgrave's reticence grants space for Gaines to render Daisy's son, Boolie—no more than a necessary functionary in earlier productions—as a figure of both three-dimensionality and significance.",
