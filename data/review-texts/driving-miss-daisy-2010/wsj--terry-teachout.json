  "bwwExcerpt": "With that sole exception, this is as fine a production of 'Driving Miss Daisy' as I can imagine. It is so fine, in fact, that I was astonished to be reminded that this is the play's Broadway premiere: The whole of its original 1,195-performance run in New York took place first at Playwrights Horizons and then at the John Houseman Theatre. Fortunately, it is being mounted in one of Broadway's most intimate and well-proportioned spaces, the 804-seat John Golden Theatre. This means, however, that tickets for the 16-week limited engagement of 'Driving Miss Daisy' are going to be hard to obtain, so do whatever you have to do to get one. Perhaps some hotshot at PBS will get the bright idea to tape the production-it would look terrific on TV-but I wouldn't count on it.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Critic expresses pleasant surprise that the production 'works as well as it does' and praises the leads' performances as 'richer and more touching' than their film versions. Since this is a single curated excerpt and sounds clearly positive, scored at upper end of Positive range, but confidence is low due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances by the lead actors, suggesting a positive reception. The use of 'surprise' and 'richer and more touching' indicates a favorable view, despite the limited context. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses surprise that the production works well and praises the actors' performances, suggesting a positive recommendation. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing the score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic expresses genuine surprise at the production's success, praising the lead performances as superior to the acclaimed film version. Despite the caveat that this is a single excerpt, the language ('richer and more touching') indicates clear enthusiasm and a recommendation to see the show.",
