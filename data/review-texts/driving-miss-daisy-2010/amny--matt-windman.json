  "bwwExcerpt": "While Redgrave barely comes across as a southern Jewish woman, she convincingly stresses Daisy's restless spirit. Jones, on the other hand, provides a congenial counterpart with an undercurrent of pain. Gaines, as Daisy's son, is credibly worn-out and frustrated by his mother's relentless demands.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt focuses on performance praise with one mild criticism. Limited text suggests qualified positive assessment but insufficient context for confident scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a mixed assessment, noting some convincing performances but also highlighting a lack of authenticity in Redgrave's portrayal. The single excerpt and lack of a clear positive or negative verdict suggest a mixed review. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the performances, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses. Given the limited text, it's difficult to gauge the overall recommendation strength, but the positive aspects suggest a mildly positive score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the cast's work, acknowledging one significant casting limitation while commending the emotional resonance of the performances, suggesting a solid but measured recommendation consistent with the lower end of the Positive range.",
