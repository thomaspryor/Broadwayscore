  "bwwExcerpt": "Indeed, Nyong'o proved as compelling and radiant in person as on screen. But the play, despite other enthusiastic reviews, struck me as an earnest, heavy-handed labor of love - sincere and worthy but a dramatically simplistic look at the oppression of women as a weapon of war. Gurira - who, incidentally, plays Michonne in 'The Walking Dead' - wrote this after interviewing women in Liberia. Nyong'o was an understudy in a 2009 Yale Repertory Theatre production while still a student.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Heartfelt, modest, occasionally clunky...The Broadway showcase magnifies both the strengths and the weaknesses of the play. On the positive side are portrayals that have deepened in complexity and nuance over the months...Gurira wants us to understand the awful choices available to these women. But the storytelling gets weighed down in message and metaphor when explaining the women peacemakers who actually did forge the peace accord in 2003 that led to democratic elections.\"\n\nRead more"
