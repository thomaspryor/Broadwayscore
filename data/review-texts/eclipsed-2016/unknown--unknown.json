And although the events it depicts happened more than a decade ago, the play resonates powerfully today...Ms. Gurira’s play, directed with clarity and force by Liesl Tommy, reminds us of something profoundly important, and perhaps too easily forgotten amid our own country’s continuing racial troubles: African lives matter.\"\n\nRead more",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"harrowing power\", \"shines with compassion\", and \"profoundly important\". Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the play's emotional power, compassion, and contemporary relevance, with specific commendation for the direction. While the language is clearly enthusiastic ('shines,' 'profoundly important'), the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the full review's verdict.",
