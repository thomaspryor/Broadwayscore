  "bwwExcerpt": "All the actresses are superb, but it's the Girl who's at the center of the evening. Nyong'o, with her expressive eyes, fully captures her fear and uncertainty, from the heart-tugging sadness when she's summoned to the commander's bed to the unsettling combination of terror and eagerness when she decides to cast her lot with Number Two and become a soldier. It's a splendid performance.",
