  "bwwExcerpt": "It's a common lament that there are no good roles for women. But Danai Gurira, a playwright and actress known as Michonne on 'The Walking Dead,' has packed this harrowing, albeit sometimes heavy-handed, 2008 drama with five of them....Liesl Tommy's taut staging provides an excellent showcase for the play. The cast is uniformly very good and while performances have deepened and feel more lived-in uptown, there are still few moments - light and serious - when individuals tilt toward being overly showy, as though they're performing. Despite that, plus a few music miscues at a recent performance, the play is unsettling and eye-opening.",
