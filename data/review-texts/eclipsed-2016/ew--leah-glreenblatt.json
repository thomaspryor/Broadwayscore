  "bwwExcerpt": "[Nyong'o] is captivating to watch, as are all the women in the cast, even when the script doesn't quite rise up to meet them. If the first half can sometimes feel too baggy and broadly-played, and the second almost seems to rush through its most affecting moments, the overall impact is still startling. Gurira, whose parents emigrated from Zimbabwe, and the Kenyan-raised Nyong'o obviously shouldn't have to carry the weight of representing their entire continent for a Western audience on Golden's stage. But Eclipsed does open a window on a world we rarely get to see this intimately, and they deliver it so gracefully that the play's flaws feel less consequential than the resonating force of its story.
