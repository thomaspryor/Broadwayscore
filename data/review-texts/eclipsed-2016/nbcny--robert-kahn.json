  "bwwExcerpt": "'Eclipsed' is a colorful and fiery drama, and one that no doubt stands bracingly apart from ordinary Broadway fare. But there's more here than just that....The performances are top-notch. I loved Nyong'o, who is vulnerable, comical and charismatic, as a still-malleable girl on the cusp of womanhood. I was touched, as well, by Sengboh and Armand, who are torn between the enemy they know, and the uncertainties of a life without his protection.",
