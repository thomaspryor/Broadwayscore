  "bwwExcerpt": "Plays about the different ways women choose to respond to institutionalized rape during wartime are not standard Broadway fare, and ECLIPSE's transfer from its October-opening run at The Public Theater, should be considered a major achievement, no doubt accelerated by the facts that the playwright is known for her acting role on the popular television series THE WALKING DEAD, and one-fifth of its superb ensemble is Academy Award-winner Lupita Nyong'o.",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights the play's achievement in reaching Broadway and praises the ensemble, suggesting a positive, though potentially qualified, recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the Broadway transfer as a 'major achievement' and praises the 'superb ensemble,' indicating strong approval, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full review's verdict.",
