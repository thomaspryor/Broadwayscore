  "bwwExcerpt": "Nyong'o loses herself utterly in the searing and stunning play 'Eclipsed,' which opened Sunday at the Golden Theatre, also marking the important Broadway bows for playwright Danai Gurira and director Liesl Tommy. Oscar-winner Nyong'o ('12 Years A Slave') plays a 15-year-old known only as The Girl who finds herself enslaved in a rebel compound during a bloody civil war in Africa. The five-member cast - all women - is a true ensemble and must not be missed.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Nyong'o loses herself utterly in the searing and stunning play 'Eclipsed'...The five-member cast—all women—is a true ensemble and must not be missed...Gurira draws very human portraits of these women, and the audience will be stunned to find itself laughing as they joke in such hell...Gurira's work has been unfairly eclipsed by Lynn Nottage's 'Ruined', which shares some themes and came out at the same time, but this production proves it is an extraordinary work that shines and shines.\"\n\nRead more"
