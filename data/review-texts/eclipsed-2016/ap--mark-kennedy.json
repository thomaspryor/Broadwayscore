  "bwwExcerpt": "Nyong'o loses herself utterly in the searing and stunning play 'Eclipsed,' which opened Sunday at the Golden Theatre, also marking the important Broadway bows for playwright Danai Gurira and director Liesl Tommy. Oscar-winner Nyong'o ('12 Years A Slave') plays a 15-year-old known only as The Girl who finds herself enslaved in a rebel compound during a bloody civil war in Africa. The five-member cast - all women - is a true ensemble and must not be missed.",
