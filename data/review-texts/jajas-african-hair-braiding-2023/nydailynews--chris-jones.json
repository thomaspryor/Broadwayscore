  "fullText": "The show curtain has a picture guide for the uninitiated: box braids, corn rows, micro braids, Ghana braids, tree braids. Even, if you’re lucky and the stylist is in the right mood, kinky twists.\n\nAll of these looks can be found at JaJa’s, the Harlem hair-braiding emporium at the heart of the very lively new Broadway play from Jocelyn Bioh, as directed by Whitney White and co-produced by Manhattan Theatre Club and the commercial producer Madison Wells Live.\n\nThere have been many shows — comedies like “Steel Magnolias,” whodunits like “Shear Madness,” even operas like “The Factotum” — set in barber’s shops and hair salons over the years.\n\nPeople come and go but stick around long enough to share their problems and reveal their personalities. Workplace conversations take place everywhere, but salons, usually dominated by folks of a single gender, make it a specialty. Plus there’s something especially intimate about somebody manipulating your hair: crabby customers become confessors and stylists become sardonic shrinks.\n\nSalons are usually havens for gossip, always good for a laugh. But as we see in this show, they can also be safe spaces.\n\n“JaJa’s African Hair Braiding,” which is a most fun 90 minutes, has the benefit of hair braiding being a long and complex process, requiring great manual dexterity on the part of the stylist. And, of course, it’s long been the province of solo entrepreneurs, like the women who hold down the chairs in this Harlem salon catering not just to Black Americans but to immigrant women from Africa, many of whom are experts in this craft.\n\nBoh’s play is what you might call closely observed; so much so, you suspect the author, who is Ghanaian-American, has spent plenty of quality time in hair-braiding spots on 125th St., where prices are established with your stylist only outside the shop so no one hears them but the two parties involved. The show is meticulous in its recreation of this business, from the use of wigs (by Nikia Mathis) to the authenticity of the props. Braiders, the play posits, have a common skill but a very broad variety of techniques and personalities.\n\nIn this play, the audience spends a day at JaJa’s, from the moment the metal shutters rise on David Zinn’s hyper-realistic setting to when they fall along with the sun. You hang with the shop’s Senegalese namesake (Somi Kakoma), her college-bound daughter Marie (Dominique Thorne), braider on steroids Ndidi (Maechi Aharanwa), who makes the most ka-ching, and dramatic braider Bea (Zenzi Williams), a Ghanan gossip with a killer personality.\n\nThe moral heart of the story is Miriam, warmly played by Brittany Adebumola, a quieter spirit but the character who most embodies what Boh clearly sees as the role of this shop in the lives of the women who work there.\n\nAdd in the customers, some kind, some rude, and you got the picture. Nothing earth-shattering occurs, no floods nor real-time murders. Not even that much conflict that cannot be worked out later. This is an ensemble piece, a collection of character studies, a bubbly slice of the uptown hair-braiding life.\n\nBy design, clearly. You don’t need to be a Black woman with braids to enjoy this play. Heck, it might teach you something about the intricacies of a craft you only have observed from afar. But this play is also trying to reach a Black popular audience, long ignored by Broadway.\n\nIt took producers a while but there are signs in this still-young season that many have finally figured out that many of the audience members they want to reach are not looking for dramas about pain, aimed mostly at white audiences, but affirmative experiences that offer laughs at human foibles and celebrate doing something really well, day in, day out.\n\n“JaJa’s” is a comedy about life as it is lived in this place, about community, aspiration, entrepreneurship.\n\nMostly, though, it’s a show about immigrants getting the job done, and having fun doing it, one braid at a time.",
