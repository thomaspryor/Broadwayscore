  "dtliExcerpt": "By design, clearly. You don’t need to be a Black woman with braids to enjoy this play. Heck, it might teach you something about the intricacies of a craft you only have observed from afar. But this play is also trying to reach a Black popular audience, long ignored by Broadway.",

The tone suggests a positive experience, but without stronger language, it indicates a solid recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on positive aspects of the show, highlighting its comedic nature and celebration of community and immigrant experiences. The aggregator verdict also indicates a positive reception.",
