    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('inviting', 'so right', Tony Award worthy) with praise for ensemble and design. Single excerpt warning and truncated text require low confidence, but positive tone is evident. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the ensemble acting and design, and concludes with a strong positive statement about the overall production. Despite the lack of full context, the tone suggests a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the cast, the world-building, and overall quality of the show. The phrase \"so much else is so right\" indicates a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the ensemble and design as Tony-worthy, defending the show's tonal choices and calling the work 'so right,' indicating a clear recommendation despite being a single curated quote.",
