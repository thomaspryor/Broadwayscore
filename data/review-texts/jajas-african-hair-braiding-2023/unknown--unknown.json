  "showScoreExcerpt": "“There are no easy answers to the complex problems that ‘Jaja's African Hair Braiding’ presents, and certainly none that can be solved within the span of a single day. Instead, the play encourages viewers to inspect the way the current world works and, hopefully, leave its salon with a greater sense of compassion and understanding for those around them tirelessly working to make ends meet.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt suggests the play succeeds in its thematic goals and provides meaningful value to viewers, though the conservative score reflects the limited text available and potential for cherry-picking from a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the play is thought-provoking and aims to inspire compassion and understanding, indicating a positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive message and encourages viewers to see the play for its insightful perspective. However, the single excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation language lead to a score in the middle of the 'Positive' bucket.",
