    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('love letter', 'remarkable precision') suggests clear praise for both the play's content and craft. Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds clearly positive, so scoring in upper Positive range (80-84). Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation of the play, praising the script's precision and its thematic focus. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed on the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the script and its portrayal of African women, indicating a positive but limited view. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly positive language ('love letter', 'remarkable precision') indicating clear approval of the script and subject matter, placing it in the upper Positive range despite limited context.",
