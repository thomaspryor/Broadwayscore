    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single curated excerpt uses strong positive language ('wonderful portrait') but extremely limited text makes full assessment impossible. Scored in upper Positive range due to unqualified praise in available quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation, describing the show as 'wonderful'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low and the score is set at the lower end of the positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is strongly positive, using the word 'wonderful'. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('wonderful portrait'), placing it in the upper Positive range, though confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated quote.",
