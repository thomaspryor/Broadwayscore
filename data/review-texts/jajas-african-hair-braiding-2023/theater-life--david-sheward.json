The dialogue sizzles and the fiery cast studiously avoids stereotypes in their lively limning...Jaja’s shop may be a familiar one, but it’s a snappy, joyful place to spend an hour and a half.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite single excerpt warning, text shows clear appreciation for writing, performances, and overall experience with 'snappy, joyful' verdict. Low confidence due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the dialogue and cast, describing the show as 'snappy' and 'joyful'. Despite the potential for cliches, the characters are multi-dimensional. This suggests a strong positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses positive language such as \"sizzles,\" \"fiery cast,\" \"lively limning,\" \"snappy,\" and \"joyful,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing the score at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains enthusiastic praise for the dialogue ('sizzles'), characters ('multi-dimensional'), and cast ('fiery'), with an explicit recommendation to see the show. Despite slight acknowledgment of familiar elements, the tone is clearly positive and warrants an upper-range score per single-excerpt guidelines.",
