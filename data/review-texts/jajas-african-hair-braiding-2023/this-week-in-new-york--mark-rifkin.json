    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise for the direction and overall production quality. However, confidence is low due to limited text availability and potential for cherry-picking from aggregator. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction and thematic exploration, indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, and the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"celebrating individuality\", \"uproarious comedy\", and \"sincerity and grace\". Given the single excerpt warning, I am placing the score at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strongly positive evaluative language ('lovingly directed', 'uproarious comedy'), placing it in the upper Positive range, though confidence is reduced due to limited text availability.",
