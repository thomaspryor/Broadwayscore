  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Under the sure hand of director Whitney White, ’Jaja's African Hair Braiding’ is an altogether terrific ensemble piece. The cast members embrace the all-for-one, one-for-all togetherness that touches the heart amid the comic elements that Bioh is so good at providing for us. A final shout-out to Dede Ayite, whose costume designs are a splendid mix of American casual and African-inspired looks, and a huge round of applause for the incredible work by hair and wig designer Nikiya Mathis.”\n\nRead more",
