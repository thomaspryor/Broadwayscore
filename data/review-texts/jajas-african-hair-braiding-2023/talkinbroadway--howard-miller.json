  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Under the sure hand of director Whitney White, ’Jaja's African Hair Braiding’ is an altogether terrific ensemble piece. The cast members embrace the all-for-one, one-for-all togetherness that touches the heart amid the comic elements that Bioh is so good at providing for us. A final shout-out to Dede Ayite, whose costume designs are a splendid mix of American casual and African-inspired looks, and a huge round of applause for the incredible work by hair and wig designer Nikiya Mathis.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'altogether terrific' with appreciation for direction, performances, and design. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction, ensemble cast, and design elements, indicating a strong positive review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"terrific ensemble piece\" and praises the director and designers, indicating a positive review. Given the limited excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive tone warrants a score on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the direction, ensemble, and design using words like 'terrific' and 'splendid,' warranting a high Positive score. Confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review.",
