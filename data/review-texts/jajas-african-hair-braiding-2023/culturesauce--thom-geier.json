  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The comedy recedes to explore more serious issues about immigration, racism and the exploitation of women. The substitution of the stylist’s chair for a soapbox is rather abrupt, and not entirely convincing. But it helps that Bioh has weaved her big-hearted dramedy from such strong roots, with characters who seem like flesh and blood.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed assessment - praises character development and 'big-hearted dramedy' but criticizes abrupt tonal shifts as 'not entirely convincing.' Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights both positive elements (strong roots, flesh and blood characters) and criticisms (abrupt, not entirely convincing). The lack of a full review and potential cherry-picking of the quote suggest a mixed review with some positive aspects. | Gemini: The review acknowledges some issues but ultimately suggests the play is a \"big-hearted dramedy\" with strong characters, indicating a mildly positive recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: Single excerpt criticizes the abrupt tonal shift to serious themes as unconvincing, but praises the play as 'big-hearted' with realistic characters, indicating a qualified recommendation in the lower Positive range. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
