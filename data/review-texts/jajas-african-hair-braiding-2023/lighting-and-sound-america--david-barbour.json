  "showScoreExcerpt": "“With its workplace setting, Jaja's African Hair Braiding recalls any number of plays, including Steel Magnolias and Thoughts of a Colored Man, but it offers a distinctive atmosphere and an often-uproarious sense of humor. It also has something pointed and troubling to say about our broken immigration system…[the play] gets us to fall in love with these skilled, funny, contentious, and thoroughly independent women, then reminds us how easily their talents and spirits can be squandered in our so-called land of opportunity. It's an argument we can't hear enough right now and Bioh makes it with uncommon eloquence.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('distinctive atmosphere', 'often-uproarious', 'uncommon eloquence') with substantive praise for both entertainment value and social impact. Single excerpt warning suggests this could be cherry-picked, but the consistent praise throughout warrants upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play's humor, atmosphere, and message, describing it as distinctive and eloquent. Despite the single excerpt warning, the positive tone suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the play's distinctive atmosphere, humor, and eloquence, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I've scored it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the play's uproarious humor, emotional depth, and thematic eloquence regarding immigration, though as a single curated quote it may not capture potential reservations elsewhere in the full review.",
