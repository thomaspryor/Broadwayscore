  "showScoreExcerpt": "“With its workplace setting, Jaja's African Hair Braiding recalls any number of plays, including Steel Magnolias and Thoughts of a Colored Man, but it offers a distinctive atmosphere and an often-uproarious sense of humor. It also has something pointed and troubling to say about our broken immigration system…[the play] gets us to fall in love with these skilled, funny, contentious, and thoroughly independent women, then reminds us how easily their talents and spirits can be squandered in our so-called land of opportunity. It's an argument we can't hear enough right now and Bioh makes it with uncommon eloquence.”\n\nRead more",
