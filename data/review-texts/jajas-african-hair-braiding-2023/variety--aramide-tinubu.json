  "fullText": "Hair is sacred to Black women, as are the institutions that shift and mold our tresses, styling them for seasons and occasions. Beauty salons are staples in the Black community, but the braiding shop is a particular type of pillar that draws in Black women and femmes from across the diaspora to one central location. Sitting for hours or even a whole day getting their hair neatly tucked into box braids or cornrows, the experiences and expectations of customers become interwoven with the lives of the ladies who work there.",
  "bwwExcerpt": "The beauty of “Jaja’s African Hair Braiding” is the play’s ability to bring life to a seemingly mundane space. On the set designed by David Zinn, the salon’s walls are painted a deep, robust pink, with bags of braiding hair hanging along the walls. The television screen propped near the ceiling displays Afrobeats music videos or a Nollywood movie more enticing than anything seen in the theaters recently. Carts full of combs, braiding gel and oil sheen sliding over the floor feel familiar to any",
