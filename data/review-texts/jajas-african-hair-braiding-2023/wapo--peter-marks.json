  "bwwExcerpt": "The playwright does at the end of this wickedly entertaining evening give in to the urge to highlight her characters’ plights a bit too baldly (sorry). Other than that, though, she and White so skillfully orchestrate her workplace comedy that you’re put in mind of the beauty parlor in “Steel Magnolias,” or, more potently, of a master such as August Wilson portraying the cabbies dispatched from a Pittsburgh storefront in “Jitney.”",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"“This bittersweet facet of the play seems to be token Bioh’s not-so-sunny perspective, which emerges as the 95 minutes of ‘Jaja’s’ wind down, when she introduces a harsher reality...You sense in her fate the dramatist’s anger, as she pulls the rug of joy out from under ‘Jaja’s’ and forces us to confront a colder truth about the dangers immigrants face. The customers’ braids may hold, it seems, even when the braider’s life unravels.”\n\"",
