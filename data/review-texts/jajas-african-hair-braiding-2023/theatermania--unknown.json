  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "After years of analyzing plays for their achievements and blunders, it's rare for me to walk out of a theater with a single thought in my mind: I loved it. And yet those three words floated in my brain after Jocelyn Bioh's new Broadway comedy Jaja's African Hair Braiding at Manhattan Theatre Club's Friedman Theatre.",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Rave range. | Gemini: The critic explicitly states \"I loved it\" which indicates a very positive reaction and strong recommendation, placing it in the Rave bucket.",
