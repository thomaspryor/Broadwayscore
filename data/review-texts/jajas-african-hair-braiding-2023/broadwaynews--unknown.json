However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses positive language like \"refreshing\" and \"vibrant,\" suggesting a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. Given the single excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation, I'm scoring towards the lower end of the positive range.",
