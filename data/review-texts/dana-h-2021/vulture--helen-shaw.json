    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The text describes the show as experimental and boundary-pushing, but offers no clear evaluative stance on whether audiences should see it. 'Fever dream' could be positive or negative. This appears to be a fragment or excerpt lacking the critic's actual recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as experimental and boundary-pushing, which suggests a mixed reception. The lack of traditional play elements may not appeal to all audiences, indicating a neutral stance. | Gemini: The review describes the show as an experiment that pushes boundaries, which suggests a positive but potentially unconventional experience. The comparison to a \"fever dream\" implies it may not be for everyone, hence the recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The language praises the show's experimental ambition ('pushes the boundaries'), though the brief excerpt prevents determining if this experimentation fully succeeds or if the 'fever dream' quality is ultimately appealing. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
