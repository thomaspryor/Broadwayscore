  "bwwExcerpt": "It's hard to imagine a performer more suited than O'Connell for such a meticulous symphony of pain, regret, damage-all grounded in oceanic empathy and strength. O'Connell's trademark aura is Aunt Who Has Seen Some Shit: She's twelve-stepped, gotten out of a cult, probably pulled a gun. This outstanding actress, incapable of an inauthentic moment, uses her repertoire of weary smiles, fleeting winces, grimaces and wry humor to blend seamlessly with the audio track.",
