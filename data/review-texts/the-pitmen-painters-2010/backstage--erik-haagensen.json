  "bwwExcerpt": "Lee Hall's 'The Pitmen Painters' is a bit like the art made by its characters: Whatever it lacks in technique it more than makes up for in expression. If the characters are sometimes too predictable and the sentiment a bit thick, that doesn't prevent the two-and-a-half-hour play from being thoroughly entertaining.",
