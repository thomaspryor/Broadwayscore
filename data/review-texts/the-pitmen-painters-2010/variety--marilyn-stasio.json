  "bwwExcerpt": "Here it is, only the beginning of a new theater season, and Broadway already has a feel-good -- make that a feel-great -- hit in 'The Pitmen Painters.' Scribe Lee Hall draws on the same inspirational themes that served him so well in 'Billy Elliot the Musical' with this heartbreakingly funny play about a group of Northumberland coal miners who in 1934 sign up for a union-sponsored art appreciation course and become the darlings of the U.K. art set. Max Roberts' helming is flawless, and bully for Equity for preserving the extraordinary ensemble of character actors from the original British production.",
