  "bwwExcerpt": "Fairly absorbing in content, Hall's patchy drama about plain blokes transformed by art is somewhat by-the-numbers in its episodic construction, complete with a comedy scene involving a nude model (Lisa McGrillis). If the story at times is predictable and the conclusion doesn't resonate, Hall's realistic, frequently humorous writing is agreeable although some passages about art and allegory get a bit thick.",
