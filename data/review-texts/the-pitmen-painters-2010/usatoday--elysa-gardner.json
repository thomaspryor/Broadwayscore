  "bwwExcerpt": "Suffice to say that Shaw, this ain't. Hall fairly bludgeons us with his populist message, and the characters can border on cartoonish in their conformity to broad, familiar stereotypes. Still, the actors are game and adroit; standouts include Michael Hodgson, wryly appealing as a wisecracking socialist, and Brian Lonsdale, who does deft double duty as the unemployed young man and an effete painter.",
