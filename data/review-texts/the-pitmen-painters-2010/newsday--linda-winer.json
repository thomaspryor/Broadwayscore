  "bwwExcerpt": "The work, which began at the same area's Live Theatre in 2007 and became a London hit with the original actors and company director Max Roberts, has come to Broadway to tell another inspirational story and to be one. At least, that is the script with a happy ending. Unfortunately, despite fine performances, 'Pitmen Painters' is mild-mannered, talky and scattershot. Instead of firing up what should be a compelling chunk of art and social history, Hall weighs it down with dull exchanges, repetitious statements about the meaning of art and, ultimately, a confusing message about the significance of the group.",
