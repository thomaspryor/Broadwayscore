  "bwwExcerpt": "Some liberties are taken by Hall in telling his story. The initially unsophisticated miners are in virtually no time well versed in artistic parlance and technically proficient with the paint brush. Such poetic license in telling a story that spans some 14 years is expected. And while the working class miners are generally portrayed with respect, there are the perfunctory 'fish out of water' jokes throughout the play.",
