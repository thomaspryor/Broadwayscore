  "bwwExcerpt": "Oliver's scenes with Lyon and Helen tremble with a yearning and awkwardness, infused with a crippling class consciousness and a subliminal eroticism that dare not identify itself. In those moments 'The Pitmen Painters' stops being an 'on the one hand/ on the other hand' lecture; it becomes excitingly ambiguous, in-the-moment theater, as rich and intriguing as Art (as we are told here) is meant to be.",

  "fullText": "The debating never stops for the title characters of \"The Pitmen Painters,\" Lee Hall's feisty adult education class — I mean history play — about a group of aesthetically adventurous miners in Northern England. These are among the questions posed, and answered and considered and fought over, many times. (By all means, feel free to take out a pencil and jot down your own responses):\n\n“The Pitmen Painters”: Christopher Connel, far left; David Whitaker; Deka Walmsley; Michael Hodgson; and Ian Kelly at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater.\n\nJust what is art? Does its meaning lie in itself or in those who look at it? Can art, or should art, be political, and if so, how is that achieved? What are the merits of abstract versus representational art? What is the difference between a work of art's worth and its value?\n\nBut the question that feels most pertinent to this play, which opened on Thursday night at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, has to do with individually representing real-life characters who are best known for being part of a group. This issue, too, is addressed many times in Mr. Hall's drama, at least indirectly.\n\nAs one of the paintbrush-wielding miners says, after hearing a speech celebrating his achievements and those of his fellow working-class artists: \"It's easy for people outside to see us as a bunch of miners. But we don't see ourselves as that. We see ourselves as individuals, don't we?\"\n\nMr. Hall, who wrote the screenplay for \"Billy Elliot\" and the book and lyrics for the musical it inspired, is brave to raise this issue. For in doing so, he is laying bare a problem he has not been able to solve as a dramatist. All of the men (and the two women) in this well-acted British production, imported to Broadway by the Manhattan Theater Club with its original director (Max Roberts) and cast, have surface traits and quirks to call their own. Yet only one of them could be considered a fully defined character. Otherwise, they're a set of human talking points in period costume.\n\nThe British theater seems to be doing its damnedest to school Broadway theatergoers in 20th-century art. Last season gave us the Donmar Warehouse production of John Logan's \"Red,\" the Tony-winning drama about the abstract painter Mark Rothko. Now there is \"The Pitmen Painters,\" inspired by William Feaver's book about the Ashington Group, which emerged out of an art appreciation class in a provincial Northumberland coal town in the 1930s and '40s.\n\nCertainly there is much to admire in \"The Pitmen Painters,\" a popular success in its native land, where it moved from the Live Theater, in Newcastle Upon Tyne, to the National Theater in London, where I saw it two years ago. Written partly in response to cuts in arts endowments and education, \"Pitmen\" belongs to a fine old British tradition of establishment-challenging theater. And there's no denying that Mr. Hall makes a valiant case for art as a fruitful stimulant to sleepy minds.\n\nA Room for Debate forum on why voters with a libertarian streak are turning away from the movement.\n\nMichelle Goldberg and Jeff Sharlet debate Christine O'Donnell's remarks about witchcraft.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Brantley acknowledges much to admire and praises the well-acted production, but identifies a fundamental dramatic flaw - that characters are 'human talking points' rather than fully defined individuals. The review balances appreciation with significant reservations about the play's effectiveness as drama. | Gemini: The review acknowledges admirable qualities but ultimately finds the characters underdeveloped and the overall impact lacking. It's neither a strong recommendation nor a strong discouragement. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the production is well-acted and finds merit in the play's ideas about art and class, but fundamentally criticizes the lack of character development, viewing the miners as dramatic devices rather than fully realized individuals. The text appears truncated at the end, creating uncertainty about the final verdict.",
