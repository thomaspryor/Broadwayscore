  "bwwExcerpt": "Oliver's scenes with Lyon and Helen tremble with a yearning and awkwardness, infused with a crippling class consciousness and a subliminal eroticism that dare not identify itself. In those moments 'The Pitmen Painters' stops being an 'on the one hand/ on the other hand' lecture; it becomes excitingly ambiguous, in-the-moment theater, as rich and intriguing as Art (as we are told here) is meant to be.",
