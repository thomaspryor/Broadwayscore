The critic finds the story effective overall. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges a potential flaw (overly sentimental) but ultimately praises the play for its success in delivering a moving story, indicating a positive recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, noting the play tells a moving story. However, it also mentions the play occasionally threatens to become overly sentimental, indicating a reservation. | Kimi: While the critic notes occasional sentimentality, the clear verdict is that the play succeeds and delivers a moving story, constituting a solid recommendation.",
