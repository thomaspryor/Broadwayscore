  "bwwExcerpt": "How they come to express themselves on canvas at the urging of a local art professor (Ian Kelly) is a livelier dramatic springboard than what happens after their work is discovered by the press and some wealthy patrons. So the first half of this enjoyably acted piece, directed by Max Roberts, is the better one. Still, there is enough intriguing biography here to justify the production's having landed on these shores from its starting point in England's North.",
