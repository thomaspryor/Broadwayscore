  "bwwExcerpt": "There’s another dimension to this story that adds to the 'Pitmen' lore. All eight actors in the show hail from the same mining region where the play is set. And they've stayed with it since the play debuted there three years ago. And each of these loyal performers, like their characters, are phenomenal talents. They're also astute critics because they knew they had the makings of a masterpiece on their hands.",
