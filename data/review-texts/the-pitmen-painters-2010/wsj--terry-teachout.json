  "bwwExcerpt": "You may have guessed that I didn't expect to like 'The Pitmen Painters,' which by all rights should have been ludicrously heavy-handed. Sometimes it is, but more often Mr. Hall has rung fresh changes on his familiar formulas, and the result is a satisfying piece of entertainment that makes its points without leaving you too badly bruised about the head and shoulders.",
