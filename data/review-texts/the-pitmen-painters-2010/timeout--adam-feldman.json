  "bwwExcerpt": "The play is less mawkish than its premise might suggest. Hall, who delved into related terrain in Billy Elliot, does not overly sentimentalize the working-class men at the core of his story (even if, as in Billy Elliot, he takes a few cheap shots at the fancier characters). Directed with lovely balance by Max Roberts—and acted by a fine British ensemble, led by Christopher Connel as the most sensitive of the pitmen—the play presents the miners’ works without evading the question of whether they were, in the judgment of art history, mostly minor work. It’s a well-crafted and thoughtful evening of theater, and Hall ends the show on a sober note of socialist disillusionment.",
