Or is it that he holds himself in even more contempt than he does the rest of the world? Either way, the narcissism is overwhelming. And despite yourself, you can't take your eyes off him, because the power behind the pose is so genuine that it hurts.\n\nPlaying the title role in Brian Friel's great play \"Faith Healer,\" which opened last night in a mesmerizing revival at the Booth Theater, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. The self-lacerating vanity that has always been central to Mr. Fiennes's presence as a film actor (\"The Constant Gardener,\" \"The English Patient\") has rarely been to put to such powerful use.\n\nThis shrewd channeling of his glamorously peevish star shine may finally get \"Faith Healer,\" a production from the Gate Theater of Dublin, directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent, the New York audience it deserves. First (and last) seen on Broadway in 1979 for a mere 20 performances with James Mason as its star, \"Faith Healer\" is a dense and lyrical series of monologues, a form little loved by action-hungry American theatergoers.\n\nYet anyone who starts listening, with full attention, to the words — and, just as important, the silences — of the three characters who tell their horrible, fantastic and oddly familiar story should be fatally hooked. Intricate and self-contradicting, the narrative has the addictive pull of a detective yarn, a cosmic version in which the clues do and do not add up to a clear solution. And in Mr. Fiennes, Cherry Jones and Ian McDiarmid this production has storytellers who know how to hold a stage unconditionally, even when, in Ms. Jones's case, the performer doesn't entirely match the part.\n\n\"Faith Healer\" is the unforgiving and exalting tale of Frank Hardy (Mr. Fiennes) and his wife, Grace (Ms. Jones), and manager, Teddy (Mr. McDiarmid). Frank is an itinerant, erratic healer of the sick in small towns throughout the British Isles, who can be reduced in description to boilerplate clichés about impossible artistic geniuses.\n\nAn Irishman in self-imposed exile, Frank is an egocentric, hard-drinking, irresistible man who is so suspicious of his talent and so afraid of losing it that he makes everyone around him suffer. You've heard all this before, no doubt, in books, films and plays about artists like Ernest Hemingway, Dylan Thomas and Diane Arbus, brilliant souls crucified on their own talent.\n\nThe astonishment of \"Faith Healer\" lies in how Mr. Friel particularizes this archetype, with the wealth of scenic and eccentric detail to be expected from an author whose other works include \"Dancing at Lughnasa,\" without losing its mythic resonance. The play is a mystery story in both the mundane and spiritual senses. Though each of the narrators tells essentially the same tale in four soliloquies (Frank speaks first and last), their accounts disagree in ways that leave us dizzy.\n\nAs is often the case in Mr. Friel's plays, memory is capricious, just as Frank's great and improbable gift is. You'll have no trouble getting the gist of the experiences shared by Frank, Grace and Teddy: of their travels to rural outposts in an increasingly temperamental old van; of the combustible relationship between Frank and Grace; of the night in a Welsh village when a drunken Frank healed all 10 invalids who came to him; of the final, disastrous return to Frank's native Ireland.\n\nBut beyond that you don't know what version of reality to accept. Was Grace Frank's wife (as she and Teddy say) or his mistress (as Frank insists)? Was it Frank and Grace or Teddy who demanded that a Fred Astaire recording of \"The Way You Look Tonight\" be played so incongruously during Frank's healing sessions? Was it Frank's mother or father who died while he was on the road?\n\nMr. Friel leaves the answers in shadow. But the pain that emerges from these conflicting accounts is as hard and lucid as crystal. You come to realize that the distortions and lies — if that's what they are — are an anesthetic that allows these people to tell their stories, as is often the case with personal myths. But as Mr. Fiennes, Ms. Jones and Mr. McDiarmid demonstrate so powerfully, such evasions can keep anger, closely followed by anguish, at bay only for so long.\n\nI'll admit I was a reluctant conquest of this production and particularly of Mr. Fiennes, to whom looking romantic and tortured has always, it seemed to me, come too easily. I had seen a production of \"Faith Healer\" in New Haven in 1994, directed by Joe Dowling and starring the incomparable Donal McCann, that remains one of the transcendent experiences of my theatergoing life. Mr. Dowling's production was pitched almost at a whisper, letting the play reveal its darkening depths by stealth.\n\nThe interpretation by Mr. Kent, who is best known for ravishingly chic productions of classics (\"Hamlet,\" \"Medea,\" \"Phèdre\"), is more overtly theatrical, as is Mr. Fiennes's characterization. But as \"Faith Healer\" insists, there is certainly more than one way to tell a story, and this version's emotional flashiness plays well on Broadway. The physical production (designed by Jonathan Fensom) remains subtle and austere, with extraordinary, crepuscular lighting (by Mark Henderson) that slyly seems to be generated by the characters' changing moods.\n\nIf there is a weak link, as impossible as this sounds, it is Ms. Jones, the remarkable American actress who won a Tony Award last year for \"Doubt.\" It's not just that her Anglo-Irish accent is uncertain. She is too palpably strong as a woman who sees her very identity erased by the man she loves. But Ms. Jones's fierce, artful balance between resentment and agony, between disgust and wonder, is beautifully sustained in ways that finally enhance the play's emotional patterns.\n\nMr. McDiarmid, a stalwart of the London stage, is beyond reproach. With his blatantly dyed orange hair and shabby showman's attire, his Teddy registers at first as a pathetic joke, a seedy old vaudevillian with a repertory of showbiz anecdotes about earlier acts he managed, like the whippet that played the bagpipes. But this jocularity is a shield that slips. And when his narrative strays into descriptions of humiliation and loss, the hurt breaks through the bravado like a fist through papier-mâché.\n\nIn like manner Mr. Fiennes plays up the showman in Frank. There are vestiges here of Laurence Olivier as the decaying music hall performer in John Osborne's \"Entertainer,\" conveying the same mixed urges to ingratiate and alienate. But beyond the contempt and charm is an awareness of imponderable darkness within. You sense it when he speaks of foreseeing the play's climactic event and opens his mouth into a maw that becomes a black hole\n\nThat's in the opening scene. In the play's conclusion, when Frank walks willingly into that darkness, he glows with solar radiance. This is unquestionably Frank's apotheosis, the consummation he has sought all his life.\n\nLike the place names that are recited as if to rosary beads, gestures echo one another throughout the monologues. There is one in particular, with arms stretched toward the audience, that suggests the laying on of hands, of fingers reaching out to touch, to connect.\n\nThe tragedy for the characters in \"Faith Healer\" is that while connection among them is elusive, the memory of fleeting contact remains and scalds. That the same might be said of the play's effect upon us is, more than anything, what makes \"Faith Healer\" a major work of art.\n\nBy Brian Friel; directed by Jonathan Kent; sets and costumes by Jonathan Fensom; lighting by Mark Henderson; sound by Christopher Cronin; video design, Sven Ortel; production stage manager, Jane Grey; production management, Aurora Productions; general management, Stuart Thompson Productions/James Triner; associate producer, Lauren Doll.
