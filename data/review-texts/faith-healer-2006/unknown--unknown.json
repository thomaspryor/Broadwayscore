    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises lead and cast as 'exceptional' with substantive artistic engagement ('dig deeply'). However, extremely limited text and potential cherry-picking requires low confidence and cautious upper-positive scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the director and cast for their depth, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt praises the cast and direction, suggesting a positive experience. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive language warrants a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the director and cast ('exceptional', 'dig deeply'), indicating a clearly positive recommendation. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this scores in the 80-84 range despite limited context.",
