The praise for Midler's performance is strong ('marvel'), but this appears to be a truncated excerpt focusing only on one element, hence low confidence. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 80 aligns with a positive review. The key quote praises Midler's performance as a standout element, indicating a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises Midler's performance as a \"marvel\" and highlights her ability to bring \"fresh life\" to the role. Given the critic's rating of 80, this falls squarely into the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The review offers strong praise for Midler's performance, calling it a 'marvel' that brings 'fresh life' to the role. The critic's own 80 rating confirms a solid positive recommendation, though the brevity of the excerpt limits confidence.",
