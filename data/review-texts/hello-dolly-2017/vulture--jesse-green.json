However, this appears to be a brief excerpt, so confidence is medium. | GPT-4o: The review uses superlative language to describe Midler's performance as a 'force of nature' and a 'tsunami of personality,' indicating a strong, enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"force of nature\" and \"sweeps everything before it,\" indicating a very positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic deploys superlative language ('force of nature,' 'tsunami') and praises the production as both 'timeless and utterly of the moment,' indicating an unqualified rave despite the brevity of the excerpt.",
