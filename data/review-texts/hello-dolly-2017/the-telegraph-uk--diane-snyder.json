  "showScoreExcerpt": "“If any musical deserves an exclamation mark, it’s this triumphant revival of 'Hello, Dolly!'...Midler makes the effort of doing seven shows a week look effortless. And she commands the stage. It’s hard to take your eyes off her…This is the sort of joyous show that reminds you why you first fell in love with musical theatre.
