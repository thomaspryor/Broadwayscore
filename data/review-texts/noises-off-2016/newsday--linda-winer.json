  "bwwExcerpt": "The comedy in the first of three acts feels a little forced. But Herrin - not incidentally, artistic director of a company named Headlong - soon catapults the physical and verbal humor headlong into increasingly inspired opportunities to watch characters who play second-rate actors play out their real lives while trying to perform the complications of their second-rate play. Slippery sardines have seldomed seemed as ominous as when Jeremy Shamos, terrific as a hapless neurotic, flops around on them.",
