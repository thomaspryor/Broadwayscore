  "bwwExcerpt": "In 2016, it's inarguably a little late to be celebrating the stereotype of the dumb blonde. But the stiff walk and posture that Megan Hilty has created for her clueless character, a stunningly untalented British stage actress cast for her generous curves, are the gift that keeps on giving in Roundabout's delicious Broadway revival of Noises Off. Whether she's galumphing around backstage or sashaying through a performance with priceless self-consciousness -- delivering every line straight to the audience with a blissful inability to take direction or interact with her fellow cast -- Hilty's Brooke Ashton is a sparkling comic caricature that never gets tired. She's well matched in director Jeremy Herrin's production by a first-rate troupe of New York theater pros, even if this notoriously tricky backstage farce hasn't quite found its ideal precision-tooled groove.",
