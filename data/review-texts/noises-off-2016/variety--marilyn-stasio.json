  "bwwExcerpt": "Funny lady Andrea Martin leads the nimble cast of this well-tooled revival helmed by Jeremy Herrin, who kept his comedic sensibilities under wraps in last season's austere RSC production of 'Wolf Hall,' but cuts loose here...Act II is bust-a-gut funny...This is where helmer Herrin puts his well-drilled ensemble through the synchronized chaos that can come crashing down on their heads if someone misses a beat...Like 'Law & Order' reruns, 'Noises Off' seems to be always playing somewhere in the civilized world, a perfect specimen of its generic art form. And that's exactly the way it should be, because this kind of comedic brilliance never gets stale.",
