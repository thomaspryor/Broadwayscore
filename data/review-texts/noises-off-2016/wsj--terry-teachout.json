  "bwwExcerpt": "This revival is as glorious as 'Wolf Hall' was dull, not least because it features Tracee Chimo, the most gifted young comic actor to hit Broadway in recent memory...The secret ingredient of his production is that Mr. Herrin has gone to similar lengths to ensure that every member of the cast plays for truth, not laughs -- which makes you laugh twice as hard. This brings us to the miraculous Ms. Chimo, who plays Poppy, the mousy assistant stage manager of 'Nothing On,' who's been sleeping with the director of the show (Campbell Scott) on the sly. Her performance is so heartbreakingly true to life that it would make you cry were you to see it in isolation. In the context of 'Noises Off,' though, it's funny almost beyond belief...Complaints? I've got none. This show is flawless.",
