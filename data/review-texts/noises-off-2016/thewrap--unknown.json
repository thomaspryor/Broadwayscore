  "bwwExcerpt": "For anyone who's seen 'Noises Off' before, there's much to smile at in director Jeremy Herrin's new revival. Truly inspired is David Furr's performance as Garry Lejeune, the lead actor in 'Nothing On.' Each character in 'Noises Off' has a quirk: nerves, incompetence, alcoholism, forgetfulness. Lejeune's thing is that he stutters. Furr wisely drops the stammering and instead turns Lejeune's inability to say certain words into a chronic inarticulateness, which is much funnier than a speech impediment...A greater problem for this production is Campbell Scott, who has neither the style nor the size to play the director of 'Nothing On,' who not only screws a few people in the company but also needs to represent our reaction to the general pandemonium on stage. Campbell has neither the style nor the size to carry 'Noises Off.'",
