  "bwwExcerpt": "What makes the show so enjoyably delirious -- at least when it's staged well -- is the anarchic nature of Frayn's imagination; just when things can't possibly get any worse for the actors onstage, ten more disastrous things happen, usually all at once. The good news is that the new Roundabout Theatre Company revival is directed (by Jeremy Herrin) and performed with tremendous speed, spirit and affection. The actors, especially Megan Hilty (TV's 'Smash), as the bombshell ingenue who needs to mouth the words of her co-stars in order to keep up with the text, and Andrea Martin, as the alternately matriarchal and diva-ish star of 'Nothin On,' are completely attuned to the helium rhythms of Frayn's writing. The brilliantly staged second act, in which the backstage actors attempt to remain silent as chaos erupts onstage, is a tour de force; a ballet of incongruity and incompetence.",
