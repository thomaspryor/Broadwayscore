  "bwwExcerpt": "At times it seems as if the cast is so focused on hitting its marks - 'Noises Off' requires Swiss-like precision - that the actors forget to have fun. Let's hope that with time, they'll become as comfortable as sardines in oil, and the production should gear up into the required breakneck speed and unhinged ­lunacy.",
