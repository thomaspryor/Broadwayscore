    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it a 'perfect marriage' and suggesting inevitability ('waiting to exist for years'). However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the musical, describing it as a 'perfect marriage' of music and storytelling. The tone suggests a high level of enthusiasm, placing it in the upper range of the Positive bucket. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is highly positive, describing the musical as a 'perfect marriage' and something 'waiting to exist for years.' Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I've scored it at the higher end of the 'Positive' bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong praise, calling the show a 'perfect marriage' of music and movement and comparing it to the 'best dance theater,' indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited context of a single curated quote.",
