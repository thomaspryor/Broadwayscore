    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise calling it 'deeply moving' and noting it 'transcends typical jukebox musical territory,' but confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'deeply moving' and 'transcends typical jukebox musical territory,' suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"deeply moving\" and \"transcends\", indicating a strong recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strongly positive evaluative language ('deeply moving,' 'transcends,' 'inventive') indicating an enthusiastic recommendation, though limited context necessitates low confidence.",
