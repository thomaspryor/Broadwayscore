Single excerpt warning noted - scored in upper Positive range given unqualified praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('gorgeous', 'transcendent') suggesting a high level of praise. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"gorgeous\" and \"transcendent,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, I am placing the score towards the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strongly positive evaluative language ('gorgeous', 'transcendent') indicating an enthusiastic recommendation, though the single-curated-quote limitation requires low confidence.",
