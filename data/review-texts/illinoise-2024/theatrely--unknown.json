  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Now on Broadway at the St. James Theater, this miracle of a show has traded the grandeur of Park Avenue Armory's monumental Drill Hall for a gentler intimacy. (\"Intimate\" would not be a typical descriptor for the St. James, but that's just how massive the Drill Hall is.) It remains, above all else, a magical work of fierce heart that bursts with indescribable wells of emotion.",
