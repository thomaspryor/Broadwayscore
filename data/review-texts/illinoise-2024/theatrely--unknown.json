  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Now on Broadway at the St. James Theater, this miracle of a show has traded the grandeur of Park Avenue Armory's monumental Drill Hall for a gentler intimacy. (\"Intimate\" would not be a typical descriptor for the St. James, but that's just how massive the Drill Hall is.) It remains, above all else, a magical work of fierce heart that bursts with indescribable wells of emotion.",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"miracle of a show\" and \"magical work.\" However, due to the limited text available, a score in the middle of the 'Positive' bucket is more appropriate.",
