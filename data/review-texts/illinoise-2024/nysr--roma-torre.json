However, with only one excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a 'wonderfully collaborative effort' and suggests it sets a new standard for Broadway musicals, indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt is positive, calling the show a \"wonderfully collaborative effort\" and stating that it \"raises the 'barre' for Broadway musicals moving forward.\" This suggests a positive recommendation, although the single excerpt warrants a score in the middle of the positive range.",
