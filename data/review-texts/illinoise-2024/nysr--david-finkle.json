  "bwwExcerpt": "There’s no denying that Illinoise is effective, a large billboard on Adam Rigg’s industrial-slash-forest set announcing the title as well as other information. It may be that longtime Stevens fans need only hear the material they love now presented as dance to carry on about it.\r\n\r\nBut providing the cherished songs with a connecting plot hasn’t necessarily resulted in an instantly graspable tale.",
