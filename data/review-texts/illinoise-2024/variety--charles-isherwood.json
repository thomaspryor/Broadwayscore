    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - 'transcendent beauty' is strong positive language, but 'ephemeral storytelling' suggests significant reservations. Lower end of Positive range due to mixed signals and single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production for its 'transcendent beauty' but notes that the storytelling can feel 'ephemeral.' This suggests a positive review with some reservations, placing it in the lower end of the Positive bucket due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights \"transcendent beauty\" but notes the storytelling is \"ephemeral\". This suggests a positive but qualified recommendation. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the dance and visual elements as 'transcendent' while criticizing the storytelling as 'ephemeral,' indicating a qualified recommendation that appreciates the production's aesthetic achievements despite narrative weaknesses.",
