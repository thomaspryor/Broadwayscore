  "fullText": "Now on Broadway at the St. James Theater, this miracle of a show has traded the grandeur of Park Avenue Armory’s monumental Drill Hall for a gentler intimacy.

  "bwwExcerpt": "At the Armory, those same stories felt monumental — a revolt of mighty compassion against a cruel, suffocating world.
