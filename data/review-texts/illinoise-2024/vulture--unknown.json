For 90 glorious minutes, you do feel.",

The use of 'glorious' further suggests high praise, though the single excerpt warning tempers confidence slightly. | Gemini: The review highlights \"technical glories\" and \"holistic transcendence\" but also mentions \"few brief stumbles,\" suggesting a positive but not rave recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring conservatively.",
