It is not just the best play to open on Broadway so far this season, but also the most important...Schreck gives a real and wrenching performance, not a speech…‘Constitution’ is one of the things we always say we want theater to be: an act of civic engagement.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Unqualified superlatives ('best play', 'most important') with multiple dimensions of praise - artistic merit, social significance, and civic value. Despite being an excerpt, the language is definitively in rave territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides high praise, calling it the best and most important play of the season, and highlights its civic engagement, indicating a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses superlative language, calling it the best and most important play of the season. It also describes the play as a work of inspired protest and a tangible contribution to change. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise calling the show the best and most important of the season with phrases like 'work of inspired protest,' but as a single curated quote that may be cherry-picked, confidence is low and the score is capped in the upper Positive range per the single-excerpt warning.",
