It is not just the best play to open on Broadway so far this season, but also the most important...Schreck gives a real and wrenching performance, not a speech…‘Constitution’ is one of the things we always say we want theater to be: an act of civic engagement.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, this contains unqualified superlatives ('best play', 'most important') and describes it as essential civic engagement. The language is consistently rapturous throughout. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives ('best play', 'most important') and praises the play as an 'act of civic engagement', indicating a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses superlatives like \"best play\", \"most important\", and describes the play as \"an act of civic engagement\", indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives ('best play', 'most important', 'inspired protest') and explicitly calls it essential civic theater, warranting a top-range Rave score despite the limited single-excerpt context.",
