  "bwwExcerpt": "It's all an extraordinary balance of historical fact, legal analysis and personal experience presented with a warm, conversational tone. Because a great deal of her text involves facts and statistics concerning violence against women ('More American women have been killed by violent male partners in the last century than Americans have been killed in wars, including 9/11.'), Schreck explains that it's important to her to have 'some positive male energy up here with me,' so she shares the stage with Mike Iveson, who at first dutifully takes on the role of moderator/timekeeper in his VFW uniform, but then reveals a bit more of himself.",
