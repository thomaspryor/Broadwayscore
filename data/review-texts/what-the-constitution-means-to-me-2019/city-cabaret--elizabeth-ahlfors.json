  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Director Oliver Butler keeps a casual, energetic delivery. Schreck breezes ahead bringing out a bright, naive, imaginative girl who evolves into a woman of admirable perception of the Constitution, fascinated by its facets...With a spirit of spontaneity and, yes, optimism, Schreck's play ties the founding document with today's political events...This is a spot-on informative conversation, delivered with gregarious humor and heart, plenty of laughs and also some tears.\" \n\nRead more",
