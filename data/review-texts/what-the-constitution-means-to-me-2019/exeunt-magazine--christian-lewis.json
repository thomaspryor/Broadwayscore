  "showScoreExcerpt": "“This piece is a beautiful, amorphous exploration of constitutional law, the judicial system, and the oh-so important concept of equal rights for all...Schreck weaves the personal and political in such seamless ways that this never feels like a civics class, but instead like a compelling story...The entire play is miraculously fluid...A guidebook in how to do political theater and an exemplary example of the power of theater. It is a flawless, moving, and incredibly powerful masterpiece.”\n\nRead more",
