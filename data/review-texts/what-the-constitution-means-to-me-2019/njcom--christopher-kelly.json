  "bwwExcerpt": "I hadn't seen 'What the Constitution Means to Me' previously, so can't measure whether this show loses any of its intimacy in a larger venue, the 597-seat Hayes Theater. But if the scale of 'What the Constitution Means to Me' is small, the emotions are big - and after months of performances, this formally complicated show (mostly a monologue, sometimes a play, occasionally improvised) is now a beautifully-oiled machine.",
