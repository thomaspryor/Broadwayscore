  "bwwExcerpt": "Red meat for liberal feminists and clearly aimed at inter-generational audiences, 'What the Constitution Means to Me' is part progressive political lecture, part personal confessional, and part manifesto for feminist reform. The show, which opened Sunday night at the Helen Hayes Theater and will run at least through July 21, captures the political restlessness of a moment when many Americans are looking back at the assumptions and power structure behind what they were asked to do in their own past and feeling plenty ready to view those experiences through a revisionist lens.",
