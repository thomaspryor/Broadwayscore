  "bwwExcerpt": "“Prayer for the French Republic” addresses, with nuance, detail and understated passion, the tensions and the connections between history and current events. While it tells of a particular family, it illuminates the troubles of all people caught up in the turbulent tides of history—as everyone in a sense is—even if some face graver danger than others.",
