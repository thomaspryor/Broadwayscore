  "fullText": "“Prayer for the French Republic,” in its regional premiere at Theater J, examines Jewish identity and antisemitism at a volatile moment. “Prayer for the French Republic” is, among other things, a play about history repeating and the durability of prejudice. Talk about timing. Joshua Harmon’s many-sided investigation of Jewish identity makes its premiere in the capital amid a political context that proves its case: Forget the past at your peril. Remembrance, a central tenet of Judaism, is a survival instinct. So is assimilation. When the narrator, Patrick Salomon (Cody Nickell), introduces us to his sister Marcelle (Danielle Skraastad), both wear their Parisian identity more proudly than any other. Certainly there is something very French about Marcelle’s cool detachment as she traces her bloodline connection to Molly, a distant cousin, like a breezy list of Old Testament begats. Bookish idealist Molly (Jourdan Lewanda) has landed on Marcelle’s couch from America, studying abroad in the fall of 2016. Her arrival is our window onto the Salomons, who Patrick tells us have been in France for more than a thousand years. But when Marcelle’s son Daniel (Ethan J. Miller) gets jumped in the street for the second time, their will to stay is tested. Daniel is more religious than his parents and wears a kippah, though Marcelle would rather he wouldn’t. Why make himself a target? Her husband, Charles (Ariel Eliaz), was born in Algeria before fleeing to Paris when the country won independence from France. Flight is part of Charles’s Sephardi heritage and he’s ready to do it again — this time, to Israel. The announcement comes as a shock and causes everyone involved to self-reflect. Harmon’s characters take shape around their differing perspectives on Jewish identity, their rigorous philosophical debates echoing within the scaffolding of a family drama. Marcelle’s 28-year-old daughter Elodie (Dani Stoller), who for two years has been moping and storming around the apartment following a manic depressive episode, speaks in spiky, discursive paragraphs in defense of Israel. Molly, an American college student, pipes up with a counterpoint when she can get a word in, while Patrick’s allegiance to France remains steadfast. Theater J Artistic Director Hayley Finn’s production grounds the action on an intimate scale. While last season’s Broadway premiere inflated Harmon’s comedy to fill the room, here the show assumes a more true-to-life size, in the modest but still chic Paris apartment designed by Misha Kachman. If some of even the more obvious humor doesn’t land, that may be due to the volatility of the context: The play premiered off Broadway in 2022, transferred in the months following Oct. 7 last fall, and meets audiences where we are now. In an idea-driven show that traverses decades of Jewish history, the best moments come from personal connections, whether they bind people for life or merely a semester: Skraastad demonstrates extraordinary range as a firm wife and mother and a daughter who worries about leaving her aging father. Lewanda and Miller lend a sweet tentativeness to the flirtation between Molly and Daniel, whose fling is technically somewhat biblical. Flashbacks to 1946, part of Harmon’s effort to paint a broad canvas, are worth the visits with Brigid Cleary and Stephen Patrick Martin as Marcelle and Patrick’s great grandparents, who were fortunate enough to be passed over during the German occupation of Paris. The fate of the piano shop that’s belonged to the Salomons for five generations is traced back through these scenes, which add dimension but also a fair amount of bloat. The story, told across three hours, is most engaging when light on its feet. There’s an epic quality to Harmon’s breadth of ideas, and a sense that he aims to encompass as many as possible. As Elodie insists in one especially dizzying diatribe: “You can’t understand one thing without understanding everything.” That would be impossible, but the play’s inclusive effort draws attention to what’s left unaddressed. To my mind, it scrupulously avoids accounting for race — the experience of Jews of color, for example, or violence against those who can’t choose to hide their difference. Doing so would enrich its conversations about antisemitism. Inspiring such objections is among the show’s strengths; there is an art to disagreement, and there ought to be disagreement about art. No one is likely to leave this show without feeling their personal convictions have been tested, which is just as it should be. Considering other points of view is the only way to make up your own mind. Prayer for the French Republic, through Nov. 24 at Theater J in Washington. 3 hours with two intermissions. edcjcc.org/theater-j.",
