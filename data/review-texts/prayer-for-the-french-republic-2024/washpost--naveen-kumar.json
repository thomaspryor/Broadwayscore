  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessFrom left, Danielle Skraastad, Ariel Eliaz, Ethan J. Miller, Dani Stoller and Jourdan Lewanda in Theater J's “Prayer for the French Republic.” (Ryan Maxwell)Review by Naveen KumarNovember 8, 2024 at 4:27 p.m. EST“Prayer for the French Republic” is, among other things, a play about history repeating and the durability of prejudice. Talk about timing. Joshua Harmon’s many-sided investigation of Jewish identity makes its regional premiere in the capital amid a political context that proves its case: Forget the past at your peril.\n\nRemembrance, a central tenet of Judaism, is a survival instinct. So is assimilation. When the narrator, Patrick Salomon (Cody Nickell), introduces us to his sister Marcelle (Danielle Skraastad), both wear their Parisian identity more proudly than any other. Certainly there is something very French about Marcelle’s cool detachment as she traces her bloodline connection to Molly, a distant cousin, like a breezy list of Old Testament begats.",
