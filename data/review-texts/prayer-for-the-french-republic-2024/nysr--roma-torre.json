    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with 'powerful theater,' 'sublime ensemble,' and 'absolute authenticity.' However, single excerpt warning means full verdict unclear, so medium confidence appropriate. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction and ensemble, describing the production as both entertaining and enlightening, indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"great heart\", \"welcome humor\", \"powerful theater\", \"entertaining\", \"enlightening\", \"sublime ensemble\", and \"absolute authenticity\", indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt contains enthusiastic praise for the direction and ensemble, describing the production as 'powerful,' 'sublime,' and 'terrifically enhanced.' However, as a single curated excerpt, it may be cherry-picked, warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket (80-84) with low confidence rather than a Rave classification.",
