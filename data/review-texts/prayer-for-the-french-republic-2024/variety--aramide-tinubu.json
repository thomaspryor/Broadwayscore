  "bwwExcerpt": "That’s not to say that “Prayer for the French Republic” should have been about something other than the story it tells. But it doesn’t tell it in a compelling or nuanced manner — despite Harmon having set himself up to succeed with a flashback story that could, but does not, provide real context and present-day interlocutors who could, but do not, push the Benhamous beyond platitudes. The debates the Benhamous are having are ones that are happening in our own republic",

However, confidence is low due to limited text from one curated quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and the ambitious scope of the drama, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt highlights \"superb performances\" and an \"ambitious\" drama, indicating a positive assessment. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am placing it on the higher end of the positive scale. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the performances ('superb') and the play's thematic ambition, indicating a positive recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
