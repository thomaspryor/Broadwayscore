    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt describes ambition and technique without clear evaluative judgment. The phrase 'seems to be aiming' suggests the playwright may not fully achieve Kushner's level, but this is too limited to determine the critic's final verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests ambition and technique but lacks clear praise or criticism, indicating a mixed reception. The aggregator context of 'flat' supports a middle-ground verdict. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests ambition but not necessarily success. The comparison to Tony Kushner implies a positive aspiration, but the phrase \"ideas that sprawl forward\" could indicate a lack of focus or coherence, leading to a mixed assessment.",
