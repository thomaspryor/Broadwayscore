However, the lack of full context and the warning about curated excerpts necessitate a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates the play is \"riveting,\" which suggests a positive experience. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it conservatively within the positive range.",
