  "dtliExcerpt": "As a theatergoing experience, however, the three-hour Prayer for the French Republic is less effectively timed. The play premiered in early 2022 at Manhattan Theatre Club; Dravid Cromer’s production has now moved to MTC’s Broadway venue, the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre. But in the gap between these two mountings, New York got a 10-month run of Tom Stoppard’s Leopoldstadt, which approached the same core issues—the persistence of antisemitism, and the debates about fitting in that surround it—with more gravity, scope and finesse. By comparison, flaws that were already noticeable Off Broadway seem more pronounced.",
