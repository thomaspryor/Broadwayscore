  "bwwExcerpt": "The actors who kept the production going, half-jokingly begging for food from their audiences in lieu of ticket sales, are the heroes here - particularly when Asch, after returning to Poland and witnessing the horrors there, and after futilely attempting to waken the U.S. government into action, turns reclusive... But \"Indecent\" is subtle, relying on subtext where needed, though providing directness and visualization where needed. The superb acting is subtle. The exquisite designs are subtle.",
