  "bwwExcerpt": "The play, for Vogel and Taichman who created it together, is an interrogation of the many definitions and interpretations of 'indecency'...Indecent can feel a little cluttered in its staging. Actors scurry this way and that. It is not always clear who is who, and who is speaking. Yiddish when spoken and sung has a translation projected on to the back wall. This uneven structure and pace can feel a little like casting an eye over a dense thesis with too many footnotes. But Indecent's roving eye, its busy-ness, its insistence to be about everything-homophobia, censorship, freedom of expression, tyranny-is as fascinating and genuine as it can be frustrating to watch.",
