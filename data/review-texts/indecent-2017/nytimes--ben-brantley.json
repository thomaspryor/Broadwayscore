  "fullText": "The road to Broadway was paved with compromise for Sholem Asch’s “God of Vengeance.” Though this early-20th-century Yiddish play had dazzled Greenwich Village audiences in 1922, the show’s producers worried that it might be too provocative for the less bohemian folk of Midtown; a pivotal love scene between two women was deleted from the script, much to the distress of members of the company.\n\n“I would not be ashamed to be arrested for acting in the play I believe in,” one of them says in “Indecent,” Paula Vogel’s heartfelt ode and elegy to a landmark of modern drama. “I am ashamed I acted in this sham I don’t believe in.”\n\nThis declaration is made by Dorothee (Katrina Lenk), an actress who had just spent a night in jail for appearing in “God of Vengeance” on Broadway. Even with excisions, Asch’s work was still deemed so morally offensive that it was shut down by the police six weeks after it opened at the Apollo Theater on 42nd Street.\n\nAlmost a century later, no whiff of scandal or self-censorship attends Rebecca Taichman’s production of Ms. Vogel’s thoughtful evocation of the life and times of “God of Vengeance,” which opened on Tuesday night at the Cort Theater. First staged at the Yale Repertory Theater in 2015, “Indecent” arrives on Broadway as one of the season’s most respectable — and respectful — plays.\n\nYes, that notorious scene that never made it to the main stem, even in the licentious Jazz Age, is fully rendered here — and not just once but in an assortment of fuguelike variations, performed with grace by Ms. Lenk and Adina Verson. The dominant note of this erotic encounter isn’t prurience, though; it’s piety.\n\n“Indecent” is, above all, decent, in the most complete sense of the word. It is virtuous, sturdily assembled, informative and brimming with good faith. The territory it covers in its one hour and 45 minutes is immense. “Indecent” presents a thorough history of Asch’s masterwork, from its inception in Warsaw in 1907 to the World War II era, when it was performed as an act of artistic affirmation in an attic in the Lodz ghetto of German-occupied Poland.\n\nWhat’s more, “Indecent” delivers not only a history of styles of theater and their political contexts but also a portrait of Asch (played by Max Gordon Moore and Tom Nelis), as he progresses from youthful enthusiasm to embittered old age. This is achieved by a tight ensemble of chameleon performers — who also include Mimi Lieber and Steven Rattazzi and the musicians Matt Darriau, Lisa Gutkin and Aaron Halva — glowing with devotion to their craft and its possibilities.\n\nYet the ardor that must have informed the writing and early performances of “Vengeance” only occasionally blazes forth in “Indecent,” which was created by Ms. Vogel and Ms. Taichman. Both women have described being deeply affected by their discovery of Asch’s play in their youth. And you can sense how seriously they take their responsibilities as 21st-century curators of its reputation.\n\nSuch conscientiousness has its downside. For all its resourceful stagecraft — which includes the fluent use of period and original pastiche song (overseen by Ms. Gutkin and Mr. Halva) and dance (by David Dorfman) — “Indecent” can be deflatingly earnest in its dialogue and timeline exposition.\n\nThe production begins with grave lyricism, with the suitcase-toting ensemble seated upstage, clad in earthen hues that blend into the shadows. (Emily Rebholz did the costumes, and the black-hole-of-history set is by Riccardo Hernandez.) When they rise, they shake cascades of ashes from their sleeves, a haunting evocation of a past of persecution and flight.\n\nSuch dreamlike images abound in “Indecent,” which has been artfully lighted by Christopher Akerlind and features projections by Tal Yarden, which orient us as to the time, place and language spoken in the scenes that follow. Much of the emotional focus is provided by our narrator, Lemml (a sweetly somber Richard Topol), Asch’s protégé and stage manager.\n\n“We have a story we want to tell you,” he says to us, as an onstage surrogate of sorts for Ms. Vogel and Ms. Taichman. “A story about a play. A play that changed my life.”\n\nAnd what a play it turned out to be! Written by Asch when he was in his 20s, “Vengeance” told the story of a bourgeois brothel owner (played by the great Yiddish theater actor Rudolph Schildkraut, here embodied by Mr. Nelis) whose daughter falls in love with one of his whores.\n\nNot only did “Vengeance” present a physical relationship between women as natural and even purifying, but it also concluded with a desecration of the Torah by Mr. Schildkraut’s character. Small wonder that the Warsaw literary circle to whom Asch first introduced his play urged him to burn it.\n\nAsch speaks of the necessity of Jews’ showing “ourselves as flawed and complex human beings.” One of his actresses in New York says: “We are the first generation that gets the chance our parents never got. To tell our stories.”\n\n“Indecent” is not shy about explicitly stating and repeating its big themes. Though the hard-working performers change characters often, their dialogue remains much the same. And there is little room for the subversive pull of conflicting subtext, of which Ms. Vogel has made adroit use in other works, including her Pulitzer Prize winner of 20 years ago, “How I Learned to Drive.”\n\nHer latest show is most moving when it approaches its material sideways. The musical numbers summon entire cultural climates with atmospheric efficiency. Tableaus like those of people waiting anxiously in line — first at Ellis Island and later in a concentration camp — echo with quiet impact.\n\nAnd that fabled scene in the rain, though perhaps repeated once too often, captures the ecstatic sense of wonder that Ms. Vogel has described feeling in reading “Vengeance” for the first time.\n\n“Indecent,” a major playwright’s long-awaited Broadway debut, may not inhabit the lightning-struck stratosphere of the play it portrays.\n\nBut it offers heartening evidence that four decades in the theater have not jaded Ms. Vogel. “Such fresh energy and sincerity,” the Schildkraut of “Indecent” marvels after meeting the young Asch. The same might be said of Ms. Vogel, who transmits the theater-struck sense of wonder of the girl who first read “God of Vengeance.”\n\nA theater review on Wednesday about the Broadway production of Paula Vogel’s “Indecent” misidentified the theater where the play was first staged, and the year in which it debuted. It was at the Yale Repertory Theater in 2015, not at the Vineyard Theater last year. The review also misidentified an actor who appeared in a 1920s production of Sholem Asch’s play “God of Vengeance,” an event that serves as source material for “Indecent.” The actor was Rudolph Schildkraut — not his son, Joseph Schildkraut.\n\nWhen we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.
