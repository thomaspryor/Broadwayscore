It's all of one captivating piece that builds in sympathy and warmth throughout into such a transcendent moment of beauty and tragedy and hope, I couldn't speak...This play is just so full and rich...The acting is simply spectacular...Just thinking of the gorgeous images makes me long to see the show again right away.\"\n\nRead more",
