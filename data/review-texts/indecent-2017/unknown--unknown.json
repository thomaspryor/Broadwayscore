    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Balanced assessment praising respect and craft but criticizing lack of passion and overly earnest approach. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the play's respectability and craftsmanship but criticizes it for lacking the ardor and subversive elements that could make it more compelling. The mixed tone suggests a balanced view with both positives and negatives. | Gemini: The review uses language that suggests a mixed reaction. It acknowledges the play's respectability and good faith, but also notes that the ardor only occasionally blazes forth and that it can be deflatingly earnest. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production's solid construction and good intentions but criticizes its earnest tone and failure to consistently deliver emotional or subversive impact, suggesting a middling verdict.",
