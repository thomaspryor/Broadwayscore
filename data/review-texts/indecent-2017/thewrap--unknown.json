  "fullText": "It’s the Jewish “Shuffle Along.” Paula Vogel takes a forgotten but seminal work, Sholem Asch’s “The God of Vengeance,” and tells the backstory of its incredible journey in her new play, “Indecent,” which opened on Tuesday nearly a year after its premiere at Off Broadway’s Vineyard Theatre with much of the same cast.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "I'm a total sucker for plays, movies and books about little known events that completely shake up our sense of history...Lesbian love was glorified in a popular Yiddish play in the early 20th century? Vogel tells her complicated, sprawling story with urgent economy. She uses the rain scene, enacted by Katrina Lenk and Adina Verson, as a leitmotiv. The words remain the same (and they're pretty graphic), but the meaning keeps changing, growing.",
