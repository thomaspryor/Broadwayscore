  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Despite its dark subject matter, 'Indecent' is a superb theatrical celebration...Vogel's script is inspiring, Taichman's direction is lyrical and masterful, Dorfman's choreography looks natural. The company of actors and musicians couldn't be better. All in all, 'Indecent' is a lovely experience. The audience was on its feet cheering at the end. This was not one of those automatic Broadway standing ovations, but a heartfelt gesture of appreciation for something special.\"\n\nRead more",
