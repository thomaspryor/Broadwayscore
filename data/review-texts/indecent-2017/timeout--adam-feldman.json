  "bwwExcerpt": "I was deeply moved by the play when it was at the Vineyard Theatre last year. On Broadway, with the same wonderful ensemble cast, it fills a much larger space without losing its essential intimacy. The script is Vogel's, the staging Taichman's, but the two are so lovingly intertwined as to be almost inseparable. The seven actors...weave multiple roles into a seamless whole. The same is true of the music that flows through the show...Rich in sympathy and humor, Indecent is as captivating the second time as the first...An elegant tribute to things that vanish in the blink of a historical eye, Indecent is a memorial that feels like a blessing.",

Given the original rating of 80, a score of 75 seems appropriate. | Kimi: The critic's rating of 80 and descriptors like 'powerful' and 'moving meditation' indicate a solid positive recommendation for this production, though the excerpt is extremely brief.",
