  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Every now and then a play comes along and grabs your heart…It took my soul and ran away with it…The cast includes a troupe of skilled actors…The plot is complicated and the jumps of time are a lot to keep up with, but Taichman does a great job of making sure the audience keeps up…There is an immense feeling of loss and the actors capture the sadness and project it onto the audience…‘Indecent’ is a heroic, important play. I hope that everyone gets a chance to see it.”\n\nRead more",
