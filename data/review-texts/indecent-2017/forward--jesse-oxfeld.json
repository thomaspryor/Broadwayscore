  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Beautifully staged…A decades-old story that’s remarkably well suited for today…The talented troupe plays all the characters…And we see their deep dedication to Asch’s play, a revelation in its time…Even better is how Taichman’s elegant direction pairs with and augments Vogel’s script, creating images like that opening one and keeping the sad story moving inexorably forward. There are musicians and music, singing and dancing, beauty and joy amid this very sad story.”\n\nRead more",
