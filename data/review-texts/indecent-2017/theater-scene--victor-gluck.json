  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"May just be Pulitzer Prize-winning author Paula Vogel’s best play...To say that the play, performed without intermission, is riveting is beside the point. Not only is the play an epitaph for the Yiddish stage it also reinvents the art of theater...It is ultimately an extremely moving document of human achievement, betrayal, and destruction. Cheers to Paula Vogel and Rebecca Taichman and their superb ensemble cast for this memorable theatrical evening.\"\n\nRead more",
