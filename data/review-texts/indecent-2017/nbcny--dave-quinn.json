  "bwwExcerpt": "With a company of seven actors rising from the ashes of history to tell the story of those lost before them, a literal stream of gray ash pouring from their sleeves as they move around the stage. Frankly, I would have been crying too like many of those around me, but I was holding my breath instead - stunned by the sheer beauty and sadness of it all. Director Rebecca Taichman...has many more gems like that throughout her beautiful and arresting staging...It would be hard to find a weak link among the cast...Playing a handful of roles each, you'll marvel as they lose and gain costume pieces, accents and mannerisms to bring the many voices involved in this play's past to life. A standout is the graceful Katrina Lenk...The 'Once' alum will break your heart with her fragility and passion, especially as the show reaches its tragic end.",
