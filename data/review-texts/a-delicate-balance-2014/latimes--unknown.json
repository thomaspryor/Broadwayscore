  "bwwExcerpt": ": Director Pam MacKinnon...has paid exquisite attention to surface detail in her handsome revival...The work is overextended, not always dramatically convincing and sometimes too knowingly articulated. Yet there's something intriguing about its puzzling mix of realism and absurdism, which are ultimately reconciled in the dazzling display of Albee's fearless theatricality...This is an ensemble effort...The performances are all sharp -- Higgins' Edna is especially crisp -- but they're still coalescing. This is the kind of work that will deepen over time. As Agnes...Close is all patrician glamour and icy control...Her portrayal reveals the heavy burden Agnes has been carrying of keeping her family -- and her own psyche -- intact...Lithgow movingly depicts the panicked struggle of a man who realizes that he's in danger of being buried alive...If this production of 'A Delicate Balance' teeters unsteadily at moments, it remains always fascinating to behold. The pleasure lies less in the play's profundity than in its carefully coordinated staginess.",
