  "bwwExcerpt": "At its best, it's thought-provoking and sometimes challenging, but it takes a long time to get moving, and I wonder whether modern-day audiences will be willing to wait for it...While the notion that well-to-do WASPs are dead inside is perhaps the least little bit overfamiliar, this is still a fairly promising setup for a theater-of-the-absurd comedy...'A Delicate Balance' comes across like a dramatically static rewrite of 'Virginia Woolf' with rather less drinking and much less cursing...Pam MacKinnon, who staged last year's outstanding Broadway revival of 'Virginia Woolf,' is Mr. Albee's preferred director, so we can assume that this direct, unmannered production is what the author had in mind...Ms. Close's performance is quiet, tasteful and underprojected, not surprising for an actor who has been absent from the stage for so long. Mr. Lithgow, by contrast, is in extraordinary form, by turns tightly inhibited and almost shockingly anguished.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Review acknowledges strengths ('thought-provoking', 'promising setup', praises Lithgow's performance) but identifies significant issues (pacing problems, overfamiliar themes, Close's underprojected performance). The qualified praise and structural concerns place this in mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some thought-provoking and challenging elements but also notes significant pacing issues and familiar themes. The performances are mixed, with praise for Lithgow but reservations about Close. Overall, it suggests a mixed experience with both strengths and weaknesses. | Gemini: The review has mixed feelings. It praises some aspects but also notes that it takes a long time to get moving and compares it unfavorably to 'Virginia Woolf'. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise ('thought-provoking') but emphasizes significant flaws: the play is 'dramatically static,' 'takes a long time to get moving,' and the star is 'underprojected.' While Lithgow receives rave reviews and the direction is deemed competent, the overall assessment questions whether the experience justifies the patience required, placing it in mixed territory.",
