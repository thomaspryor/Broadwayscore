However, confidence is low due to truncated text and only having one curated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Glenn Close's performance as 'revelatory,' suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on Glenn Close's \"revelatory performance,\" suggesting a strong positive aspect of the production. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive with high end score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Glenn Close's performance, describing it as 'revelatory' and emphasizing her compelling control and presence, though the limited excerpt prevents full assessment of the overall production recommendation.",
