  "fullText": "Hedwig and the Angry Inch Still - H 2015\n\nHedwig fans rejoice. Mama’s coming home.\n\nJohn Cameron Mitchell, co-creator and original star of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, will return to his signature role in the cult musical about an East Berlin rocker who tells her story of botched sex-change surgery and broken dreams.\n\nMitchell will step into Hedwig’s glitter boots for a limited eight-week run in the current Broadway revival, beginning performances on Jan. 21 at the Belasco Theatre.\n\nDirected by Michael Mayer, the show won four Tony Awards this year, including best musical revival, lead actor Neil Patrick Harris and featured actress Lena Hall.\n\nSince Harris wrapped his contracted stint in the title role in August, Andrew Rannells has played the part, followed by current star Michael C. Hall, who appears through Jan. 18.\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Lifestyle\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Stephanie Hsu, Michaela Jaé Rodriguez and More Join 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' on Broadway \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Business\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Broadway Box Office: Grosses Tumble 14 Percent After NYC Snowstorm\n\nRead more ‘Hedwig and the Angry Inch’: Theater Review\n\n“I am in equal parts thrilled and terrified to be returning to Hedwig,” said Mitchell in a statement. “Fifteen years ago she kicked my butt so hard that I quit acting. But like an expertly facelifted ex-wife, she’s lured me back. The killer new work by Neil Patrick Harris, Andrew Rannels and Michael C. Hall has left much larger pumps to fill. Here’s hoping I don’t need a walker by the end of the run.”\n\nMitchell wrote the show with composer-lyricist Stephen Trask, and originally played Hedwig, starting off-off-Broadway at Westbeth and continuing in the 1998 off-Broadway production that ran for over two years at the Jane Street Theatre. Mitchell also directed and starred in the 2001 film version.\n\n“John is one of my oldest and dearest friends, and this character is such an important part of his life that I mostly just feel excited and happy that he gets to revisit her in this incredible incarnation,” said Trask. “And then there’s probably a small part of me that feels like Robbie Robertson felt when The Band reunited without him. I kind of wish I were going to be on that stage.”",
