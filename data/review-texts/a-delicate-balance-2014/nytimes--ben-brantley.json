  "fullText": "SCARBOROUGH, Me. — When Glenn Close first visited this beach town a decade ago, she walked into a kitchen and found a stuffed white bunny in a pot on the stove. It was yet another “Fatal Attraction” joke, but this time, Ms. Close laughed: She was smitten with the prankster, David Shaw, a venture capitalist she had started dating. Later, on the lawn of his waterfront home, they put on inflatable sumo wrestler suits and bumped bellies until Ms. Close was flailing like a turtle on its back. They married in 2006, and Ms. Close has since become a summertime Mainer, even mastering beach bocce ball with a zeal that would impress Patty Hewes, her cutthroat character on the cable series “Damages.”\n\nSo: Has marriage made Ms. Close the happiest she has ever been?\n\nShe took a long pause to consider that question on a recent afternoon. And no wonder. Not simply because she once said she would never marry again, after two divorces, because she felt it put too much pressure on men and women who were already “so vastly different.” Nor because, as blissed-out as life can be here, she still yearns for great film roles, if not the Academy Award that has proved elusive after six nominations.\n\nNo, happiness and marriage have become a potent topic because of her latest project, a return to Broadway this fall in Edward Albee’s “A Delicate Balance.” The play, which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1967, starts preview performances on Oct. 20 and is one of theater’s most intense domestic dramas, full of emotional sinkholes that Ms. Close has some experience with.\n\n“Well, you know, every human relationship is — you are constantly working on aspects of it,” she started saying, haltingly, as she sat on a porch of Mr. Shaw’s home that they now share. (He was away that day on business.)\n\nHow to wade through the crush of culture coming your way this season? Here’s a guide to 100 events that have us especially excited, in order of appearance.\n\nShe paused again, brushing sand off the red toenail polish on her bare feet, and then became more emphatic.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",
