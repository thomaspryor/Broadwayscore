  "bwwExcerpt": "When you put a bunch of great actors together...and get them to perform a Pulitzer-winning drama (by no less than Edward Albee), you expect fireworks. But the starry new Broadway revival of Albee's 1966 drama 'A Delicate Balance' is surprisingly flat and likely to disappoint both those unfamiliar with the three-act play, as well as those who still remember its much acclaimed revival from two decades ago with Elaine Stritch and Rosemary Harris...Despite the witty lines and a handful of exciting moments, the production is a three-hour, very static bore. Pam MacKinnon, who directed the 2012 Broadway revival of Albee's 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?', never manages to combine these accomplished performers into a unified ensemble. Perhaps that balance will be reached as the run continues.",
