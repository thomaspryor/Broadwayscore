    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic praises the play's core qualities ('dazzles with wit, gorgeous writing') but expresses disappointment with the direction's approach. Single excerpt warning and truncated text suggest low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play's wit and writing, indicating a positive view, but notes a lack of shock and subtlety compared to expectations. Given the single excerpt and text quality warning, the score is on the lower end of Positive. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the play's strengths but criticizes the direction, suggesting a mixed experience. The single excerpt and truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises Albee's text as 'dazzling' and 'gorgeous' but criticizes director Pam MacKinnon for explicit staging that lacks the subtlety and accumulating shock of previous productions. Given the single-excerpt warning and truncated ending, this represents a qualified recommendation.",
