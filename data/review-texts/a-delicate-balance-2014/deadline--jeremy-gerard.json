    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses powerful, dramatic imagery to describe Lithgow's performance as a 'storm' and 'neutron bomb,' suggesting intense praise for his central role. However, with only one truncated excerpt available, confidence is low as the full critical verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses vivid imagery to describe the impact of the production, suggesting a powerful and engaging experience. Given the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises John Lithgow's performance and describes the play's impact as powerful, suggesting a positive but potentially unsettling experience. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for John Lithgow's performance using powerful metaphors ('storm,' 'neutron bomb'), indicating a clearly positive assessment of the revival's central element. Confidence is low due to single-excerpt limitation and truncation.",
