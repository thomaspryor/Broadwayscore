  "bwwExcerpt": ": 'A Delicate Balance' is a long play, and, particularly in Agnes' lengthy speeches, it can slow down, and become gloomy. It's a pitfall that this production, which is mostly rewarding, doesn't completely avoid. Its biggest asset is Lithgow, who gives one of those masterful performances that's entertaining even as it's dramatically potent.",
