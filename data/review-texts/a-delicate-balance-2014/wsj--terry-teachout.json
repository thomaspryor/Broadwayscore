    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Critic finds most of the show dramatically static, comparing it unfavorably to another play, but notes it becomes interesting late. With only excerpts available and unclear overall verdict, this appears mixed leaning negative. | GPT-4o: The review suggests the show lacks dramatic tension and interest until late in the performance, implying a negative view. However, the text is excerpted, so the full context and final verdict are unclear, leading to low confidence. | Gemini: The review indicates that the play only becomes interesting late in the second act, suggesting a mixed experience overall. The truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the first portion as 'dramatically static' compared to Virginia Woolf, while noting a positive turn in the second act, suggesting an uneven production without a clear overall verdict in the provided text.",
