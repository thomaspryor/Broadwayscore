Avid theatergoers like to revisit classic plays, not so much looking for the definitive production but a different interpretation of great, familiar material.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | No bucket consensus - using median score | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges Glenn Close's performance as entertaining but does not provide a strong recommendation for the overall production. The tone suggests a neutral stance, focusing on revisiting classic plays rather than endorsing this specific revival. | Gemini: The review states that Glenn Close is entertaining and fun to watch, suggesting a positive aspect of the production. The phrase \"at least\" implies some reservations, but overall the review leans towards a positive, albeit qualified, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic uses faint praise ('at least') for Glenn Close's performance while criticizing the revival as 'blunt'—a significant flaw for Albee's subtle material—suggesting the production fails to capture the play's necessary nuance despite the star's efforts. | Buckets: openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Negative",

  "bwwExcerpt": "At least Glenn Close is entertaining and fun to watch in the new, blunt revival of Edward Albee's 'A Delicate Balance'...Close has this way of turning her black-button eyes into tiny holes that don't so much see out as burrow their way into her skull...Her performance is also why this 'Delicate Balance,' directed by Pam Mackinnon, is blunt and unsubtle. And turning Agnes into an uncompromising gargoyle is only part of the monochromatic scheme at work here. Not entertaining and fun are Plimpton's merely loud Julia and Duncan's monotonous Claire, a performance that exposes a serious flaw in Albee's play: Claire, besides being clairvoyant and delivering a few amusing wisecracks, serves no function in act three...Back in the 1960s, Albee was accused of turning his female characters into harridans. Mackinnon's work with these three actresses, unfortunately, makes that case...Lithgow and Balaban give some semblance of playing human beings. Lithgow's delivery of Tobias' famous cat speech is especially multi-faceted.",
