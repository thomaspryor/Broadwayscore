The positive language outweighs the reservations. Confidence is low due to truncated excerpt format. | GPT-4o: The review praises the production as 'feisty' and 'intriguing' with 'shimmering character work,' indicating a positive reception. However, it notes occasional restlessness and oscillating speeds, suggesting some reservations. The excerpt's brevity and lack of a full conclusion lower confidence. | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"intriguing work\" and praises the \"shimmering character work,\" but also notes that the production \"can feel like it's oscillating speeds,\" suggesting a qualified recommendation. Confidence is low due to the truncated text. | Kimi: The critic praises the shimmering character work and strong cast while noting occasional pacing inconsistencies, resulting in a qualified but clear recommendation to see the revival.",
