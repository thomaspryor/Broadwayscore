The original 60 rating confirms this falls in Mixed territory, neither recommending nor discouraging attendance. | GPT-4o: The review praises the cast but criticizes the play as 'chilly' and 'cerebral,' aligning with the critic's original rating of 60, indicating a mixed assessment. | Gemini: The review praises the cast, but ultimately finds the play itself to be distancing. This aligns with a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While praising the cast as excellent, the critic ultimately finds Albee's play chilly and distancing, resulting in a mixed assessment consistent with the 60/100 rating provided.",
