The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review. | Gemini: The review praises the cast but finds the play itself emotionally detached, aligning with a mixed assessment. The critic's rating of 60 supports this classification. | Kimi: The critic praises the cast highly but finds the play itself emotionally remote and alienating. The provided 60/100 rating confirms a mixed assessment that neither fully recommends nor discourages attendance.",
