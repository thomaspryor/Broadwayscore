  "bwwExcerpt": "Albee likes his works to be directed by MacKinnon because, I think, she makes no attempt to amplify the angst, but concentrates instead on total veracity in primary colors and on turning her actors -- no small feat here -- into an ensemble of interdependent players...Close, returning to Broadway after many years away, will need more time to fully lubricate her considerable skills in this kind of stage-savvy company, although a note of self-consciousness is hardly inapt for Agnes, and Close is always true. But with Lithgow, everything is always in play. Right now. As Tobias, Lithgow's colors are as ample as his fellow's growing understanding that a drink cart is about all that separates a well-appointed home from an elevator, going down...This is, to say the least, a pleasurable three acts of watching others teeter on the brink, which always helps you last another day on terra firma yourself. Albee's gift to humanity, you might say.",
