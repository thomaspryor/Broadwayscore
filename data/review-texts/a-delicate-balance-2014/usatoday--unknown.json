  "bwwExcerpt": "There are few things more terrifying than a calm Glenn Close...Agnes, who sees it as her task to maintain order, never entirely loses her cool. But in Close's revelatory performance, she evolves from a woman who seems almost preternaturally composed -- even as she contemplates going mad, in her first lines -- to a more intimidating and sadder creature striving desperately for 'maintenance,' as she puts it...MacKinnon certainly doesn't shy away from Balance's absurdist leanings...Tobias and Agnes and their decades of baggage are central throughout, of course, and MacKinnon and her actors make it abundantly clear that this marriage is not a loveless one. The tenderness and regret in Lithgow's expression as Tobias looks at his wife, and the barely repressed agony Close brings to some lines, convey something greater than tolerance or co-dependence. These fine actors find the warmth in Albee's stinging message. It's a pleasure to see them in roles that accommodate both their intensity and their flair for nuance.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for Close's 'revelatory performance' and Lithgow's work, with appreciation for the director's approach and the actors finding 'warmth' in difficult material. The concluding 'pleasure to see them' indicates clear recommendation, though focus is primarily on performances rather than the production as a whole. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of Glenn Close and John Lithgow, highlighting their ability to convey warmth and nuance. The description of Close's performance as 'revelatory' and the pleasure of seeing the actors suggests a strong positive impression, though the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"revelatory performance\", \"fine actors\", and \"pleasure to see them\". Given the single excerpt, I am scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Close's 'revelatory' performance and Lithgow's work, calling the production a 'pleasure,' though as a single curated excerpt it warrants conservative scoring in the upper Positive range.",
