  "bwwExcerpt": ", : I will tell you now that you can't miss these performances -- including British actress Clare Higgins. Albee's play is a masterpiece and this group conveys it very well. There is some shaky direction by Pam McKinnon...Albee's play about family, friendship, love, and loss is devastating. 'Balance' maintains its own balance as a conventional drawing room comedy of manners that becomes an existential jigsaw puzzle. Close and Lithgow have an amazing rapport, as do Balaban and Higgins. Martha Plimpton gives it all heft as the voice of reason. The amazing Lindsay Duncan is there for upheaval, and for playing the accordion. I wish she did more on Broadway.",
