  "bwwExcerpt": ", : I will tell you now that you can't miss these performances -- including British actress Clare Higgins. Albee's play is a masterpiece and this group conveys it very well. There is some shaky direction by Pam McKinnon...Albee's play about family, friendship, love, and loss is devastating. 'Balance' maintains its own balance as a conventional drawing room comedy of manners that becomes an existential jigsaw puzzle. Close and Lithgow have an amazing rapport, as do Balaban and Higgins. Martha Plimpton gives it all heft as the voice of reason. The amazing Lindsay Duncan is there for upheaval, and for playing the accordion. I wish she did more on Broadway.",

Minor reservation about direction doesn't undermine the overall positive verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances highly and calls Albee's play a masterpiece, suggesting a strong positive impression despite some criticism of the direction. The single excerpt and lack of a full review text reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review states \"you can't miss these performances\" and calls the play a masterpiece, indicating a strong positive recommendation despite some reservations about the direction. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains enthusiastic recommendation language ('can't miss', 'masterpiece') and strong praise for the cast, though the criticism of 'shaky direction' prevents a Rave classification. Scored at upper end of Positive range per excerpt-only guidelines.",
