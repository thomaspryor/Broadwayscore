    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes show as worth seeing ('a chance to see') with praise for clarity of production. However, confidence is low due to limited text - this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive recommendation, highlighting the opportunity to see a classic work with clarity. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is at the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a positive recommendation, but the lack of context makes it difficult to assess the strength of the recommendation. I've placed it in the lower end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a clear recommendation to see the show, praising the production's clarity in handling difficult material, though the single curated quote limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
