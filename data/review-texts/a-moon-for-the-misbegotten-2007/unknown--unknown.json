    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance using elevated language ('luminous', 'heart-wrenching') suggests positive verdict, but single excerpt from unknown source requires caution and low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Wilson's performance as 'luminous' and describes a powerful emotional transformation. Given the single excerpt warning, this suggests a strong positive impression, but the confidence is low due to the limited text. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a strong positive assessment of Wilson's performance, suggesting a positive overall experience. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing the score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
