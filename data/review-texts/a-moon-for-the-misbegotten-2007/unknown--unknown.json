    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance ('luminous', 'heart-wrenching') but only one excerpt available from unknown source makes full assessment impossible. Upper Positive range due to clearly positive language. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Wilson's performance as 'luminous' and describes her emotional depth, suggesting a positive view of her portrayal. However, with only one excerpt, the overall sentiment is uncertain, so a low confidence score at the upper end of Positive is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a strong positive assessment of Wilson's performance, suggesting a positive overall experience despite the limited context. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performance using words like 'luminous' and 'heart-wrenching,' indicating a positive reception, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the overall verdict.",
