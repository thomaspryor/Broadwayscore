    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises the director's work with superlative language ('heavenly', 'like stars'), suggesting strong positive assessment of the production, but very limited text available for full verdict determination. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses vivid, positive imagery to describe the production, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the production in a positive light, but it is difficult to determine the overall verdict with only one sentence. Given the positive tone, I am scoring it as positive, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear, appreciative praise for the director's aesthetic choices and production design using evocative positive language ('heavenly,' 'stars'), though the single-quote limitation prevents a higher confidence assessment.",
