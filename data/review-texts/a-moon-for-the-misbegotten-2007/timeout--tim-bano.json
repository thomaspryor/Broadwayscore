However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, describing the production as impactful and sharp. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs energetic, combative metaphors ('punch', 'jab', 'dagger') to praise the production's vitality and sharp writing, indicating strong approval. However, confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation.",
