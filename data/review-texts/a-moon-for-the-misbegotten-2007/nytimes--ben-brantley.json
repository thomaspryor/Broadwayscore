    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performances achieving 'something approaching the impossible' suggests a positive recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of McDonald and Hoffman, suggesting a strong emotional impact and a positive experience. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances of McDonald and Hoffman, suggesting a positive experience. Due to the limited text, confidence is low, but the strong praise warrants a score on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise for the lead performances ('approaching the impossible'), suggesting a high level of craft and emotional authenticity. While limited to a single curated quote focused specifically on the acting, the language indicates clear enthusiasm within the Positive bucket.",
