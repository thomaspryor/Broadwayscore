    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('breathing fresh life', 'riveting', 'seethes with subtext') suggests an enthusiastic recommendation. Single excerpt limits confidence, but the praise appears unqualified. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language like 'riveting revival' and 'breathing fresh life', indicating a highly favorable view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"fresh life\", \"painfully relatable emotion\", and \"riveting revival\", suggesting a strong recommendation. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt features enthusiastic praise ('riveting', 'breathing fresh life', 'painfully relatable'), warranting a high Positive score. However, as only one curated excerpt is available, confidence is low and the score is conservatively placed at the upper end of the Positive bucket per instructions for single-excerpt reviews.",
