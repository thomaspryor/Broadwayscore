    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic acknowledges a significant flaw ('bagginess remains a sticking point') but ultimately recommends seeing it as a 'valuable chance' with praise for the ensemble's quality and the production's dynamism. Single excerpt with mixed signals warrants lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges a flaw ('bagginess') but highlights the show's dynamic delivery and humor, suggesting a positive recommendation despite reservations. Due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a significant flaw (\"bagginess\") but praises the dynamism and humor of the ensemble, suggesting a qualified recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt provides a qualified recommendation, offering strong praise for the ensemble and staging ('very highest quality', 'dynamism') while acknowledging structural flaws ('bagginess'), placing it in the upper-positive range.",
