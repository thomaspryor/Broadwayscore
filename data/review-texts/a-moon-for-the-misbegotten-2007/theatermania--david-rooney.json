However, confidence is low due to limited text from curated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and the revival's faithfulness to the playwright's work, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances as \"commanding\" and states the revival \"honors\" the playwright's work, indicating a positive assessment. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the lead performances as commanding and notes the revival honors O'Neill's poetry and the characters' humanity, indicating a solid recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, it may not capture the full review verdict.",
