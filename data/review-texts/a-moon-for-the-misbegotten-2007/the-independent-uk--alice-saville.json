    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising a 'brilliant performance' suggests positive assessment, but very limited text makes full verdict unclear. Scored at upper end of Positive bucket due to strong praise word 'brilliant'. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Wilson's performance as 'brilliant' and impactful, suggesting a positive view. However, the single excerpt warning indicates the possibility of cherry-picking, so the score is on the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a brilliant performance and its positive impact on the portrayal of misogyny. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt employs strong positive language ('brilliant') regarding the lead performance, indicating a favorable review. Per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, scored in upper Positive range (80-84) with low confidence due to limited context.",
