  "bwwExcerpt": "In a Broadway season robust with bravura performances, comes another that makes demands of our souls along with our ears...As played -- no, embodied -- by Mantello with fathomless compassion and dignity (not to mention charm and humor), Ned is impossible to ignore. 'The Normal Heart' is unabashed agitprop, which is rarely welcome on Broadway, and Ned Weeks is an unlikely hero. But as 'Jerusalem' is also showing us, not all heroes wear white hats. Some are unpleasant company, doing what they must, demanding that attention be paid.",
