  "bwwExcerpt": "In its Broadway debut with a starry cast that includes Joe Mantello, Ellen Barkin and Jim Parsons, 'The Normal Heart' hasn't lost any of its anger or biting humor, but it feels more like a fascinating time capsule. Most impressive is John Benjamin Hickey as Ned's lover. As he changes from handsome, assured newspaper reporter into a shell of a man ravaged by disease, he embodies the painful intersection of the political and the personal where 'The Normal Heart' beats.",
