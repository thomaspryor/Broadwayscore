  "bwwExcerpt": "All of this might lead one to expect that the revival of \"The Normal Heart\" would be a political, historical, even anthropological experience rather than a theatrically satisfying one. It is certainly true that \"The Normal Heart\" is not the best play to deal with AIDS...But \"The Normal Heart\" can be appreciated as a play, rather than as a cause or a series of hectoring lectures.",
