  "bwwExcerpt": "Mr. Waltz comes closest to being genuinely funny; he's a sly actor, as well as a fine one, and the ironies of his character allow him some restraint. But the unsubtleties of the script—gleeful displays of glib hypocrisy—compounded by two broad performances plus Ms. Foster's excruciatingly shrill one, make \"Carnage\" a puppet show with a misanthropic puppeteer.",
