  "bwwExcerpt": "There's a fine, fine line... No, let me rephrase that. There's a wide gaping canyon between clever social commentary and unmotivated slapstick. And while I'm not suggesting that Yasmina Reza's God of Carnage had me longing for the subtle nuances of Messrs. Moe, Larry and Curly I will admit to being reminded of the famous Tallulah Bankhead quip, 'There's less to this than meets the eye.'",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic draws unfavorable comparisons to slapstick comedy and uses the dismissive Bankhead quote to suggest the play lacks substance. The 'wide gaping canyon' metaphor indicates the production fails to achieve meaningful social commentary. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests disappointment with the play's execution, comparing it unfavorably to slapstick and implying it lacks depth. However, with only one excerpt, the full sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence in the verdict. | Gemini: The critic is clearly unimpressed, suggesting the play lacks substance and comparing it unfavorably to slapstick comedy. Given only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the production as 'unmotivated slapstick' rather than clever social commentary, suggesting it fails to deliver the depth it promises.",
