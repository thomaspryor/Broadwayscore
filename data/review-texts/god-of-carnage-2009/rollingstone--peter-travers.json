  "bwwExcerpt": "There's nothing terribly wrong with Carnage, the film version of Yasmina Reza's Tony-winning stage comedy God of Carnage. But there's nothing trippingly right with it either. What bubbled on stage lacks fizz on screen...the film version of Carnage hasn't just lost God from its title, it's lost the laughs from the play that brought it life.",

The critic explicitly states they are reviewing 'the film version' and compares it unfavorably to the stage production, but the evaluation is of the cinematic adaptation, not the theatrical show itself.",
