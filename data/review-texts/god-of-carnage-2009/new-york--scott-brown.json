  "bwwExcerpt": "So why does God of Carnage, for all its witty anarchy and farcical cheek, feel a little flabby in the gut, a little punch-drunk and glass-jawed—and, even at 85 minutes, a little padded Maybe because it’s all too easy. This fight feels fixed: the punches telegraphed, the reversals rehearsed. The cozy bassinet of gentrified Brooklyn (where child-rearing is art form, fashion statement, and blood sport, all in one) is about as big a bull’s-eye as the boulevard affords. (Reza’s longtime translator, Christopher Hampton, has repatriated the story from a tony Paris arrondissement to Cobble Hill.)",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Acknowledges positive elements ('witty anarchy and farcical cheek') but overall assessment is disappointed - calls it 'flabby,' 'punch-drunk,' 'padded,' and 'too easy.' Single excerpt warning means this could be unrepresentative of full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as having 'witty anarchy and farcical cheek' but also criticizes it as 'flabby' and 'padded'. This suggests a mixed review, acknowledging some positive elements but also significant flaws. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the play has some redeeming qualities (\"witty anarchy and farcical cheek\") but ultimately feels \"flabby\" and \"padded.\" This indicates a mixed reaction, but the single excerpt and truncated nature lower confidence. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the play's 'witty anarchy' but focuses heavily on its structural flaws, calling it 'flabby,' 'padded,' and 'fixed' with 'telegraphed' punches. As a single curated excerpt without a clear final recommendation, this suggests a mixed assessment weighing style against substance.",
