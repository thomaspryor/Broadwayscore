  "bwwExcerpt": "Reza's scabrously funny new play, which opened Sunday at the Bernard Jacobs Theatre, is set in the home of Michael and Veronica Novak, seemingly a nice, middle-class couple. The Novaks play host to the more affluent Alan and Annette Raleigh, whose son has bashed their son's teeth in. It's not a typical social visit, but both sets of parents are determined to work out the matter civilly.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls the play 'scabrously funny' which is positive praise, but this single excerpt is purely descriptive plot setup and may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as 'scabrously funny,' indicating a positive tone. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review, the confidence is low and the score is set at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the setup of the play but doesn't offer a clear evaluation. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if the review is positive or negative, so I'm classifying it as mixed with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the play as 'scabrously funny,' indicating clear appreciation for the writing's sharp wit and comedy, though the limited excerpt provides mostly plot context rather than a full critical assessment.",
