    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Critic praises the construction as 'skillful' and performances as 'wicked,' with emotional engagement promised through laughter and cringing. However, this appears to be a brief excerpt, limiting full assessment of the critic's complete verdict. | GPT-4o: The review praises the show for its skillful construction and wicked performances, suggesting a highly enjoyable experience that elicits both laughter and cringing. The enthusiastic tone and lack of reservations indicate a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review highlights the skillful construction and performance of the play, suggesting a positive experience, although the mention of cringing implies some reservations. | Kimi: The critic delivers unqualified praise for both the writing ('skillfully constructed') and performances ('wickedly performed'), framing the show's uncomfortable humor as an intentional and effective virtue rather than a flaw. The promise that audiences will find themselves 'laughing and cringing' indicates a successful theatrical experience.",
