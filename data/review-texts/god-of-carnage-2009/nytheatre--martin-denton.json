  "bwwExcerpt": "There is much that's resonant to take away from God of Carnage: not only its honest view of the worst inside all of us, but its more focused jabs at cell phone culture, pharmaceutical companies' dishonesty, and inappropriate parenting techniques of various descriptions. But when I left the theatre, I felt that I hadn't seen the play's true potential realized.",
