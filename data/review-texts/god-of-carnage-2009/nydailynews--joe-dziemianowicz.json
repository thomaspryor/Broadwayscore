  "bwwExcerpt": "Reza, the Tony-winning French author of “Art,” has skewered middle-class hypocrisy before. She’s also writing here about pentup rage seething beneath daily lives, particularly in a big city like New York. The confrontation unleashes hostilities as ever-shifting alliances form between and among the couples. It’s sort of a “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” meets “Survivor.” Once rum starts flowing, it gets louder, uglier and funnier.",
