  "bwwExcerpt": "Not quite a fully realized play, it's an extended situation comedy featuring two couples meeting to discuss a playground fight between their 11-year-old sons. It seems one of the little boys whacked the other with a stick causing him to lose two teeth. At first, the interaction is civil but there are tensions in the air. It doesn't take long before emotions erupt. And look out. Besides being exceptionally funny, there are several shocking moments in this play that are bound to take you by complete surprise.",
