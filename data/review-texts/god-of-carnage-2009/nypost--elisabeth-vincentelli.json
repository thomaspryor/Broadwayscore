  "bwwExcerpt": "As she did in 'Art,' Reza dissects upper-middle-class foils with precision and a welcome mean streak, but her plays don't amount to all that much once the smoke has cleared. 'God of Carnage' itself boils down to 'Good manners only hide bad problems.' We learn something old every day. Her dramatic devices aren't all that innovative, either puking is a cheap way to get a laugh. It's also a diabolically efficient one, especially in the hands of director Matthew Warchus and his expert cast.",
