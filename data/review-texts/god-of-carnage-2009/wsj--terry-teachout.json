  "bwwExcerpt": "The conceit of 'God of Carnage' is that Ms. Reza's couples are cut from different bolts of the same cloth. The wives are self-righteous liberals who believe that good will can solve all problems, the husbands thuggish conservatives equally certain (as Mr. Daniels's character puts it) that violence is 'a law of life. . . . People struggle until they're dead.' The point of the play, insofar as it has one, is that the husbands are more or less right: No sooner do the wives start drinking than they shed their bourgeois inhibitions and come out swinging.",

This suggests a positive, but qualified, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic praises the ensemble's skill in elevating the material ('fine actors,' 'approaching art') but explicitly states the play itself fails to achieve its artistic ambitions ('never quite gets there'), resulting in a balanced, non-committal assessment without a clear recommendation.",
