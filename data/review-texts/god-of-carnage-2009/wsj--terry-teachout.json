This suggests a positive, but qualified, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic praises the ensemble's skill in elevating the material ('fine actors,' 'approaching art') but explicitly states the play itself fails to achieve its artistic ambitions ('never quite gets there'), resulting in a balanced, non-committal assessment without a clear recommendation.",
