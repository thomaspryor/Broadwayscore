    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges inventive elements but explicitly calls the show 'something of a disappointment.' This suggests mixed feelings leaning negative, but the single excerpt warning requires caution about the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges inventiveness but ultimately labels the show as a disappointment, indicating a negative verdict. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a low confidence level. | Gemini: The review acknowledges inventiveness but ultimately finds the show disappointing, indicating a mixed reaction. The single excerpt and lack of full text reduce confidence. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges significant inventiveness in the production, they explicitly characterize the show as 'something of a disappointment,' indicating an overall negative recommendation rather than a mixed or positive one. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
