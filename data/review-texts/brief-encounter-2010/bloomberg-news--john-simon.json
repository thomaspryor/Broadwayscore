    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Pan) - using median score | Claude: The critic calls the show a 'bastardization' and expresses pity for the actors. However, this is only one excerpt and may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong negative language ('bastardization') and expresses sympathy for the actors trapped in a poor production. The lack of redeeming qualities and the comparison to an unsurpassable movie version suggest a deep pan. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the word \"bastardization\" and expresses pity for the actors, suggesting a negative overall assessment of the production. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic employs the devastating term 'bastardization' to condemn the production wholesale while expressing sympathy for the actors trapped in it, indicating a strongly negative verdict despite limited available text. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Pan",
