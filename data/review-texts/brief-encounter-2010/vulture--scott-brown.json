  "bwwExcerpt": "To pin down precisely what Brief Encounter is (a para-cinematic mock-expressionistic play with music? A self-conscious post-Luhrmann meta-movie-musical onstage?) would quickly exhaust the Earth’s dwindling supply of hyphens. I’ll settle for “cabinet of wonders,” which seems to get at the false-bottomed delights of this sui generis theatrical event from director Emma Rice and her eager-to-please Kneehigh Theatre troupe. Ferried more or less intact across the East River from St. Ann’s Warehouse to Studio 54, Brief is built atop filmmaker David Lean’s dour postwar chiaroscuro of the same name, about an impossible affair carried on by two married, decent, highly un-Byronic souls. (The 1945 film was based on Noel Coward’s star-crossed stage melodrama Still Life, and Rice has restored some of Coward’s original dialogue.)",
