    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt focuses on what's lost in adaptation, describing romance as 'swallowed up' and overall feel as 'off' - suggests disappointed expectations rather than recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a loss of charm and an underwhelming romantic portrayal, indicating a mixed review. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a loss of something captivating and that something feels 'a little off,' suggesting a mixed or slightly negative sentiment. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it in the mixed range. | Kimi: The single available excerpt indicates the production fails to fully capture the expected coziness, with the central romance feeling 'swallowed up' and 'a little off,' suggesting significant execution flaws without outright condemnation.",
