  "bwwExcerpt": "Although Brief Encounter offers plenty of comic embellishments and artful stage business, it is most powerful when it quiets down to give the material’s sorrow full scope. Adapter and director Emma Rice’s use of Coward’s songs—“A Room with a View” and “Mad About the Boy,” to name two—makes structural (if not always tonal) sense, even if you wish the cast included stronger singers. But then again, it’s the whole artful package, not its individual parts, that seems to sweep some people off their feet.",
