  "bwwExcerpt": "Emma Rice’s overstuffed and overwhelming production, which premiered Off-Broadway last season, adds song and dance, slapstick comedy, video projections, puppetry and a jazz band to what is a relatively sober and sad tale of star-crossed lovers. The end result is just as clever as it is irritating and unnecessary.",
