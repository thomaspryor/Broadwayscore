  "bwwExcerpt": "Even if you're not familiar with David Lean's 1946 movie melodrama Brief Encounter, you will find yourself caught up in writer-director Emma Rice's brilliantly reconceived stage adaptation, now playing at Broadway's Studio 54 following a successful run last winter at Brooklyn's St. Ann's Warehouse. (EW's original review). Despite playing in a much-larger theater, the show loses nothing of its considerable wit or charm.",
