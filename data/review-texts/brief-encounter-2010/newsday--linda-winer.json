  "bwwExcerpt": "Last winter, fortunate theatergoers fell madly, hopelessly in love with 'Brief Encounter,' the enchanting British spin on the Noel Coward movie that had a limited sold-out run at the adventurous little St. Ann's Warehouse under the Brooklyn Bridge.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear enthusiasm with phrases like 'fell madly, hopelessly in love' and 'enchanting,' but as a single curated excerpt, it may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'enchanting' and notes that theatergoers 'fell madly, hopelessly in love' with it, indicating strong positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic describes the show as \"enchanting\" and indicates that it is a welcome addition to Broadway. Given the limited text, I am scoring it as positive with high end of the range. | Kimi: The excerpt uses rapturous language like 'ingenious,' 'enchanting,' and 'madly, hopelessly in love,' indicating strong enthusiasm for this Broadway transfer. However, given this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's balance, the score is capped at the upper end of the Positive range per protocol.",
