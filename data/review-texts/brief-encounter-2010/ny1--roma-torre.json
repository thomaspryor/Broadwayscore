  "bwwExcerpt": "The concept relies heavily on audio/visual elements which are ingeniously woven into the production. And when all is said and done what emerges is a beautifully touching piece of theatre. To compare it to the source would be a disservice since creator/director Emma Rice's staging is itself artfully original. What she’s achieved is something of a reconstruction of the Noel Coward work. Rice added songs written by the author, along with puppets, evocative choreography and a giant screen featuring filmed projections, all of which contribute yet another dimension to the story.",
