  "bwwExcerpt": "The concept relies heavily on audio/visual elements which are ingeniously woven into the production. And when all is said and done what emerges is a beautifully touching piece of theatre. To compare it to the source would be a disservice since creator/director Emma Rice's staging is itself artfully original. What she’s achieved is something of a reconstruction of the Noel Coward work. Rice added songs written by the author, along with puppets, evocative choreography and a giant screen featuring filmed projections, all of which contribute yet another dimension to the story.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic praises the production as 'beautifully touching' and 'artfully original,' highlighting the director's achievement and innovative staging. However, since this is only a curated excerpt, confidence is medium. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's originality and artistic elements, describing it as 'beautifully touching' and 'artfully original'. Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses phrases like \"ingeniously woven\", \"beautifully touching\", and \"artfully original\", indicating a positive assessment. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers strong praise for the production's emotional impact and originality, describing it as 'beautifully touching' and 'artfully original,' which indicates a clear recommendation. Given this is only one curated excerpt that may be cherry-picked, confidence is low but the language warrants an upper-range Positive score.",
