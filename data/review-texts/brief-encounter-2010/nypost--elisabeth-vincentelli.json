However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"brilliant,\" \"spirited charm offensive,\" and \"impossible to resist,\" indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic superlatives like 'brilliant' and 'impossible to resist', indicating a clear recommendation in the 80-84 range. Confidence is low per the single-excerpt warning. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
