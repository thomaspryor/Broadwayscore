  "bwwExcerpt": "Rice uses a variety of charming strategies to ward off the stuffier conceits of the period love story, much of it set just before World War II in the railway station where the furtive lovers meet. Actors and musicians perform Coward songs such as 'Mad About the Boy' and 'Always,' the latter written with Stu Barker; a band plays some numbers before the show, and others are woven into the plot. Onto Neil Murray's industrial set, meanwhile, a screen is occasionally lowered, so that flesh-and-blood actors can interact with their celluloid interlocutors, a technique used to similar effect in Woody Allen's sly movie comedy 'The Purple Rose of Cairo.'",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes production elements positively ('charming strategies') and shows appreciation for creative choices, but lacks clear recommendation language. Given excerpt limitation and cautious tone, scored at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the use of 'charming strategies' and innovative techniques, suggesting a positive view of the production's creativity. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes 'charming strategies' and favorably compares the technique to Woody Allen's movie. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly praises director Emma Rice's 'charming strategies' and describes the theatrical techniques appreciatively, indicating a clearly positive assessment of the production despite the limited context.",
