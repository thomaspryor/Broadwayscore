  "bwwExcerpt": "Proving once more that Noel Coward wrote sexier scenes for clothed people that most playwrights could with naked ones, the evening's steamy highlight comes in a moment where Yelland and Sturrock, alone together at last, finally reach the 'will we or won't we' point. With the company singing Stu Barker's soft ukulele arrangement of 'Go Slow, Johnny' in the background, the tension is elegantly unbearable.",
