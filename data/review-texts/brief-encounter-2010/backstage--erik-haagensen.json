  "bwwExcerpt": "When Kneehigh Theatre's multimedia stage adaptation of the classic Noël Coward-penned film 'Brief Encounter' played St. Ann's Warehouse this past December, this Coward fan attended with great trepidation, only to fall head over heels for it. I felt similar trepidation when I heard that Roundabout Theatre Company would bring the show to Broadway at Studio 54. St. Ann's is a decidedly intimate space. Would the show fill a much larger house? Happily, the answer is ringingly affirmative.",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses strong enthusiasm for the Broadway production, overcoming initial trepidation with a 'ringingly affirmative' verdict, indicating a highly positive experience. | Gemini: The critic expresses initial trepidation but ultimately finds the production successful and filling the larger Broadway house, indicating a positive experience. | Kimi: The critic expresses strong enthusiasm for the Broadway transfer, using phrases like 'fall head over heels' and 'ringingly affirmative' to indicate the production successfully makes the jump to a larger venue.",
