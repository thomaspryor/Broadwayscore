  "bwwExcerpt": "When Kneehigh Theatre's multimedia stage adaptation of the classic Noël Coward-penned film 'Brief Encounter' played St. Ann's Warehouse this past December, this Coward fan attended with great trepidation, only to fall head over heels for it. I felt similar trepidation when I heard that Roundabout Theatre Company would bring the show to Broadway at Studio 54. St. Ann's is a decidedly intimate space. Would the show fill a much larger house? Happily, the answer is ringingly affirmative.",
