  "bwwExcerpt": "They are part of the reason theatregoers leave the play with a smile. That, and the cast itself waiting for you near the bar at the end, singing modern songs by Beyonce, Cyndi Lauper and Journey while playing accordion, trumpet, double bass and ukulele. Does being serenaded by the actors after the doomed romance on stage ends in tears make sense? Not really, particularly after all the blissful hijinks have evaporated. But if this is what Rice can do with a mere sliver of a story, just imagine what she can do with something more meaty.",
