    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear criticism about lost intimacy and romance being 'swallowed up', concluding 'it feels a little off'. With only one curated quote available and no positive counterbalance visible, this suggests a mixed-to-negative assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a loss of impact and an 'off' feeling, indicating mixed sentiments. However, without a full review or clear positive or negative language, the score is set in the middle of the Mixed range. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a loss of charm and a romance that doesn't quite work, suggesting a mixed or lukewarm reception. Given that this is the only excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates specific staging issues dampen the central romance, suggesting a mixed reception where production flaws undermine the material's intimacy.",
