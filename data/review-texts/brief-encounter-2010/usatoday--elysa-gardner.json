  "bwwExcerpt": "Those who associate Coward with sophisticated couples gliding glibly through dry repartee may be surprised by the depths of sensuality and tenderness reached in this adaptation of his work, which opened Tuesday at Roundabout Theatre Company's Studio 54. Initially performed at London's Kneehigh Theatre, Encounter draws on both Coward's screenplay of the same title and his one-act play Still Life, on which the film was based.",
