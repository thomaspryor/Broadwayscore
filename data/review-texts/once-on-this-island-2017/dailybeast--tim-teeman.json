  "bwwExcerpt": "The Caribbean music of Once On This Island is so exuberant and beautifully performed that it is only at the end you realize what a tragic tale has been told to you...Kilgore's voice is pure and resonant, Philip Boykin and Kenita R. Miller, as Ti Moune's adoptive parents, who worry for her safety, sing beautifully too, their warmth and love for Ti Moune feel as an all-encompassing musical blanket by the audience too. Salonga is the perfect 'good witch' of Love counterpart to Dandridge's malevolence. If the music is wonderful-truly, every song-and the direction brimming with life and originality",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"For most of the musical, you are utterly enveloped and enchanted...If the music is wonderful—truly, every song—and the direction brimming with life and originality, what jars in 'Once On This Island' is the story.
