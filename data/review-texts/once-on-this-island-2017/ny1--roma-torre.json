  "bwwExcerpt": "Theatre-in-the-round is always a big challenge to stage, but the dazzling revival of 'Once On This Island,' currently ensconced in the Circle in the Square Theatre, feels right at home - and long may it live. The show that first graced Broadway in 1990 is back in a production that comes to life in a burst of creative energy courtesy director Michael Arden. His staging of the vibrant musical written by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty sprawls with abandon across the entire playing space, up the aisles, and along the back walls.",
