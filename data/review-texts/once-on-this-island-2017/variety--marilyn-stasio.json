  "bwwExcerpt": "The ungainly in-the-round stage of Broadway's Circle in the Square is put to imaginative use in director Michael Arden's inspired revival of 'Once On This Island,' the 1990 musical by Lynn Ahrens (book & lyrics) and Stephen Flaherty (music). The imaginative physical design extends to the auditorium, where colorful laundry hangs on the side walls and luxurious vegetation blooms. Everything about Dane Laffrey's immersive set design welcomes the audience to the little island in the French Antilles where this pretty but sad fable is set.",
