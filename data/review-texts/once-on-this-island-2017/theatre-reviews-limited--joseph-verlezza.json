  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The captivating aura that cast a magical spell fueling the imagination of a little girl as she listens to the folklore of the island is replaced by a big Broadway spectacle that is plagued with excess and self-indulgence...At times the story is lost. Obscured by overwrought staging and a superfluous set...Vocally the cast is a powerhouse but over amplified...Even with all its distraction and pitfalls, for those who have never visited this island before, it will be a marvelous vacation.”\n\nRead more",
