  "bwwExcerpt": "Thanks to a large cast and the most stunning use of puppetry since 'The Lion King,' this co-production by Lincoln Center Theater and London's National Theatre is absolutely masterful and immensely moving...Be warned that 'War Horse' is a genuine tearjerker. But it is not so sentimental as to be off-putting. This is tug-at-your-heartstrings storytelling at its most spectacular and transcendent.",
