  "bwwExcerpt": "While it's all beautifully acted by an American company, the true stars of this production are the animals, designed by Adrian Kohler and Basil Jones of the Handspring Puppet Company. Lifelike without any attempt to conceal the artifice, the creatures are magnificent, a thrilling synthesis of art and imagination. It wasn't until after heading home that I stopped to think that I had just cried over a horse that was actually made up of several props held together by visible handlers. This is the power and magic of great theater.",
