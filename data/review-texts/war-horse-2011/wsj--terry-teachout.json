The focus on the impressive stagecraft and puppetry suggests a high level of praise. | Gemini: The review calls the show a \"triumph of stagecraft\" which indicates a positive sentiment. However, the praise is somewhat qualified by the focus on the puppets over the human actors. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives like 'triumph' and 'magnificent' to celebrate the puppetry and emotional impact, indicating an enthusiastic recommendation despite the brevity of the excerpt. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
