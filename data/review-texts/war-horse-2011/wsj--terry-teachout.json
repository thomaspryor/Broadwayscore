    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Review explicitly calls the show 'a triumph' and praises the puppetry as 'magnificent' and 'most moving.' While noting it's 'stagecraft over sentiment,' this reads as praise for the production's technical achievement rather than criticism. | GPT-4o: The review uses the word 'triumph' to describe the show, indicating a strong, enthusiastic recommendation. The focus on the impressive puppetry as a highlight suggests a unique and compelling theatrical experience. | Gemini: The review calls the show a \"triumph of stagecraft\" and highlights the moving performances of the puppets, indicating a positive, though somewhat qualified, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives ('triumph,' 'magnificent') to praise the production's puppetry and emotional impact without reservation, calling it a triumph of theatrical technique. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
