  "bwwExcerpt": "Some have branded the show as sentimental. Have we become so jaded that people are called suckers for crying during a good, old-fashioned tale? 'War Horse' isn't sentimental: It's just not afraid to be emotional. Ultimately, the show succeeds because it tells children and reminds adults that some of life's joys are made great by terrible hardships.",
