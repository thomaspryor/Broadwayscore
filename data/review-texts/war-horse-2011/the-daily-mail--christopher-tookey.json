  "bwwExcerpt": "Steven Spielberg, with the help of screenwriters Lee Hall and Richard Curtis, has fashioned Michael Morpurgo’s novel into an unforgettable experience, the most moving picture I have seen all year. This could be described as a ‘boy and his horse’ movie, but that is to underestimate its power, passion and complexity. This is the best of all horse movies, even surpassing such classics as National Velvet, Black Beauty and Seabiscuit.",
