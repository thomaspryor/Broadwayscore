    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise calling the show 'a marvel' and highlighting the playwright's 'mastery.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong praise ('marvel of construction and characterization') and highlights the playwright's mastery, suggesting a highly positive view. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"marvel\" and \"mastery,\" indicating a positive review. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the language pushes the score towards the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt uses superlatives ('marvel,' 'mastery') indicating strong praise for the play's construction and writing, placing it in the upper Positive range. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced per instructions.",
