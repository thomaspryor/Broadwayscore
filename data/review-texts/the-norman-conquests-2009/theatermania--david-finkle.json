    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Calls the play 'a marvel' and praises 'mastery' - clearly positive language. However, only one excerpt available makes full assessment difficult, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as a 'marvel' and highlights the playwright's 'mastery,' indicating strong enthusiasm. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"marvel\" and \"mastery,\" indicating a positive review. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it on the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the play's craft using words like 'marvel' and 'mastery,' indicating a clear recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
