    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise for the revival capturing the special qualities of acclaimed source material. However, limited to one curated quote requires low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the revival for capturing the essence of Ayckbourn's work, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is clearly positive, using words like \"ingenious\" and \"special\" to describe the revival. Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise, calling the playwright 'ingenious' and stating the revival 'captures much of what makes these plays so special,' indicating a clear recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is low, but the language places it in the upper Positive range.",
