    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises both the source material ('Ayckbourn at his most ingenious') and this specific Broadway revival ('captures much of what makes these plays so special'). However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the revival for capturing the essence of Ayckbourn's work, indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, calling the plays \"ingenious\" and stating the revival captures what makes them \"so special.\" Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language warrants a score on the higher end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt provides clear praise for both the playwright's ingenuity and the revival's success in capturing what makes the plays special, warranting an upper-range Positive score per instructions for clearly positive isolated quotes.",
