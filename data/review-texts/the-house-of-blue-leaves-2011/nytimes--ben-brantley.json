  "bwwExcerpt": "As directed by David Cromer - and enacted by a talent-stuffed cast that includes Ben Stiller, Jennifer Jason Leigh and the remarkable Edie Falco - this production zooms in on every gritty grain of pain to be found in Guare's breakthrough work from 1966. Within the dimness, there is one luminous force. And that is Falco, whose varied, nuanced acting has long been familiar to television viewers in shows that include 'The Sopranos' and 'Nurse Jackie'...When the world is as dark as it is in this 'House,' your eyes naturally seek the light, whatever its source.",
