  "bwwExcerpt": "Sometimes the current hot director is not the best choice for a big Broadway revival with star names. David Cromer scored an Off-Broadway hit with a naturalistic staging of 'Our Town,' and though it had a short run, his Broadway production of 'Brighton Beach Memoirs' bravely forsook punching the punch lines to emphasize the strong family connection among Neil Simon's sad-funny Jeromes. The producers of the current revival of John Guare's 1971 'The House of Blue Leaves' must have taken a look at Cromer's résumé and figured he'd be perfect for this sad-funny portrait of shattered ambitions and celebrity worship. Unfortunately, director and play are not a perfect fit. Cromer's kitchen-sink approach doesn't work for Guare's zany dreamers, who are simultaneously nobodies and larger than life.",
