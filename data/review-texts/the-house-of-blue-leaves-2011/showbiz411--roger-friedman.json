  "bwwExcerpt": "No revival will ever be as good as something we saw the first time. I can remember clearly John Mahoney and Swoozie Kurtz as Artie and Bananas from 1986. They were revelatory. And yet, Ben Stiller has given Artie a new sense of desperation, Edie Falco has toned Bananas down to a human level, and Jennifer Jason Leigh brings new laughs to Bunny's weird world. John Guare's play gets more interesting under David Cromer's restrained direction.",
