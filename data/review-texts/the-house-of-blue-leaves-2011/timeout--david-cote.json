  "bwwExcerpt": "Those happy and sad masks are iconic for a reason: A director who wants to put a fresh spin on a familiar play need only fiddle with the comedy-tragedy equalizer knob. Such adjustments get you a Long Day’s Journey Into Night that taps undiscovered veins of goofiness, or a revival of The Man Who Came to Dinner that chronicles lives of quiet Midwestern desperation. John Guare’s 1971 classic, The House of Blue Leaves, isn’t so easy to flip. Guare’s black farce about nobodies dying to be somebodies tickles your funny bone before kicking you in the gut. So it’s only natural that David Cromer, whose gimlet-eyed earnestness led to revelatory stagings of Our Town and Brighton Beach Memoirs, should see how high he could pump the grim factor. The result is an overly dour production that gets Guare’s bitter ironies but none of his naughtiness or joy.",
