  "bwwExcerpt": "Sunday in the Park with George, which opens tonight in a bare-bones but beautiful-enough Broadway revival starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Annaleigh Ashford, is both a deconstruction and an example of that duality. A deconstruction because Lapine's book, among the brainiest ever written for a musical, works innumerable trenchant variations on the theme of sacrifice for art. The show is also a demonstration of that theme, because Sondheim's songs are so profound that they feel, even while unspooling in unbroken threads of human longing, as if they had left the realm of lived experience and entered a Keatsian plane of absolute truth-beauty far above our own. The lyrics constantly delight the ear while also dramatizing, in that very delight, the way art both exalts and erases. 'Rapturous' and 'capture us' are like the jaws of a trap snapping shut.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Bare-bones but beautiful...Sondheim’s songs are so profound that they feel as if they had left the realm of lived experience and entered a Keatsian plane of absolute truth-beauty...It’s hard to keep your eyes off Gyllenhaal. But the performance is not as effortless as it might be...He is unable in Act Two to escape the interiority of the writing of modern-day George, and so the drama, always tenuous by this point, leaches out. Or would, were it not for the compensating talents of Ashford.\"\n\nRead more"
