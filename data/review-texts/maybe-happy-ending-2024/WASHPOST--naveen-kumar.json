Shen in “Maybe Happy Ending.” (Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman) Review by Naveen Kumar November 12, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. EST NEW YORK — Art about artificial intelligence tends to warn us about the dangers of playing God and creating monsters. So there is an immediate element of surprise and delight to “Maybe Happy Ending,” a swoony and only-slightly-dystopian rom-com between robots. The musical by Will Aronson and Hue Park, like most science fiction, still reflects on human experience, but with an eye toward exploring our best impulses rather than our worst. It’s a darling gem of a show with a big heart and a captivating sideways sensibility. And in a Broadway assembly line churning with revivals and remakes, it’s a refreshing model of innovation.
