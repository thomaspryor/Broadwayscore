There they are expected to remain, alone in their small single rooms, until their batteries can no longer be recharged, at which point they presumably will be scrapped for parts.\n\nCriss plays a \"HelperBot 3\" named Oliver, who is fairly content with the routines that mark the passage of time. In a series of repetitive small scenes, we observe Oliver as the days, the weeks, the months, the years go by. He spends his time looking out the window, awaiting his mail delivery of jazz magazines and the occasional replacement part, and taking care of his plant, which he has named Hwaboon (who has his own cute little bio in the Playbill, as well as an Instagram account). Oliver has but one dream, that his former owner, James (Marcus Choi), will retrieve him and take him back home.\n\nRobo-life goes on unchanged, until one day there is a knock at the door. It is Claire (Ms. Shen), the more advanced HelperBot 5 from across the hall. She wonders if Oliver would help her to recharge her battery. Claire, a later bot model and subsequently more human-like than Oliver in her appearance and demeanor, has her own dream, which is to visit Jeju Island once again and observe the fireflies for which it is famous. Before you can say \"road trip,\" the pair is off on an adventure; she in search of fireflies, he in search of James.\n\nDez DuronPhoto by Matthew Murphy and Evan ZimmermanMaybe Happy Ending is a delicate work, one that could easily lose its way and veer from charming to cloying. That it doesn't is thanks to the performances, to Michael Arden's gentle-handed direction, and the occasional meandering into the offbeat, such as when Claire and Oliver wind up spending the night in a motel where the rooms generally rent by the hour. There also appears from time to time a jazz vocalist named Gil, played by NBC's \"The Voice\" finalist Dez Duron. His exact purpose in the show is a bit of a puzzle, but he sure can sing. Otherwise, with the exception of a couple of agreeable little waltzes, the rest of the songs that are tied to the storyline are rather nebulous.\n\nStill, this string of simple moments manages to sneak up on us and begins to add up to a delicate little love story, held together by a perfect scenic design made up of Dane Laffrey's appearing and disappearing sets and George Reeve's video projections. But more than this, Maybe Happy Ending can also be seen as a parable about planned obsolescence and disposable lives, say of the elderly, in a world that holds neither in great esteem. The show was a big hit in South Korea, where it originated; word-of-mouth and the wonders of social media may well do the trick here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n\n                                                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n                \n                \n                \n\n            \n             \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Share:",
