  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Michael Arden’s slick production... might feel like 2064 on the surface, but in its nostalgic, rechargeable heart, the show parties like it’s 1999... Shen and Criss are the ones who make it work. Shen especially is a delight to watch, with an open, emotive face full of quicksilver expressions and a tartness that can turn explosive when she needs it to.\"\n\nRead more",

This suggests a positive view, though the lack of full context makes the recommendation less emphatic. | Gemini: The review highlights positive aspects of the production and performances, suggesting it's worth seeing, but the limited text makes it difficult to gauge the overall enthusiasm.",
