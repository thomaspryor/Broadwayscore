However, scoring conservatively due to single excerpt warning and potential for cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt describes the musical as 'undeniably moving, well-made, adorable,' which suggests a positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses positive language like \"undeniably moving, well-made, adorable musical\" and notes the audience's emotional response, suggesting a positive recommendation, but the use of \"maybe\" and the single excerpt makes it a cautious positive.",
