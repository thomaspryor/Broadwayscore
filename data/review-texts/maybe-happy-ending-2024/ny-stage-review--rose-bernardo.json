  "fullText": "\"Retired robots in love\" doesn't sound like the sexiest sales pitch for a Broadway show. Maybe a sitcom. Perhaps a Pixar movie. But Will Aronson and Hue Park's Maybe Happy Ending—which just opened on Broadway after previous productions in Seoul and an American premiere at Atlanta's Alliance Theatre—is right at home in the cozy Belasco Theatre. It's a jewel of a musical, and a pure ray of sunshine on a dark winter day.\n\nThe aforementioned robots—Helperbots, as they're called in our near-future Seoul setting—are Oliver (Darren Criss, awash with charm) and Claire (Helen J Shen, in a spectacular Broadway debut). Once accustomed to serving and catering to a human's every need, they're now living out their remaining days in a Helperbot retirement home, essentially a technological trash heap.\n\nTheir meet-cute happens because Claire's charge is dangerously low, and she asks the antisocial Oliver, her neighbor, for a battery boost. Girl meets boy; girl and boy take a random road trip; girl and boy pose as a married couple in a low-rent motel, whereupon comedy ensues. Strip away the futuristic bells and whistles, and Maybe Happy Ending reveals itself to be a good old-fashioned love story.\n\nAronson and Park's score is a savvy mix of bubbly traditional musical-theater numbers and single-malt-smooth swing music. And it's all sung superbly—and simply. No exhausting, ear-popping riffs, just precise vocals that reflect each Helperbot's emotional shades.\n\nAt first glance, Dane Laffrey's scenic design might look simple, but it's truly a technical marvel, with sliding screens and shifting shadowboxes to emphasize Oliver's and Claire's isolated lives. Director Michael Arden, a Tony winner for the recent Parade revival, knows how to take an audience's breath away.\n\nMaybe the musical takes a few too many tries to reach its (maybe) happy ending. But this is a 100-minute future-set show about robots, bursting with genuine feeling. If you need something to lift you out of your post-election depression, Maybe Happy Ending is your emotional upper.",
