However, this is only a single excerpt, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'deeply silly and surprisingly moving,' which suggests a positive experience. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive sentiment, describing the musical as \"surprisingly moving\" and \"unexpectedly affecting theatre.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm placing the score towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the show's emotional impact and tonal balance, describing it as 'surprisingly moving' and 'unexpectedly affecting theatre.' Confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation, which may not capture the full review's nuance.",
