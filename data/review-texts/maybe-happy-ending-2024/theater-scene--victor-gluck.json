    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt uses strong positive language ('utterly beguiling'), but extremely limited text makes confidence low. Given this is curated and clearly positive, scored toward upper end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the musical as 'utterly beguiling,' indicating strong positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The phrase \"utterly beguiling\" suggests a very positive recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise with 'utterly beguiling,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, with only a single curated quote available, the score reflects upper-range Positive (80-84) per guidelines rather than a definitive Rave.",
