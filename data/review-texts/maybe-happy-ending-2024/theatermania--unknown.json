  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Maybe Happy Ending exudes an undeniable charm and warmth, which sets it apart from many other new Broadway musicals these days that go for bombast over emotion. Refreshingly original, this story about two robots who, for a brief moment, meet each other halfway, becomes a poignant celebration of finding connections in an ephemeral world.\"",

However, with only one excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the show's charm, warmth, and originality, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review highlights the show's charm and originality, calling it a \"poignant celebration.\" While positive, the single excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation language suggest a score in the middle of the positive range.",
