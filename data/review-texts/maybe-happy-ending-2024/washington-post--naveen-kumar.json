  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessDarren Criss and Helen J. Shen in “Maybe Happy Ending.” (Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman) Review by  Naveen KumarNovember 12, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. ESTNEW YORK — Art about artificial intelligence tends to warn us about the dangers of playing God and creating monsters. So there is an immediate element of surprise and delight to “Maybe Happy Ending,” a swoony and only-slightly-dystopian rom-com between robots.\n\nThe musical by Will Aronson and Hue Park, like most science fiction, still reflects on human experience, but with an eye toward exploring our best impulses rather than our worst. It’s a darling gem of a show with a big heart and a captivating sideways sensibility. And in a Broadway assembly line churning with revivals and remakes, it’s a refreshing model of innovation.",
