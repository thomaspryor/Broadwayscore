    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show positively as 'tender meditation' but lacks clear recommendation language or verdict. Given single excerpt warning and descriptive nature, scored at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive view of the musical as a 'tender meditation,' suggesting a thoughtful and engaging production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, and the score reflects a mildly positive sentiment. | Gemini: The single excerpt available describes the musical as a \"tender meditation,\" which suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic assessment. Given the limited information, a score on the lower end of the positive range is appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers mild praise describing the show as a 'tender meditation' on meaningful themes, suggesting appreciation for its emotional depth. With only a single curated excerpt available, confidence is low and the score reflects the lower end of the Positive range.",
