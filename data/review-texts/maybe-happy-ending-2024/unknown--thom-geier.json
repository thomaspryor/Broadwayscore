    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a unique and understated storytelling approach, which indicates a positive view. However, the lack of full context and the single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious approach with a low confidence score. | Gemini: The single excerpt is positive, calling the show a \"sui generis original.\" Given the lack of context and the warning about the excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive with medium confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt employs distinctly laudatory language ('sui generis original'), indicating a clear recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full review verdict.",
