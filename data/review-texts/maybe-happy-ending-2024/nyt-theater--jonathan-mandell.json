    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language with multiple compliments (original, charming, clever, touching), but confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides positive descriptors such as 'charmingly acted', 'cleverly staged', and 'touching', indicating a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed towards the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, describing the show as 'charming' and 'cleverly staged' with a 'touching take on love.' Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unreserved praise using enthusiastic adjectives ('charmingly,' 'cleverly,' 'touching') for the acting, staging, and thematic content, indicating a clear recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
