    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('beautiful, sincere') but single excerpt warning applies - this sounds like strong praise so scored in upper Positive range, though confidence is low due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive impression of the show, describing it as 'beautiful' and 'sincere'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single quote is positive, calling the show \"beautiful\" and \"sincere.\" Given the lack of context and the warning about cherry-picked quotes, I've scored it as positive with medium confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unambiguous positive descriptors ('beautiful,' 'sincere') indicating clear appreciation, though the limited single-excerpt context prevents higher confidence or Rave classification.",
