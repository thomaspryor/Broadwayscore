However, with only one curated excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the staging and design elements, culminating in a strong endorsement of the show's 'theatrical magic,' which suggests a highly positive view. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language used is indicative of a rave review. | Gemini: The review praises the staging and sets, and the final sentence indicates a positive recommendation, although the single excerpt makes it hard to be certain of the overall tone.",
