    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the musical as 'quirky/charming', which suggests a positive tone. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, the confidence is low, and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as \"quirky/charming\", which is a positive sentiment, but the limited text makes it difficult to assess the overall strength of the recommendation. I am scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: Single brief excerpt describes the show as 'quirky/charming', indicating mild approval, though the limited context necessitates low confidence.",
