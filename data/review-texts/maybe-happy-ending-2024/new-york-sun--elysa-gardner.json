That was my predicament, at least, after catching a preview of “Maybe Happy Ending,” the most original and enchanting new musical to arrive on Broadway in years.\n\nCo-written by Broadway newbies Hue Park and Will Aronson, with music by Mr. Aronson, “Ending” had its premiere in Mr. Park’s native South Korea; the English-language version, introduced at Atlanta’s Alliance Theatre in 2020, is also set in that country, in “the near future” — circa 2064, according to the script. There, we meet Oliver and Claire, who live in separate rooms in a housing complex for obsolete robots.\n\nThese “Helperbots,” who have been discarded by their owners, both look entirely human, though Oliver is an older model. Brought to life in an adorable, heartbreaking performance by an increasingly impressive stage and screen actor, Darren Criss, Oliver betrays his vintage through jerky movements and a comical tendency to repeat certain phrases. Yet as he notes when they meet, Claire’s series, while “sleeker,” is “less durable” — a point that will come back to haunt them both, not to mention the audience.\n\nNaturally, Claire and Oliver fall for each other, but the result is much more than a romantic musical comedy with a mechanical hero and heroine. “Ending” is a one-act meditation on love, loss, mortality, and moral responsibility for the digital age — that is, now and the foreseeable future — delivered with a mix of sharp humor, poignance, and sheer imagination that’s nothing short of breathtaking.\n\nDirector Michael Arden, following a string of triumphant revivals that include last year’s “Parade” and 2017’s “Once on This Island,” has recruited a cast and design team who make the most of these assets. As Claire, Helen J Shen makes a thoroughly charming Broadway debut, combining a sweetly girlish voice with a sly, dry wit that poses a winning contrast to Oliver’s earnestness.\n\nAnother disarming newcomer, Dez Duron, pops up periodically as an old-time crooner named Gil Brentley, who embellishes Claire and Oliver’s budding romance with traditional pop-flavored tunes. Elsewhere, Mr. Aronson has crafted theatrically savvy, instantly engaging melodies that are enhanced by the sparkling piquance of his and Mr. Park’s lyrics.\n\nOliver’s fondness for Gil’s tunes in particular stems from the close relationship he enjoyed with his former owner, James — played by a touching Marcus Choi, in flashbacks that unfold both onstage and in black-and-white videos — who was a big jazz fan. A deceptively cheerful opening number establishes both Oliver’s loneliness and his utter confidence that he and James will be reunited; it’s a belief that he clings to well into the show.\n\nSpoiler alert: When James’s illusions are shattered, it’s in a way that evokes ethical dilemmas posed by rapidly evolving technology while underscoring how humans have betrayed and wounded each other throughout time, even with the best of intentions. Claire’s history, as it is revealed, raises similar questions, while delving into more sinister territory.\n\nThe video segments that help flesh out the robots’ pasts are designed by George Reeve, with assistance from scenic designer Dane Laffrey, who has fashioned a bewitching set of moving parts. Claire’s and Oliver’s rooms consist of sliding boxes, which are accompanied by panels that also shift with the action, providing a range of close-up and expansive views that give the production an almost cinematic quality.\n\nBen Stanton’s lighting adds to the magic. When Oliver and Claire embark on a road trip, she takes him to a field full of butterflies, and they chase the tiny creatures as they twinkle in the night. Oliver compares them to robots; when they fly off, he tells Claire, “They’re just going home to charge.”\n\nIf the scene is one of many that will put a lump in your throat, “Ending” can be as hilarious as it is heartrending. At one point, Claire’s failing battery forces the robots to check into a motel. The clerk asks Oliver, politely, “Will you be charging this?” His response is one of shocked indignance: “Excuse me, sir. ‘This’ is my wife.”\n\nBy the end of the show, the robots have confronted the harrowing prospects that inevitably face even the happiest of human couples. “How can people do this?” Oliver asks Claire, referring, of course, to falling in love, and then losing the person they cherish, in one way or another. As “Maybe Happy Ending” reminds us, radiantly, most of us are fortunate enough to have no choice.\n\nMs. Gardner has written about theater and music for The New York Times, The Village Voice, Town and Country, Time Out New York, Entertainment Weekly and other publications.

When Oliver fully realizes that Claire’s “shelf life” will end before his, he asks in real pain, “How can people do this?” — meaning survive the death of others. If the start of love is the start of loss, is it perhaps better to erase one’s memories (which these Helperbots can do because they have their own passwords) or even to avoid the journey altogether? A good question for robots and, as posed by this astonishing musical, maybe the most deeply human one of all.\" }, { \"@type\":\"BlogPosting\", \"headline\":\"TimeOut - Review Maybe Happy Ending\", \"datePublished\":\"2025-01-10T02:21:50-05:00\", \"articleBody\": \"Can a show as strange and special as Maybe Happy Ending find a place for itself on Broadway today? I like to think that maybe it can. But as the show reminds us, everything is ephemeral: “We have a shelf life, you know that,” says Claire. “It’s the way that it has to be.” The fact that this show is casting its firefly glow on Broadway at all feels like a gift.

Meanwhile, the show around him is grasping at many bubbling themes and carrying only a select few over the finish line.

There’s nothing robotic about this production: it wears its heart on its sleeve and on charm alone, succeeds. \" }, { \"@type\":\"BlogPosting\", \"headline\":\"Variety - ‘Maybe Happy Ending’ Review: Broadway’s Deeply Moving Robot Musical, Starring Darren Criss, Teaches Us How to Be Human\", \"datePublished\":\"2025-01-10T02:21:50-05:00\", \"articleBody\": \"“Maybe Happy Ending” is an undeniably moving, well-made, adorable musical, and it is a pleasant surprise to see an audience weep at a show about two robots in love. The musical makes the bold claim that maybe we are not that different from robots after all, or that they are not that different from us. Just as robots have much to learn from humans, we in turn can learn from them, especially how to care for each other and for ourselves. It’s crucial to know when you need to charge your battery, but likewise it’s important to be willing to share that charger with someone in need. \" }, { \"@type\":\"BlogPosting\", \"headline\":\"Deadline - ‘Maybe Happy Ending’ Broadway Review: Darren Criss And Helen J Shen Delight As Lovestruck Androids Dreaming Of Electric Cheek\", \"datePublished\":\"2025-01-10T02:21:50-05:00\", \"articleBody\": \"After the amazing firefly scene, and even more spectacularly, a scene in which our lovers’ inner circuits reveals themselves in a heart-stopping, full-stage display of light and sound that explodes from the set’s early, more constricted (if still lovely) aperture approach, Maybe Happy Ending could happily end, and if Arden and his team can’t quite restrain themselves from stretching things a bit, well, it’s hard to blame them: There still a delight or two, not to mention a lump in the throat, that demand to be experienced.
