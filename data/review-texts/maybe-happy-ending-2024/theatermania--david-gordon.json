  "fullText": "Maybe Happy Ending exudes an undeniable charm and warmth, which sets it apart from many other new Broadway musicals these days that go for bombast over emotion. Refreshingly original, this story about two robots who, for a brief moment, meet each other halfway, becomes a poignant celebration of finding connections in an ephemeral world.",

  "dtliExcerpt": "A sweet romcom by Hue Park and Will Aronson opens on Broadway.\n\nWhen a theater reviewer uses the word \"sweet\" or any of its synonyms, it's most often in a derogatory way. The book is\n\nWritten by Hue Park (book and lyrics) and Will Aronson (book, lyrics, and music),\n\nAfter 12 years, Oliver's quiet life is interrupted by a knock on the door from his across-the-hall neighbor Claire (Helen J Shen).

Shen is effortlessly charming, infusing Claire with a shy humor that makes her utterly lovable.

Dane Laffrey's gliding set pieces evoke the sleek but rundown atmosphere of Oliver and Claire's world, but they're so noisy you can always tell when they're coming. Ben Stanton's lighting adds a\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.
