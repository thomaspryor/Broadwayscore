    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising cast and chemistry suggests positive recommendation, but extremely limited text and potential cherry-picking warrants low confidence and conservative positive score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides positive feedback on the cast and chemistry, suggesting a positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the cast and their chemistry, indicating a positive review. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am placing the score on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers strong praise ('remarkable', 'penetrating') for the cast performances and character chemistry, indicating a clear positive recommendation. However, as a lone curated quote, it may not represent the full review verdict, warranting low confidence.",
