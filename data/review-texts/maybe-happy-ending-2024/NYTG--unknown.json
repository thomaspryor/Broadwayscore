Shen shine in a robotic romance &#x27;Maybe Happy Ending&#x27; review — Darren Criss, Helen J. Shen shine in a robotic romance Read our review of Maybe Happy Ending on Broadway, an original new musical starring Darren Criss and Helen J. Shen, now playing at the Belasco Theatre. Joe Dziemianowicz November 12, 2024, 05:00 Who could have imagined that a musical depicting romantic sparks between two robots would emerge as an emotional highlight of this Broadway season? But a Kleenex-worthy payoff is just one of the delights of the artfully crafted Maybe Happy Ending , an exceptionally well-oiled and visually sublime production. The story is set outside Seoul, Korea, in the near future. An endearing Darren Criss stars as Oliver, an obsolete, anthropomorphic “HelperBot” relegated to a machine scrapyard. He naively expects to reunite with his ex-employer. Broadway newcomer Helen J. Shen shines as Claire, a decommissioned later-model bot with a dying battery. The two meet when she knocks on his door to borrow his charger. In rom-com fashion, they click. She joins him on a trip to reunite with his former owner, James (Marcus Choi), which leads to insights about the nature of life, memory, and love. The story could short-circuit at any moment by turning too syrupy, but creators Will Aronson and Hue Park deftly sidestep that potential trap. The duo’s book is streaked with dark realities that shade the story. Their songs are consistently catchy, whether it’s the seemingly simple “World Within My Room,” Oliver’s ode to life as he knows it, or the stirring title track. The gently calibrated score fits the characters. Director Michael Arden’s gorgeous staging makes the most of Dane Laffrey’s multilevel sets behind sliding panels and George Reeve’s floor-to-ceiling videos. As Oliver and Claire fall, it’s easy to do the same for the show. No maybe about it — Maybe Happy Ending has theatrical magic. Maybe Happy Ending summary Humanoid robots have been around for ages, whether it’s Rosey from The Jetsons , C-3PO from Star Wars , or the synths of Humans . Maybe Happy Ending couples robots with the classic trope of boy-meets-girl. The result is a tender and bittersweet look at life and love, in which Claire and Oliver escape the scrapyard and go on an adventure that takes many unexpected turns. The musical has previously had productions in Seoul and Atlanta, and it now makes its Broadway debut at the Belasco Theatre . What to expect at Maybe Happy Ending The show’s opening image reveals James in his home, where the vibe is sleek mid-century modern, right down to a vintage record player. Records – in every sense of the word – are essential to the narrative. In a clever conceit, a jazzy crooner named Gil Brentley ( Dez Duron ), whom James and, by extension, Oliver, loved, materializes occasionally as a bridge to the past. In yet another, Oliver’s memory bank, a different sort of record, is key to a touching twist involving James’s son and his own future. While it’s relatively early in the Broadway season, it’s a safe bet that one of its most romantic moments will be from Oliver and Claire&#x27;s journey. It&#x27;s lit by fireflies and underscored by strings made for swooning. You will. What audiences are saying about Maybe Happy Ending Maybe Happy Ending has an audience approval rating of 91% on the review aggregator Show-Score. “A fun, unique new musical.
