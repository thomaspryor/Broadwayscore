It examines what it means to be human, what makes us human, and what it is that separates us from robots — but instead of doing this from a human angle, it takes the robot perspective. The musical by Will Aronson and Hue Park is set in a near-future Seoul, and concerns Oliver ( Darren Criss of \"Glee\" and \"The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\") and Claire ( Helen J Shen in her Broadway debut), two human-like robot \"HelperBots\" who have now been \"retired.\" Just like an old iPhone, they are doomed to planned obsolescence, abandoned by former owners and left to toil in the \"HelperBot Yards,\" a sort of robot purgatory. They meet when Claire has to borrow a charger (her cable is faulty and her battery life is shrinking; sound familiar?) and they form an unexpected bond. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-variety-article-mid-article-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\",\"mid-article\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[300,250],[2,2],[300,251],[2,4],[4,2],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Related Stories &#039;Euphoria&#039; Season 3 Trailer: Zendaya, Sydney Sweeney and Jacob Elordi Return as Rue Battles Drug Dealers, Cassie Becomes a Cam Girl and More",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Both Criss and Shen give excellent, very different performances... One of the achievements of the production is the very complete world that director Michael Arden has created. The sleek, futuristic set (by Dane Laffrey) draws on Korean design, provides a clear sense of time and place... “Maybe Happy Ending” is an undeniably moving, well-made, adorable musical, and it is a pleasant surprise to see an audience weep at a show about two robots in love.\"",
