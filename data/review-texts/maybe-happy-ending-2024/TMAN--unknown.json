  "fullText": "A sweet romcom by Hue Park and Will Aronson opens on Broadway.\n\nWhen a theater reviewer uses the word \"sweet\" or any of its synonyms, it's most often in a derogatory way. The book is\n\nWritten by Hue Park (book and lyrics) and Will Aronson (book, lyrics, and music),\n\nAfter 12 years, Oliver's quiet life is interrupted by a knock on the door from his across-the-hall neighbor Claire (Helen J Shen).

Dane Laffrey's gliding set pieces evoke the sleek but rundown atmosphere of Oliver and Claire's world, but they're so noisy you can always tell when they're coming.
