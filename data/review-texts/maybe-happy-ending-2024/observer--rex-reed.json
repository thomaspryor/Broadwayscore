  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"I can only tell you how impossible it is to relate the freshness, the joy and the quality that elevate every aspect of this extraordinary work of theatre artistry. While the rapturous music and lyrics by the team of Will Aronson and Hue Park break your heart, the dazzling direction by Michael Arden reaches levels of perfection in staging and the technical marvels in the settings by Dane Laffrey leave you slack-jawed with awe. There is nothing familiar, no “seen it before” feeling to the action sequences that unfold... I love this show and cannot wait to see it again—and often.\"\n\nRead more",

The critic expresses a strong desire to see it again, indicating a rave review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses extremely positive language such as \"extraordinary work of theatre artistry\", \"reaches levels of perfection\", and \"leave you slack-jawed with awe\", indicating a rave review. The critic also states they \"love this show and cannot wait to see it again—and often.\" | Kimi: Despite being a single excerpt, the text contains unqualified superlatives ('extraordinary work,' 'levels of perfection,' 'slack-jawed with awe') and an explicit declaration of love, indicating an enthusiastic rave.",
