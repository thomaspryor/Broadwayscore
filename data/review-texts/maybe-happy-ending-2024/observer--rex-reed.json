While the rapturous music and lyrics by the team of Will Aronson and Hue Park break your heart, the dazzling direction by Michael Arden reaches levels of perfection in staging and the technical marvels in the settings by Dane Laffrey leave you slack-jawed with awe. There is nothing familiar, no “seen it before” feeling to the action sequences that unfold... I love this show and cannot wait to see it again—and often.\"\n\nRead more",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides unqualified praise with superlatives such as 'extraordinary work of theatre artistry' and 'levels of perfection'. The critic expresses a strong desire to see the show multiple times, indicating a rave review. | Gemini: The review uses extremely positive language such as \"extraordinary work of theatre artistry\", \"dazzling direction\", and \"reaches levels of perfection\". The critic also states that they \"love this show and cannot wait to see it again—and often.\" | Kimi: Despite being a single excerpt, the critic uses unambiguous superlatives ('extraordinary,' 'levels of perfection,' 'slack-jawed with awe') and explicitly declares love for the show, indicating a full-throated recommendation.",
