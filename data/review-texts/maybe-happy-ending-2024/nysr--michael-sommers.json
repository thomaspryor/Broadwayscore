  "fullText": "★★★★☆ A darling and delightful new Broadway musical that opened at the Belasco Theatre, Maybe Happy Ending takes viewers several decades into the near future to introduce the notion of \"Helperbots.\" These domestic robots can be found in practically every home as loyal mechanical servants to the humans they resemble so closely.\n\nOliver and Claire happen to be Helperbots of different generations – Oliver is a model three and Claire is a more advanced model five – but already they have been deemed obsolete when Maybe Happy Ending begins. Strangers to each other, they reside as neighbors in a retirement community for outmoded robots outside of Seoul, Korea.\n\nAs their initially snarky friendship evolves, it becomes apparent that Claire is a more developed entity than the ever-boyish Oliver. Claire also is far more aware than Oliver of the significance that certain functions in their systems are wearing out – and the manufacturer no longer is making replacement parts. This intimation of mortality is introduced early into the 90-minute musical, which begins lightly and humorously and gradually deepens into a bittersweet romance.\n\nEventually the two head off together on a journey to Jeju Island, where Oliver fondly expects to be reunited with his former owner James. Their trip proves to be disillusioning for Oliver, but not before he and Claire experience the summer wonder of clouds of fireflies illuminating the night skies. The fireflies symbolize the fleeting nature of life and love that the musical illuminates.\n\nOriginally produced in Korea in 2016 and then by Alliance Theatre in Atlanta in 2020, the musical is deftly crafted by Hue Park and Will Aronson. Although the genuinely sweet nature of their work teeters a few times on the edge of going twee, the quick, crisp script, the neat, sensible lyrics, and the glistening music yield considerable pleasure.\n\nSwiftly directed by Michael Arden with great taste and smarts, the show employs ever-modulating moving portals to frame the action. Dane Laffrey's excellent, understated scenic design is complemented by George Reeve's impressive video design.\n\nThe performances of Darren Criss as the chipper Oliver and Helen J Shen as the clear-eyed Claire are not so utterly adorable as to be cloying, but they are pretty adorable anyway. Making an auspicious Broadway debut, Shen gives her sensible Claire a warm voice and presence.\n\nMaybe Happy Ending is surely the balm for any who find recent Broadway musicals too loud, since its sometimes jazz-inflected score is orchestrated gently for mostly strings, keyboard and woodwinds with exceptional grace.",
  "bwwExcerpt": "Lately there’s been audience complaint – if chat boards can be believed – how some recent Broadway musicals blast out hellishly loud, banging music. Maybe Happy Ending is surely the balm for any such feelings, since its sometimes jazz-inflected score is orchestrated gently for mostly strings, keyboard and woodwinds with exceptional grace by the composer.
