    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. The phrase 'more nostalgic than dramatically compelling' suggests the show has appeal but lacks theatrical substance. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 suggests a mixed review, and the key quote indicates that while the play is a 'loving tribute,' it lacks dramatic compulsion, aligning with a mixed assessment. | Gemini: The review describes the play as a \"loving tribute\" but ultimately finds it \"more nostalgic than dramatically compelling,\" indicating a mixed assessment. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The review acknowledges the play as a 'loving tribute' but explicitly finds it 'more nostalgic than dramatically compelling,' indicating a lukewarm, middle-ground assessment consistent with the 60 rating.",
