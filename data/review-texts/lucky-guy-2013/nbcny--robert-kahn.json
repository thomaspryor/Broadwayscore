  "bwwExcerpt": "The biggest challenge faced by 'Lucky Guy' might be the conundrum of its title. Ephron originally called her script 'Stories About McAlary,' and McAlary's widow was reportedly apprehensive of the change, at least before sitting in on a rehearsal. McAlary's time was brief, but it seems as if it was filled with the love, camaraderie and success many spend lifetimes twice as long trying to achieve. All things considered, you could say he was pretty lucky.",
