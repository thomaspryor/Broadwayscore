  "bwwExcerpt": "With an insider's devastating combination of repulsion and affection, [Ephron]'s written a most unlikely thing: a play about journalism, or really about telling stories, that is as rich and rough and elegiac and fun as the lost world it re-creates...Ephron was damned lucky; few writers write their best work last and manage to go out with a bang. She was lucky, too, in having eventually convinced Tom Hanks, who had been reluctant, to star as McAlary...And while it's no little compliment to his performance to say it is as good as that of his castmates, who are excellent from top to bottom, the triumph belongs to Ephron and Wolfe, who are almost one entity here. In shaping the final working script, Wolfe had access to Ephron's drafts and notes, and did no more or less than what Ephron, as engaged an author as ever there was, would clearly have approved.",

However, the use of 'flawed hero' and 'world gone wrong' suggests some complexity and reservations, leading to a solid but not unqualified positive score. | Gemini: The review describes the play as a \"valentine\" and \"surprisingly moving,\" indicating a positive, though not ecstatic, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as a 'valentine' and 'surprisingly moving,' indicating clear appreciation and recommendation, though the brevity of this excerpt suggests it is pulled from a longer review.",
