  "bwwExcerpt": "'Lucky Guy,' which opened Monday night at the Broadhurst Theatre, is Tom Hanks' rookie Broadway appearance, but the film star makes acting on stage look easy. Effortlessly transferring his low-key charisma to the theater, Hanks is quick, funny and surprisingly tough as columnist Mike McAlary and, at the end, makes the character much more touching than you'd think possible.",
