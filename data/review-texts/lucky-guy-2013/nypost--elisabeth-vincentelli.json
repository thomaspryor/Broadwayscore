  "bwwExcerpt": "Nora Ephron's 'Lucky Guy' is a eulogy. A really fun, really entertaining eulogy. You may have heard that Tom Hanks, making his Broadway debut, is the star of the show - and he is, his Everyman-relatable charm coming through as strongly onstage as it does on- screen. But Ephron's real focus isn't a man but the end of hardboiled New York journalism.",
