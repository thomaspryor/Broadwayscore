  "bwwExcerpt": "But this vibrantly acted production, directed by George C. Wolfe with his signature urban zip, does its best to mitigate the dramatic deficiencies by keeping the wider scene pulsating even when the protagonist's journey grows fuzzy or loses steam. The projections animating David Rockwell's kinetic sets only accelerate the staging's step.",
