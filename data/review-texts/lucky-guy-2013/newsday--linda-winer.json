  "bwwExcerpt": "Wolfe and a laser-eyed creative team take control of our gaze with the rhythm and allure of a noir movie. David Rockwell's brilliantly inventive, sleek black-and-white sets make headline projections and sliding furniture look new again. Desks are seldom out of sight for these workaholics, even when they're at the bars. In 'Imaginary Friends,' Ephron's grossly underrated 2002 Broadway play about Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy, Hellman says, 'We're all just stories. The question is, who gets to tell them.' How lucky, if that's not too paradoxical a word, that Ephron got to tell this one.",
