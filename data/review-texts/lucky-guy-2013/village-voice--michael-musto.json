  "bwwExcerpt": "Hanks is terrific at capturing the writer's gumption, drive, and vulnerability...But this is truly an ensemble piece, and the whole company--as directed by George C. Wolfe--is strong...As the evening's sketchy feeling becomes its defining feature, it's clear that this is more of a character evocation than a strict narrative. It's a play about atmosphere--the booze-and-smoke-filled arena where headlines are born, chances are taken, and, most of all, stories are told. In the uneven but boisterously affecting result, McAlary's pure love of journalism--like Ephron's--shines through like a cigarette in the dark.",
