  "bwwExcerpt": "We may have reached the saturation point with stage adaptations of popular movies but I have to admit, 'Tootsie' is quite a hoot. On the surface, it's a conventional musical with a conventional narrative arc and fairly conventional songs. But it's unconventionally funny. And thanks to an A-list cast of comedians, it's the comedy that makes this one sing!",
