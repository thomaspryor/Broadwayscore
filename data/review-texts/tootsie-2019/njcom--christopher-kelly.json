  "bwwExcerpt": "All of this is directed with great spirit and charm by Scott Ellis, and it's held together by the extraordinary Fontina. More than just a marvelous physical feat - he changes personas and clothes with quicksilver grace - the performance never soft pedals Michael's steamroller ambition, even as Fontana makes us feel the character's desperation and frustration. Which is to say: You root for Michael even if he's sometimes an immense jerk.",
