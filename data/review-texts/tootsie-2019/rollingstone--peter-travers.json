  "bwwExcerpt": "Let's hear it for Tootsie, the laugh-out-loud funniest musical of the Broadway season. Yes, it's another tune-filled spin on a hit movie - Pretty Woman, King Kong, the list goes on. But this one is actually good - hell, better than good, it's musical-comedy heaven. Using the beloved 1982 movie with Dustin Hoffman as a launching pad, the singing-dancing Tootsie still features an unemployed asshole of an actor who has to dress up as a woman to land a part. But the film's casual sexism (it celebrates a dude who finds himself) has been updated for the #MeToo era, going from retro to woke and slamming the door on patrimony with a mighty Times Up.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The laugh-out-loud funniest musical of the Broadway season. Yes, it’s another tune-filled spin on a hit movie...But this one is actually good...Musical-comedy heaven...Leading a dynamite cast is Fontana in a give-him-the-Tony-now tour de force...Ellis stages this circus like a ringmaster supreme. The infectious score is by Yazbek...The uproarious book ups the fun quotient of the movie by creating an avalanche of one-liners that leave you laughing uncontrollably.”\n\nRead more"
