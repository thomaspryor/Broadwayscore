  "bwwExcerpt": "You'll have just enough time during the false-start opening moments of director Scott Ellis' wonderful new Tootsie to ponder such things, and then the musical and its star Santino Fontana grab hold and don't let go. It's not without a few runs in its stockings, but this Tootsie is a delight, a not-quite-blind date that plays out so much better than you could have imagined.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“This ‘Tootsie’ is a delight, a not-quite-blind date that plays out so much better than you could have imagined...You’ll witness a team at the top of its game...Yazbek’s score is maybe a bit too heavy on the mid-tempo numbers...Best of all is Horn’s dialogue, loaded with sitcom zingers...There’s not a weak link in this cast, though the whole thing belongs to Fontana.” \n\nRead more"
