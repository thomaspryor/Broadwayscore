  "showScoreExcerpt": "“One of the better adaptations of movies in recent memory. Credit must be given to Robert Horn for an intelligent, bright and imaginative book. It is fresh and to its credit veers slightly from the movie to enable it to have a different slant...The book is abetted by a bouncy score...Upbeat standard Broadway fare. The cast, although not dynamic, is effective...Ellis has taken a familiar story and presented it in new terms as a musical that is worth visiting and enjoying.”\n\nRead more",
