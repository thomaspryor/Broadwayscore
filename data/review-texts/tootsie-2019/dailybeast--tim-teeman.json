  "bwwExcerpt": "Tootsie as a musical is a confusing mélange, and not for the sexual and romantic attractions and farce-heavy confusions it sets in motion by lead character Michael Dorsey's (Santino Fontana) cross-dressing. The Broadway version of the 1982 movie-which starred Dustin Hoffman as Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels-is both chaotic and apologetic, with a sharper and better book than it has music.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The Broadway version of the 1982 movie is both chaotic and apologetic, with a sharper and better book than it has music. The show has speeches grafted into it about gender inequality and feminist respect that stand out like absurd sore thumbs.. The book...is witty and sharp...If the words are mostly on point, the music, design, and choreography of ‘Tootsie’ rarely rise above meh...This ‘Tootsie’ is slightly lost in its own cloud of sequins and cultural intent.”\n\nRead more",
