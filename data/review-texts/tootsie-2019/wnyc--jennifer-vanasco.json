  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'Tootsie' is that rare musical that's actually funny. REALLY funny...What's not to love? Well, for starters, the plot...Horn tries to make all this gender nonsense okay. At the end, Michael babbles some pablum about how he learned that women have it tough, but we actually never see him experiencing that toughness. We only see his life getting easier...The ballads are droopy, the choreography is particularly uninspired. For the most part, however, it's a solid musical and it's funny.\"\n\nRead more",
