  "bwwExcerpt": "The songs are peppy, if not especially remarkable, somewhat in the vein of Yazbek's earlier shows like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. There's nothing as swoony as Omar Sharif here. But Yazbek shows his gift for writing for character, with Sandy's high-anxiety What's Gonna Happen and Jeff's dry, cackling Jeff Sums It Up. A lot of Horn's jokes are groaners, but some of them aren't and the script is packed with so many that the laughs-per-minute ratio stays pretty high. The cast is a treat, particularly the supporting actors, whose characters are written more playfully and at times more cogently than Michael or Julie, though Fontana is working overtime, backwards and forwards, in heels and out, to make Dorothy more than a caricature and Michael more than a jerk. He's even found a distinct singing voice for Dorothy, a fleecy contralto.",
