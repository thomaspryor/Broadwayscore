  "bwwExcerpt": "The new Broadway musical Tootsie is a story of transformation in which an actor becomes a better man after passing himself off as a woman. Based on a beloved 1982 movie starring Dustin Hoffman, the show by David Yazbek and Robert Horn unleashes more zippy one-liners and corny double entendres than anyone could ever want. But the film's sweeter charms and magic have gone missing in the metamorphosis from the screen to the stage of the Marquis Theatre.",
