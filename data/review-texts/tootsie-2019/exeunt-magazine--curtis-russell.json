  "showScoreExcerpt": "“’Tootsie’ makes sound business sense as an adaptation property...The film’s spine remains largely intact...As a case study of a dumb guy becoming slightly less dumb about what gals go through, the play works like gangbusters. This may not be the story many want to hear right now, but it’s the most fun I’ve had at the theater in months...The score feels more like pastiche than vintage Yazbek...Yazbek’s lyrics are witty...more than keeping pace with Horn’s book.”\n\nRead more",
