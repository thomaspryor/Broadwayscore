  "bwwExcerpt": "'Tootsie,' the new Broadway musical by David Yazbek (music and lyrics) and Robert Horn (book) that opened Tuesday at the Marquis Theatre, is a marvel of movie-to-musical reinvention. As much an update as it is an adaptation, the show acknowledges that gender politics have undergone significant changes in the last four decades while embracing what makes this loony tale still so much fun today. But what really stands out is the wit. This 'Tootsie' yields more laughs per minute than any musical since 'The Book of Mormon.' Yazbek and Horn are like Woody Allen in the early days, only campier and completely besotted with Broadway.",
