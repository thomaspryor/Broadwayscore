  "bwwExcerpt": "Happily, this thoroughly modern update is a genuine thrill, mostly thanks to Robert Horn's smart book, which excises a lot of the more cringe-y aspects on the original comedy, and instead invites audiences to laugh at Michael Dorsey. The show begins with Michael interrupting the opening number to complain about his character's motivation, for goodness sake! Packed with jokes, the show is completely ridiculous, but it totally works.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“This thoroughly modern update is a genuine thrill, mostly thanks to Horn's smart book...Central to all of this is...Fontana as Michael, who is absolutely crushing this juicy part...The whole cast gets their moment to shine...If there are weak spots, I would say that while the songs, by...Yazbek, are fine, none are memorable. The music is serviceable and the lyrics quippy, but you won't be humming tunes on your way out of the theater.”\n\nRead more"
