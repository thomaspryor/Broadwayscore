  "bwwExcerpt": "Comedy rarely flows as smoothly as it does here. The secret is more than the book; it's the songs. Mr. Yazbek is one of the few composer-lyricists working today who can set jokes to music and make them pay. The most obvious instance in 'Tootsie' is 'What's Gonna Happen,' a showstopping patter number for Michael's ex-girlfriend, the neurotic Sandy (Sarah Stiles). In a tumble of words reminiscent of 'Model Behavior' from Mr. Yazbek's underrated score for 'Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,' she goes well past that verge.",
