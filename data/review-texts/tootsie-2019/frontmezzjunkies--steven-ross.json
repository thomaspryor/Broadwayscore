  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"One of the funniest Broadway movie musicals around. It’s pretty much comedic gold...None of the more serious songs telling the emotional stories are obviously catchy or carry a hook that stays with you once you leave the theatre. That isn’t where the wiseness and fun of 'Tootsie' resides.
