  "bwwExcerpt": "Just when you thought the old-fashioned musical comedy was dead, along comes an adaptation of a 37-year-old movie about sexism in the entertainment industry to breathe new life into it. David Yazbek and Robert Horn's Tootsie has the big dance numbers, frothy score, rat-a-tat jokes, and, in Santino Fontana, the kind of star turn from a triple threat that made the American musical such a pop cultural force fifty years ago. Directed with Swiss watch precision by Scott Ellis, Tootsie is an unexpected, charming delight.",
