  "bwwExcerpt": "The good news is that book writer Robert Horn has not pulled a 'Pretty Woman' and simply transcribed a screenplay, in this case, the Oscar-nominated 1982 script by Larry Gelbart, Murray Schisgal and many uncredited writers. Equally good, Horn supplies a few one-liners that are every bit as funny as the movie's zingers.",
