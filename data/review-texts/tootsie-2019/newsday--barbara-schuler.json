  "bwwExcerpt": "Throughout, it's all great fun, from the sick one-liners and cringeworthy puns to enough inside theater references to put 'Something Rotten' to shame. (The opening night song 'The Most Important Night of My Life' will never top 'Another Op'nin', Another Show,' but it's still a delight). But as in the film, there are important take-aways, lessons Dorothy imparts to Michael about the trials women face. When he declares that 'being a woman is no job for a man,' you sense overwhelming agreement from the women in the audience. But you get the feeling the men are at least listening.",
