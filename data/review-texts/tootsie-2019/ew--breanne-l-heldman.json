  "bwwExcerpt": "All that said, the show is damn funny. The book, by Robert Horn, is jammed with laugh-out-loud one-liners, and Scott Ellis' direction allows those moments, and many others, to shine. The score, by Tony winner David Yazbek (The Band's Visit), and choreography by Denis Jones are light and lively. And William Ivey Long's costumes, including his recreation of Dustin Hoffman's iconic red sequined dress from the movie, are gorgeous, clever, and fresh.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The musical within the musical...really works, as many moments do throughout — but the cliché factor doesn’t exactly drop to zero...That said, the show is damn funny...The performances are worthy of raves...Ultimately, the show has the good-time vibe of a jukebox musical, trading long-loved hit tunes for clever zingers and humor. And it makes an honest effort to recognize and support the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements, despite the plot’s inherent misalignment with them.”\n\nRead more"
