  "bwwExcerpt": "All that said, the show is damn funny. The book, by Robert Horn, is jammed with laugh-out-loud one-liners, and Scott Ellis' direction allows those moments, and many others, to shine. The score, by Tony winner David Yazbek (The Band's Visit), and choreography by Denis Jones are light and lively. And William Ivey Long's costumes, including his recreation of Dustin Hoffman's iconic red sequined dress from the movie, are gorgeous, clever, and fresh.",
