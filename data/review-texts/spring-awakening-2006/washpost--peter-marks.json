However, this appears to be a brief excerpt, so confidence is medium due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language ('exceptional power and beauty') and indicates a successful contemporary relevance, suggesting a highly enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"exceptional power and beauty\" and praises the show's ability to feel contemporary, indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic deploys superlatives ('exceptional') and unqualified praise for the production's contemporary impact, indicating a must-see recommendation despite the brevity of the excerpt.",
