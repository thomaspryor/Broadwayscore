  "bwwExcerpt": "Theirs isn't an I-love-you-to-the-moon-and-back relationship. Theirs is: \"Mommy do you love me?\" \"When your eyes are closed.\" When things get too serious-when Lucy's doctor tells her she might need surgery-mom high-tails it back to LaGuardia. But Rona Munro's play-and Strout's book-is more about what's not said: what happens when our eyes are closed, what happens when we're thousands of miles (and worlds away) from our family.",
