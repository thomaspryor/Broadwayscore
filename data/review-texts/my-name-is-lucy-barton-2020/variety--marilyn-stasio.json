However, the text is very brief, so the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review praises Laura Linney's performance with strong positive adjectives like \"extraordinary intimacy and intelligence,\" indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strong superlatives ('extraordinary') to praise the lead performance, indicating an enthusiastic recommendation. Confidence is low due to the text being a brief excerpt under 150 words.",
