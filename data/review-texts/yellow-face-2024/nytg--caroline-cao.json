  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Kim duly performs a blend of egotistical confidence, comic cowardice, and conscientiousness in the role, and he bounces off an easygoing Ryan Eggold as Marcus, the 100% white guy whom DHH unintentionally grants an Asian American-intended role. Folded within the hilarity are critiques on a system that can enable this snafu.\""
