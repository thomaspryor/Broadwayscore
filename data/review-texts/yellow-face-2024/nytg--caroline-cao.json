  "fullText": "Read our review of Yellow Face on Broadway, an acclaimed comedy play written by David Henry Hwang and starring Lost and Hawaii Five-0's Daniel Dae Kim. How do we approach a “post-racial” theatrical landscape? That’s one question that circulates playwright David Henry Hwang’s Yellow Face on Broadway, directed by Leigh Silverman at the Todd Haimes Theatre. Through his onstage alter ego, DHH (Daniel Dae Kim), the playwright searches for answers about Chinese American identity and casting politics in an autobiographical(ish) play mixed with a thought experiment. Inspired by the controversy over a 1991 Miss Saigon casting the non-Asian Jonathan Pryce in an Asian role, Yellow Face toys with the thorniness of this issue through DHH, who finds himself in a racial casting scandal of his own. Kim duly performs a blend of egotistical confidence, comic cowardice, and conscientiousness in the role, and he bounces off an easygoing Ryan Eggold as Marcus, the 100% white guy whom DHH unintentionally grants an Asian American-intended role. Folded within the hilarity are critiques on a system that can enable this snafu. It’s a task to make Hwang’s genre-shifting — in a way I can’t spoil — play cohesive, but for the most part, Silverman tightens its layers on the gargantuan stage, working with subtle shifts in Arnulfo Maldonado’s set and Yee Eun Nam’s projection design. Two boxy set pieces provide location and historical context (projecting crucial real-life reviews and news articles) with documentary-like efficiency. Yellow Face pushes its conversation through its racially subversive, often cheeky casting choices in the ensemble. Notably, Shannon Tyo unleashes her own sting in the various players she inhabits (among those an outraged actor ranting about Miss Saigon and a parody of titanic theatre producer Cameron Mackintosh), and it’s impossible not to feel her injecting herself into the roles. Other casting choices, like a non-Asian Kevin Del Aguila playing the Asian actor B.D. Wong, the casting tests our notions of acceptability in theatrical practices. After winning a Tony Award for his play M. Butterfly in 1988, playwright David Henry Hwang (fictionalized as DHH in the play) protested the yellowface casting of Welsh actor Jonathan Pryce as a “Eurasian” pimp in Miss Saigon. Hwang subsequently penned his 1993 farcical play Face Value, which was a box office and critical failure on Broadway. These historical events are among the incidents that kick off Hwang’s Yellow Face, a hybrid of autobiography and mockumentary. DHH finds himself in a sticky situation when he accidentally casts an ethnically ambiguous, non-Asian white man, Marcus (Ryan Eggold), in an Asian leading role in Face Value. Matters get muddier when Marcus subsequently inhabits Asian theatrical roles and activism. Integrated into these events are Hwang’s conversations with his American Dream-loving father, HYH (a memorable Francis Jue), a banker who is eventually subjected to the Senate Banking Affairs Committee sinophobic investigations, which targeted several Asian Americans including Taiwanese American scientist Wen Ho Lee (also Jue). Yellow Face throws proverbial darts at a white-dominated theatrical institution. It establishes its provocations in an early tongue-in-cheek exchange — “Asian parts must only ever be played by Asian actors” — in which the non-Asian Kevin Del Aguila briefly plays the Asian B.D. Wong. Yellow Face evolved from its 2007 Off-Broadway premiere at The Public Theater, with the Broadway version casting actors of other races as well aside from white and Asian. Thus, the Broadway production blurs the notions of racial “authenticity” or “racial-subversive” casting, with each actor playing various spectrums of characters not aligned with their race. Yellow Face encourages its audience to gauge what are “unacceptable” and “acceptable” forms of racial performance in various artistic contexts. As of publication, Yellow Face received an 82% audience approval rating on the site Show-Score, compiled from 63 reviews. Read more audience reviews of Yellow Face on Show-Score. The semi-autobiographical Yellow Face might have stuffiness in its smart script, but Leigh Silverman’s Broadway staging unearths thoughtful questions about casting politics and Chinese American identity.
