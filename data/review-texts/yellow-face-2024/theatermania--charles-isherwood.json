  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Yellow Face is perhaps less a great work of theater than a great conversation starter. Nevertheless, it's good to have it back on a New York stage. At the very least, Hwang's play reminds us how much has changed but also how much remains the same, for all the strides that have been made in Asian representation in the theater world and elsewhere since 2007.\"",
