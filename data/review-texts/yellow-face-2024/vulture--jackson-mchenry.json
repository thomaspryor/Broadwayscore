  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Seventeen years is an eon in theater time, enough to make some plays feel as dated as fondue and Fawlty Towers, but David Henry Hwang's Yellow Face has aged well. Currently receiving its belated Broadway premiere in a swift, tangy production by Leigh Silverman  who also directed its first New York run in 2007  the play retains its bite in part because its essential subject, like that of many a good comedy, is human folly.\"",
