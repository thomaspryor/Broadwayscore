  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"With its minimalist sets by David Korins; era-appropriate costumes by Myung Hee Cho; and dreamy lighting (Donald Holder) and sound (Darron L. West) hinting at the time-hopping requirements of a memory play, Silverman's smoothly directed production is likely the final say on this long-in-coming play and a decades-old theater world brouhaha. David Henry Hwang and Yellow Face get the well-deserved last laughs.\""
