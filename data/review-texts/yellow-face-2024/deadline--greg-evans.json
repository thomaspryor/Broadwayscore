West) hinting at the time-hopping requirements of a memory play, Silverman's smoothly directed production is likely the final say on this long-in-coming play and a decades-old theater world brouhaha. David Henry Hwang and Yellow Face get the well-deserved last laughs.\"",

However, confidence is medium due to limited text from a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's direction and design, suggesting it is a definitive and well-received version of the play. The positive tone and the phrase 'well-deserved last laughs' indicate a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the direction, design elements, and suggests a definitive production. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the tone is clearly positive. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the 'smoothly directed' production as the 'final say' on the play and notes the playwright gets 'well-deserved last laughs,' indicating a clear recommendation despite limited available text.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "We can start by thanking Hwang’s terrific play – cut by a half-hour since its overlong Off Broadway version – and crackerjack direction by Leigh Silverman. Perhaps most of all, the production’s appeal rests with a cast led by an excellent Daniel Dae Kim, the Lost and Avatar: The Last Airbender star making a seamless transition to the Broadway stage.",
