  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"With its minimalist sets by David Korins; era-appropriate costumes by Myung Hee Cho; and dreamy lighting (Donald Holder) and sound (Darron L. West) hinting at the time-hopping requirements of a memory play, Silverman's smoothly directed production is likely the final say on this long-in-coming play and a decades-old theater world brouhaha. David Henry Hwang and Yellow Face get the well-deserved last laughs.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the production elements and direction, concluding that Hwang 'gets the well-deserved last laughs.' However, single excerpt limits full assessment of verdict strength. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's direction and design elements, suggesting it is a definitive and successful staging. The positive tone and the mention of 'well-deserved last laughs' imply a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the direction and suggests the production is definitive, indicating a positive assessment. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the direction and design, calling the production the 'final say' on the play and noting the creators earn 'well-deserved last laughs.' As a single curated excerpt, it suggests a positive verdict but warrants low confidence.",
