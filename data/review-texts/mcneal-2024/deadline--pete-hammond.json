However, it notes that the material doesn't always match the star's presence, suggesting some reservations. | Gemini: The review praises Downey Jr.'s performance but notes that the material isn't always up to par, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The critic delivers a qualified recommendation, praising Downey Jr.'s 'commanding' and 'magnetic' performance while noting the material falls short of the star's caliber. The 'thought-provoking' descriptor and emphasis on the lead's debut suggest it's worth seeing despite the script's limitations.",
