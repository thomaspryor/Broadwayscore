  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Downey, in his rumpled Important Novelist garb (costumes courtesy of Jennifer Moeller, on point as ever), is perfectly cast as Jacob McNeal, an old-school author  he's sexist, misogynist, drinks too much, wallows in self-pity when he isn't shouting his self-important ambitions, narcissistic, dreams of Shakespeare, lives like Mailer."
