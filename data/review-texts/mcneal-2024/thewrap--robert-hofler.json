Then this writer covers a subject that you know something about, and he or she gets it completely wrong.\n\nThat’s how I felt watching Ayad Akhtar’s new play “McNeal,” which had its world premiere Monday at LCT’s Vivian Beaumont Theater.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Bartlett Sher directs and he pushes each of these supporting players to overact to the extreme, while Downey Jr. delivers an oddly staccato performance. It’s as if he’s trying to distance himself from the character with his tick-filled delivery of the lines. However, as this 90-minute play progresses with its over-the-top performances from the supporting actors, Downey Jr. begins to emerge as the calm eye of the angry storm raging around his character. He wins our sympathy by default.",
