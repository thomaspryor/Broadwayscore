Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights the play's relevant themes and a \"commanding\" performance by Downey Jr., suggesting a strong positive impression. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the play's thematic content ('timely and timeless') and the lead's 'commanding performance,' indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited available text.",
