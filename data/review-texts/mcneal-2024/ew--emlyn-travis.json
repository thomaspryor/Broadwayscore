    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the lead performance as 'commanding' with 'viper-like precision.' However, this only evaluates one actor's performance, not the overall show, and appears cherry-picked from a longer review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the actor's performance, highlighting a 'commanding presence' and 'viper-like precision.' However, without more context, it's unclear if the overall production is similarly praised. Given the single excerpt warning, a lower positive score is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the actor's performance, indicating a positive aspect of the show. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation strength, so I'm scoring it as a positive with reservations. | Kimi: Single excerpt provides strong praise for the lead performance using vivid, enthusiastic language ('commanding presence,' 'viper-like precision'), suggesting a recommendation based on the star turn. However, limited to one curated quote focusing only on the actor, preventing higher confidence or Rave classification.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "McNeal might ask fascinating questions about a writer’s sense of integrity, the disconnect between generations of writers, and the limits of artificial intelligence within art, but the delivery is so garbled that it is difficult to ascertain what the play is actually trying to say about these complex issues… if anything at all.
