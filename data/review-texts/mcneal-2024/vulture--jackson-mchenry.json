    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The critic finds the play itself 'oddly mechanical' while praising Downey Jr.'s performance. This creates a mixed assessment - positive element (committed performance) balanced against negative critique (mechanical feel). | GPT-4o: The review describes the play as 'oddly mechanical,' suggesting a lack of engagement or effectiveness, despite praising Downey Jr.'s performance. This indicates a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a committed performance from Downey Jr., but ultimately finds the play itself \"oddly mechanical,\" suggesting a mixed or lukewarm reception. | Kimi: The critic finds the play 'mechanical' and uses 'despite' to signal that Downey's performance cannot save the flawed production, indicating a negative recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
