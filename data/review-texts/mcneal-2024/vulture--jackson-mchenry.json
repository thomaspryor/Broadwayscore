  "bwwExcerpt": "McNeal’s woozy ruminations about art and technology might strike with more force if the actual drama around them had more tensile strength. The human dynamics Akhtar and Sher hang all of this on never get past cliché: McNeal confronts a cadre of women, including Martin’s assistant (Saisha Talwar), a horrifyingly underprepared magazine journalist (Brittany Bellizeare), and a former New York Times books editor who is pretty obviously based on Pamela Paul (Melora Hardin). In his exchanges with them, they get to do little except absorb his rants about everything from the work of Annie Ernaux to Harvey Weinstein. If McNeal wants to tell us that a great artist — specifically a great man, in this case — is some unique force in the universe, it requires a more finely crafted rendering of that man. But on the opposite end, if the play wants to suggest AI could offer an alternative to that figure that’s equal in stature? Well, there’s an issue of rendering there, too.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The critic finds the play itself 'oddly mechanical' while praising Downey Jr.'s performance. This creates a mixed assessment - positive element (committed performance) balanced against negative critique (mechanical feel). | GPT-4o: The review describes the play as 'oddly mechanical,' suggesting a lack of engagement or effectiveness, despite praising Downey Jr.'s performance. This indicates a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a committed performance from Downey Jr., but ultimately finds the play itself \"oddly mechanical,\" suggesting a mixed or lukewarm reception. | Kimi: The critic finds the play 'mechanical' and uses 'despite' to signal that Downey's performance cannot save the flawed production, indicating a negative recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
