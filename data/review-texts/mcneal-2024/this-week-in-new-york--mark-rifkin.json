However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the script as 'lukewarm' and the drama as 'murky', suggesting a negative view of the production. However, the single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a negative assessment due to a \"lukewarm script\" and \"murky\" drama, suggesting the show is not recommended. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the script as 'lukewarm' and the drama as 'murky,' stating that the star performance is overshadowed by these weaknesses, indicating the critic does not recommend the production.",
