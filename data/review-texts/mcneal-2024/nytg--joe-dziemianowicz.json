  "fullText": "Read our review of McNeal on Broadway, a world-premiere play written by Ayad Akhtar and starring Robert Downey Jr., making his Broadway debut in the title role. In Ayad Akhtar’s crisply staged yet dramatically muddy play, McNeal, Oscar winner Robert Downey Jr. summons every ounce of his innate swagger and smugness as a misogynistic author who’s just found himself the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature. In his Broadway debut, Downey steps up; he’s sure-footed and magnetic. The play itself, less so. Jacob McNeal learns about being honored during a visit with his doctor (Ruthie Ann Miles). She’s essentially told her illustrious patient he’s boozing himself into the grave. A writer who drinks too much – groundbreaking. McNeal’s dance with death is presumably meant to raise the stakes, but instead it just lands as a background hum. What Akhtar, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer of Disgraced, is really chasing is McNeal’s relationship with authorial authenticity – and the role of artificial intelligence in that equation. The esteemed McNeal, we learn, has always cut corners and stolen both words and story ideas from others, including a powerful journalist (Melora Hardin) as well as his late wife. That latter grim bit of history is dredged up by his estranged son (Ravi Gavron). Now, McNeal has harnessed A.I. to churn out his new work by rewording texts of Shakespeare, Ibsen, Kafka, and others “in the style of Jacob McNeal.” Just like that, push-button brilliance. His agent (Andrea Martin) basks in his glories, while a New York Times profile writer (Brittany Bellizeare) finds herself a reluctant fan. McNeal, meanwhile, can’t stand himself. Akhtar’s intermissionless play zips by stylishly in director Bartlett Sher’s sleek staging, but what the play is trying to say about A.I. and its potential dangers ultimately eludes. The notion of A.I. being “helpful” repeats throughout. McNeal has stolen all his life, and now he has a new tool for literary larceny. To borrow another’s wise words, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Playwright Ayad Akhtar is a dramatist known for taking on hot topics including identity, race, and religion in Disgraced, and capitalism and greed in Junk. McNeal, a modern morality tale, centers around the thorny implications of using artificial intelligence, particularly in writing. Lincoln Center Theater's of McNeal at the Vivian Beaumont Theater is the play's world premiere. While you arrive at McNeal, the expansive stage of the Beaumont remains bare, but a supersized smartphone is seen towering at the center. Inanimate but, in a way, alive, an amorphous shape swirls on the screen like a cauldron. What mysteries are inside that device? Looming even larger than the plus-size cell phone is Downey, who almost never leaves the stage. The role of A.I.-obsessed Jacob McNeal was built for a star, and the actor breathes it to life with a mix of smarminess (think of adversarial Lewis Strauss from Oppenheimer, for which Downey won his Oscar) and self-absorption (think of Tony Stark in Iron Man). Projections by Jake Barton, who designed the sets with Michael Yeargan, are a key to the physical staging as the story goes from the doctor's office to Sweden to New York offices and apartments. A giant, A.I.-enhanced digital image of McNeal appears at some points, even more unnerving than when a gun emerges on stage and a figure perches perilously on a ledge. McNeal has an audience approval rating of 81% on the review aggregator Show-Score. Read more audience reviews of McNeal on Show-Score. Although the play falls short of leaving a deep impact, Robert Downey Jr.’s star turn and strong physical staging keep you on board for McNeal's fleet 90 minutes.

The final verdict acknowledges both strengths and shortcomings without a clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The review praises Robert Downey Jr.'s performance and the physical staging, but criticizes the play for being dramatically muddy and failing to leave a deep impact. This suggests a mixed review with notable strengths and weaknesses. | Gemini: The review praises Downey's performance and the staging, but finds the play itself dramatically muddy and falling short of a deep impact. This suggests a mixed experience, leaning slightly positive due to the star power. | Kimi: While the critic finds the play itself 'dramatically muddy' and criticizes its lack of lasting impact, the enthusiastic praise for Downey's 'sure-footed and magnetic' Broadway debut and the 'strong physical staging' constitute a qualified recommendation to see the show.",
