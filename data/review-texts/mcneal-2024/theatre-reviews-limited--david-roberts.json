    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the lead performance as 'authentic' and noting the actor 'devours' the challenging role. However, with only one curated quote available, this may not represent the full review sentiment, so scoring conservatively in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performance of an actor in the show, indicating a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of broader context, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performance as \"authentic\", suggesting a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance using enthusiastic language ('devours,' 'authentic'), indicating a positive reception, though the single curated excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
