    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt acknowledges the playwright makes 'important points' but provides no clear verdict on the production quality or recommendation. With only this fragment, the assessment leans neutral-to-positive but lacks context for a stronger classification. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the importance of the points made by Akhtar, suggesting a positive view of the show's thematic content. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of a full review, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt acknowledges some positive points but doesn't offer a clear recommendation, suggesting a mixed or neutral assessment. Given that it is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the play's intellectual content regarding art and AI, suggesting thematic merit but lacking strong production endorsement. Single excerpt availability warrants low confidence and lower-end Positive scoring. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Positive, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
