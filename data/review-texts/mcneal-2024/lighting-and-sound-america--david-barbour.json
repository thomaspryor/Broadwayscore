However, extremely limited text makes full verdict uncertain - could be mixed review with this as one criticism. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a negative view, highlighting issues with character believability and situations. However, with only a single excerpt, the confidence is low as it may not represent the full review. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is a negative statement about the characters and situations, indicating a lack of believability and thus a negative review. Confidence is low due to the limited text. | Kimi: The sole available excerpt identifies critical weaknesses in character credibility and plotting, indicating a negative assessment, though the truncated context and single-quote limitation warrant low confidence.",
