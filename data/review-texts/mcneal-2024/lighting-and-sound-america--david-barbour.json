    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Single negative excerpt criticizing fundamental story elements. Low confidence due to extremely limited text - this could be a minor criticism in an otherwise positive review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a significant flaw in the show, suggesting a negative view. However, with only one excerpt, the full verdict is unclear, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is negative, indicating the show suffers from unbelievable characters and situations. Given the limited context, a negative score is appropriate. | Kimi: The single available excerpt identifies significant flaws in character and plot believability using negative language ('suffers from'), indicating the critic does not recommend the show. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence must remain low.",
