    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | No bucket consensus - using median score | Claude: Clear mixed verdict - explicitly calls the play 'a mess' but praises it as 'fascinating character study' with strong lead performance. No clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The review describes the play as a 'mess', indicating a negative overall assessment, despite the praise for Downey Jr.'s performance. The negative tone about the play itself leads to a negative score. | Gemini: The review states the play is a mess, but highlights Downey Jr.'s performance as a benefit, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: Although the critic calls the play 'a mess,' they ultimately recommend it as a 'fascinating character study' driven by Downey Jr.'s committed Broadway debut, indicating the performance outweighs the script flaws. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
