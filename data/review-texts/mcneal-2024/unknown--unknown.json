    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic describes the protagonist as 'more a data set than a character,' which is a significant criticism of the writing/characterization. While acknowledging RDJ as 'formidable,' the core complaint suggests fundamental flaws in the show's central element. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, praising the actor's capability but criticizing the character's depth. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, so a mid-range Mixed score is appropriate. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a negative assessment, indicating the character is underdeveloped despite the actor's performance. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt praises Downey Jr. as 'formidable' but criticizes the title character as underdeveloped ('more a data set than a character'), suggesting uneven quality. Low confidence due to limited excerpt availability. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",
