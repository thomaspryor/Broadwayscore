    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic describes the play as 'unfocused and confused' which indicates a negative assessment, but with only one excerpt available the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, describing the play as 'unfocused and confused'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt states that the play \"seems unfocused and confused,\" indicating a negative assessment. Given that this is the only excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The sole available excerpt offers substantive criticism regarding the play's lack of focus and clarity, indicating the reviewer does not recommend the production. Score reflects the clearly negative tone of this isolated quote, though confidence is low given the possibility of cherry-picking in single-excerpt scenarios.",
