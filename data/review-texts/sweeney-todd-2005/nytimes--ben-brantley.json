The tone is enthusiastic about the changes made. | Gemini: The review states that this production is a \"cleaner, more concentrated nightmare\" than the original, indicating a positive, albeit unsettling, experience. This suggests a recommendation with reservations, as it might not be for everyone. | Kimi: The critic favorably compares this production to the original, praising it as a more concentrated and effective realization of the show's horror elements, indicating strong approval despite the excerpt's brevity.",
