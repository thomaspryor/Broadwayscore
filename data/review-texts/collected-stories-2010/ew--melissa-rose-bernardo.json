  "bwwExcerpt": "Why, you ask, would Manhattan Theatre Club follow its premiere of Donald Margulies' Time Stands Still with a revival of Collected Stories — his crafty 1996 literary drama that's already been done twice in New York City? So we can hear Linda Lavin turn out two hours' worth of delicious bons mots like 'Life's too short for The New Yorker.' Lavin is relishing, but not milking, her role as a writer/professor/reluctant mentor; Deadwood's Sarah Paulson is ever-so-slightly (perhaps appropriately) grating as her sycophantic protégée.",
