  "bwwExcerpt": "MTC head Lynne Meadow directs and skillfully guides the cast through Margulies' conversational and emotionally charged dialogue. Lavin is brilliant. She's a marvel to watch breathe life into Ruth as she goes from standoffish star writer to insecure and heartbreakingly vulnerable wreck. Paulson convincingly shifts from insecure hesitant, unpublished ugly duckling to a confident, if ruthless, literary swan poised to eclipse her hero.",
