  "bwwExcerpt": "Little wonder that, for the third time since 1997, a New York theater has turned to 'Collected Stories.' Donald Margulies' drama delivers an engrossing, if somewhat schematic, couple of hours with just a single set and two actors. What sets this play apart from dozens of others with identical descriptions, however, is that the characters are interesting, intelligent women, for a change.'",
