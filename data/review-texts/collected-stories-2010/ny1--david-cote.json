  "bwwExcerpt": "If Donald Margulies were a novelist, he'd churn out airport fiction, like John Grisham or Michael Crichton: popular, but not to be confused with art. Now Manhattan Theatre Club has revived Margulies’ 'Collected Stories,' a 1996 two-hander set in the world of genuine literature. It’s skillful, diverting stuff, but essentially, light reading.",
