  "bwwExcerpt": "By the end of Lynne Meadow's effective production, you've gotten hooked. But for the most part, 'Collected Stories' feels too polite, underwhelming and small. Linda Lavin gives a knockout performance as Ruth, marked by much humor and genuine emotion. Sarah Paulson looks too poised to play a student in her 20s, but becomes convincing as her character grows confident.",
