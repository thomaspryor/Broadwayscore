  "bwwExcerpt": "Anyone who takes acting seriously would walk a Broadway mile to see Linda Lavin play a distinguished but earthy author who is betrayed by the adoring protege who worms into her reclusive life. Pulitzer Prize-winning scribe Donald Margulies deftly if oh-so-laboriously lays out the groundwork for the final confrontation that allows Lavin to rip her guts out. Manhattan Theater Club a.d. Lynne Meadow, who previously directed Lavin in 'The Tale of the Allergist's Wife' and helms here, respects her star's firepower and has hired a classy tech-team to prove it. But lordy, lordy, what a boring play it is.",

  "wrongFullText": "Feb 1, 2010 8:03pm PT \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n Secrets of the Tribe\n \n \n\n \n\n Eye-opening docu views several decades of questionable research about Amazonian Brazil's Yanomami.\n\nThe anthropological field resembles a vipers’ nest of ethical breaches and academic backstabbing in “Bus 174” helmer Jose Padilha’s “Secrets of the Tribe.” This eye-opening docu views several decades of questionable research and behavior that ultimately rendered Amazonian Brazil’s Yanomami — once considered the last, “purest” primitive society untouched by outside influence — bitterly cynical toward First World interlopers. Absorbing feature is slated for HBO broadcast later this year, with wider fest play and tube sales assured.\n\nThe major adversaries here are two well-known U.S. authorities on the subject. Napoleon Chagnon began studying the Yanomami in the 1960s, penning the popular tome “Yanomamo: The Fierce People,” which described bloody intertribal wars. But his data, conclusions and tactics (plus involvement in a reckless spread of Western diseases) have been seriously questioned. Ardent foe Kenneth Good’s books sparked a flood of New Age-y media portraying Yanomami as peaceful innocents, but Good was criticized for marrying a 13-year-old tribeswoman. Levi-Strauss protege Jacques Lizot (who refused to be interviewed) allegedly traded Western goods (even guns) for pederastic sexual services. Colleagues both supportive and appalled are featured in this fascinating assembly of heated debate and archival footage.\n\nAs a California consumer, you have the right to opt-out from the sale or sharing of your personal information at any time across business platform, services, businesses and devices.
