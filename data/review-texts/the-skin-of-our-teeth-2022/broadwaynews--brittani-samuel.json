  "bwwExcerpt": "As an absurdist meditation on resilience, 'The Skin of Our Teeth' (which premiered on Broadway in 1942) is still relevant today, but its larger life lessons hardly seem revolutionary. We've already spent the past two years in a deeply intimate relationship with endurance. Surely, we will have to again. My advice? Surrender to the creativity of 'Skin' which, in 2022, is best viewed as a theatrical vessel for the many great talents currently working in American theater. A play this long and zany would have a harder time holding attention if not for the 28 cast members' unrelenting commitment to crazy. Gabby Beans, in particular, as the Antrobuses' high-octane housemaid Sabina, gives the best comedic performance I've seen all year. Almost Disney-like in her zealousness, Beans adopts the voice of Yzma from 'The Emperor's New Groove' and spritelyness of Edna Mode from 'The Incredibles,' then drops the act to assure us that she, too, is confused: 'Don't take this play serious. The world's not coming to an end. You know it's not. People exaggerate!'",
