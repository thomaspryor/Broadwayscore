  "bwwExcerpt": "For some, this too muchness, married to Wilder's bookish mischief, will pall. The intermission doesn't come until nearly two hours in, and as I walked out into the lobby, an usher asked me if I planned on leaving. Apparently a lot of people do. But if you stick it out, you can find real power in the way the lush design garlands a profound suspicion of human endeavor. Blain-Cruz relegates Wilder's emphasis on endurance for something more questioning, mostly by giving space to the questions that are already there.",
