  "bwwExcerpt": "If ever a play needed a high concept, it is Thornton Wilder's surreal comedy with its many disparate parts and radical shifts in tone. Lileana Blain-Cruz directs this revival with less a vision than a couple of ideas. To call them 'concepts' gives her too much credit, and both those ideas hold our attention for a minute or two. That's a problem for a play with three acts that lasts three hours. I haven't witnessed this many walk-outs at a theater since the Met Opera last staged Schoenberg's 'Moses und Aaron.'",
