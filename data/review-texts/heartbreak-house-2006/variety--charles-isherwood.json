    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges good production values ('handsome') but delivers a clear negative verdict with 'dramatically sluggish.' Single excerpt warning applied - this appears to be the critic's core assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'handsome' but 'dramatically sluggish', indicating a mix of positive and negative elements. The lack of full context and the single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach, leading to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the phrase \"dramatically sluggish production,\" indicating a negative assessment. Given that it's a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt presents a balanced mixed assessment, acknowledging aesthetic merits ('handsome') while delivering significant criticism of the dramatic execution ('sluggish'). With only one curated quote available, the confidence is low. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",
