    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Praises production values and acting but identifies a significant flaw - missing the essential dangerous quality. Single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review praises the production's mounting and acting but notes a lack of the 'dangerous electricity' that made the original memorable, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (handsomely mounted, well-acted) but ultimately finds the production lacking compared to the original, suggesting a mixed or lukewarm reception. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: While the critic praises the production values and performances, the decisive 'but' clause emphasizes a crucial missing element—the dangerous electricity of the original—suggesting a competent but ultimately disappointing revival that falls short of its potential.",
