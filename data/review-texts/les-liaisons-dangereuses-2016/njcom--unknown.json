  "bwwExcerpt": "Schreiber misses badly here, offering up a kind of Ray Donovan take on Valmont, brutish and creepy. He's less a bodice-ripping villain than the kind of guy who in modern times would be hanging around school playgrounds wearing a trench coat. Schreiber generates little in the way of chemistry with McTeer, and even less with the actresses who play his two conquests, Birgitte Hjort Sørensen (HBO's 'Vinyl'), as the virtuous Madame de Tourvel, and Elena Kampouris ('My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2'), as the virginal Cecile. (On the night I saw the show, he also mangled a few of his lines.)",
