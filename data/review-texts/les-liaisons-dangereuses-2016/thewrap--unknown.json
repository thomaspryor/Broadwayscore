  "bwwExcerpt": "In Liev Schreiber's eccentric performance, this audio disconnect provides one of the few pleasures in what is otherwise a lethargic production, one that originated at London's Donmar Warehouse under the direction of Josie Rourke. Schreiber sounds as if Laurence Oliver's tenor is fighting Richard Burton's baritone, with all of this disharmony emitting from the esteemed American actor's great granite face.",
