  "bwwExcerpt": "'I always knew I was born to dominate your sex and avenge my own,' the deliciously amoral Marquise de Merteuil tells her male interlocutor in Les Liaisons Dangereuses. As personified in a blazing performance by Janet McTeer - her voice like velvet and her physical bearing a cloak of studied artifice encasing a flesh and blood woman of ferocious cunning - there's never cause to doubt her claim. Her accomplice-turned-opponent in their games of cruel conquest is a different matter. But even if Liev Schreiber is ill-suited for the part of the 'conspicuously charming' Vicomte de Valmont, Josie Rourke's evocative staging provides a compelling portrait of a dissolute aristocracy on the brink of devouring itself.",
