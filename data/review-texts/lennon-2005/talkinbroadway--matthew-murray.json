However, this appears to be a truncated excerpt, limiting confidence in the full assessment. | GPT-4o: The review suggests the show succeeds only when it shifts focus from being a traditional musical to a concert, indicating mixed success. The tone is not strongly positive or negative, placing it in the mixed category. | Gemini: The review suggests the show has strengths when it focuses on the music but implies weaknesses in its attempt to be a traditional musical, indicating a mixed experience. | Kimi: The critic suggests the show has an identity crisis, failing in its attempt to be a traditional musical but succeeding when it embraces concert format. This qualified assessment indicates mixed results rather than a clear recommendation.",
