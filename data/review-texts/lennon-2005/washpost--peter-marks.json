    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic directly criticizes the show for feeling like a 'museum exhibit' rather than a 'theatrical experience,' indicating fundamental failure to achieve its purpose. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be one negative observation in an otherwise mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a lack of theatricality, comparing the show to a museum exhibit. This implies a negative view of the production's engagement level. However, with only one excerpt, the full sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt compares the show unfavorably to a museum exhibit, suggesting a lack of theatricality and engagement, leading to a negative assessment. | Kimi: With only a single excerpt available, the critic's comparison to a museum exhibit suggests the production is static and fails to achieve genuine theatrical impact, warranting a negative classification in the mid-range of that bucket.",
