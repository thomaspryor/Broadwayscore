    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic finds the show lacking in theatrical cohesion while acknowledging 'stirring musical moments.' This balances negative (not cohesive as theater) with positive (stirring music), suggesting a mixed verdict. Low confidence due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The review notes a lack of cohesion in the theatrical experience, despite some positive musical moments. The excerpt suggests a mixed reception, with no clear recommendation to see or avoid the show. | Gemini: The review excerpt acknowledges \"stirring musical moments\" but ultimately finds the show lacking as a \"cohesive theatrical experience.\" This suggests a mixed assessment, leaning towards the lower end of the Mixed bucket due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt presents a balanced critique, criticizing the show's lack of theatrical cohesion while praising the musical performances. As a single curated excerpt, the overall verdict is unclear but appears neither fully positive nor negative.",
