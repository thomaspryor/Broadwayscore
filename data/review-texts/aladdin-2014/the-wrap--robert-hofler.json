  "bwwExcerpt": ": Suffice to say, \"Aladdin\" bears no resemblance to Nicholaw's previous laugh-filled Broadway effort, \"The Book of Mormon.\"...And neither does Chad Beguelin's book, which is loaded with some clever \"Sesame Street\" word play but finds no magic whatsoever in a story rife with magic lanterns, carpets, genies and sultry Arabian nights. Will children get the humor in send-ups of old tap and soft-shoe numbers? Isn't mocking stage traditions a rather cynical way to introduce children to the theater?",
