    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies - this balances genuine praise (handsome, gorgeous design, soaring songs) against significant criticisms (bloated, overstuffed, not magical enough). The 'but' structure suggests overall disappointment despite acknowledging merits. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the show's design and some songs but criticizes it as bloated and lacking magic. The single excerpt suggests a mixed verdict with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents both positive aspects (handsome show, gorgeous design, soaring songs) and negative aspects (bloated, overstuffed, not magical enough), indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges strong production values and some soaring songs, but the decisive 'But' emphasizes significant flaws—bloat and a lack of magic—that undercut the experience, suggesting a show with redeeming qualities that ultimately disappoints.",
