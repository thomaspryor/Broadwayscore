    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for direction, ensemble work, and design elements with words like 'flawlessly,' 'surprise and wonder,' and 'marvel.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked positive content from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the ensemble and costume design, indicating a positive reception. The use of words like 'flawlessly', 'surprise', and 'wonder' suggests an enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the direction, ensemble, and costumes, indicating a positive experience. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the direction ('flawlessly') and design ('stunning'), indicating a strong recommendation despite the limited context of a single curated quote.",
