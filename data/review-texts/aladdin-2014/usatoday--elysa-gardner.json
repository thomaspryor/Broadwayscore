'Aladdin' rubs you the right wayElysa Gardner@elysagardner, USA TODAYUpdated March 20, 2014, 10:12 p.m. ETNEW YORK — It's safe to say that no Broadway performer is currently burning more calories per second than James Monroe Iglehart does during Friend Like Me, an eight-minute joyride featured near the end of Act One in Aladdin (* * * ½ out of four stars).\n\nYou may recognize the song from the 1992 animated movie on which this new musical, which opened Thursday at the New Amsterdam Theatre, is based. In the film version, Friend is sung by Robin Williams, voicing the role of the genie who comes to our titular hero's aid, at his most breathlessly ebullient. It's an act that would be impossible to reproduce, so Iglehart, abetted by director/choreographer Casey Nicholaw, simply tops it.\n\nBy the end of the number — which includes a game-show segment, a medley of tunes from other Disney musicals and a succession of winking, twinkling chorus lines — Iglehart's Genie is deliriously huffing and puffing; the audience, which responded at a recent preview with a standing ovation, is just as giddy.\n\nIf Disney Theatrical's latest production doesn't sustain that frenzied high throughout, it delivers a rush that may surprise folks who attend either as chaperones or to relive their own youths. Nicholaw, noted for less family-friendly projects such as The Book of Mormon and The Drowsy Chaperone, works with a book by Chad Beguelin, also his collaborator on Elf: The Musical, for which Beguelin provided mostly hokey lyrics.\n\nThe libretto here is sharper, and deftly refines a less-than-stellar screenplay. Disney's account of the goodhearted young \"street rat\" who, with Genie's help, assumes royal stature to woo a princess never reached the enchanting heights of, say, Beauty and the Beast.\n\nBut this Aladdin shows more imagination, and has more fun, in buffing up the film's plot than the stage version of Beast did in trying to recapture the original's glory.\n\nBeguelin uses obvious jokes and references, yet they're delivered with such gleeful savvy by Nicholaw and his excellent company that you suspend skepticism and dive right in.\n\nThere are unexpectedly, winningly understated touches as well, among them a lovely presentation of Aladdin's most famous tune, Alan Menken and Tim Rice's Oscar-winning A Whole New World.\n\nThe magic carpet carrying Adam Jacobs' spry, endearing Aladdin and Courtney Reed's charmingly no-nonsense Princess Jasmine remains dimly lit against a simple, starry backdrop; rather than having the couple fly out into the audience, Nicholaw keeps the emphasis on their tender chemistry and robust voices.\n\nThe score also features jazzy tunes and a pining ballad written for, but not included in, the movie — composed by Menken, with lyrics by the late Howard Ashman — and new songs by Menken and Beguelin, whose words here draw at least some inspiration from Ashman's playful wit and poignance. They're all heartily sung by a cast that also includes a darkly juicy Jonathan Freeman, reprising his film role as Jafar, the conniving control freak who tries to thwart Aladdin at every turn.\n\nJafar ultimately fails, of course, so that Iglehart's dazzling Genie gets to declare, \"I just love a happy ending!\" Even the most jaded observers will, again, share in his enthusiasm.",
