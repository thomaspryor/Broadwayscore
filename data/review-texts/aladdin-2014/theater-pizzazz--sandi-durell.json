    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear enthusiasm with superlatives ('maaaahvelous') and positive emotional impact ('made me feel like a kid again'). Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the tone is unambiguously positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses enthusiastic language ('maaaahvelous!') and highlights multiple positive aspects (costumes, sets, comedic fun). However, only one excerpt is available, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses enthusiastic language like \"maaaahvelous!\" and describes feeling like a kid again, indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic uses exuberant superlatives and praises the production design and emotional effect, warranting an upper-range Positive score despite the limitation of a single curated excerpt.",
