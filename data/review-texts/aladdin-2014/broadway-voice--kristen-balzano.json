    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt uses strong positive descriptors ('enchanting,' 'magical,' 'jaw-dropping') while praising the show's restraint. However, confidence is low due to limited text availability. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as enchanting and magical, indicating a positive experience. However, the lack of extreme praise and the caution about the excerpt being cherry-picked suggests a mildly positive verdict. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"enchanting\", \"magical\", and \"jaw-dropping\", suggesting a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, I've placed the score at the higher end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strongly positive descriptors like 'enchanting,' 'magical,' and 'jaw-dropping' while praising the production's restraint, indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited context.",
