    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt uses clearly positive language ('enchanting', 'magical', 'jaw-dropping') suggesting strong recommendation, but limited text requires low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'enchanting' and 'magical', indicating a positive impression. However, the lack of 'extreme' or 'unnecessary fireworks' suggests some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, this leans towards a positive verdict but with caution. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"enchanting\", \"magical\", and \"jaw-dropping\", suggesting a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I've placed it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strongly positive descriptors while appreciating the production's restraint, indicating a clear recommendation despite limited available context.",
