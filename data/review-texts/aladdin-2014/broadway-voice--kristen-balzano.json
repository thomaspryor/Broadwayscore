    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt uses strong positive descriptors ('enchanting', 'magical', 'jaw-dropping') suggesting clear recommendation, but limited text and potential cherry-picking warrants low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the show, highlighting its enchanting and magical qualities. However, the lack of extreme praise and the warning about the single excerpt necessitate a cautious approach, placing it at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using words like \"enchanting\", \"magical\", and \"jaw-dropping\". Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic offers strong praise describing the show as 'enchanting,' 'magical,' and 'jaw-dropping' while appreciating its restraint from unnecessary spectacle, indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited excerpt available.",
