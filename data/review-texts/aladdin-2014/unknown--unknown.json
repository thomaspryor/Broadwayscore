    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic had low expectations but was pleasantly surprised, describing the show as 'infectious' with positive energy. However, this is only one excerpt so scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt indicates a positive shift from initial low expectations, describing the musical as 'infectious' and only 'mildly syrupy', suggesting it is enjoyable. However, the lack of a full review and single excerpt warning necessitates a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review states that the musical defied expectations and has an infectious spirit, indicating a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. The \"mildly syrupy\" comment suggests a reservation.",
