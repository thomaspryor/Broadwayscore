Since a certain blockbuster feline arrived well over a decade ago, Broadway has been lapped by wave after wave of big, often gloppy songfests adapted from animated movies, mostly from the mother ship, Disney.\n\nSo the prospect of “Aladdin,” promising another weary night in the presence of a spunky youngster and wisecracking animals, didn’t exactly set my heart racing. But this latest musical adapted from one of Disney’s popular movies, which opened on Thursday night at the New Amsterdam Theater, defied my dour expectations. As directed and choreographed (and choreographed, and choreographed) by Casey Nicholaw, and adapted by the book writer Chad Beguelin, “Aladdin” has an infectious and only mildly syrupy spirit. Not to mention enough baubles, bangles and beading to keep a whole season of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” contestants in runway attire.\n\nI don’t mean to suggest that Mr. Nicholaw, best known for the spectacularly smutty “Book of Mormon,” has infused the original material with subversive aspects, or even a single naughty word. But while it mostly sticks to the formulaic pattern of the movie — spirited princess falls in love with cute commoner, evil vizier snarls, helpful genie makes like a veteran of the stand-up circuit — the stage “Aladdin” also joshes the somewhat exhausted conventions of the genre with a breezy insouciance that scrubs away some of the material’s bland gloss. (“We don’t have time for self-discovery,” the villain, Jafar, snaps at one point.) And the score (by Alan Menken, Howard Ashman and Tim Rice), which features several songs written for the movie that didn’t make it to the screen (and some new ones with lyrics by Mr. Beguelin), has been adroitly, not to say exhaustively, exploited for any and every opportunity to indulge in extravagant musical numbers. These pay energetic tribute to everything from the Cotton Club and Las Vegas to vintage Hollywood and current Bollywood.\n\nI am still shaking the stray sequins from my clothing.\n\nAs many will recall, the 1992 movie was all but upended by the anarchic performance of Robin Williams, who provided the voice of the shape-shifting blue Genie. Here a similar feat is performed by James Monroe Iglehart, a burly and, er, genial presence who presides over the proceedings with a wink and a sly smile, and stops the show on cue (it must be in his contract) when he emerges from his lamp to sing the hyperactive “Friend Like Me.” As Mr. Iglehart races through Ashman’s witty lyrics with impressive breath control, the gold-dripping cave designed by Bob Crowley (in excellent form) explodes with members of the chorus performing a series of antic divertissements. Fez-wearing waiters proffer piles of food (in tribute to “Hello, Dolly”?), glittery showgirls fling their gams in their air, Genie and Aladdin do a brief tango and a sliver of a square dance (I think), all followed by a big-finish tap finale featuring blinding gold costumes.\n\nThis almost maniacally entertaining number also interpolates snatches of songs from other Disney movies (like “Beauty and the Beast”) into the accelerating mayhem, and includes allusions to such disparate cultural markers as Oprah Winfrey, “West Side Story” and (why not?) the game show “Let’s Make a Deal.” Behind Door No. 3 is a miniature pyramid, inspiring this immortal pun from the Genie: “Now you and King Tut will finally have something in Tutankhamen!”\n\nAn appetite for similar ba-dum-bum humor (some choice, some groan-worthy) will increase your enjoyment of “Aladdin,” which puts a greater emphasis on broad comedy than most of Disney’s other stage musicals (actually all of them), and often seems determined to keep us in a state of happily dazed distraction from the familiar mechanics of its central story line. If I can peer back through the haze of salaaming dancers still rampaging through my brain, I believe this involves the travails of Princess Jasmine (Courtney Reed), whose father the Sultan (Clifton Davis) is determined to find her a suitably regal husband.\n\nNaturally Jasmine, one of Disney’s earlier girl-empowerment figurines, sticks up for her right to make her own choice. (“Why are you so determined to pawn me off to any Tom, Dick or Hassim that comes our way?” she huffs.) Although she’s played with a likable light touch by Ms. Reed, this figure, now generic, might as well have “spunky” tattooed in henna on one hand, and “sweet” on the other.\n\nEscaping from the palace in disguise to mix with the common people one day, she meets Aladdin (a gleaming Adam Jacobs), who’s poor but hunky and lovable. He is constantly trailed by a trio of ne’er-do-well companions (replacing the monkey, Abu, from the movie) who trade snarky remarks and crack jokes as they scrape a living by any means possible. (They are played with boyish comic verve by Jonathan Schwartz, Brandon O’Neill and Brian Gonzales, whose gags about his ever-growling stomach include puns on hummus and tabbouleh; don’t try this at home.)\n\nUnsurprisingly, and after perhaps a few too many trips around the bazaar, this bunch triumphs over the machinations of the nasty Jafar, played with epicene menace and great lashings of eyeliner by Jonathan Freeman (reprising his role from the movie), whose animal sidekick has also been transformed into a human one, a mini-meanie called Iago (Don Darryl Rivera), spouting his own steady stream of one-liners as he bustles behind his evil overlord.\n\nMost of the numbers not involving chorus members in chest-baring vests and harem pants tend to pass by without making much of an impression. (Gregg Barnes did the pseudo-Arabian costumes.) Although Mr. Jacobs and Ms. Reed have solid voices, even the movie’s big hit song, the pretty Menken-Rice ballad “A Whole New World,” lands rather softly. (More plush orchestrations might help.) On the plus side, the Disney engineers have provided a nifty bit of wonder for the magic carpet, which appears to float softly around the stage without benefit of any visible lifting apparatus.\n\nStill, this isn’t the most impressive feat of trickery on display in “Aladdin.” That would be Mr. Nicholaw and Mr. Beguelin’s inexhaustible determination to put a cockeyed slant on the trademark Disney musical formula. Obviously, they have not been able to clear away all the underbrush of clichés that come with this territory. “Just be yourself,” the Genie says to Aladdin, when lesson-learning time arrives. But the production’s relentless razzle-dazzle and its anything-for-a-laugh spirit also infuse the show with a winking suggestion: If you can’t be yourself, just be fabulous.\n\nShare full articleRelated ContentAdvertisement",
