  "bwwExcerpt": "While burning through wishes, you should ask for the musical to have a lot more heart. The absence is glaring, given that Disney excels at tugging at tickers and then making them melt. But this show seldom moves you. The title character's yearning ballad, \"Proud of Your Boy,\" sung to his long-gone mom, isn't enough to make this anything better than a Bedouin \"Beauty and the Beast\" - a cartoon on stage.",

While burning through wishes, you should ask for the musical to have a lot more heart. The absence is glaring, given that Disney excels at tugging at tickers and then making them melt.\"",
