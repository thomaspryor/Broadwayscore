    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear recommendation for target audience (families) but with notable reservation about not matching the source material's magic. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive experience for families, though it notes the show doesn't fully capture the magic of the original film. Given the limited text and mild positivity, a lower score within the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The review is positive, stating it should please families, but it does have a reservation about not capturing the magic of the animated film. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise ('colorful, energetic') but includes significant reservations about the show failing to match its source material, limiting the recommendation to family audiences specifically rather than general acclaim.",
