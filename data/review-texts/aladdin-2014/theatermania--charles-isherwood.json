    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: This is a qualified recommendation - the critic says it 'should please families' but notes it falls short of expectations. Single excerpt warning and positive language suggests lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a generally positive impression, highlighting the show's appeal to families and its energetic nature, but notes it falls short of the animated film's magic. Given the single excerpt and text quality warning, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review is positive, stating it should please families, but it also notes that it doesn't quite capture the magic of the animated film, indicating reservations. Given that it is a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a qualified recommendation limited to family audiences, praising the energy and color while explicitly noting the production fails to match the original film's magic. As a single curated excerpt, the overall verdict may not be fully represented.",
