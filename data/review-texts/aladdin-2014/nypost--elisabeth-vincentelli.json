  "bwwExcerpt": "Disney's new \"Aladdin\" doesn't quite catch lightning in a bottle - but it lets a pretty nifty genie out of a lamp. That would be James Monroe Iglehart, in the role memorably voiced by Robin Williams in the 1992 animated hit. Every time this Genie's on stage, it's as if \"Aladdin\" were mainlining Red Bull. Iglehart works so hard during his big number, you fear for his health - that is, when you're not laughing your head off. And then there's the rest of the show...The whole vibe is like a throwback to those old Bob Hope/Bing Crosby movies: \"The Road to Agrabah.\" But the journey may be a short one - leaving the beautiful New Amsterdam Theatre free just in time for the \"Frozen\" musical to move in.",
