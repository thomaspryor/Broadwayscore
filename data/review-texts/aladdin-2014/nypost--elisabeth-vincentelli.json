  "bwwExcerpt": ": Disney's new \"Aladdin\" doesn't quite catch lightning in a bottle - but it lets a pretty nifty genie out of a lamp. That would be James Monroe Iglehart, in the role memorably voiced by Robin Williams in the 1992 animated hit. Every time this Genie's on stage, it's as if \"Aladdin\" were mainlining Red Bull.
