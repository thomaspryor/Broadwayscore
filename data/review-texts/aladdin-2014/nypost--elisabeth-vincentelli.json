  "bwwExcerpt": "Disney's new \"Aladdin\" doesn't quite catch lightning in a bottle - but it lets a pretty nifty genie out of a lamp. That would be James Monroe Iglehart, in the role memorably voiced by Robin Williams in the 1992 animated hit. Every time this Genie's on stage, it's as if \"Aladdin\" were mainlining Red ...",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise with superlative language ('dazzles', 'spectacular', 'wonderful world'), but only one excerpt available so confidence is low. Positive tone suggests upper range of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the production elements, using words like 'wonderful' and 'dazzles', suggesting a highly positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"dazzles\" and \"wonderful world\", indicating a positive review. However, since it is a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous enthusiasm with words like 'dazzles' and 'spectacular,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, as a single curated quote, it warrants the upper end of the Positive bucket (80-84) rather than a Rave classification, with low confidence due to limited context.",
