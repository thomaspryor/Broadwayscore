Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"dazzles\" and \"wonderful world\", suggesting a strong recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's spectacle using words like 'dazzles' and 'spectacular,' indicating a strong recommendation, though the limited single-excerpt context warrants reduced confidence.",
