    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise with 'wonderful world' and 'dazzles' language, but low confidence due to limited text availability and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the production's visual elements, using words like 'wonderful' and 'dazzles'. Despite the single excerpt warning, the positive language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"dazzles\" and \"wonderful world\", indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I've placed it towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's visual elements using words like 'dazzles' and 'spectacular,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, as a single curated quote, it may not represent the full critical assessment.",
