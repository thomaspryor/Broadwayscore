  "fullText": "The cartoonish musical is modelled after snappy 1960s Broadway musical comedies, complete with passing scenes staged \"in-one\" in front of a curtain to cover changes in d&eacute;cor. Sure, that's retro, but it suits the light-hearted material as well as a Disney crowd who probably prefers familiar formats. Casey Nicholaw, an ace director-choreographer, maintains a slightly tongue-in-cheek quality throughout the fast-moving show, especially in his frisky dances that, with their sinuous arm gestures, synchronized moves and general acrobatics, often suggest Bollywood production numbers. A lively and good-looking ensemble expertly undulates through the sometimes zany choreography.",
