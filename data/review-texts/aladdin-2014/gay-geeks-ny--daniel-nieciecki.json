  "fullText": "Disney’s Aladdin on Broadway: Adaptation Decay Animation, television, books, theater, and all other media are ways we tell stories, toolkits of techniques to present information such as the thoughts and feelings of characters and the scope of the worlds that shape them and which they shape in return. Media are not fungible, however: they operate according to different rules and rely on different conventions to be successful and it is not always possible or desirable to translate a story from one medium to another successfully. “Success” in this context could be defined as preserving the heart of the story, its message, tone, and emotional and intellectual content, while telling it in a new way. If the experience of the story in its new medium is inferior to the experience in the original, then the story has suffered from Adaptation Decay. I had the privilege to experience an excellent example of Adaptation Decay on Sunday in a performance of the latest Disney animated film to be translated into the medium of Broadway musical theater, Aladdin, currently in previews at the New Amsterdam Theater. Aladdin debuted in 1992, in the heart of the Disney Renaissance. While not completely uncontroversial, it was and has remained very well received by critics and the public alike. The film featured a decent Alan Menken score, a darkly fabulous villain in the sorcerer Jafar, and even the manic absurdity of Robin Williams’ comedic style – which is often difficult to tolerate for very long – was well matched to the role and the medium of an animated film. The benefit of animation as a medium, though, is that the only limitation on what can be shown on screen is the imagination of the artists. Aladdin is a typical Disney animated film in that the main human characters are accompanied by non-human sidekicks who have been anthropomorphized to varying degrees: Jafar’s parrot familiar Iago, Aladdin’s monkey friend Abu, Jasmine’s pet tiger Rajah, and the sentient flying carpet. These characters can be brought to life by animation when they would be impossible or implausible in more “realistic” genres like live-action film and theater. There are several options for adapting these characters to the stage. One could attempt to recreate the film as closely as possible. The Broadway version of Beauty and the Beast dressed the actors playing the cursed servants in costumes resembling clocks, candelabras, and teapots. The Broadway version of The Lion King demonstrated to great critical acclaim how non-human animal characters can be portrayed by humans through puppets, evocative costumes, or a combination of the two. It would not have been impossible to follow this path for Abu or Iago. Alternatively, one could simply cut the characters altogether. They are not essential to the plot, although children in the audience might miss them. The creative team behind the Broadway version of Aladdin, however, seems to have come up with the worst option possible. In place of Abu the monkey, Aladdin has not one but three human side-kicks who are both forgettable and irritating. In place of Rajah the tiger, Jasmine is accompanied by not one but three stereotypical sassy black women apparently on vacation from Little Shop of Horrors. Finally, Jafar is accompanied not by a parrot but by a baffling sort of clown who has the astonishing talent of being more obnoxious than Gilbert Gottfried. The flying carpet makes an appearance, too, during “A Whole New World,” but only as a gimmick like the helicopter in Miss Saigon. Other things that animation accomplishes much better than live theater are action sequences, such as the slapstick chase scene during “One Jump Ahead,” and huge ensemble set pieces like “Prince Ali.” The latter is creatively staged as viewed from the interior of the palace, which allows the actors to circle off stage, quickly change costumes, then return again through the doorway as the song continues. The former scene, in fact all the action scenes in the show, are less convincing than an old Looney Tunes cartoon. I could go on more about how the show fails as traditional musical theater, such as giving gratuitous characters gratuitous songs simply to fill empty space and how, as a result of filler and the limitations of live theater, the climax, the final confrontation with Jafar, is anticlimactic. What should be noted, however, are the surprising and disappointingly numerous resorts to gay panic and body image as sources of humor. One would have hoped that a Broadway staging of a Disney show in 2014 would not need to turn to accidental intimacy between two males as a horrible thing to laugh at or fat people as the necessary and obvious butt of jokes. Unfortunately, that was apparently too much to expect. When taken together, all of these changes inhibit the story. They debase an entertaining cinema experience into a grueling endurance test that fails to retain most of the enjoyment of the original, complete with a time dilation from 90 minutes to over two hours plus intermission. The decisions made in translating this story from an animated film to a live Broadway musical are either poorly chosen or poorly executed and thereby prevent the story from being told and experienced to the same degree as on the screen. Such is the definition of Adaptation Decay. To end on a positive note, credit must be given where due. James Monroe Inglehart was phenomenal in the role of the Genie and did a tremendous job to make the role his own while still incorporating many of the distinctive elements of the Robin Williams shtick from the film. It was also a pleasure to hear Jonathan Freeman, the original actor for Jafar, bring his silken malevolent voice back to the role. However, with Broadway ticket prices being as astronomically high as they are, I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone pay full price for this show. Adaptation between media is not easy. It requires talent and skill and often a great deal of luck, because not all stories are suited to all media. The most important question to ask yourself, before “How do I adapt this story to this medium?” is “Should I adapt this story to this medium?” If the producers had done sufficient introspection before bringing Aladdin to the Broadway stage, the honest answer should have been “No.” This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.
