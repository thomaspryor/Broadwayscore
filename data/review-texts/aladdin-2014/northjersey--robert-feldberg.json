  "bwwExcerpt": "Large but agile, Iglehart then leads the singing and dancing in \"Friend Like Me,\" a wonderfully over-the-top moment of celebration. Casey Nicholaw hasn't directed the show very nimbly, but his choreography for this number is invigorating. \"Aladdin\" ends with the hero and Jasmine floating through the night sky on a magic carpet. It's a lovely image, but too little, too late.",
