    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clear praise for production values ('visual feast', 'dazzles', 'magical'). However, the phrase 'more magical than the story it tells' suggests story weaknesses. Low confidence due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the production's dazzling visual elements and magical quality, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is very positive, describing the production as a \"visual feast\" and \"more magical than the story it tells.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise, highlighting the dazzling costumes, sets, and effects as a 'visual feast' while implying the narrative is less compelling than the spectacle. The recommendation is primarily for the production values rather than the book.",
