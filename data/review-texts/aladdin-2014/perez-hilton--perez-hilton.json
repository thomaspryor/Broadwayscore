    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The emphatic capitalization and repetition of 'win' suggests strong enthusiasm, but this is only a single curated excerpt which limits confidence in the full review's verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provided is highly enthusiastic, using strong positive language ('win win WIN!') indicating a rave review. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is set at the lower end of the Rave range. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is extremely positive, using the phrase 'win win WIN!' which indicates a strong recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive sentiment warrants a score on the higher end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers unqualified enthusiastic praise with superlatives ('win win WIN'), indicating strong recommendation. Per single-excerpt guidelines for clearly positive quotes, score is placed at upper end of Positive range with low confidence due to cherry-picking risk. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
