  "dtliExcerpt": "Its exotic Middle Eastern setting and multiethnic cast aside, Aladdin offers less \"A Whole New World\" - to quote its signature song - than a traditional Disney fairy-tale realm; it's perhaps the most old-school of the company's screen-to-stage adaptations since Beauty and the Beast. But that shouldn't deter audiences from making this splashy Arabian Nights wish-fulfillment fantasy into a family-friendly hit. Directed and choreographed by musical comedy specialist Casey Nicholaw with loads of retro showmanship, an unapologetic embrace of casbah kitsch and a heavy accent on shtick, this is sweet, silly fun. It's not the most sophisticated entertainment, but the target demographic won't mind at all.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"While it doesn't rival the imagination or innovation of \"The Lion King,\"  the show's ebullient comic spirit should make it a popular hit. It's not the most sophisticated entertainment, but the target demographic won't mind at all.\"",
