But that shouldn't deter audiences from making this splashy Arabian Nights wish-fulfillment fantasy into a family-friendly hit. Directed and choreographed by musical comedy specialist Casey Nicholaw with loads of retro showmanship, an unapologetic embrace of casbah kitsch and a heavy accent on shtick, this is sweet, silly fun. It's not the most sophisticated entertainment, but the target demographic won't mind at all.\n\nThe 1992 release followed The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast in Disney's renaissance of the animated feature musical, heralding the valiant final resurgence of hand-drawn toon artistry before computer animation took hold. The film was notable for its shift beyond the princess focus to a more boy-centric story, and for being among the first cases of major celebrity voice casting becoming central to the production's marketing, via Robin Williams' role as the motormouth Genie.\n\nIt was also the final collaboration between composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman before the latter's death due to AIDS complications in 1991. The team completed eleven songs for Aladdin, only a handful of which made it into the movie; several of the others have found an afterlife here. Tim Rice stepped in to complete work on the film's score with Menken, while Chad Beguelin (The Wedding Singer, Elf), the book writer on this stage adaptation, contributes additional lyrics. Irrespective of who wrote what, the songs are tuneful, if not quite top-drawer.\n\nNicholaw won a 2011 Tony Award as co-director with Trey Parker of The Book of Mormon. But the most indicative precursor of his work here was his staging of \"Show Off,\" the hilariously insincere disavowal of a Broadway star's natural spotlight-seeking tendencies, performed with brio by Sutton Foster in The Drowsy Chaperone. That same more-is-more, irrepressibly over-the-top shamelessness defines the twin showstoppers that bookend intermission in Aladdin.\n\nThe first is \"Friend Like Me,\" in which the Genie (James Monroe Iglehart), freshly uncorked from his lamp, previews the infinite gifts available to his astonished new master, Aladdin (Adam Jacobs). Starting with Iglehart doing a Cab Calloway-esque scat, Nicholaw builds the song into a mammoth production number, with a chorus of whirling valets and showgirls, a \"Dancing with the Scimitars\" ballroom break, a step or two of hoedown, a game-show interlude, a mini-medley of Disney tunes from other musicals, an exuberant tap routine and a finale with canes and a kickline. While Williams' vocal performance in the movie was quite large, Iglehart's high-energy turn is perhaps even larger, whether he's dropping in winking pop-cultural anachronisms (he quotes Sweet Brown at one point) or firing off hoary one-liners like a Catskills comic. He's a delight.\n\nThe follow-up song, again led by the indefatigable Iglehart, is \"Prince Ali,\" a royal procession that makes Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra entrance look like a casual stroll. Replete with Vegas-style fan dancers, peacocks and the now-regulation streamer explosion, this takes place after the Genie has transformed Aladdin from street scruff into a regal suitor worthy of Princess Jasmine (Courtney Reed), the feisty Sultan's daughter feeling cramped inside the palace walls.\n\nBeguelin's book is larded with gags but sticks more or less to the movie. The main addition is a trio of vaudevillian comic sidekicks for Aladdin, (Brandon O'Neill, Jonathan Schwartz and Brian Gonzalez), replacing his kleptomaniac monkey onscreen. (Jasmine's tiger has also been nixed.) These guys were part of Ashman's concept for the film, and their jaunty songs are enjoyable, particularly \"High Adventure,\" even if they sometimes outstay their welcome.\n\nThe opening number, \"Arabian Nights,\" is a busy riot of marketplace scene-setting and souk-chic fashion, in which the Genie reminds us that, \"Even our poor people look faaabulous!\" That goes double for buff Aladdin, in his artfully patched Hammer-time pants. Beaming like a toothpaste commercial model, Jacobs packs plenty of charm into the role, and is an ideal incarnation of the handsome Disney cartoon hero -- now with lifelike nipples and body hair! He also brings tenderness to his warm rendition of \"Proud of Your Boy,\" in which the orphaned urchin dreams of becoming more than a street thief.\n\nBut the romantic pulse of Aladdin is a little faint. Jasmine is a less captivating version of Belle and Ariel before her, spouting generic female-empowerment refrains but never acquiring much dimension as a character. Her magic carpet flight with Aladdin during \"A Whole New World\" is a technological marvel (no visible trace of cables or lift mechanisms), set against the star-strewn velvet of lighting designer Natasha Katz's night sky. But the scene lacks enchantment because the chemistry between Aladdin and Jasmine isn't quite there. While Reed sings sweetly, she's more like a curvy Kardashian than a Disney princess, and her trio of fly-girl attendants could sub for Destiny's Child. (I swear, I kept listening for the opening guitar lick from \"Bootylicious,\" waiting for someone to ask, \"Kelly, can you handle this?\")\n\nBeguelin looks for the true heart of the musical in the intertwined quests of Aladdin to be an honorable man and the Genie to be a free one. But while both actors are winning presences, their storylines bump along with the jokey buddy dynamic of a Bob Hope-Bing Crosby movie (think Road to Morocco), limiting the emotional pull.\n\nIn leaning so heavily on the campy humor (yes, there are \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" dance moves aplenty) the creative team has slightly shortchanged the show on earnest sentimentality, which for better or worse is an essential Disney ingredient. That makes Aladdin's appeal somewhat juvenile, though plenty of adults with a taste for broad comedy will eagerly get on board. The cartoonish aspect is enhanced by the mugging villains: Jafar (Jonathan Freeman, reprising the vizier role he voiced in the film), and his diminutive henchman, Iago, no longer a parrot but a sneering human sycophant who, in Don Darryl Rivera's amusing performance, seems spliced from the DNA of Danny DeVito and Matt Lucas.\n\nBob Crowley's pretty sets appear lifted from storybook illustrations and classic animation backgrounds, but the most lavish design element by far is Gregg Barnes' endless parade of costumes. Their rich textures and vibrant colors are frequently embellished with beads, brocades, tassels and trinkets, accessories that are available in more modest versions at the lobby merchandise stand.

  "fullText": "Sam Gold directs the Broadway revival in a new adaptation by Amy Herzog, who penned last year’s scorching update of the Norwegian dramatist’s ‘A Doll’s House.’ In a clever trick that pulls us into the community about to witness the spectacular downfall of the public figure crusading for truth at the center of An Enemy of the People, a bar descends from above during the pause between acts, with theatergoers filing onto the stage to be served shots of aquavit while musicians and singers perform traditional Norwegian songs. Several audience members stay seated around the periphery when the action resumes. The house lights also remain up, giving us no escape from our complicity as town physician Dr. Thomas Stockmann, played with bristling intensity by Jeremy Strong, is pilloried with ridicule that escalates into physical violence. Sam Gold’s crackling production up to that point has been deceptively traditional, handsomely staged in the round at the Circle in the Square, with a first act that sets the scene for festering conflict in the warmth and cozy domesticity of Stockmann’s home, lit by oil lamps and trafficked by a steady flow of drop-in dinner guests. Unlike some of Gold’s revivals that have staged classic texts in modern dress, the setting here remains a small town in late 19th century Norway. But the issues stirred up by Henrik Ibsen’s 1882 drama have queasy echoes in contemporary America. The heavily condensed adaptation is by Amy Herzog, who straddled the centuries last year in her bruising update of Ibsen’s A Doll’s House, which starred a transfixing Jessica Chastain in Jamie Lloyd’s knockout revival on Broadway. Herzog’s sharp dialogue is fluid and identifiably American in vernacular but not littered with anachronisms. Without ever hammering this play’s uncanny modern-day relevance, the new production deftly underscores the parallels of our current ugly political divide; the risks of being a whistleblower; distrust in science by people whose ignorance is manipulated by those in power; trial by public opinion; and a conflict between environmental and economic concerns, all of which will be familiar to 21st century American audiences. The drama follows Stockmann’s attempts to spread the word about dangerous bacterial contamination in the waters of a spa resort that is the town’s lifeblood. The plotline calls to mind everything from the 2016 water crisis in Flint, Michigan, to the COVID denialism that spread during the pandemic, even as the national death toll soared beyond one million. A laugh that’s both knowing and nervous ripples through the audience when the disillusioned Stockmann considers fleeing the country: “In America, we won’t have to worry about any of this.” Part of what keeps it interesting is the play’s refusal to let liberals off the hook for attitudes ranging from naivete to belligerent superiority. Strong’s Stockmann is a flawed man, as compelling for his intransigent arrogance as for his righteous indignation. Working together for the first time, husband and wife Gold and Herzog compress the original five-act structure into a tight two hours broken only by that boozy pause — shorter by half than the usual Broadway intermission. Some choices are not entirely beneficial to the play, such as the too-abrupt reversal of left-leaning young anti-authoritarian newspaper editor Hovstad (Caleb Eberhardt), who turns from an eager Stockmann supporter into a vehement detractor. But there are also smart changes like the removal of Stockmann’s wife, making her a composite character with his schoolteacher daughter, Petra (Victoria Pedretti), and giving the doctor the lingering sadness of a recently widowed man. Stockmann at first is both validated and alarmed when university lab reports come back confirming his suspicions that the spa, where he serves as resident physician, has been contaminated by industrial pollutants, the majority coming from a tannery owned by his crusty father-in-law, Morten Kiil (David Patrick Kelly). He has no trouble getting Hovstad and the latter’s quasi-radical colleague Billing (a very droll Matthew August Jeffers) on board to publish the findings in The People’s Messenger, a name that morphs from symbolic to bitterly ironic as the play unfolds. Hovstad has long been impatient for a changing of the guard, with the rich old men of the town council overdue to be nudged aside for new blood with more progressive ideas. He thinks the disaster of the resort and the investors’ cost-cutting plumbing will be enough to discredit them. Even the more conservative printer who bankrolls the publication, Aslaksen (Thomas Jay Ryan), is in Stockmann’s corner, promising to use his considerable influence to get the tradesmen and property owners associations behind him. But Aslaksen shows enough indications of being an ingratiating weasel that his about-face comes as no surprise. The person whose opposition Stockmann least expects is his brother Peter (Michael Imperioli), the town’s self-important mayor, which shows how little the two men understand each other. Hints of longtime sibling rivalry fuel Peter’s umbrage as he accuses Thomas of irresponsibility in threatening to go public with speculative findings that will bring exorbitant costs, closing the spa for three years or more and likely causing the town’s tourist-driven economy to crash. Thomas remains intractable in his conviction that the health of the population and the high risk of disease or death are of greater importance than any financial concern. But his supercilious brother works swiftly to undermine him. There’s no warmth in the siblings’ relationship, but at the same time, the willingness of Peter — played with icy composure and blithe insincerity by Imperioli in top form — to destroy Thomas is breathtaking. Denied an official outlet to publish his report, Thomas declares his intention to speak directly to the people at a town meeting. That assembly is an increasingly raucous affair, and anyone who has ever rankled at bureaucratic obstructionism will wince at the insidious efficiency of Peter and Aslaksen, working in tandem to keep Thomas from speaking. The scene is played as a grim crescendo, its outcome chilling. Through all this, Strong builds from calm certainty to febrile outrage; until numb resignation — and, later, an odd optimism for future vindication — sets in, he’s so tightly wound he makes his Succession character, Kendall Roy, look chill. The role of Thomas Stockmann feels tailor-made for the actor’s dangerous energy. But he’s no simplistic martyr in a post-truth world. Herzog has chosen to retain one of Ibsen’s thorniest speeches, a diatribe about social evolution in which Stockmann talks of the difference between mongrel dogs and pedigree breeds as an analogy for the uneducated masses and the elite intelligentsia. It’s a screed that veers into eugenics, suddenly showing the character in an unsympathetic light. The fact that he can never remember the name of the family’s housemaid, Randine (Katie Broad), also calls into question his regard for the servant class. Strong has never been an actor to shy away from an abrasive edge, but he maintains sufficient balance to keep us in Thomas’ corner. The startling image of his total physical submission after the brutality of the meeting also gives the character’s treatment by the townsfolk real pathos. If Herzog’s Chekhovian adjustments to the play’s ending feel less sure-footed, it still leaves us with a sick feeling of moral rot and the isolation of those who speak out against it in a corrupted society. While Gold’s revivals of the classics have tended to be less consistent than his incisive work on new plays — the ensembles of his King Lear and Hamlet both seemed at times to be all acting in different productions — his uniformly excellent cast here is very much on the same page, many of them doubling as singers and musicians in the scene transitions. In addition to Strong and Imperioli, standouts include Ryan, the epitome of slippery sanctimoniousness as Aslaksen; Kelly as mean-to-the-core old drunk Kiil; Eberhardt as the turncoat editor, whose opportunism costs him any romantic headway he had made with Petra; and Pedretti in the latter role, a young woman with as much spine as her father but perhaps more clear-sighted vision. Alan Trong also makes an impression as Captain Horster, a seafarer alone in his loyalty to Thomas’ family. Sets by the design collective known as “dots” make resourceful use of the staging in the round to guide us into a 19th century parlor and dining room or the offices of The People’s Messenger, with remarkably authentic-looking furnishings. (Scandinavian design fans will salivate over a handsome carved wooden rocking chair.) Isabella Byrd’s lighting and David Zinn’s finely detailed costumes evoke the period, while Gold audaciously jars us back into our contemporary world with his ingenious solution for the town meeting. What could have been a gimmick instead serves as a bridge between then and now. It’s far from the first time Ibsen — and this work in particular — has been dragged into the present, but it’s urgent and effective. Ultimately one of the key strengths of this bracing revival is that it presents a classic drama as a play for our time.
