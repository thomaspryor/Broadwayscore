All were successful in varying degrees, and two of them, \"The Lion King\" and \"Newsies,\" are still running. If money makes your world go round, that's an impressive track record. If, on the other hand, you're more interested in artistic quality, then you may take a dimmer view of Disney's continuing presence on Broadway. The best of the Disney shows, Julie Taymor's stage version of \"The Lion King,\" is a minor masterpiece of creative design, while the worst, \"Tarzan,\" was as forgettable as a bad novel written in invisible ink. \"Aladdin,\" which is based on the 1992 animated feature, falls roughly halfway between those two stools. It's not nearly as good as the movie, but it does have a terrific star, super-duper sets and sensational special effects.",

This suggests qualified interest rather than a clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges strong elements like the star and production design but ultimately suggests the show is not as good as the original movie, placing it between Disney's best and worst efforts. | Gemini: The review states that the show is not as good as the movie but has good elements, placing it in the mixed category. | Kimi: While the critic notes the show falls short of the film's artistic quality and lands in middle ground between Disney's best and worst, the enthusiastic praise for the lead performance, sets, and effects constitutes a recommendation to see it for its entertainment value.",
