The praise is qualified and the overall assessment suggests disappointment despite technical merits. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges strong elements like the star and production design but ultimately suggests the show is middling compared to the original movie, placing it between Disney's best and worst efforts. | Gemini: The review states that the show is not as good as the movie but praises the star, sets, and special effects, placing it in the mixed category. | Kimi: The critic positions the show as middle-of-the-road Disney ('halfway between' The Lion King and Tarzan), praising the spectacle and star performance while criticizing its inferiority to the source material and lack of artistic merit.
