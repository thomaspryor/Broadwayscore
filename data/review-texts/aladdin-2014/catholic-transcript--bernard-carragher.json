    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language with 'F-U-N' and 'treat for the eye and ear', but single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'F-U-N' and a 'treat for the eye and ear,' indicating a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper range of Positive. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses enthusiastic language like \"F-U-N\" and \"treat for the eye and ear\", indicating a positive recommendation. Given that it's a single excerpt, I've placed the score towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the show's craftsmanship and entertainment value, calling it 'F-U-N' and a 'treat for the eye and ear,' indicating a clear positive recommendation.",
