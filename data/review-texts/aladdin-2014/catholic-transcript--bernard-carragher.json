    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('F-U-N', 'treat for the eye and ear', 'craftily assembled') but only one excerpt available, so confidence is low. The enthusiasm suggests upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'F-U-N' and 'a treat for the eye and ear,' indicating a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses enthusiastic language like \"F-U-N\" and \"treat for the eye and ear,\" indicating a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic, unqualified praise describing the show as 'F-U-N' and 'craftily assembled,' warranting a score in the upper Positive range, though the single available excerpt limits certainty about the overall verdict.",
