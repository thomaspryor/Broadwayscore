However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses positive language like \"F-U-N\" and \"treat for the eye and ear,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given that it's a single excerpt, the score is placed in the middle of the positive range.",
