    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review emphasizes fun and describes the show as 'craftily assembled' and 'a treat,' indicating clear enjoyment and recommendation despite being a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the production as fun and visually and aurally pleasing, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. The use of 'F-U-N' and 'treat' indicates enthusiasm, warranting a score at the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"F-U-N\" and \"a treat,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket.",
