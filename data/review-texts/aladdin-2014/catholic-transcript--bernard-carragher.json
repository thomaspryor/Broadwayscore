    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic emphasizes fun and craftsmanship with enthusiasm (spelling out 'F-U-N'), calling it 'a treat for the eye and ear.' However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'F-U-N' and a 'treat for the eye and ear', indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is very positive, calling the show \"F-U-N\" and \"a treat for the eye and ear\". Given the single excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the production's craftsmanship and sensory appeal, describing it as 'F-U-N' and a 'treat for the eye and ear,' indicating a clear recommendation.",
