  "fullText": "If you're granted three wishes to make during Disney's \"Aladdin\" you'll definitely want to use one to discover how the musical's creative genies pull off the magic-carpet ride in the second act.\n\nThis fringed two-seat Persian hovercraft, er, rug, floats up, down and all over while carrying the street-smart urchin Aladdin (a likable Adam Jacobs) and his royal crush, Princess Jasmine (an equally likable Courtney Reed).\n\nThere are no visible wires or hydraulic gismos making that effect, whether the stage is bathed in starry darkness or full sunlight.\n\nThis supercool carpet sweeps some wow! (if not, WTF!) into this entertaining but emotionally sparse adaptation of Disney's 1992 cartoon that won Oscars for its score and the song \"A Whole New World.\"\n\nJames Monroe Iglehart is the wish-granting genie in “Aladdin.” ( Cylla von Tiedemann)\n\nBroadway's \"Aladdin\" hews closely to the animated movie, but expands on the family-friendly film. There are new characters, as well as fresh songs that blend neatly with familiar ones, including \"Diamond in the Rough,\" sung by evil Jafar (Jonathan Freeman, velvety and villainous) and sidekick Iago, a parrot-like guy personified by an aptly screechy Don Darryl Rivera.\n\nThe score is a mashup of music by Alan Menken, lyrics from the film by the late Howard Ashman and Tim Rice, plus additional verses by Chad Beguelin, who also wrote the script.\n\nDirected and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw (\"The Book of Mormon\"), the show is as colorful as the Crayola 64 box, and as tirelessly energetic as a toddler, but it also feels canned.\n\nWhile burning through wishes, you should ask for the musical to have a lot more heart. The absence is glaring, given that Disney excels at tugging at tickers and then making them melt. But this show seldom moves you. The title character's yearning ballad, \"Proud of Your Boy,\" sung to his long-gone mom, isn't enough to make this anything better than a Bedouin \"Beauty and the Beast\" — a cartoon on stage.\n\nCourtney Reed and Adam Jacobs star in “Aladdin” on Broadway. (Deen van Meer)\n\nIn lieu of soul, the show pours on the droll. Beguelin's breezy book cracks jokes about pyramid schemes and sassy Jasmine's disobedient feminist streak. The frisky, \"High Adventure,\" performed by Aladdin's three buddies who were cut from the film, is just goofy good fun.\n\nThe production's best special effect isn't the carpet, but the rollicking and endearingly over-the-top turn by James Monroe Iglehart (\"Memphis\"), who handles Robin Williams' role as the genie.\n\nWith nonstop joking, fist bumps, declarations of \"Oh snap!\" and nimble dance moves and smooth vocals, Iglehart shines with enough charisma to light a thousand and one nights.\n\nAnd that's how you would use up your last wish: that you bring half his magic and magnetism to whatever you do.",
