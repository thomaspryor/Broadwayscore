  "bwwExcerpt": ": Don't be fooled by the title of Disney's latest film-to-stage transfer. \"Aladdin\" may be named after its lead street urchin character, but the musical comedy that just opened at the New Amsterdam Theatre is all about one character: the Genie. That's due to the casting of the energetic James Monroe Iglehart, who all but erases the memory of Robin Williams, the voice of the Genie in the 1992 animated film. It's rare that you see an actor playing a character he was born to play in a career-defini",
