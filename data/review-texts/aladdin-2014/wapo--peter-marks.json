  "bwwExcerpt": ": \"Animated\" doesn't begin to describe the frantic, screwball version of Disney's \"Aladdin\" that opened Thursday night on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theatre, with a bushel of new songs and a Genie who works so hard you wouldn't be stunned to find him continuing to grant wishes at the stage door.
