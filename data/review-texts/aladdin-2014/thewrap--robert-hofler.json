  "fullText": "Back in the twentieth century, Walt Disney Pictures got it just right with its animated feature &#8220;Aladdin.&#8221; Its producers used only a few songs from Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (with help from lyricist Tim Rice), they kept the nearly nonexistent story down to a friendly 90 minutes, and hired Robin Williams to do the voice of the Genie, his surreal riffs nicely visualized by the animators.\n\nTwenty-two years later, Disney Theatricals brings &#8220;Aladdin&#8221; to Broadway, where it opened Thursday at the New Amsterdam Theater, and it pads the story with Menken/Ashman tunes that got cut from the movie, adds some characters and new songs, turns the Genie into a big show queen, and abracadabra! It&#8217;s a two-and-a-half hour show. Children would probably prefer 90 minutes; no doubt, adults will, too.\n\nAlthough the Genie (the literally breathlessly James Monroe Iglehart) kicks-off the show to introduce the story and characters with the big, brassy &#8220;Arabian Nights,&#8221; he then takes a long nap in his lantern before reappearing near the end of Act One to perform &#8220;Friend Like Me&#8221; and a quick medley of tunes from other Disney musicals. It&#8217;s only then that &#8220;Aladdin,&#8221; under the direction of Casey Nicholaw, reveals itself as a spoof of Broadway musicals &#8212; or is it Vegas shows? &#8212; not unlike the Nicholaw-helmed &#8220;A Drowsy Chaperone&#8221;and &#8220;Spamalot,&#8221; which he choreographed. Suffice to say, &#8220;Aladdin&#8221; bears no resemblance to Nicholaw&#8217;s previous laugh-filled Broadway effort, &#8220;The Book of Mormon.&#8221;\n\nAlso read: &#8216;Rocky&#8217; Theater Review: Sylvester Stallone&#8217;s Boxer Comes Out Swinging and Singing\n\nAnd neither does Chad Beguelin&#8217;s book, which is loaded with some clever &#8220;Sesame Street&#8221; word play but finds no magic whatsoever in a story rife with magic lanterns, carpets, genies and sultry Arabian nights. Will children get the humor in send-ups of old tap and soft-shoe numbers? Isn&#8217;t mocking stage traditions a rather cynical way to introduce children to the theater? The only stab at genuine romance and magic is the Menken/Rice song &#8220;A Whole New World,&#8221; which finds poor-boy Aladdin (Adam Jacobs) and bored Princess Jasmine (Courtney Reed) atop a carpet that actually appears to be flying around the stage without the help of wires or hydraulics.\n\nSee video: Jimmy Fallon Sang &#8216;Let It Go&#8217; From &#8216;Frozen&#8217; as Vladimir Putin\n\nJacobs and Reed offer big Broadway singing voices that eschew the homogenized crooning of their animated predecessors. But Aladdin&#8217;s cohorts Babkak (Brian Gonzalez), Omar (Jonathan Schwartz) and Kassim (Brandon O&#8217;Neill) are characters better left on the cutting-room floor along with their Menken/Ashman song &#8220;High Adventure,&#8221; not to mention their new Menken/Beguelin song &#8220;Somebody&#8217;s Got Your Back.&#8221;\n\nJasmine is another of those Disney princesses who, unlike ingénues of yesterday, turns out to be just as brash, aggressive and obnoxious as the men around her. It&#8217;s a curious conflict: trying to be feminist and yet telling stories that aggrandize royalty, the most repressive class-driven institution known to man.",
