Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show as 'big, busy, splashy' and delivering 'eye-popping spectacle,' suggesting a positive experience despite being 'a bit generic.' The single excerpt indicates a positive tone, but the text quality warning suggests caution. | Gemini: The review says the show \"delivers in terms of sheer eye-popping spectacle\" and is \"sure to run and run\", but also notes that it \"feels a bit generic.\" This suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, acknowledging the show feels generic but praising its visual spectacle and commercial potential, suggesting a mild recommendation tempered by the single-quote context.",
