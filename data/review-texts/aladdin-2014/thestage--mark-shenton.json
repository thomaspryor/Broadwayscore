    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified positive - acknowledges genericness but praises spectacle and predicts success. Low confidence due to single curated quote that may not represent full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the show's visual appeal and potential longevity, indicating a positive recommendation despite noting it feels 'a bit generic'. The single excerpt and text quality warning suggest a cautious approach, thus a low confidence level. | Gemini: The review states the show \"delivers in terms of sheer eye-popping spectacle\" and is \"sure to run and run\", but also notes that it \"feels a bit generic\". This suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
