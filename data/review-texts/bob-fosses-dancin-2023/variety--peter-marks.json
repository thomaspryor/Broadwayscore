    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises the production as 'slick' and 'stylish' but the key qualifier 'even if it doesn't quite capture the electric atmosphere of the original' indicates significant disappointment that prevents a positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review praises the revival as 'slick' and 'stylish,' indicating a positive impression, but notes it doesn't fully capture the original's atmosphere, suggesting some reservations. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, calling the revival a \"slick, stylish celebration.\" However, it notes that it \"doesn't quite capture the electric atmosphere of the original,\" indicating a reservation. Thus, it's a positive review with reservations. | Kimi: Marks clearly praises the production as 'slick' and 'stylish' while offering a single caveat about not matching the original's electricity. The overall tone recommends the show despite this reservation.",
