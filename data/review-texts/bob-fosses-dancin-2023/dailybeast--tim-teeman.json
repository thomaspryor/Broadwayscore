  "bwwExcerpt": "Dancin’ is mostly spectacular, until it suddenly isn’t—before ramping itself up again for the finale. An audience member behind me whooped through the first act and into the bravura first number of the second. And then their whoops hushed as the show dialed itself down. The difference in energy, not just on stage but in the theater, was stark; it was as if someone had stuck a pin in a balloon.",

This suggests a mixed experience overall. | Gemini: The review describes the show as having both spectacular and less impressive moments, indicating a mixed experience. The single excerpt and truncated nature of the text reduce confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt describes a stark contrast between a spectacular opening and a significant energy drop in the second act ('as if someone had stuck a pin in a balloon'), creating an inconsistent experience despite the strong finale recovery.",
