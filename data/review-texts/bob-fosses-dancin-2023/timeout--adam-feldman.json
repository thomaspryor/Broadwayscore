    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. Acknowledges excellent dancing but criticizes the show as feeling like a 'museum piece' rather than vital theater. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review. The praise for the dancers is countered by the criticism of the show feeling static and outdated. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the quality of the dancers but ultimately finds the show lacking in vitality, suggesting a mixed experience. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60 rating confirms a Mixed classification. The review acknowledges excellent dancers (positive element) but delivers a damning structural critique (museum piece, not living theater). The 'but' construction emphasizes the negative outweighs the positive, placing this in the lower Mixed range.",
