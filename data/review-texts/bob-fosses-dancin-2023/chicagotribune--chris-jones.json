With only a truncated excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may be cut off. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'fascinating' but also 'deeply conflicted,' indicating a mixed review. The lack of a full review or clear rating lowers confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt calls the revival \"fascinating, if deeply conflicted.\" This suggests a mixed reaction, leaning towards the positive due to the \"fascinating\" descriptor. However, the lack of a clear recommendation and the \"deeply conflicted\" aspect place it in the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise ('fascinating') alongside significant criticism ('deeply conflicted'), suggesting a mixed reception.
