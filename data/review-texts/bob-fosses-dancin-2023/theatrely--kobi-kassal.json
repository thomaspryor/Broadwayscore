  "bwwExcerpt": "What I admire about this production is that it knows exactly what it is. A monologue at the top of the show states, 'the viewing of too many musical comedies with sentimental and over romantic plots may cause serious and sometimes incurable damage to the playgoer and the critics’ standards. Therefore, what you are about to see is an almost plotless musical.' And boy, do they deliver on that promise.",
