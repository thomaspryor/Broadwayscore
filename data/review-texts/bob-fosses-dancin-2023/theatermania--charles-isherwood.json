However, the text is brief and lacks detailed evaluation, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review praises the show as a celebration of movement and highlights Fosse's distinctive style, indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: Brief excerpt offers unqualified praise for the choreography and production quality, positioning it as a worthy celebration of Fosse's legacy without the extreme superlatives of a rave.",
