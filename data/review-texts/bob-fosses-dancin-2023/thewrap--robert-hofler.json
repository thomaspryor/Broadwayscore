  "fullText": "Memory doesn’t serve me well in reviewing “Bob Fosse’s Dancin’,” which opened Sunday at the Music Box on Broadway. I saw the original show, simply titled “Dancin’,” and remember very little about it. Oddly enough, I do remember the date I saw the show, because it was the first preview (March 28, 1978), and some people at the Shubert Organization had decided to give the Broadhurst Theatre a little makeover.",

There's no evaluation of the current show's quality.; kimi: The text contains only biographical context about the critic's memory of the original 1978 production and mentions the current opening date, but provides no evaluation of the current Broadway production's quality, performances, or overall merit.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "I don’t recall how Fosse ended his 'Dancin’.' Cilento ends his with a real flourish. He gives each of his nearly two dozen dancers the full-star treatment, complete with his, her or their name emblazoned (lighting by David Grill) in tall letters on the upstage wall. Cilento, who appeared in the original company of 'A Chorus Line,' presents the anti-'Chorus Line' with this extended curtain call. These quick solo turns feature some of the evening’s best choreography. Here and elsewhere in the show",

However, the text appears truncated and the critic's memory limitations about the original add uncertainty to the overall assessment. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, highlighting the choreography and the dancers. The critic praises the ending and the way Cilento gives each dancer the \"full-star treatment.\" | Kimi: The excerpt offers specific praise for the production's staging ('real flourish') and choreography, but the text appears truncated before a final verdict is delivered, limiting certainty about the overall recommendation strength.",
