    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Text is clearly appreciative, praising how the revival 'reminds us of the breadth of Fosse's talent' and emphasizing the show 'brims with joy.' However, confidence is low due to truncated text and single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the joy and energy of the production, praising the choreography and overall experience. Given the single excerpt warning, the positive tone suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the joy and energy of the production, highlighting Fosse's talent and the dancers' performance. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt enthusiastically praises the production's preservation of Fosse's choreography while emphasizing the 'joy' that 'brims' from the dancers' energy and lively staging, indicating a strong recommendation despite the truncated text.",
