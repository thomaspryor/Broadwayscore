    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Acknowledges the show celebrates Fosse's work but criticizes it as static and lifeless rather than theatrically vital. Clear mixed assessment. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the show lacks vitality and feels static, indicating a negative evaluation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the celebration of Fosse's choreography but compares it to a museum exhibit, indicating a lack of vitality and life. This suggests a mixed or neutral assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging the show's technical celebration of Fosse's work, the critic's verdict emphasizes that it fails to be 'living, breathing' theater, comparing it unfavorably to a static museum exhibit. The 'but' signals that the negative assessment outweighs the positive observation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
