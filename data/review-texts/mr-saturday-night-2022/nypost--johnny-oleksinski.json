  "bwwExcerpt": "There's one thing to kvetch about with \"Mr. Saturday Night\": it would be better as a straight play than a song-and-dance show. Jason Robert Brown has composed a bland point-A-to-point-B score that's not as hilarious or textured as the text. Similar to \"Tootsie\" before it, the star here is the scenes, not the tunes.",
