    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic describes the play as feeling like a 'rough draft' rather than a 'finished work' and criticizes fundamental elements like character development and plot resolution. This indicates a clear negative assessment despite being only an excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the play as unfinished and characterizes it as having unresolved conflicts, indicating a negative assessment. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the play feels unfinished and the characters are opaque, suggesting a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous criticism of the play's writing, describing it as an unfinished rough draft with opaque characters and contrived resolutions, indicating a fundamentally flawed production with no redeeming qualities mentioned.",
