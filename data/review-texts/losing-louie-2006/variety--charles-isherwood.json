    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic finds the show 'overly familiar and schematic' despite praising performances. This suggests significant structural flaws that outweigh the acting positives. Single excerpt warning requires caution - the negative framing may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, noting the play's familiarity and schematic nature, but also acknowledging some positive performances. The single excerpt warning and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the play is \"overly familiar and schematic\" but has \"some winning performances,\" suggesting a mixed assessment. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the play as 'overly familiar and schematic' while acknowledging 'winning performances,' but the contrast word 'despite' indicates the acting doesn't overcome the script's formulaic nature. With only one excerpt available, the verdict remains uncertain but leans mixed.",
