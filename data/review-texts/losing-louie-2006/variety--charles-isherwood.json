    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows fundamental criticism of the material as 'overly familiar and schematic' while acknowledging 'winning performances.' The structure suggests overall disappointment despite positive elements. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a mixed review, highlighting the play's familiarity and schematic nature while acknowledging some positive aspects in the performances. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review notes that the show feels \"overly familiar and schematic\" but acknowledges \"some winning performances,\" indicating a mixed assessment. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic finds the play itself 'overly familiar and schematic' (clear criticisms) while acknowledging 'winning performances' as the only redeeming quality. This follows the classic pattern of performer-praise-not-redeeming-pan, indicating a recommendation against seeing the show.",
