  "bwwExcerpt": "Toby Jones is at the heart of it as Vanya, a sour, bitter, tragic version of PG Wodehouse's Lord Emsworth, stuck not so much in his country house as in a mind that is filled with regrets. Jones uses all of his charisma to create a sense of empathy with the audience - in less skilful hands, we might turn against his solipsistic victimhood and consider the peasants outside, whose lot was somewhat less comfortable. But we don't - Vanya does deserve more, his bad choices bad, but the price paid so,",

However, with only one curated excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | Gemini: The review focuses on a positive performance, but the overall recommendation is somewhat tempered due to the limited excerpt available. The phrase 'Vanya does deserve more' suggests a positive leaning.",
