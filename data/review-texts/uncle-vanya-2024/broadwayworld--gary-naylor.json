  "bwwExcerpt": "Toby Jones is at the heart of it as Vanya, a sour, bitter, tragic version of PG Wodehouse's Lord Emsworth, stuck not so much in his country house as in a mind that is filled with regrets. Jones uses all of his charisma to create a sense of empathy with the audience - in less skilful hands, we might turn against his solipsistic victimhood and consider the peasants outside, whose lot was somewhat less comfortable. But we don't - Vanya does deserve more, his bad choices bad, but the price paid so,",

Despite the warning about text quality, the tone is clearly appreciative of the actor's skill, indicating a recommendation. | Gemini: The review focuses on Toby Jones's performance and its ability to create empathy, suggesting a positive experience despite the character's flaws. The limited text makes it difficult to assess the overall recommendation strength, but the positive portrayal of Jones's performance leans towards a strong positive.",
