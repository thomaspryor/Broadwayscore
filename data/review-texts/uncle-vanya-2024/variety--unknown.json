    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt explicitly calls the production 'brilliant' and praises the entire cast, indicating clear appreciation. However, with only one curated quote available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range as this may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the play's brilliance and the performances, suggesting a strong recommendation. The use of 'brilliance' indicates a high level of enthusiasm, placing it in the Rave bucket. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The excerpt highlights the 'brilliance' of the play, suggesting a positive assessment. However, due to the limited text and single excerpt, a more conservative score within the 'Positive' bucket is appropriate.",
