  "fullText": "Heidi Schreck pens a comedy-bolstered but disorienting translation of Chekhov’s seminal play.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Broadway News’ Broadway Review by Brittani Samuel — our overview of reactions, recommendations and information tied to last night’s Broadway opening of “Uncle Vanya.”\n\nLincoln Center Theater’s current Broadway revival was my first time meeting “Uncle Vanya.” I suspect there will be many Vanya virgins like me drawn to this production’s familiar and diverse ensemble of theater, film and TV stalwarts — Alfred Molina, Anika Noni Rose, Steve Carell to name a few. The diverse accreditation only matters for its impact on placing Heidi Schreck’s adaptation of the work in a sense of time and place. We are still on a sweeping estate with a disparate gang of hapless characters — farm worker Vanya (Carell), his niece Sonia (Alison Pill), his love interest Yelena (Rose) and the rest.\n\nAlready have an account?\n              Log in",
