However, due to the single excerpt and lack of a full review, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The phrase \"very punchy revival\" suggests a positive assessment, but the lack of further context and the single excerpt warning necessitate a score in the lower end of the positive range.",
