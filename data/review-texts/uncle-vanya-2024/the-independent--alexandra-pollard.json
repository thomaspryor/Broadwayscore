  "bwwExcerpt": "Most of the men in Uncle Vanya have wasted their potential, and most of the women are chafing at the bit for more satisfying lives. \"You had the good fortune to be born a man with agency,\" says Vanya's mother Mariya (Dearbhla Molloy). \"What I wouldn't have done with that agency.\" Every single player here evokes their character's ennui terrifically - but it is so dimly lit, the staging so staid, the pace so unhurried, that the ennui is catching.",
