  "fullText": "Heidi Schreck pens a comedy-bolstered but disorienting translation of Chekhov’s seminal play. Good morning, and welcome to Broadway News’ Broadway Review by Brittani Samuel — our overview of reactions, recommendations and information tied to last night’s Broadway opening of “Uncle Vanya.” Lincoln Center Theater’s current Broadway revival was my first time meeting “Uncle Vanya.” I suspect there will be many Vanya virgins like me drawn to this production’s familiar and diverse ensemble of theater, film and TV stalwarts — Alfred Molina, Anika Noni Rose, Steve Carell to name a few. The diverse accreditation only matters for its impact on placing Heidi Schreck’s adaptation of the work in a sense of time and place. We are still on a sweeping estate with a disparate gang of hapless characters — farm worker Vanya (Carell), his niece Sonia (Alison Pill), his love interest Yelena (Rose) and the rest.

  "dtliExcerpt": "One can see why top-caliber actors would flock to revel in this flurry of familial relationships, hormonal hangering and endless suffering, but I’m still not convinced audiences need to. Or at least not yet. This “Uncle Vanya” still seems to be finding its footing.",
