  "dtliExcerpt": "Still, the new Lincoln Center production from the typically reliable director Lila Neugebauer is so disconnected and alienating that, frankly, I spent most of the production wondering how on earth such a collection of famous, talented actors — Steve Carell, Alfred Molina, Anika Noni Rose, Jayne Houdyshell, Alison Pill, for goodness sake— had so failed to cohere.
