    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The language is positive but measured - 'competent' and 'rarely boring' suggest adequacy rather than excellence, while 'often funny' is a clear positive. Single excerpt warning requires conservative scoring within positive range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt suggests a generally positive experience, noting the production is 'competent' and 'often funny', which indicates a recommendation. However, the lack of a full review and the mention of 'rarely boring' suggest some reservations. | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"competent\" and \"funny,\" suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. The phrase \"rarely boring\" implies some reservations.",
