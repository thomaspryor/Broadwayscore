FranklinNew York\n\nThe Vivian Beaumont stage isn’t exactly the proverbial postage stamp.

This points to a negative assessment, though the single excerpt limits the ability to gauge the full sentiment. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a lack of cohesion in key elements of the production, suggesting a negative overall assessment.",
