  "bwwExcerpt": "To paraphrase Moss Hart, it's a brave writer who would contrive this show: Japes Lapine's adaptation of Act One, playwright-director Hart's best-selling 1959 autobiography that's become an object of inspiration/adoration for anyone seeking a career in front of-or behind-the footlights. (Ask any actor, playwright, director, or designer you know if they've read Act One. If they haven't, give them a copy.) And it's fitting that Lapine would be the one to transfer this ultimate showbiz story from page to the Lincoln Theater Center's Broadway stage. Like Hart, Lapine is both a playwright-he penned the libretti forFalsettos and Stephen Sondheim's Sunday in the Park With George, Into the Woods, and Passion-and director, helming a variety of shows from those musicals to a revival of The Diary of Anne Frank.",
