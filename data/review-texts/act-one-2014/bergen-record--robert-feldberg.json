  "bwwExcerpt": "Moss Hart's autobiography 'Act One' was big news in 1959. But are people interested in a man whose fame on Broadway happened well over a half-century ago? If they're not, it's hard to see what they'll find to savor - other than a delightful performance by Tony Shalhoub - in James Lapine's stage adaptation of the book, which opened Thursday night at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic questions the show's relevance and appeal to modern audiences, suggesting little to recommend except one performance. However, this is only one excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the show may not appeal to those uninterested in the historical subject, with the only highlight being Tony Shalhoub's performance. This indicates a negative overall impression, despite some praise for an individual performance. | Gemini: The review questions the show's appeal beyond Shalhoub's performance, suggesting it may not resonate with everyone. This indicates a mixed recommendation. | Kimi: The critic suggests that beyond Shalhoub's performance, the show offers little of interest to audiences not already invested in Moss Hart's legacy. This qualifies as a negative recommendation despite the single positive note.",
