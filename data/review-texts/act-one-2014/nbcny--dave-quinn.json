  "bwwExcerpt": "Audiences unfamiliar with Moss Hart's legacy may have a hard time understanding his importance after watching James Lapine's flat adaptation of 'Act One' that just opened at Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater. Instead of an inspiring account of talent and tenacity, Lapine's 'Act One' is a bland story that fails to put Hart's life into perspective...Lapine, who both wrote and directed 'Act One,' constructs the story of the show in a linear fashion, narrated by an older version of Hart (Tony Shalhoub, 'Golden Boy,' in one of three roles he plays) and a twentysomething version of Hart (Santino Fontana, 'Cinderella'). The problem with that device is that our narrators often tell us more about our character's emotions than we get to see and feel.",
