  "bwwExcerpt": "So much love and care and ambition have been poured into 'Act One,' playwright/director James Lapine's sprawling stage adaptation of playwright/director Moss Hart's celebrated 1959 memoir. But as the Lincoln Center Theater's in-house magazine reminds us, Hart himself wrote, 'Playwrighting is not a gentle or sentimental profession, nor, may I add, is any part or portion of the theater.' Putting gentleness aside, one therefore must report that this play about the theater has a dazzling theatrical set but a dispiriting lack of drama. Autobiographical peaks and valleys that read with such charm and intensity in Hart's words are translated here into almost three hours of busy, flatline narrative.",
