  "wrongFullText": "The theatrical experience is based on Hilary Mantel’s Man Booker Prize-winning novels ”Wolf Hall” and ”Bring Up the Bodies”.\n\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company’s Wolf Hall: Parts 1 & 2 will officially transfer to Broadway in spring 2015, confirming recent rumors to that effect. The theatrical event is slated to arrive at Broadway Winter Garden Theatre on March 20.\n\nDirected by Jeremy Herrin and adapted for the stage by Mike Poulton, Wolf Hall: Parts 1 & 2 originated at the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon and transferred to the West End's Aldwych Theatre in May. The West End run concluded on September 6.\n\nThe two plays are adapted by Mike Poulton from Hilary Mantel’s Man Booker Prize-winning novels Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies. Set in the 1500s, the plays tell the story of Thomas Cromwell and his rise to power to become the right-hand man of Henry VIII, as well as Cromwell's interactions with Anne Boleyn.\n\nThe production features a company of more than 20 actors, headed by Ben Miles as Thomas Cromwell, Lydia Leonard as Anne Boleyn, and Nathaniel Parker as King Henry VIII — all of whom appeared in the West End company.\n\nThe production will also feature scenic and costume design by Christopher Oram, lighting design by Paule Constable (Part 1) and David Plater (Part 2), sound design by Nick Powell, and music by Stephen Warbeck.\n\nWill Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre House a Pair of Historical Dramas Next? \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Tagged in this Story\n \n\n \n \n \n Aldwych Theatre\n \n \n \n \n Anne Boleyn\n \n \n \n \n Ben Miles\n \n \n \n \n Henry VIII\n \n \n \n \n Lydia Leonard\n \n \n \n \n Man Booker Prize\n \n \n \n \n Mike Poulton\n \n \n \n \n Royal Shakespeare Company\n \n \n \n \n Wolf Hall\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n Latest Reviews\n \n \n See all\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: Jason Alexander Leaves a Little Gristle in New Production of Sweeney Todd \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: Manon!, Opera’s Have-It-All Girl \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: In The Porch on Windy Hill, Bluegrass Heals a Broken Family \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: Power Slips Away, One Lear at a Time, in King Lear at La MaMa \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: Blackout Songs, When Your Life Is One Long Night Out \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Review: Stories of Childhood Told Through Dance in BLACK GIRL: Linguistic Play \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Theater News & discounts\n \n Get the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania's newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre."
