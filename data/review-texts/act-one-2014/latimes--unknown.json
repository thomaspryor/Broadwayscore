  "bwwExcerpt": "But there's a fundamental problem in bringing 'Act One' to the stage: The episodic story isn't structured as a drama. There's tension but little suspense. Anyone who knows the vaguest thing about Hart will know that he became one of the 20th century's major Broadway figures...on stage this roller coaster journey, unable to induce butterflies of excitement, seems unduly repetitive. The book hasn't been distilled into a workable dramatic form...But there are rewards to the production. Three actors play Moss Hart: Matthew Schechter is young Hart, Tony Shalhoub is the older Hart looking back, and Santino Fontana is the anxious, eager-beaver acolyte Hart determined to conquer the Great White Way. All three are terrific, but Shalhoub, who also plays Hart's father as well as a highly neurotic George S. Kaufman (who has some of the same compulsive tendencies as Shalhoub's TV character Monk) is outstanding.",
