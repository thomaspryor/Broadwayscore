  "bwwExcerpt": "The result is a thrillingly well-staged play that runs for two hours and 40 minutes but feels much shorter. Not only is 'Act One' light on its theatrical feet, but it has the open-hearted impact of a melodrama -- one that has the advantage of being true. Part of what makes 'Act One' so potent is that Mr. Lapine disdains all irony in describing Mr. Hart's rise to fame. His was an old-fashioned American-dream-come-true tale, and it doesn't embarrass Mr. Lapine in the least to dish it up on a pageantlike scale reminiscent of the spectacular stage version of 'Nicholas Nickleby.'",
