    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic identifies fundamental flaws - the show fails to reveal what made its subject special and lacks basic theatrical elements like story structure and snappy dialogue. However, this is only one excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt criticizes the show for lacking essential elements that would make it special, indicating a negative assessment. The mention of missing key aspects suggests disappointment. | Gemini: The review points out a significant flaw in the show, indicating it's missing a crucial element, but doesn't outright condemn it. The truncated nature and single excerpt make it difficult to assess the overall sentiment fully, leading to a 'low' confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt identifies fundamental narrative flaws, stating the play fails to reveal what made its subject special, suggesting a disappointing production that misses its basic premise.",
