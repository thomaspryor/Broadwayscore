    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating directly indicates Mixed territory. Review acknowledges positive elements (affectionate tribute, captures wit) but has significant reservations about theatrical realization. | GPT-4o: The review describes the play as 'affectionate, if uneven' and notes it sometimes feels more like a 'dramatized biography'. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review is mixed, acknowledging the play's strengths (capturing Hart's wit and ambition) but also noting its unevenness and feeling like a dramatized biography rather than a fully realized theatrical experience. The original rating of 60 aligns with the mixed bucket. | Kimi: The review acknowledges the show's merits ('affectionate,' 'captures wit') but levels significant criticism ('uneven,' 'not fully realized'), matching the critic's own 60 rating that indicates a middle-ground assessment neither enthusiastic nor dismissive.",
