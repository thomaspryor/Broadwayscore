However, with only one curated excerpt available, the full verdict may not be represented. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the impressive set design and Shalhoub's performance as key strengths, suggesting a positive view. However, the limited excerpt and lack of overall verdict make the confidence low. | Gemini: The review highlights the impressive set design and Shalhoub's performance, but the overall tone is mildly positive due to the limited excerpt available. | Kimi: Single excerpt praises Tony Shalhoub's performance as one of the 'greatest pleasures' and admires the elaborate revolving set design, indicating a clear recommendation despite limited context.",
