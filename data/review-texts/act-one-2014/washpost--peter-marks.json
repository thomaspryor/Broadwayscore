  "bwwExcerpt": "As 'Act One' would have it, no love is quite so intense and tempestuous as that between a playwright and his play. In fact, in the endearing new stage adaptation of Moss Hart's memoir--long a theater world bible--any other affection revealed over the course of two and three-quarter hours in the Vivian Beaumont Theater is a pallid affair compared to the fervor of the dramatist savoring and agonizing over the reactions to his first Broadway play...And though Lapine's overlong script could use some editing, and some of the myriad supporting performances feel under-realized, his 'Act One,' which opened Thursday night, remains a warm and stimulating summation of the romance of the theater and the satisfactions of pleasing an audience.",
