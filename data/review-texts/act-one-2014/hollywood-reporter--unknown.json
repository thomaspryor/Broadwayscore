  "bwwExcerpt": "...it's problematic in a work fundamentally about the magic of the theater that all the magic is confined to the design department. Condensing into play form Moss Hart's 1959 autobiography -- a peach among American theater memoirs -- was probably an impossible task. However, that doesn't soften the arduousness of sitting through writer-director James Lapine's botched attempt at it...Fontana...as always, has an appealing stage presence, but his characterization is entirely generic -- a driven, likable young man whose commitment to succeed strengthens with each acrid taste of failure. While the multitasking Shalhoub is given little to do as the older Moss and his father, he mines welcome humor out of his portrayal of the fastidious, soft-spoken George, even if too much of the performance is about the celebrated playwright's OCD neuroses. The closest Lapine comes to finding some heart in the material is in the gradual bonding of these two -- the wide-eyed novice and the world-weary Broadway eminence.",
