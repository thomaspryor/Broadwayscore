  "bwwExcerpt": "'On Your Feet!' is uneven and occasionally long-winded. It's also sometimes inspiring and uplifting. The two lead performers, Ana Villafañe and Josh Segarra, are charismatic, in different ways. Numerous jukebox musical tropes are at work in 'On Your Feet!'...What the musical does best, though, is illustrate the sacrifices it took for the Estefans to succeed...Villafañe, also a Cuban immigrant from Miami, looks and sounds like Estefan...As Grammy-winning producer Emilio Estefan, Segarra ('Lysistrata Jones') sings in a subdued way. His acting is more engaging, and his entrance, in a pair of only-in-Miami shorts, is charming. Dinelaris's book does some unnecessary pandering...'On Your Feet!' isn't quite 'Jersey Boys,' but in places, the rhythm is gonna get you.",
