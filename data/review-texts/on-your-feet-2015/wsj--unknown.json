  "bwwExcerpt": "Broadway's latest greatest-hits album, 'On Your Feet!: The Story of Emilio and Gloria Estefan,' is what the subtitle promises...Alexander Dinelaris's book is heavy on the Hollywoodian clichés, but it has its charming moments, too, and every other aspect of the production, directed by Jerry Mitchell, is slick and satisfying, starting with the smoking-hot choreography of Sergio Trujillo and the tear-it-up onstage band. Not only does Broadway debutante Ana Villafañe look, sing and dance like Ms. Estefan, but she acts well enough to make me want to see her in more challenging fare. Yes, I know, it's just a jukebox musical, but I liked 'On Your Feet!' In fact, I liked it a lot -- and I think you might, too.",
