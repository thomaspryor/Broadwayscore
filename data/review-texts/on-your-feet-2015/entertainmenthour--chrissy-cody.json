  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Director Jerry Mitchell deftly helmed the production, keeping with the bright colors and sequins grounded with the heart-warming aspect of the importance of family. The audience was with the story every step of the way. Every laugh landed, lines got applause in the middle of the show, and there was plenty of cheering throughout...a bombastic, feel-good story with an amazing cast and fantastic music pulling everyone along for the ride. Do not miss out!\"\n\nRead more",
