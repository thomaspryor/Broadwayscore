  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"An engaging jukebox musical that depends heavily on the music of the Estefans and the Miami Sound Machine to tell the story of the iconic couple. The musical highlights several important themes and raises a considerable collection of rich and enduring questions...Under Jerry Mitchell’s able direction, the cast is uniformly brilliant…'On Your Feet!' will be around for some time. Enjoy the music and the story and be inspired.\"\n\nRead more",
