  "bwwExcerpt": "Miserable affairs, angsty German teens and sad-sack British royals - in shows like 'Thérèse Raquin,' 'Spring Awakening' and 'King Charles III' - have made the season a dour one. Even the blockbuster 'Hamilton' ends on a melancholy note. So it's a pleasure to welcome 'On Your Feet!,' the rare show that earns its exclamation mark. Inspired by the life and music of Gloria and Emilio Estefan, it literally gets the audience off its seats and into a conga line.",
