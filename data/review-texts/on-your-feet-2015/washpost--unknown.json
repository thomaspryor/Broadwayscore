  "bwwExcerpt": "'On Your Feet!,' which had its official opening Thursday night, now takes its place in the upper echelons of the jukebox genre, a club that already admitted the Tony-winning 'Jersey Boys' and the more recent Broadway hit 'Beautiful: The Carole King Musical.' None of these qualify as great art, although they make for polished commercial properties: the breakthrough of 'Jersey Boys' was in demonstrating how a clever narrative mitigates some of the form's rampant cliches. Like these earlier entries, 'On Your Feet!' is a vehicle for delivery of a vibrant songbook and yet another version of that familiar American music-business story - the rise from humble origins of an artist of extraordinary gifts, who faces formidable personal challenges but by dint of will and talent emerges triumphant.",
