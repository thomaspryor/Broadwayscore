    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show is 'crowd-pleasing' but criticizes the 'mechanical book' and explicitly states it 'falls somewhere in the middle' - classic mixed review language with no clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The review describes the musical as 'half-formulaic, half-original' and 'crowd-pleasing' but criticizes the book as 'mechanical'. The overall tone suggests a mixed reception, with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges fresh elements but also notes a mechanical book and formulaic aspects, placing it in the mixed category. The truncated text and single excerpt lower the confidence. | Kimi: While the excerpt acknowledges the show is 'undeniably crowd-pleasing' with 'fresh' flavor, the critic's final assessment places it 'somewhere in the middle' of the jukebox musical genre, citing a 'mechanical book' as a significant flaw.",
