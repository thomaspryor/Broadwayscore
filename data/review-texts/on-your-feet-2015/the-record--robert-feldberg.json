  "bwwExcerpt": "Despite its unenthralling dramatics, the show does have an underlying warmth, in showing the closeness and caring of a family across generations, and also a sympathetic, good-natured marital relationship. Its chief assets, though, are those musical routines, which, in addition to 'Conga,' include 'Get on Your Feet,' 'Rhythm Is Gonna Get You' and many other energized numbers, as well as several sweet ballads used as character songs. 'On Your Feet!' is not going to revolutionize Broadway, but, alongside a bland story, it does offer some musical fireworks.",
