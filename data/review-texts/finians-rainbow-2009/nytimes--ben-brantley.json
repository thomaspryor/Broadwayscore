  "fullText": "Finian’s Rainbow From left, Christopher Borger, Cheyenne Jackson, Kate Baldwin, Paige Simunovich and Jim Norton in this revival at the St. James Theater.\n\nLeaves are decaying in soggy piles in the city’s parks, and the first cold snap has come and gone, awakening anxiety about the prospect of a chilly winter. But permanent sunshine can confidently be predicted for the vicinity of the St. James Theater, where the joyous revival of “Finian’s Rainbow” opened on Thursday night.\n\nHere is where you should head this fall to warm your soul amid the diversions of that ever-great and ever-endangered American art form, musical comedy. All the comforting pleasures of the genre  infectious song, exuberant dancing, jokes both lovably corny and unexpectedly fresh, and of course the satisfying pairing of a him and a her  are on abundant display in this thoroughly winning production, a welcome picker-upper in an uneven Broadway season.\n\nThe latest transfer from the beloved City Center Encores! series of musicals in concert, “Finian’s Rainbow” is also the most unlikely. Pretty much nobody expected to see this oddity cavorting beneath a Broadway proscenium again, although the original production was a solid hit that ran for a year and a half when it opened in 1947. Since then the show has come to be considered too corny, too confused, too tainted by misconceptions about its racial politics.\n\nConsider, if you will, the recipe, seemingly cooked up by somebody hitting the whiskey bottle a little too hard. Among the primary cast of characters: one leprechaun, one mute young woman who dances her dialogue, one racist politician who turns from white to black and back again. Locale: Missitucky, a fictional state in the American South where black and white sharecroppers live together in friendly harmony, harvesting tobacco leaves when they are not raising their voices in song. Primary plot device: a purloined pot of gold bestowing the ability to make wishes come true.\n\nBut beautiful music has a way of binding together the most unlikely materials, and the score for “Finian’s Rainbow,” by the lyricist E. Y. Harburg and the composer Burton Lane, is itself an overflowing pot of memorable songs, by turns yearning and bouncy, mocking and sincere, soft as a rose petal and clever as a crossword.\n\nUnder the nimble direction of Warren Carlyle, who also supplies the buoyant choreography, this bounteous score is being sung with lively conviction by a cast of Broadway regulars and veterans, and one confident newcomer. The morning after seeing “Finian’s Rainbow,” you may well find yourself shaking your head at the absurdities of the book by Mr. Harburg and Fred Saidy, a tipsy jumble of romance, fantasy and satire. (Topics of surprising renewed relevance: the seductions of living on easy credit, the perils of foreclosure, the “misbegotten G.O.P.”) But you will remember, above all, the soaring lift of the music.\n\nTo call Kate Baldwin a newcomer is perhaps an overstatement. Ms. Baldwin has appeared on Broadway before and has a solid list of regional and Off Broadway credits. But never has she made the bewitching impression she does here. The show’s first moment of magic arrives shortly after Ms. Baldwin’s Sharon McLonergan descends the green hills of Missitucky with her enterprising father, the rainbow-chaser of the title, played by the reliably delightful Jim Norton (a Tony winner for “The Seafarer”).\n\nFinian has noted the resemblance to their Irish hometown, where the skylarks sing the same tunes. Sharon senses it too. Feeling a twinge of homesickness, she pauses to sing one of the score’s most famous numbers, “How Are Things in Glocca Morra?” Ms. Baldwin’s cool, pure soprano gently rides the crests of the undulant melody, tugging at each question in the lyric with a sensitivity that perfectly expresses the song’s tender, yearning essence.\n\nThe tune is folk-simple, the words drenched in stock ideas of Irishness, but as performed with both sophistication and sincerity by Ms. Baldwin, it has the distilled beauty of an art song. The crinkling blue eyes of Mr. Norton’s Finian, the classic sentimental Irishman, are soon misted over with longing, but he may not be the only one in the house in need of a handkerchief.\n\nSuch magic occurs whenever Ms. Baldwin has a chance to sing; happily, this is often. She is well paired with the easygoing charmer Cheyenne Jackson as the local boy Woody, who is snared almost as soon as he sets eyes on Sharon  or as soon as Finian sets eyes on this promising prospect for his daughter. Their gleaming voices blend smoothly on the show’s other well-known song, “Old Devil Moon,” a softly swinging duet about the strange magic that turns the boy or girl next door into an object of celestial attraction.\n\nThe notion is reprised in a more impish spirit in “Something Sort of Grandish,” Sharon’s tongue-twisting duet with her other admirer, a leprechaun-on-the-lam named Og, played with zesty, bug-eyed brio by the talented comic actor Christopher Fitzgerald. Og is also drawn to Woody’s sister, Susan (Alina Faye), the aforementioned dancing mute. Ms. Faye performs Mr. Carlyle’s choreography, which deftly blends the brisk rhythms of Irish step dancing with the vocabulary of classical ballet, with a clean, bright attack.\n\nRoom for Debate asks whether shorefront homeowners should have to open their land to all comers.\n\nNew York City's top public schools must become more diverse.",
