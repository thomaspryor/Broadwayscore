However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation, suggesting the show offers an uplifting experience. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed towards the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses a positive sentiment, suggesting the show is enjoyable and escapist. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic praises the production's success in transporting the audience and providing temporary relief from worries, indicating a clearly positive if slightly qualified recommendation.",
