I am delighted to report that this latter art is being practiced in altitudinous-high style...Scott Ellis’s ripping, lavishly appointed revival of this 1978 musical about dueling giant egos knows that when it comes to being hyperbolic, there’s no people like show people...sit back, relax and savor the blissfully bumpy ride in luxury accommodations.\"\n\nRead more",

The critic is clearly delighted and recommends savoring the experience. Single excerpt warning applies, but the enthusiasm level suggests upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly enthusiastic language, praising the revival as 'ripping' and 'lavishly appointed' with a sense of delight. The tone suggests a strong recommendation, despite the limited context. | Gemini: The review uses enthusiastic language like \"altitudinous-high style\" and \"blissfully bumpy ride,\" indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt features effusive praise including 'over-the-moon acting,' 'ripping,' and 'lavishly appointed,' indicating a highly positive response. However, as only a single curated excerpt is available, confidence is reduced per scoring guidelines.",
