  "bwwExcerpt": "..how I wish I could say that Florian Zeller's play lived up to the depths of its worthy ambition - much less to Langella's silken heartbreak of a performance or to the international acclaim of the award-winning French author. 'The Father,' which is having its American premiere in a new production directed by Doug Hughes ('Doubt') and translated by Christopher Hampton, uses a come-on-along device to try to make us viscerally feel the confusion and the cruelty of the mind in disarray.",
