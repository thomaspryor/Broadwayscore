  "bwwExcerpt": "Once it becomes apparent what Zeller is up to, 'The Father' has nowhere to go - it merely marks time until André completes his dreary spiral into despair and complete confusion. The ever-amazing Langella keeps this watchable for as long as possible, giving us an André who is alternately charming and irksome, pitiable and pathetic. But by the time this poor man is getting slapped around (or is he?) by a man who may or may not be his son-in-law, 'The Father' has turned repetitive and sour. What's the point of this hall-of-mirrors, other than to reflect back the ugliness of humanity?",
