However, this appears to be a brief excerpt, so confidence is medium due to limited evaluative content. | Gemini: The review highlights a 'devastating performance' and 'harrowing play,' suggesting a positive, albeit potentially difficult, experience. The lack of further details suggests a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: While brief, the text offers unqualified superlatives for both the lead performance ('devastating') and the production's emotional impact ('harrowing'), indicating strong endorsement.",
