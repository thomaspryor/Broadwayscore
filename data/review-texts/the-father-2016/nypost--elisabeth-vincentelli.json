  "bwwExcerpt": "While the role of an elderly man slowly losing his marbles could have lent itself to some mugging - Florian Zeller did subtitle his play 'a tragic farce' - Langella is fairly restrained. Not quite as much as when playing the calmly menacing KGB handler of 'The Americans,' but pretty low-key by his standards.",
