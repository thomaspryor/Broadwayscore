    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite noting the play is 'overlong and sensationalistic,' the critic calls it 'absorbing and heartfelt' with an 'excellent Broadway revival.' This is positive but qualified. Single excerpt warning and 'Read more' truncation require low confidence. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the production as 'absorbing and heartfelt' and 'excellent,' indicating a positive recommendation despite noting it is 'somewhat overlong and sensationalistic.' The single excerpt warning suggests using the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review calls the revival \"excellent\" and the play \"absorbing and heartfelt,\" but also notes it is \"somewhat overlong and sensationalistic,\" indicating a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: The critic calls the revival 'excellent' and the play 'absorbing and heartfelt,' indicating a clear recommendation, though significant reservations about it being 'overlong and sensationalistic' prevent a higher score.",
