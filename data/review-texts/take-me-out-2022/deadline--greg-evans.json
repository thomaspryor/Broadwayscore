Positive language suggests upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast and direction, suggesting the production is a revelation even for those familiar with the original. The positive tone and strong language indicate a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the cast as \"impeccable\" and suggests the production could be a \"revelation,\" indicating a strong positive recommendation. The direction is also praised for its attention to detail. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the 'impeccable' cast and skilled direction, calling the production a 'revelation' with thoughtful pacing, warranting a high Positive score despite limited text.",
