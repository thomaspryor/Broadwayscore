Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds clearly positive so scoring upper end of Positive bucket, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive reception, highlighting strong performances and emotional engagement. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a strong positive reaction, highlighting the engaging story and strong performances. The phrase \"hard to walk out without caring\" suggests a compelling and emotionally resonant experience. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
