  "bwwExcerpt": "Which leads you immediately to the thought - why are they so naked? We can do wonders with frosted glass these days, but Take Me Out insists that the actors be as close to us as possible (almost on the downstage lip) and that nothing obscure their full-frontality. Greenberg's deftly constructed play is full of dramaturgical distractions to keep us off balance, and the eye-catching choice should immediately raise your suspicions. Is this meant to be erotic? Even playfully so? No. Greenberg's play is unsexy in its bones. Take out the soap-and-towel stuff, and you're left with ideas that - give or take a few dozen slurs - you could take to church.",
