  "bwwExcerpt": "The production is, for sure, broad and embracing of an exuberant kind of theatricality, occasionally at the expense of the pace of a show that has to maintain a rush of ideas. Many of the laughs that come are as intended, but a few feel gratuitous. And the David Rockwell set is a rare disappointment from this gifted designer: there was an opportunity there to radically freshen the vistas of the work, but it offers few sharp edges and no real surprises. That said, you're watching a skilled and earnest ensemble. Adams makes for a very reliable narrator, but most of the best scenes involve the consistently superb Williams, whom you can easily believe as a real ball player and whose acting has the single quality most essential to all Greenberg plays: He never reveals too much at once.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'Take Me Out' now feels like a period piece, with no comment on transgender issues, queerness or any of the other political hot potatoes today. The same is true of the racial dynamic...'Take Me Out' is a very smart play, a cleverly structured piece that uses sport — and, yes, nudity — to explore salient questions well worth a couple of hours in the theater. It’s also a gentle and humanistic piece of work...The production is, for sure, broad and embracing of an exuberant kind of theatricality, occasionally at the expense of the pace of a show that has to maintain a rush of ideas.

Low confidence due to limited text availability. | GPT-4o: The review praises the play's intelligence and structure, suggesting it is worth seeing. However, it notes some pacing issues and gratuitous laughs, indicating reservations. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The review states the play is \"well worth a couple of hours in the theater\" but also mentions some issues with pacing and gratuitous laughs, indicating a positive but not rave review. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: The critic explicitly recommends the show as 'well worth' attending and praises its 'very smart' structure and 'skilled' ensemble, though with reservations about it feeling like a 'period piece' and occasional pacing issues. Single excerpt limits confidence.",
