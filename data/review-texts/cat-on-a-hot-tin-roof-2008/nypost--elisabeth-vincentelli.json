  "bwwExcerpt": "But Stanley also needs to have a feral charm and a touch of insecure neediness — otherwise, it’s hard to see why he’d feel threatened by Blanche, or why Stella would stay with this wife-beater in wife-beaters. Unfortunately, Underwood sticks to one note, and that’s brutish. Even then, it often feels as if we’re watching a fundamentally nice actor baring his teeth — and his chest — to look mean. Stanley’s rage at the world doesn’t come from deep inside.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt criticizes the lead performance as one-dimensional and unconvincing, but with only one excerpt available from what may be a longer review, the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the lead actor's performance as lacking depth and nuance, suggesting a disappointing portrayal of a key character. The tone is negative, focusing on the shortcomings in the performance. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on a negative assessment of the actor's performance as Stanley, indicating a lack of depth and authenticity in the portrayal. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring in the negative range with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic finds the lead actor's performance one-dimensional and surface-level, failing to capture the character's required complexity and emotional depth, which represents a significant flaw in this production.",
