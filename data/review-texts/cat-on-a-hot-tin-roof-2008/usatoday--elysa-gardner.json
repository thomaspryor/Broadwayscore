  "bwwExcerpt": "It's telling that Blanche DuBois, one of the most famous neurotics in American literature, sometimes comes across as the least hysterical person on stage — or maybe just the least aggressive in her hysteria. As summoned by director Emily Mann, whom Williams befriended and worked with late in his life, the French Quarter, where Blanche visits her sister, Stella, is a raucous place, with people forever laughing or fighting, making love, or stomping and whining in agitatio",

The truncated nature and absence of explicit verdict language requires caution in scoring. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the director's interpretation of the setting and characters, but doesn't offer a clear recommendation. The tone is observational, not strongly positive or negative. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the directorial approach and staging choices but lacks clear evaluative language indicating whether this interpretation succeeds or fails. With only one curated excerpt available and the text clearly truncated mid-sentence, the critic's final verdict cannot be determined.",
