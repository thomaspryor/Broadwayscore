    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt describes the production as 'striking' and suggests it would 'delight Tennessee Williams' and audiences seeking entertainment. However, with only one curated excerpt available that appears cut off mid-sentence, confidence is low as the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the physical and magnetic performances of the cast, suggesting a positive experience for audiences. However, it also notes a lack of subtle psychological insights, indicating some reservations. The single excerpt and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the actors' physical beauty and sexual magnetism, suggesting a positive experience for audiences. However, the phrase \"no subtle psychological insights\" indicates a reservation, leading to a score in the lower-middle of the positive range. Confidence is low due to the truncated text. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers qualified praise emphasizing the cast's physical magnetism and 'striking' production values while noting the lack of psychological insight, indicating a lukewarm recommendation typical of the lower Positive range.",
