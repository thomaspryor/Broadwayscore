  "bwwExcerpt": "There's little poignancy in the performance. When Blanche goes crackers at the end, it seems to come out of nowhere, rather than being the inevitable result of a long slide. [...] Blair Underwood, another performer from films and TV who is normally a sensitive actor, overdoes Stanley's macho-ness to the point of excluding any other qualities.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt criticizes key performances as lacking depth and nuance, with Blanche's breakdown feeling unearned and Stanley being one-dimensional. However, this is only a single excerpt so the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights significant issues with the performances, noting a lack of poignancy and overacting. The critique suggests disappointment with the production, indicating a negative review. | Gemini: The review excerpt criticizes the performances of the lead actors, stating that they lack poignancy and overdo their roles. Given the negative tone, I've classified this as negative. | Kimi: The critic specifically faults the two lead performances, finding the actress lacking poignancy and the actor overplaying Stanley's macho qualities, which undermines the production's emotional impact.",
