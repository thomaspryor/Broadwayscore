  "bwwExcerpt": "Sometimes there's yuks so quickly. The latest production of Tennessee Williams' masterwork \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" is an unfathomable misstep from the gifted Emily Mann, whose work I have often admired as both director and playwright. Helmer Mann and her starry cast treat the work as if it were a combination soap opera and sitcom. The result is embarrassing and sad.",
