  "bwwExcerpt": "Though Snook is the show's undeniable star, she has stiff competition: Director Kip Williams' is also a standout. The meticulous direction goes hand in hand with Snook's performance and strikes a fascinating balance. Polished as it must be — to seamlessly pull off her collaboration with her video selves — it doesn't quite feel precise, often presenting with an element of messiness that suits Dorian, as he wallows in his moral decay, frazzled by the Faustian trade he's made, by the power it affords him, by his own detachment from the rest of humanity.",

  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Despite the show's ruminations revolving around Dorian's ego, there is no vanity in this performance where Snook sweats, sneers, and dashes across stage. The bold production is as cinematic as it is theatrical, and a perfect showcase for its shining star."
