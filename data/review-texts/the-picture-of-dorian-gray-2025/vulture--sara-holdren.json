  "bwwExcerpt": "It’s a mark of Williams’s savvy—combined with the expert calibrations of his adaptation’s solo performer, Sarah Snook—that neither this moment nor any other in the show is approached with the heavy highlighter of relevancy. Wilde, with his withering disdain for moral snobbery, would have hated that, and this Dorian Gray stays true to its originator’s brilliant ghost, even as it winkingly inserts a phone selfie here and a creepy TikTok filter there. The show arrives on Broadway trailing acclaim from its London run, including an Olivier for Snook, and it works because it is, first and foremost, a sensory feast. Fast, clever, delicious, and performed by Snook with the giddy virtuosity of Simone Biles executing a floor routine, it reaches the gut and the heart lightly, thrusting like a fencer, by way of its playfulness and spectacle. It doesn’t need a bullhorn to talk about the now — just a great story and an acrobatic actor.",
