  "bwwExcerpt": "Those digital selves are rendered on separate screens of various shapes and sizes, aptly resembling pictures in, say, the National Portrait Gallery. They’re kinetic, flying in and out, landing at different angles, sometimes rendering whole bodies in silhouette and, at others, offering a series of characters at a gossipy table. All are richly realized, down to the mutton-chop mustaches (in some cases) or the elaborate headwear (in others). All, of course, are played by Snook. Unless you saw this piece in London, I doubt you will have seen quite the like before.",

  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Snook's performance in Kip Williams's self-penned production is powerful in every way, an exquisitely crafted melange of determination, drive and cheekiness. On the night I saw the show, she did not drop so much as a syllable. And yet there was nothing automaton about her work, which was just as well given all of the screens that surrounded her. She's brilliant, alive and fun. All at once."
