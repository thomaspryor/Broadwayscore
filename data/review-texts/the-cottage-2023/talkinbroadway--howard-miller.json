    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic uses highly positive language ('perfect', 'pleasurable') with charming analogies. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language, describing the play as 'perfect' and 'pleasurable'. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses highly positive language, comparing the play to pleasurable summer activities, indicating a strong recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise using 'perfect' twice and evocative pleasurable imagery, clearly recommending the show as delightful summer fare. However, as a single curated excerpt, the full context and any potential reservations are unknown.",
