  "fullText": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-cottage-review-a-bedroom-farce-braves-broadway-9b285462\n\nLaura Bell Bundy and Eric McCormack Joan MarcusThe bedroom farce has had a wobbly history on American stages. The celebrated French farceur Feydeau is virtually never revived. The British have always had a healthier appetite for the genre, but one of the most successful of such comedies, Ray Cooney’s 1983 “Run for Your Wife,” which lasted nine years in the West End, was a quick fizzle on Broadway, playing less than two months.\n\nHayes Theater, 240 W. 44th St., New York, $49-$169, 212-239-6200, closes Oct. 29\n\nSo Sandy Rustin, the author of “The Cottage,” a sex farce in the classic British mold, which is even set in England, in 1923, deserves a cheer or two for bringing this rarely seen style of comedy back to Broadway, even if the play doesn’t rise into a soufflé of delightful door-slamming and tangled romantic confusion.\n\nPerformed with boisterous gusto by a cast featuring “Will and Grace” star Eric McCormack, and directed by Jason Alexander, whose years on “Seinfeld” have taught him a thing or two about comedy, the play had me smiling indulgently more often than clutching my belly. (With the exception of Michael Frayn’s “Noises Off,” an ingenious farce-within-a-farce seen on Broadway in three separate productions, and returning to London in September, I have never been much enamored of the form.)\n\n“The Cottage” takes place in an expensive-looking but not overly grand house in the countryside outside London. Paul Tate dePoo III has designed it in a cozy-cluttered style that seems appropriate, although I doubt that even a house that comes to resemble a high-end version of a hotel renting rooms by the hour would feature as the centerpiece of its drawing room a louche-looking Empire chaise longue, bright red and trimmed in gold.\n\nCopyright ©2025 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
