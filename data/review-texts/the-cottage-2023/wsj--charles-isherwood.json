The lack of enthusiasm and the critique of pandering to contemporary ideas indicate a mixed assessment. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the play is \"indifferent,\" which falls into the mixed category. The single excerpt and lack of full context make it difficult to assess a stronger positive or negative leaning.",
