The celebrated French farceur Feydeau is virtually never revived. The British have always had a healthier appetite for the genre, but one of the most successful of such comedies, Ray Cooney’s 1983 “Run for Your Wife,” which lasted nine years in the West End, was a quick fizzle on Broadway, playing less than two months.\n\nHayes Theater, 240 W. 44th St., New York, $49-$169, 212-239-6200, closes Oct. 29\n\nSo Sandy Rustin, the author of “The Cottage,” a sex farce in the classic British mold, which is even set in England, in 1923, deserves a cheer or two for bringing this rarely seen style of comedy back to Broadway, even if the play doesn’t rise into a soufflé of delightful door-slamming and tangled romantic confusion.\n\nPerformed with boisterous gusto by a cast featuring “Will and Grace” star Eric McCormack, and directed by Jason Alexander, whose years on “Seinfeld” have taught him a thing or two about comedy, the play had me smiling indulgently more often than clutching my belly. (With the exception of Michael Frayn’s “Noises Off,” an ingenious farce-within-a-farce seen on Broadway in three separate productions, and returning to London in September, I have never been much enamored of the form.)\n\n“The Cottage” takes place in an expensive-looking but not overly grand house in the countryside outside London. Paul Tate dePoo III has designed it in a cozy-cluttered style that seems appropriate, although I doubt that even a house that comes to resemble a high-end version of a hotel renting rooms by the hour would feature as the centerpiece of its drawing room a louche-looking Empire chaise longue, bright red and trimmed in gold.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Given the year the play is set, these developments seem more a matter of pandering to contemporary ideas than anything else. But linear logic is not a hallmark of farce, good, bad or, as in this case, indifferent.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Critic appreciates the effort to revive bedroom farce and praises the cast/director, but clearly states the play doesn't fully succeed ('doesn't rise into a soufflé') and only provoked mild amusement rather than genuine laughter. | Gemini: The review is mixed, noting that the play is performed with gusto and had the critic smiling, but it doesn't quite reach the level of delightful door-slamming confusion. It's a qualified positive but not a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic praises the cast's boisterous gusto and admits the play deserves credit for reviving the farce genre, but the key verdict 'smiling indulgently more often than clutching my belly' indicates mild enjoyment rather than strong recommendation, balanced against criticism that it 'doesn't rise into a soufflé of delightful door-slamming.'
