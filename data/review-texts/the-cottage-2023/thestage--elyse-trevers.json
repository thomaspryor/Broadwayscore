That by itself would have worked without a nod to female independence and the few introspective moments.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic suggests the show doesn't succeed in its current form but acknowledges positive elements like clever props and fast pacing. The conditional 'would have worked better' indicates the show falls short of its potential. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the show has strengths in its comedic elements but criticizes the attempt at seriousness, indicating a mixed reception. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence in the score. | Gemini: The review suggests the play has humorous moments and is fast-paced, but it also implies that the attempt at seriousness detracts from the overall experience. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While praising the fast pacing and clever physical humor, the critic suggests the show fails to successfully integrate its serious thematic elements, implying a flawed execution rather than a clear recommendation.",
