    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic frames this as unpretentious entertainment that succeeds at its modest goals, with positive language like 'delivered on a platter' and 'properly silly cast,' but the single excerpt limits confidence in the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as a 'brazenly straightforward drawing-room farce' meant for 'light amusement,' suggesting a positive experience for those seeking entertainment without seriousness. The tone is positive, but the single excerpt and lack of depth in the review text suggest a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review describes the play as being created for 'light amusement' and delivered well by the cast, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. The lack of full text and single excerpt warning suggest a conservative score.",
