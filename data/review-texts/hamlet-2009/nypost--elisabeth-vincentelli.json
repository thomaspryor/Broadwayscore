    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows balanced assessment - praises Law's energy and compelling presence but notes he's 'not entirely convincing.' This mixed evaluation suggests neither clear recommendation nor discouragement. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a mixed assessment of the performance, noting both compelling aspects and lack of full conviction. With only one excerpt, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence mixed score. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes Law's performance as \"compelling to watch\" but also notes he's \"not entirely convincing,\" suggesting a positive but qualified recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for Law's physical performance and watchability, but explicitly notes it is not entirely convincing, suggesting a mildly positive assessment typical of a 70-74 range score. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
