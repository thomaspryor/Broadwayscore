    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review offers balanced praise and criticism - acknowledges Law's intensity and handsome staging but notes his performance feels calculated and the production lacks fresh illumination. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a balanced view, praising Jude Law's intensity but critiquing the lack of spontaneity and fresh insights in the production. The single excerpt warning suggests a cautious approach, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review offers mixed opinions, praising Jude Law's intensity but noting a lack of spontaneity and fresh illumination of the text. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises Law's committed performance and the handsome staging but criticizes the calculated nature of the interpretation and lack of fresh insight, indicating a qualified, mild recommendation typical of the lower Positive range.",
