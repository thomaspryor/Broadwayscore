  "bwwExcerpt": "If you judged Anastasia from the excitement from fans both outside and inside the theater leading up to the curtain rising, you'd surmise this was a franchise that carried a generation. In reality, although this is the Broadway debut of the show, the story dates back to the 1997 animated movie that accounts for the nostalgic look back that so many young adults were experiencing. If you missed the sensation at that time, and in the interim decades, it's difficult to imagine what the devotees saw ",
