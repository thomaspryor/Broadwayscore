  "bwwExcerpt": "Alexander Dodge's luscious backdrops of St. Petersburg and Paris aided by Donald Holder's lighting are more seductive than the best travel poster. Aaron Rhyne's deliciously dizzying projection designs whoosh us through the countryside as they take the train to Paris and then up the elevator inside the Eiffel Tower.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt focuses entirely on production design with enthusiastic praise ('luscious', 'seductive', 'deliciously dizzying'), but text is clearly truncated mid-sentence and may not represent the overall verdict. Lower positive range due to incomplete assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production design, lighting, and costumes, suggesting a visually appealing show. However, the single excerpt and lack of a full verdict limit confidence, suggesting a mildly positive impression. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the positive aspects of the production design, suggesting a strong recommendation.

While limited to a single truncated excerpt, the clearly enthusiastic tone warrants the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
