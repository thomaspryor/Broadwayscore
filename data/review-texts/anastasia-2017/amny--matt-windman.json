    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic calls it 'uneven but well-meaning and mostly pleasant' - mixed language that acknowledges flaws ('uneven') while finding some merit ('pleasant', 'well-meaning'). Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'uneven but well-meaning and mostly pleasant,' indicating a mixed assessment with some positive elements. However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach to scoring. | Gemini: The review uses the word \"uneven\" but also \"mostly pleasant\", suggesting a mixed reaction. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers mild praise ('mostly pleasant', 'well-meaning') tempered by criticism ('uneven'), suggesting a qualified recommendation at the lower end of the Positive range.",
