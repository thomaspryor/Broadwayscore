This indicates a negative overall assessment despite the praise for Altomare. | Gemini: The review highlights a strong positive aspect (Christy Altomare's performance) as the \"saving grace,\" suggesting the show has other issues, but is still worth seeing for her performance. | Kimi: The phrase 'saving grace' implies the production has significant flaws but is redeemed by the lead performance, indicating a mixed verdict rather than a clear recommendation. | Buckets: openai=Negative, gemini=Positive, kimi=Mixed",
