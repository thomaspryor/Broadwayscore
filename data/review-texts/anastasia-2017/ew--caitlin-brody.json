The tone suggests a negative view, but without the full review, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review excerpt compares the Broadway production unfavorably to the animated movie, calling it \"fidget-inducing\" and too long. Given the negative tone and single excerpt, I'm scoring it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers direct criticism of the Broadway adaptation as boring and overlong compared to the original film, with negative descriptors indicating the production fails to justify its runtime.",
