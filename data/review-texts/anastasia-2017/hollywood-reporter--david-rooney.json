  "bwwExcerpt": "The key selling point of this pretty but anodyne musical, which ends up being more satisfying than the sum of its parts. It's a fairy-tale whose princess chooses her own kind of prince, a destiny foretold in the stirring shared childhood recollection of Dmitry and Anya, 'In a Crowd of Thousands.' It's kitschy, old-fashioned entertainment given a relatively sophisticated presentation, and you have to acknowledge its success when you hear the target demographic swoon on cue.",

This suggests a positive recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review indicates that the show is enjoyable when it focuses on the romance, and praises McNeal's performance, suggesting a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise, noting the show succeeds when focusing on romance but gets bogged down in historical elements, while commending McNeal's radiant central performance.",
