This suggests a positive recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review indicates that the show is enjoyable when it focuses on the romance, and praises McNeal's performance, suggesting a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise, noting the show succeeds when focusing on romance but gets bogged down in historical elements, while commending McNeal's radiant central performance.",
