  "bwwExcerpt": "Terrence McNally's book goes through so many contortions on the subject of Anastasia. She is the royal daughter. She isn't the daughter. She is, then she isn't again. But then why does this Russian girl know so much about the Romanovs' pet cat and why is there a diamond the size of the Ritz sewn into her rag of an overcoat? Also unexplained is where Anya/Anastasia learned to jump from trains a la Tom Cruise and defend herself (and her boyfriend) by kicking men in the nuts. No Disney princess ever did that before! As the two lovers, Christy Altomare and Derek Klena display pretty singing voices, and otherwise show as much depth as the animated-film characters their roles are based on.",

However, this is only one excerpt from a longer review, so the full verdict may be different. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the book for its convoluted plot and character development, suggesting a lack of depth. While there is some praise for the singing voices, the overall tone is negative, focusing on the show's shortcomings. | Gemini: The review highlights plot contortions and shallow character development, indicating a negative overall assessment despite mentioning 'pretty singing voices.' | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
