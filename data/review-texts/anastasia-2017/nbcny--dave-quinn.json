  "bwwExcerpt": "Broadway's got a bright new star, and her name is 'Anastasia.' The 1997 beloved animated movie has been transformed into a magical new stage musical, now open at the Broadhurst Theatre, with a much-improved book by Terrence McNally, added songs from the film's composers Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, and a star-making performance by actress Christy Altomare. Fans of the original 20th Century Fox flick (who call themselves 'Fanastasias') will surely be satisfied with the offering, while those who skipped the cartoon should realize this isn't the fairy tale fluff they might have initially assumed it to be.",
