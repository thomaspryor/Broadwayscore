  "bwwExcerpt": "Broadway's got a bright new star, and her name is 'Anastasia.' The 1997 beloved animated movie has been transformed into a magical new stage musical, now open at the Broadhurst Theatre, with a much-improved book by Terrence McNally, added songs from the film's composers Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, and a star-making performance by actress Christy Altomare. Fans of the original 20th Century Fox flick (who call themselves 'Fanastasias') will surely be satisfied with the offering, while those who skipped the cartoon should realize this isn't the fairy tale fluff they might have initially assumed it to be.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('bright new star,' 'magical,' 'star-making performance') with praise for book improvements and lead performance. Single excerpt limits confidence but tone is clearly enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is highly positive, praising the transformation of the animated movie into a magical stage musical with a much-improved book and a star-making performance. The tone suggests a strong recommendation, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt limitation. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting a star-making performance and a much-improved book. The critic states that fans will be satisfied, and those unfamiliar with the source material should realize it's not just fluff. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise calling the show a 'bright new star' and 'magical,' highlighting a star-making performance and recommending it for both fans and newcomers, though the single curated quote limits overall confidence.",
