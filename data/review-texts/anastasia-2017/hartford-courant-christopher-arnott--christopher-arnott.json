  "bwwExcerpt": "In its yearlong journey from Hartford to Broadway, 'Anastasia' has found itself. When this sweet-natured musical of self-discovery premiered a year ago at Hartford Stage, it was just as lush and romantic, but underneath those gorgeous trappings it seemed uneven, insincere, unsure of itself. At the Broadhurst Theatre, where it opened Monday night, the show is now fluid, smooth and clear-headed. 'Anastasia' has not fundamentally changed. But dozens of small fixes have made it a much sharper show. Had the Hartford Stage version hurried to Broadway sooner without these tweaks - or heaven forbid, had not tried out in Hartford at all - the show's stylistic inconsistencies would have doomed it. It speaks and sings now with a stronger voice.",
