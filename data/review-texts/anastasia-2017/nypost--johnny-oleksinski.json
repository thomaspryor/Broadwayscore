    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite acknowledging visual appeal, the critic dismisses the fundamental elements (songs, book, characters) with harsh language like 'snooze' and 'cardboard cutouts.' Single excerpt warning noted, but the negative assessment of core theatrical elements outweighs the visual praise. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt criticizes the songs, book, and characters, suggesting a negative impression overall despite acknowledging visual appeal. The single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly negative about the core elements of the show (songs, book, characters), despite acknowledging the visual appeal. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the negative aspects outweigh the positive. | Kimi: The critic delivers a harsh assessment of the musical's core elements (score, book, and characters), offering only faint praise for the visual design. With fundamental components dismissed as boring and shallow, this represents a clear recommendation against seeing the show.",
