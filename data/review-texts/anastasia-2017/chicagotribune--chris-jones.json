  "bwwExcerpt": "Alas for imperial Russia and the family of Czar Nicholas II, the 17-year-old Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna was murdered in 1918 by the Cheka, Vladimir Lenin's secret police. But since princesses have a unique ability to skate above republican sentiment and the harsh realities of forensic science, the legend of a surviving Anastasia has lived on in popular culture, most famously as a 1997 animated musical film, scored by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty and wherein Anastasia was voiced by Meg Ryan, she whom no Bolshevik could ever suppress. Now Anastasia has reappeared on Broadway, the centerpiece of a new musical that works quite delightfully when the star is center stage, and struggles mightily when she is off in the wings, where the charming Christy Altomare spends far too long.",

The original 40 rating confirms this falls in the lower Mixed range. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges a 'fine leading lady' but criticizes the show as 'listless' and lacking memorable moments, aligning with the critic's original rating of 40. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like the leading lady and handsome production, but ultimately finds the show lacking in emotional impact, leading to a negative classification. The critic's rating of 40 supports this. | Kimi: While the critic compliments the production values and lead performance, the overall verdict is that the show lacks emotional resonance and fails to be memorable. The critic's original rating of 40 confirms this is a negative recommendation.",
