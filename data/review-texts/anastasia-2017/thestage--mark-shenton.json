  "bwwExcerpt": "The Oscar-nominated hit from the original movie, Journey to the Past, as well as Once Upon a December are the stand-outs here, though they've been augmented by nearly 20 new songs. Other significant changes from the film see the character of Rasputin replaced by a vengeful Russian police sergeant called Gleb, who is determined to fulfil his father's mission to destroy the Russian royal family. He's played by Ramin Karimloo - the Iranian-born musical star who first came to prominence in the West End - with impressive authority and strong vocals.",

However, the single excerpt and lack of overall context limit confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Karimloo's performance and highlights standout songs, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers mild praise for specific musical numbers ('stand-outs') and a lead performance ('impressive authority'), but as a single curated quote, it provides limited insight into the overall verdict.",
