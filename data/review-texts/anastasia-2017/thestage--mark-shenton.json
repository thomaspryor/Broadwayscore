  "bwwExcerpt": "The Oscar-nominated hit from the original movie, Journey to the Past, as well as Once Upon a December are the stand-outs here, though they've been augmented by nearly 20 new songs. Other significant changes from the film see the character of Rasputin replaced by a vengeful Russian police sergeant called Gleb, who is determined to fulfil his father's mission to destroy the Russian royal family. He's played by Ramin Karimloo - the Iranian-born musical star who first came to prominence in the West End - with impressive authority and strong vocals.",
