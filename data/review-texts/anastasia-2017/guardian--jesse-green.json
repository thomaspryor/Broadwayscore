    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic calls it 'handsome' but dismisses it as feeling like a theme park rather than real theater, which is clearly negative. However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict may be more nuanced. | GPT-4o: The review describes the production as 'handsome' but ultimately criticizes it for lacking the depth of a theatrical experience, likening it to a 'theme park attraction'. This suggests a negative overall impression despite some positive aspects. | Gemini: The review excerpt compares the show unfavorably to a theme park attraction, suggesting a lack of theatrical depth. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the production values as 'handsome,' the use of 'unfortunately' and the comparison to a 'theme park attraction' rather than legitimate theater indicates a recommendation against seeing the show for serious theatergoers.",
