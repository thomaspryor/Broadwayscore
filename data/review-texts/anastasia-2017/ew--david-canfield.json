Given only one excerpt available and the mixed praise/criticism, scoring at lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the production's ability to translate the film's scope to the stage, indicating a positive reception. The original rating of 87 supports a strong positive classification, though the mention of not capturing the movie's emotional magic suggests some reservations. | Gemini: The review is positive, noting the production's success in translating the film's scope. However, it also mentions that it doesn't quite capture the movie's emotional magic, indicating a reservation. Given that it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the production's visual scope and mounting while explicitly noting a failure to capture the source material's emotional resonance, indicating a mildly positive recommendation. Confidence is low due to reliance on a single curated excerpt that may not reflect the full review context.",
