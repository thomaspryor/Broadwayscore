Since this is a curated positive excerpt, scoring at upper end of Positive range, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'sumptuous spectacle' and highlights its effective use of romance and historical context, indicating a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as a \"sumptuous spectacle\" and acknowledges both the romance and tragedy, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic review. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise ('sumptuous spectacle,' 'makes the most of') indicating a solid recommendation, though the single curated quote limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
