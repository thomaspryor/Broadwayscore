  "bwwExcerpt": "A young woman with no memory tries to find out who she is in the new Broadway musical 'Anastasia.' The show, despite being filled with some very good songs and performances, suffers from its own identity crisis. It's got a split personality and is torn between whether it's serious drama or frothy musical comedy. One wishes that the creative team - the same one behind 'Ragtime' - of Terrence McNally (book), Stephen Flaherty (music) and Lynn Ahrens (lyrics) had found a way to make it cohesive and more balanced.",
