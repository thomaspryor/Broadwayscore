    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic describes the show as having a 'dusty, bewildered air' and not knowing what it wants to be, which is clearly negative. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, describing the show as 'dusty' and 'bewildered', implying a lack of clear direction or purpose. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses a negative sentiment, describing the show as feeling \"dusty\" and \"bewildered.\" Given the limited text, a negative score is appropriate, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The single excerpt describes the production as 'dusty' and 'bewildered' with an identity crisis, indicating the critic finds the show dated and incoherent rather than successful.",
