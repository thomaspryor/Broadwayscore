  "bwwExcerpt": "...Nighy and co-star Carey Mulligan have a brilliant vehicle worthy of their complementary talents. Piloted with exceptional sensitivity by Stephen Daldry and beautifully designed by Bob Crowley and Natasha Katz, this revival is as fine as the original -- while being utterly different in texture, tone and impact...Hare...refuses to stack the deck, giving us full rein to fall under the spell of both Tom and Kyra as they inevitably succumb to the forces that both brought them together and tore them apart...Nighy...exudes a to-the-manor-born elegance that's heightened by the nervous tics of a febrile personality used to getting his way...Mulligan casts a hypnotic spell, playing combativeness and vulnerability in perfect balance. The result is riveting, as absorbing a drama as can be seen anywhere this season, played at the highest level...Skylight is a keeper and this revival is one for the ages.",
