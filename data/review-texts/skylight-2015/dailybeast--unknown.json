  "bwwExcerpt": "I don't know many authors who can so seamlessly blend comedy and sadness the way Hare does. Or perhaps weld is the better word, because there is no pulling apart the joy and sadness in this play, the outcome of which, while most assuredly inevitable, is never predictable...I can't imagine any actors serving Hare better than these actors do. [Mulligan] inhabits her role as though it were written just for her...She completely embodied the role of the earnest schoolteacher Kyra Hollis...Nighy is Nighy, you could say. He has gestures, inflections, rhythms, and body language that follow him from project to project. All true, and yet I don't know any actor who, at a deeper, more profound level, inhabits a character the way he does...Skylight isn't some exhausting O'Neill-like epic, but it is an intense experience. It picks you up and hurls you along for two hours, and then resolves with such dramatic rightness that you walk out completely satisfied and at the same time all shook up.",
