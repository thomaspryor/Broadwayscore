  "bwwExcerpt": "There's never much question about how things will end. But the stars make it intriguing with their contrasting portraits that open another chasm between the characters. Nighy is all tics and poses and ants-in-the-pants restlessness. Mulligan is calm and measured - and even at her most self-righteous, she never sounds like she's preaching. She even makes the melodramatic move of tossing a drawer of silverware work.",
