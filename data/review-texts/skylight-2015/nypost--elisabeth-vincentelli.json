  "bwwExcerpt": "Watching a couple duke it out works only if you also understand what drew them to each other in the first place. But in the new Broadway revival of David Hare's 'Skylight,' the lovers don't share much, either in love or war...The imbalance of power between them is a key part of the play, and much of that is due to their age difference...But in this production, directed by Stephen Daldry ('The Audience'), the gap has turned into a chasm: There's no getting around the fact that Mulligan is 29 to Nighy's 65...The lack of sexual chemistry between them makes you wonder why Kyra bothers to put up with Tom. It doesn't help that Nighy, who first played the role in 1997, turns on the charm so hard that all we see are mannered tics. In contrast, Mulligan is a marvel of quiet strength...she truly comes alive onstage. And she does it in such an understated manner that it'd be easy to miss how rich her performance is.",
