  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The movie from 2004 is a distant memory but, as directed and choreographed by Nicholaw, it comes to sharp life again in this still timely and relevant new musical...The whole cast is terrific. The two female leads, Henningsen as Cady and Louderman as Regina are both strong, particularly Louderman...It's funny, touching and emotionally resonant...Transferring from film to musical theater is no mean feat and 'Mean Girls' does it, overall, exceptionally well- with some powerful songs.\"\n\nRead more",
