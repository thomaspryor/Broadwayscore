  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The ensemble is excellent, with great dancing and supporting roles that make the principle cast look great...The musical is very much like the movie...The play has a little more pep in its step owing to the nature of its theatrical medium. Hennigsen's Cady is a bit too perky and somewhat dorky, not as natural and uncaring of what other people think...It's fine though because, in the end, the story's message about the value of true friendship and self-acceptance is all that really matters.\"\n\nRead more",
