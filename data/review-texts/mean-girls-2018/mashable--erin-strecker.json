  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The musical hews quite closely to its source material...A faithful retelling of the endlessly rewatchable film - with a couple additional dance breaks...The cast is uniformly excellent; in particular, the three actresses portraying the iconic Plastics trio...If there's any disappointment, it's that the songs don't quite rise to the actors' obvious talent...The score would have benefitted from a little more variety...Each number is pleasant enough...but you won't really be humming any of the tunes.\"\n\nRead more",
