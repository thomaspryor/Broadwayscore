We have the full support of law enforcement and the juvenile court system.\"\n\nBirdsong requested that families should report issues of concern to law enforcement or school administrators.\n\nThere was also a previous threat investigated Sunday night in reference to Clovis High School in New Mexico that raised concerns locally because that school had the same initials as Centennial High School, Puckett said.\n\nA separate threat referenced Centennial and Independence and resulted in the juvenile arrest, Puckett said.\n\nReach Andy Humbles at ahumbles@tennessean.com or 615-726-5939 and on Twitter @ AndyHumbles."
