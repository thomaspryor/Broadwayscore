  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Fey, famous for her Saturday Night Live performances, wrote the show, and Casey Nicholaw directed and choreographed it, bringing the story, song, dance, and comedy together to make for a fun evening for theatregoers. The music is by Fey’s husband, Jeff Richards, and the sassy lyrics by Neil Benjamin. The show is true to the movie...This show has it all: humor, fun, dance, and engagement with the audience. I highly recommend it for an evening of fun.\"\n\nRead more",
