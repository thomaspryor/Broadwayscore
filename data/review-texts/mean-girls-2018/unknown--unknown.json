Richmond and Benjamin’s many many (many) musical numbers are passable by middle-of-the-road Broadway standards...Yet they rarely capture either the tone or the time of being a certain age in a certain era...As long as they're talking, the leading students of 'Mean Girls' exude an idiosyncratic, carefully exaggerated comic charm.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Mixed assessment with both praise ('likable', 'comic charm') and criticism ('over-padded', 'passable', 'trouble lies'). Single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'likable' but criticizes the musical numbers and their effectiveness. The excerpt suggests a mixed reception with some positive elements but significant reservations. | Gemini: The review uses phrases like \"likable but seriously over-padded\" and \"passable by middle-of-the-road Broadway standards,\" indicating a mixed assessment. The positive comment about the actors' charm is balanced by criticism of the musical numbers. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates mixed but mildly positive reception; while criticizing the show as 'over-padded' with only 'passable' music, the 'likable' designation and praise for the cast's comic charm suggest a weak recommendation.",
