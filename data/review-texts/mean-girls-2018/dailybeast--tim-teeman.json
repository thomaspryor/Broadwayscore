The book by Tina Fey still has all the sly, biting brilliance and precise observational humor of the original movie, which she also wrote.",

It praises the visuals, direction, choreography, and Tina Fey's writing, but it is somewhat conditional on liking the original movie. | Kimi: While the text is fragmented, the critic offers unqualified praise for the visual design ('no better-looking production on Broadway') and explicitly states fans of the movie 'will also love this musical,' citing strong direction and writing.",
