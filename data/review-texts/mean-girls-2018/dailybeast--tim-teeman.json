It praises the visuals, direction, choreography, and Tina Fey's writing, but it is somewhat conditional on liking the original movie. | Kimi: While the text is fragmented, the critic offers unqualified praise for the visual design ('no better-looking production on Broadway') and explicitly states fans of the movie 'will also love this musical,' citing strong direction and writing.",
