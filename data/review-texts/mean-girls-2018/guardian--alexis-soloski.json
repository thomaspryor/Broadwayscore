  "bwwExcerpt": "Mean Girls is fine. Mean Girls is fun. The songs, by Fey's husband Jeff Richmond and lyricist Nell Benjamin, are catchy enough, the book is reasonably witty, the staging, by Casey Nicholaw, sufficiently fluid. The anti-bullying message is straightforward enough (maybe too straightforward, the show says it twice): 'Calling someone ugly doesn't make you better looking. Calling someone stupid won't make you any smarter.' But - no offense, okay? - Mean Girls is basic.",
