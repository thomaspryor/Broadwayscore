  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'Mean Girls' is loud, fast, insistently chipper, and fitfully hilarious; it is also deficient in the qualities that make a musical memorable. I give it a C+...Even the show's assets are turned into debits by repetition...Casey Nicholaw's musical staging is loaded with inventive touches...But songs and dances can, and should, do more than constantly hype a musical with ever-larger doses of vitamin B12...The show improves markedly in its later stretches.\" \n\nRead more",
