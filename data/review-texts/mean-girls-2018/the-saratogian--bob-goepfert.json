  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Colorful, big, exciting and highly entertaining...Fey's wit and keen eye for social satire shines throughout the production...The singing is good and the dancing terrific in support of a score that needs help as the music lacks distinction and tends to be repetitive...The choreography is clever, energetic and sets the mood and location of every scene perfectly...As well as the performers avoid caricature, the fact is 'Mean Girls' is still a cliché. An entertaining cliché, but a cliché nonetheless.\"\n\nRead more",
