No clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some positive elements like catchy songs and colorful staging, but overall describes the show as 'oddly inert' and lacking energy, leading to a negative verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like catchy songs and slick dancing, but ultimately finds the show lacking energy and feeling inert, indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging competent songs, dancing, and staging, the critic's verdict is that the show is lifeless and fails to capture the energy of the original film. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
