The key quote indicates that the show has strengths, particularly in Act 2, but does not imply an overall strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review is short and only offers a single sentence about the show. The critic's rating of 60 suggests a mixed review, with the show improving in the second act. | Kimi: The critic's own 60/100 rating places this squarely in the Mixed range, and the excerpt indicates the production improves significantly in Act 2 after a presumably weaker opening act.",
