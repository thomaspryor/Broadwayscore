The critic notes charms but also significant issues with the adaptation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges both positive and negative aspects, indicating a mixed opinion. The critic points out that the musical adaptation feels overstuffed and overlong. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the production has some merits ('not without its charms'), the focus is on structural problems and failure to capture the source material's quality, resulting in an ambivalent assessment rather than a clear recommendation.",
