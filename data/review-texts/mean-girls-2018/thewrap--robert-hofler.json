  "bwwExcerpt": "Beyond the successful recycling of 14-year-old jokes, the other good news about Fey and Richmond's first joint Broadway effort is that her characters need to sing. The angst, joy and fear on display are big in a very hormonal teenager kind of way. 'Mean Girls,' unlike its first cousin 'Legally Blonde,' finds the necessary volume to justify breaking into song, whether those songs are about the despair of being an outsider or falling in love with a photo of the Wham!-era George Michael. These are the early traumatic experiences of life that stick in your memory much longer than passing the bar exam or applying for social security. If only Fey's springboard of a book had inspired more memorable, distinctive songs. A few hit the mark: 'I See Stars' delivers chewable bubblegum and 'What's Wrong With Me?' is a poignant lament from Gretchen, the most insecure of the Plastics. And when the group's nasty leader, Regina, seeks revenge on her new turncoat friend Cady, 'Watch the World Burn' turns up the heat.",
