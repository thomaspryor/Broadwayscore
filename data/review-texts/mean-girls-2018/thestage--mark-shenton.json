  "bwwExcerpt": "At least Henningsen's Cady, the character played in the film by Lindsay Lohan, effectively transitions from vulnerable outsider to knowing insider. She carries the show's main numbers, too, with aplomb; Taylor Louderman is monstrous and marvellous as Regina, whom Cady may or may not have literally thrown under a bus. Broadway regular Kerry Butler doubles as both her mother and wronged teacher with skilled ease. Is the show 'fetch' or 'grool', to quote two of the new words its characters seeks to coin? No, but Broadway may nevertheless welcome its easy, if generic, professionalism.",
