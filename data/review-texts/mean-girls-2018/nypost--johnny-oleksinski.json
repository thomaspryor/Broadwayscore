The mention of Tina Fey's book capturing the movie's 'sharp wit' further supports this positive evaluation. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"fetchingly funny\" and \"surprisingly sweet\" to describe the musical, indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The review offers unqualified praise for the show's humor, tone, and book, clearly recommending the adaptation despite the brevity of the excerpt.",
