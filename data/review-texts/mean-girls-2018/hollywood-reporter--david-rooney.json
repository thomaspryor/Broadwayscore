  "bwwExcerpt": "Ironically, given that the musical has a more cartoonish quality amplified by the extensive use of video in the design, the key transformation plays more believably on stage. That's also because fresh-faced Henningsen, with her big, bright voice, brings such assurance to Cady's ricochets from guileless adventurer in a strange land to cool conqueror and back to humbled do-gooder, who is able to see the redeeming qualities in everyone. And Henningsen's sweet chemistry with Selig lends spark to their scenes; Aaron's own reawakening from Regina's spell contributes to Cady's growth as he tears down her misguided belief that 'More is Better.'",

This indicates a positive recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review is positive, calling the show \"fun\" but noting that it doesn't quite reach the heights of the source material, indicating a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The critic delivers a clear recommendation ('as much fun as you'd expect') while qualifying it with a reservation about the show not matching the original film's satirical edge, placing it in the solid positive range with caveats.",
