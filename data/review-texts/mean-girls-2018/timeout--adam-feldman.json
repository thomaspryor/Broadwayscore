  "bwwExcerpt": "Where Mean Girls glows most is in the spotlight it shines on its cast. Taylor Louderman is sensational as the blackhearted Regina, fearsome leader of the queen-beeyatch trio known as the Plastics. (Richmond gives her brassy, Bond-villain musical themes.) Flanking her are the manically insecure Gretchen (Ashley Park, her confusion infused with real feeling) and the chipper, empty-headed Karen (an extremely funny Kate Rockwell, with a tottering walk and a face like a blank check); on the opposite side of the cafeteria battlefield are the gothy 'art freak' Janis (Barrett Wilbert Weed, a rich presence and powerhouse vocalist) and the brightly flaming Damian (Grey Henson, whose second-act tap number, 'Stop,' does exactly that to the show). Mean Girls's gospel of female self-actualization is borne out in the platform it provides for some of the most exciting young performers in musical theater. They bring a lot to the cafeteria table.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating aligns with Mixed bucket. Language is balanced - 'solid, entertaining' suggests competence but 'could have been so much more' indicates disappointment with unrealized potential. | GPT-4o: The critic describes the show as 'solid' and 'entertaining' but notes it doesn't transcend its material, aligning with a mixed review. The original rating of 60 supports this classification. | Gemini: The review is mixed, calling the show solid and entertaining but also stating it could have been more. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60/100 rating places this firmly in the Mixed range. The review acknowledges the show is entertaining and competent ('solid,' 'hits its marks') but explicitly states it fails to transcend expectations, indicating a middle-ground assessment rather than a recommendation.",
