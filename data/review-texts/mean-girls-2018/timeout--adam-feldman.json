    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating aligns with Mixed bucket. Language is balanced - 'solid, entertaining' suggests competence but 'could have been so much more' indicates disappointment with unrealized potential. | GPT-4o: The critic describes the show as 'solid' and 'entertaining' but notes it doesn't transcend its material, aligning with a mixed review. The original rating of 60 supports this classification. | Gemini: The review is mixed, calling the show solid and entertaining but also stating it could have been more. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60/100 rating places this firmly in the Mixed range. The review acknowledges the show is entertaining and competent ('solid,' 'hits its marks') but explicitly states it fails to transcend expectations, indicating a middle-ground assessment rather than a recommendation.",
