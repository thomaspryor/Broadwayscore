  "bwwExcerpt": "Vibrant, beautifully sung and visually splendid, this funny charmer - book by Fey, music by Jeff Richmond and lyrics by Nell Benjamin - broadens the original Paramount movie - a bar-raiser for teen flicks - to full musical comedy scale without sacrificing any of the mordancy and compassion that made a superstar of Lindsay Lohan and a generational descriptor of the title.
