  "bwwExcerpt": "In setting this 'cautionary tale' to music, Fey and lyricist Nell Benjamin (Legally Blonde) have more latitude to explore the internal lives of these now-iconic characters. Though Henningsen's Cady is more broadly naive than the one originated by Lindsay Lohan, her earnest vocals bring a quality of sweetness to numbers like 'Stupid In Love' - in which Cady professes her equal devotion to math and her new crush Aaron Samuels (Kyle Selig). Henningsen finds her character's edge by her fifth number, 'Apex Predator' - a rocking tribute to Regina's top-of-the-food-chain status, and the reveal of Cady's primal desire to be popular. 'What's Wrong With Me?' shows poor Gretchen Wieners - played with a perfect mix of comic anxiety and melancholy by Ashley Park - in a rare moment of reflection: 'Where is my mind? Where does it end? Maybe I need to find a better friend?'",
