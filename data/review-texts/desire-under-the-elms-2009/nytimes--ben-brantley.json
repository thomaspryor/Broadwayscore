    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the lead performance and direction choices, but acknowledges the source material's inherent challenges. With only one curated quote available, confidence must remain low as this may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Mendes' performance for adding energy to a potentially static play, suggesting a positive impact. However, the limited context and single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious, low-confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises a specific performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the production. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the lower end of the positive bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead's performance, suggesting she brings essential dynamism to overcome the text's static nature, indicating a clearly positive assessment. However, as a single curated excerpt, it may not represent the full review's verdict on the overall production.",
