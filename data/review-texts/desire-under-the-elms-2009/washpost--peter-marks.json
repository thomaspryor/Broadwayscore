Medium confidence due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt compares the production unfavorably to a high school staging, suggesting it falls far short of Broadway standards. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt compares the production unfavorably to a high school staging, indicating a negative assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic delivers a harsh assessment comparing the production to amateur theater, finding it unworthy of the material's stature. Given this is a single curated excerpt, the score reflects a solid negative verdict while acknowledging the limited context available.",
