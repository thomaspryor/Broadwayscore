    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies - this quote identifies fundamental structural issues but doesn't provide clear recommendation. The framing as 'the problem' suggests criticism, placing it in Mixed territory given the limited context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a fundamental issue with the show, suggesting a lack of focus. Without additional context, it's unclear if there are redeeming qualities, leading to a mixed assessment. | Gemini: The critic identifies a core problem with the show, suggesting it fails to effectively balance its multiple elements. Given the limited excerpt, a negative score seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt identifies a significant structural problem with the show's conception, criticizing its lack of focus in attempting to combine multiple disparate genres and elements into one production. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Negative",
