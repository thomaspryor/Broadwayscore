However, the mention of 'clichés' and 'conventions' suggests some reservations, leading to a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review describes the show as a \"loving tribute\" and highlights its crowd-pleasing moments, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The single-sentence excerpt frames the show as a successful and 'loving tribute' that effectively deploys golden age conventions to crowd-pleasing effect, though the text appears truncated and lacks a definitive recommendation.",
