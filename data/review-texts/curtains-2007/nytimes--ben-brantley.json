'Less than the sum of its parts' indicates disappointment. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for being overly eager to please and ultimately less effective than its components suggest. This indicates a negative assessment without any redeeming praise. | Gemini: The review clearly states that the show is \"exhausting\" and \"less than the sum of its parts,\" indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic describes the production as exhausting and less than the sum of its parts, indicating a clear negative verdict without citing redeeming qualities.",
