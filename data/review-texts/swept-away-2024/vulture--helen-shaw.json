Neither recommends nor discourages clearly. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges moments of beauty but criticizes the musical for its earnestness and an ineffective book, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges \"moments of real beauty\" but ultimately finds the show \"undone\" by its earnestness and weak book. This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges genuine aesthetic strengths ('moments of real beauty') but delivers a disappointed final verdict ('ultimately undone'), suggesting a divided assessment typical of mixed reviews. Given this is a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
