    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows structural criticism about pacing/length without clear recommendation. The tone suggests issues with the show's development, placing it in mixed territory, but excerpt is too limited for confident assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a critique of the show's pacing, indicating a mixed sentiment. The lack of additional context and the single excerpt warning lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The critic suggests the show is too short to fully develop, implying potential but ultimately mixed feelings. Given the single excerpt and the truncation, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates unusual engagement (wanting more content) but emphasizes structural flaws from brevity; qualified positive given limited context.",
