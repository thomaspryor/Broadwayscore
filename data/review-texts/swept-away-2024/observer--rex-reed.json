    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong metaphorical language praising the show's power and emotional impact, but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness of full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong, enthusiastic language ('force and fury of a hurricane') suggesting a highly positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong, positive language like \"force and fury\" and suggests a powerful emotional impact on the audience. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the Positive range, but with low confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt employs vivid, superlative imagery ('force and fury of a hurricane') to praise the show's powerful impact, placing it in the upper range of positive recommendations. However, with only a single curated excerpt available, confidence must remain low regarding the full review's sentiment.",
