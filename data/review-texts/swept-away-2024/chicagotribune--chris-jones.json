  "bwwExcerpt": "I suspect “Swept Away” will end up as the most niche of this fall’s armada of Broadway musicals; it’s an unusual, all-male piece that doesn’t offer obvious commercial appeal, especially given its dire theme for a big Broadway night out. But it strikes me as a weird, sure, but also daring interpretation of a kind of music we only rarely hear on Broadway.",
