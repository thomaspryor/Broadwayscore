    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Single excerpt shows criticism of the show's execution ('falls prey to roteness') despite creative team efforts. However, with only one curated quote available, the full verdict is unclear - this could be from a longer mixed or negative review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, highlighting the show's tendency to be rote despite creative efforts. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates that the show 'often falls prey to this roteness,' suggesting a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt and warning, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the show as mechanically predictable ('rote') despite its thematic ambitions, indicating the production fails to transcend formulaic storytelling. With only one curated quote available, the assessment carries low confidence.",
