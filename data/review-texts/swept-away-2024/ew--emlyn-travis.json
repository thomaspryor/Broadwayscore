  "bwwExcerpt": "Without spoiling anything, Swept Away is a musical that will keep viewers on their toes until its final moments — even if it does rush its ending a smidge. In fact, attendees may find themselves wanting to take in a secondary viewing (after the adrenaline wears off, of course) to catch glimpses of what they missed the first time around; I’m certain that there were subtle cues from each of the actors that I didn't notice in my flurry to catch all of the action. But, be prepared: The powerful performances and message of brotherhood and sacrifice will stick with you long afterward. Steel your heart, grab a lifejacket, and set sail for the Longacre Theatre as soon as possible. Grade: A",
