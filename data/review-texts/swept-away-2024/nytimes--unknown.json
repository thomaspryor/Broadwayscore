    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt emphasizes strong theatrical elements (visual panache, song) while positioning the show as artistically significant ('among the darkest, most unsparing'). Positive framing suggests critical appreciation, but low confidence due to limited excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the musical's dark and unsparing nature, which suggests a unique experience but does not clearly indicate a positive or negative recommendation. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning necessitates a low confidence score. | Gemini: The quote acknowledges positive aspects like music and visuals but also highlights the show's dark and unsparing nature, suggesting a qualified recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges production strengths (visuals, vocals) but emphasizes the show's dark, intense nature without clear recommendation language. The concessive structure ('For all its...') suggests the darkness outweighs the surface pleasures. Single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Mixed",
