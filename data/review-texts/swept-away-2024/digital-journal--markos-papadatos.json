  "bwwExcerpt": "Overall, “Swept Away” is a high-adrenaline and pulse-pounding new Broadway musical. The music by The Avett Brothers is quite catchy and it will stick with the audience well after the show is over; moreover, it will certainly spark conversations among viewers. The acting performances by the cast members are riveting and electric all around. It is able to delve beyond the surface, and there is an honesty and authenticity to it like no other, and “Swept Away” stands out in a raw and unflinching manner. It is a stirring tale of shipwreck, salvation, forgiveness, and brotherhood that is set on the high seas. It is worth checking out, and it garners 4.5 out of 5 stars.",
