    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('gorgeous, haunting work', 'profound meaning') suggests enthusiastic recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('gorgeous', 'haunting', 'profound meaning'), suggesting a highly favorable view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"gorgeous\" and \"haunting\", indicating a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong aesthetic praise ('gorgeous,' 'haunting,' 'profound meaning') indicating a clear recommendation in the upper range of Positive, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
