    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic uses positive language ('awesomely different') and frames uniqueness as a virtue. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('awesomely different', 'totally unexpected') indicating a highly favorable view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The quote is highly positive, calling the show \"awesomely different and totally unexpected\". Given that this is the only excerpt, I'm scoring it as a strong positive, but with low confidence due to the lack of context. | Kimi: The single excerpt employs strong positive language ('awesomely different'), indicating clear enthusiasm, though the limited context requires low confidence.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "The good news is that Mayer is in top form with his latest Broadway entry. The new musical “Swept Away” opened Tuesday at the Longacre Theatre, and it helps immeasurably that this divisive director is working with great material here. In its first half, the musical recalls the grandeur of Benjamin Britten’s opera “Billy Budd.” Then Rachel Hauck’s set capsizes – the ship really flips over! – and the musical turns into an intimate chamber piece with its four survivors starving and slowly spinning around in the middle of the sea.",
