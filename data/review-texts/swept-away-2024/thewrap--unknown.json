    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic uses positive language ('awesomely different') and frames uniqueness as a virtue. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('awesomely different', 'totally unexpected') indicating a highly favorable view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The quote is highly positive, calling the show \"awesomely different and totally unexpected\". Given that this is the only excerpt, I'm scoring it as a strong positive, but with low confidence due to the lack of context. | Kimi: The single excerpt employs strong positive language ('awesomely different'), indicating clear enthusiasm, though the limited context requires low confidence.",
