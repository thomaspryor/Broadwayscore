However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights positive aspects of the musical, specifically the performances and songs, suggesting a positive but potentially qualified recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers specific praise for vocal performances and identifies multiple highlights, suggesting clear approval of the production. However, confidence is low given this is a single curated excerpt that may not reflect the full review's verdict.",
