    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises lead performer and highlights specific musical moments in a show described as having 'no shortage of quietly devastating moments,' suggesting overall quality. However, this is only one excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and highlights the emotional impact of the musical, suggesting a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises specific performances and highlights, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic review. Given the limited text, a score in the lower-middle of the positive range seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the vocal performances and emotional impact, describing moments as 'quietly devastating' and duets as 'highlights,' indicating clear approval despite limited context.",
