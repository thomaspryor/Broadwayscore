    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'unusual but daring,' which suggests a positive view, albeit with some reservation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt is positive, calling the show \"unusual but daring.\" Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the lower end of the positive bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt contains qualified positive evaluative language ('daring') suggesting the show is worthwhile despite its unconventional nature. However, given the single-excerpt warning and extreme brevity, the score is placed at the lower end of the Positive bucket with low confidence.",
