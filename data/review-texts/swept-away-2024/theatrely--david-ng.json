    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The review acknowledges emotional authenticity as a positive but criticizes the forced plot structure. The 'even when' construction suggests significant reservations that temper the praise. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the emotional authenticity of the musical but notes that the plot feels forced, indicating a mixed assessment with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review suggests the show is \"emotionally authentic\" but acknowledges that the plot feels forced at times. This indicates a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers genuine praise for the show's emotional authenticity, presenting the criticism about the forced plot as a secondary concession rather than a primary flaw, suggesting a qualified recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
