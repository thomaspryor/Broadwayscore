    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: This appears to be a truncated excerpt with a critical assessment that the show lacks emotional grounding, suggesting mixed-to-negative reception, but without more context the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The review suggests the show lacks emotional depth or connection, which is a significant criticism. However, the brevity of the review limits the confidence in the score. | Gemini: The critic states that the musical \"never quite finds its emotional anchor,\" indicating a negative assessment and a lack of recommendation. | Kimi: The critic identifies a fundamental flaw—the show's failure to find an emotional anchor—but the extremely brief text appears truncated or excerpted, warranting caution against a definitive negative score until the full verdict is visible. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",
