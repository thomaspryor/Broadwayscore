However, this appears to be a very brief excerpt, limiting confidence in the assessment. | GPT-4o: The review suggests a lack of emotional impact, implying the show does not succeed in engaging the audience as intended. | Gemini: The critic states that the musical \"never quite finds its emotional anchor,\" which is a negative assessment, placing it in the negative bucket. | Kimi: The critic identifies a fundamental flaw in the production, noting that despite its premise, the show fails to establish the emotional connection necessary for success. The measured but decisive criticism suggests the production doesn't work overall.",
