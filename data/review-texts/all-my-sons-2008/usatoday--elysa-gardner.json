    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising lead performances with 'nuanced intensity' suggests positive recommendation, but limited text prevents fuller assessment of overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of Lithgow and Wiest, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range to account for potential cherry-picking. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances of Lithgow and Wiest, suggesting a positive aspect of the production. Given the limited text, a score in the lower-middle of the 'Positive' range seems appropriate. | Kimi: Single excerpt praises the lead actors' performances with 'nuanced intensity' but offers limited evaluative context on the production overall. Given the single-excerpt warning that such quotes may be cherry-picked, this warrants a conservative score in the lower Positive range.",
