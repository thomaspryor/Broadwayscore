However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive transformation of the play, suggesting a worthwhile production. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the director's transformative vision, describing the result as 'expressionistic and haunting'—language that indicates a successful, atmospheric production worth seeing, though the limited excerpt prevents a higher confidence rating.",
