  "bwwExcerpt": "Contrasting with video designer Jeff Sugg's horrific clips of doomed airplanes plummeting to the ground, O'Brien's production is decidedly low-key. Letts' Joe is an unremarkable everyman, happy to retire comfortably. Bening's Kate, living in an era when wives don't have much choice in the matter, determinedly stands by her husband's claims of innocence, knowing that her personal future is dependent on his. Walker's Chris, whose wartime experiences may have instilled a greater empathy for others, is an earnest voice of emerging ideals.",

The single available quote makes assessment difficult. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a neutral to slightly positive description of the production and performances, but lacks strong praise or criticism. The tone suggests a mixed review, with some appreciation for the performances and production elements, but no clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the characters and production style, but doesn't offer a clear recommendation. The tone is neutral, suggesting a mixed or lukewarm response. | Kimi: The excerpt analyzes performances and production choices with descriptive language that implies committed acting ('earnest,' 'determinedly') and thoughtful staging ('decidedly low-key'), but lacks explicit recommendation or strong praise. Single excerpt limits confidence.",
