  "bwwExcerpt": "A thrilling cast rise to the challenge of making this entirely believable, fraught and eventually scorching. As matriarch Kate, Annette Bening is devastating as well as devastated: a woman clinging to hope, despite knowing in her heart that it is hopeless. And Tracy Letts -- who is also a playwright who wrote the Tony and Pulitzer Prize-winning August: Osage County -- is equally superb as a man consumed by his secrets.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the cast with vivid language ('thrilling', 'devastating', 'scorching', 'superb'). Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds clearly positive so scored at upper end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast's performance as 'thrilling' and 'scorching', with specific commendation for Annette Bening and Tracy Letts. The language suggests a strong positive impression, though the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"thrilling,\" \"entirely believable,\" \"devastating,\" and \"superb,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strong superlatives like 'thrilling,' 'devastating,' and 'superb' to praise the lead performances, indicating clear enthusiasm. However, as a single curated excerpt focused narrowly on acting, confidence is reduced regarding the overall production verdict.",
