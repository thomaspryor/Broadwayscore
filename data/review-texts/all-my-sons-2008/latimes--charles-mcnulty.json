  "bwwExcerpt": "O'Brien's production includes actors of color in important roles. Hampton Fluker plays George and Chinasa Ogbuagu plays Sue Bayliss, a neighbor with sharp opinions on the Keller family's self-deceiving ways. The casting, neither colorblind nor thematic, is part of a theatrical tradition that has become more or less standard. If the company seems unsettled, the issue isn't race but style. O'Brien's ensemble mixes realism with contemporary classicism in a catch-as-catch-can way. It's the acting equivalent of a mixed salad.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt criticizes the production's inconsistent style and describes the ensemble as 'unsettled' and 'catch-as-catch-can,' suggesting significant flaws despite praising casting choices. | GPT-4o: The excerpt discusses the casting and acting style, noting a lack of cohesion ('unsettled') and a mix of styles ('catch-as-catch-can'). This suggests a mixed assessment, with no clear recommendation or strong praise. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the production as an 'acting equivalent of a mixed salad' and 'unsettled,' indicating a mixed or neutral assessment. The lack of a clear recommendation and the negative undertones suggest a score in the mixed range. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the ensemble as 'unsettled' and the acting approach as inconsistent ('catch-as-catch-can,' 'mixed salad'), indicating uneven execution rather than complete failure. As this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's verdict, confidence is low.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The production seems caught between a solid midcentury Broadway realism and a more theatrically fluid 21st century approach. But the core of the play, the situation of a disillusioned son’s inevitable confrontation with his hypocritical father that Miller would potently redeploy in 'Death of a Salesman,' is explosively renewed...O’Brien’s ensemble mixes realism with contemporary classicism in a catch-as-catch-can way. It’s the acting equivalent of a mixed salad.\"\n\nRead more"
