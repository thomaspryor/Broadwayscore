    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Extremely strong praise for Lithgow's performance described as 'highest order' acting that 'transforms' the play 'into something approaching greatness.' However, single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Lithgow's performance as transformative and of the highest order, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising Lithgow's performance as acting of the highest order and suggesting it elevates the play to greatness. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified superlatives for Lithgow's performance and its transformative effect on the production, describing it as 'acting of the highest order' that elevates the drama to 'greatness.' As a single curated excerpt, it represents the upper range of positive reception, though the full review may have contained additional context.",
