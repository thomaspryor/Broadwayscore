She also has terrific technique...But the opacity of the production overall means we still can’t read her with any clarity, and the play acquires a weird wobble at its core...The production is almost never moving, except when Ann’s brother, George, shows up intending to expose everyone’s lies.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite praise for Bening's performance and technique, the critic finds the production 'literal-minded,' lacking resonance, with 'opacity' and a 'weird wobble at its core.' The overall assessment is negative with isolated positive moments. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights significant issues with the production, describing it as 'literal-minded' and lacking resonance. While there is praise for Ms. Bening's performance, the overall tone suggests disappointment with the production's impact. | Gemini: The review criticizes the production as \"literal-minded\" and \"opaque,\" leading to a \"weird wobble.\" While praising Bening's performance, the overall assessment is negative. | Kimi: While the critic praises Annette Bening's technique and emotional depth, the verdict on Jack O'Brien's production is sharply negative: it is described as opaque, emotionally inert ('almost never moving'), and possessing a 'weird wobble at its core.'",
