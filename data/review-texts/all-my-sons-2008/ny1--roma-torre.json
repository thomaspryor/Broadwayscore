What could so easily turn melodramatic is directed by O'Brien to maximum dramatic effect without sacrificing emotional honesty...The three principals, acting their hearts out, seem right at home.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with superlatives like 'shattering' and 'devastating,' highlighting exceptional direction and performances. Single excerpt warning applied - this reads as enthusiastic recommendation placing it in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('shattering production', 'devastating scene') and praises the direction and performances. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt contains very strong positive language such as \"shattering production\" and \"devastating scene\", indicating a strong recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives like 'shattering' and 'devastating' alongside praise for direction and performances, but is scored in the high Positive range per the single-excerpt warning guidelines.",
