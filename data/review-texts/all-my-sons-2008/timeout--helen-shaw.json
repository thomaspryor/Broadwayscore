  "bwwExcerpt": "First Bening combusts, then Walker goes up like a Roman candle, and ultimately Letts collapses in an avalanche of dust. There are other strong elements in these final sequences, particularly Hampton Fluker's performance as the weirdly childlike George-who has been deeply wronged by the Kellers but who wants to forgive them anyway, because it would let him pretend to be innocent again. His dazzled eyes reflect the central trio, staggered by their charisma and blinded to any flaws. Does All My Sons have failings? Never you mind. All you'll be able to remember is a family of giants falling one after the other, like a stand of redwoods crashing down.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt uses powerful imagery ('combusts', 'Roman candle', 'avalanche', 'giants falling like redwoods') to describe transcendent performances. The dismissive 'Never you mind' about flaws suggests any issues are irrelevant compared to the impact. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses vivid, dramatic imagery to describe the performances, suggesting a powerful and memorable production. The phrase 'Does All My Sons have failings? Never you mind.' implies that any flaws are overshadowed by the production's strengths, indicating a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the powerful performances and impactful final sequences, suggesting a strong, memorable experience despite any potential flaws. The concluding sentence implies a highly positive overall impression. | Kimi: The critic lavishes superlatives on the lead performances ('combusts,' 'Roman candle,' 'giants'), explicitly dismisses potential flaws as irrelevant ('Never you mind'), and promises an unforgettable theatrical experience focused on powerhouse acting. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"There is a real and precious thing at the center of 'All My Sons.' It is the trio of Tracy Letts, Annette Bening and Benjamin Walker...All three are believable in every detail—blockbuster actors dedicated to small, unshowy connections to one another. In scene after scene, they do wonders. Around them, though, is a flatter and falser world...What does work after all the decades is Miller’s stunning climax, a series of emotional explosions.\"\n\nRead more",
