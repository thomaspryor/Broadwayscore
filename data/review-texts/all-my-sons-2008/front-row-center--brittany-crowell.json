Though still incredibly relevant to today’s audiences, the piece feels aged and dated in this production and doesn’t find a full life.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative verdict stating the revival 'isn't able to carry the full weight' of the play and 'feels aged and dated.' Despite praising one performance, the overall assessment is disappointing. Low confidence due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The review highlights significant issues with the production, such as ineffective blocking and a lack of new insight, despite acknowledging a standout performance. The overall tone suggests disappointment with the revival. | Gemini: The review states that the production feels aged and doesn't find a full life, and that the blocking didn't help the performances. While one performance is praised, the overall assessment is negative. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production as 'aged and dated' with ineffective blocking that fails to support the performances, offering only isolated praise for one actor. Given the single-excerpt warning, confidence is reduced, but the tone clearly discourages attendance.",
