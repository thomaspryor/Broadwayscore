  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'All My Sons' is moderately effective, with strong histrionics from its three leads, but never fully rises to the occasion. Miller's play resonates with contemporary relevance (think capitalistic excess, faulty airplane issues, and 'exoneration') but, at least in this version, seems more dated, wordy, and melodramatically contrived than ever…The emotional storm and stress reaches hurricane levels but, because the situations seem so carefully manufactured…it fails to truly break your heart.\"\n\nRead more",

'Moderately effective' but 'never fully rises to the occasion' signals mixed reception without clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges strong performances but criticizes the production for being dated and contrived, suggesting a mixed reception. The single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges strong performances but ultimately finds the production \"moderately effective\" and contrived, leading to a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic praises the three leads but ultimately finds the production dated and contrived, noting it 'fails to truly break your heart.' The 'moderately effective' assessment and qualified praise place this in the Mixed bucket.",
