  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"CK: We share general feelings on the play itself—chiefly, that it’s over-obvious and sanctimonious. I certainly felt the overly straightforward nature of this production did the play no favors. More than ever, it seemed like a parable that’s been plotted within an inch of its life...DF: Bening’s clearly a fine stage actor, but here she seems so deliberately drabbed down that it’s almost showy. Neither she nor Tracy Letts—also a terrific actor—ever convinced me they were a married couple.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Critics find the play 'over-obvious and sanctimonious' and criticize both the production approach and lead performances as unconvincing. However, single excerpt limits full assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the play as 'over-obvious and sanctimonious' and suggests the production's straightforwardness is detrimental. The performances are noted but not convincingly positive. The single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses negative sentiments about the play's obviousness and the production's straightforward nature, as well as the performances of the lead actors. Given the negative tone and lack of a clear positive counterpoint, I've classified it as negative. | Kimi: The excerpt offers criticism of the play's writing ('sanctimonious'), the production ('overly straightforward'), and the lead performances (lack of chemistry), indicating a negative verdict. However, with only a single curated excerpt available, confidence is reduced.",
