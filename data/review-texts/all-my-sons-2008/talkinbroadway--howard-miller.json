    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for performances ('beautifully rich') and production quality ('fine production'), emphasizing the play's enduring relevance and freshness. Single excerpt limitation requires medium confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'fine' and highlights the 'beautifully rich performances' of the leads, indicating a strong recommendation. The caution about a single excerpt suggests using the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses phrases like \"fresh and disturbing,\" \"beautifully rich performances,\" and \"fine production,\" indicating a strong positive assessment. The phrase \"holds up to this day, a remarkable work\" further reinforces this positive sentiment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the acting and deems the production 'fine' and the play 'remarkable,' warranting a high-positive score, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
