However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"maximum effect\", \"devastates you\", \"master class\", and explicitly recommends the revival. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Tracy Letts' 'master class' performance and explicitly recommends the revival, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence that this represents the full review's balance.",
