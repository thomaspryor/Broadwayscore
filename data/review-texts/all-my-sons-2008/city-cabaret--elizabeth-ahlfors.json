  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Skillfully revisited...O'Brien steers a sterling cast through the veneer of post-war complacency and delves into secrets and acrimony to unravel a shattering inevitability...Miller's language, always straightforward with an edge of poeticism and O'Brien's deft handling, heightens the dramatic fall-out with emotion and truth...Relevancy is clear here in Miller's second play...still delivered with smashing conviction over 70 years after he wrote it.”\n\nRead more",
