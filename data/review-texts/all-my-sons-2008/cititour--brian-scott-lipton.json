It's a truly triumphant performance that makes us sad for all we haven't been able to witness during her prolonged absence.\"\n\nRead more",

Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Bening's performance as 'truly triumphant', suggesting a strong positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on Annette Bening's \"triumphant performance\" and signals strong praise, suggesting a positive recommendation. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong praise ('truly triumphant') for the lead performance, suggesting a clear recommendation to see the show, though limited context prevents higher confidence or Rave classification.",
