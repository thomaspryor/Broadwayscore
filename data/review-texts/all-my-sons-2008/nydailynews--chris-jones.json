  "bwwExcerpt": "Letts' performance likely will strike some as odd or disconnected - I find it perfectly in tune with the moment, and there is much to like about Bening's work, too. Kate Keller is a tricky part - she can come off as merely an enabler or a kook. Bening comes up with something much richer, as does Walker, who is quite moving and, well, sad. It will take another generation or two to fix things, you think.",

However, the single excerpt warning and lack of a clear overall verdict suggest a cautious, mildly positive score. | Gemini: The review highlights positive aspects of the performances, particularly Letts' and Bening's, and describes Walker's performance as \"quite moving.\" While not an overwhelming rave, it leans towards a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the principal performances, with the critic finding Letts' work perfectly tuned, Bening's interpretation surprisingly rich, and Walker's turn genuinely moving, indicating a solid recommendation.",
