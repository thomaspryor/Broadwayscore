  "bwwExcerpt": "Letts' performance likely will strike some as odd or disconnected - I find it perfectly in tune with the moment, and there is much to like about Bening's work, too. Kate Keller is a tricky part - she can come off as merely an enabler or a kook. Bening comes up with something much richer, as does Walker, who is quite moving and, well, sad. It will take another generation or two to fix things, you think.",
