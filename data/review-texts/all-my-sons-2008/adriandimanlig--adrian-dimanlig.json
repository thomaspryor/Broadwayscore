Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly positive verdict. | Gemini: The review contains strong positive language such as \"enticing and successful\", \"one of the very best revivals of the season\", and \"stunning cast\". The reviewer explicitly encourages the reader not to miss the revival. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlatives ('masterfully', 'shattering', 'one of the very best revivals') and an explicit recommendation to see the show. However, as a single curated excerpt, it is scored at the upper end of the Positive bucket per guidelines for cherry-picked quotes. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
