  "bwwExcerpt": "This play is done a lot - What community theater hasn't trotted it out at least once? - so audiences generally know the story. But this cast breathes so much life into Miller's characters it feels like you're watching for the first time. Tracy Letts is compelling as Joe, a man who hides well his heavy guilt. As Kate, Annette Bening is a poignant mix of strength and despair, fighting off a grief she refuses to acknowledge. But it's Benjamin Walker as the tortured son Chris who most commands attention whenever he's on stage, so apparent is the fury he's brewing.",

The positive tone and focus on compelling performances suggest a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the cast for bringing new life to the play, highlighting strong performances from Letts, Bening, and especially Walker. The overall tone is positive, suggesting a worthwhile experience. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the principal performances, describing them as compelling, poignant, and commanding attention.
