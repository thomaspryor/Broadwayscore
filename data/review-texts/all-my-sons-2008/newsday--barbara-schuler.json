  "bwwExcerpt": "This play is done a lot - What community theater hasn't trotted it out at least once? - so audiences generally know the story. But this cast breathes so much life into Miller's characters it feels like you're watching for the first time. Tracy Letts is compelling as Joe, a man who hides well his heavy guilt. As Kate, Annette Bening is a poignant mix of strength and despair, fighting off a grief she refuses to acknowledge. But it's Benjamin Walker as the tortured son Chris who most commands attention whenever he's on stage, so apparent is the fury he's brewing.",
