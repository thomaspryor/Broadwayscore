This only diminishes the play's effectiveness as a both a tragedy and a cautionary tale. While Arthur Miller's 'All My Sons' still works as a very powerful indictment of capitalism in America, the Roundabout Theatre Company production makes it look much older than it actually is with all the emoting that goes on in the course of the evening.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic finds the direction heavy-handed and the production diminishing to Miller's powerful play, describing excessive emoting that makes it seem dated. However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict may be more nuanced. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the director's approach and suggests the production diminishes the play's impact, indicating a negative assessment. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a low confidence level. | Gemini: The review states that the direction diminishes the play's effectiveness, indicating a negative assessment of the production despite acknowledging the power of the source material. | Kimi: The critic finds the direction heavy-handed and the acting overdone, stating it diminishes the play's effectiveness and makes Miller's text feel dated.",
