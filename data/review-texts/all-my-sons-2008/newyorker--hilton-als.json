    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Balances praise for direction and performances against criticism of the play's symbolic execution. The 'but' structure indicates reservations that prevent a positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the acting and staging but notes a significant issue with the symbolism, indicating a mixed review. The single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the production is \"beautifully acted and staged\" but has reservations about the symbolism. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as a slightly positive review with reservations. | Kimi: While the critic offers strong praise for the acting and staging ('beautifully'), the note that the production fails to solve significant problems with the play's symbolism indicates a mixed verdict rather than a clear recommendation.",
