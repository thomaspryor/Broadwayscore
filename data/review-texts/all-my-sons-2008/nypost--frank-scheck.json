    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with 'stellar cast' and 'emotionally devastating' plus relevance claim suggests enthusiastic recommendation. Single excerpt warning means this could be cherry-picked positivity, but language is definitively positive, warranting upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast and describes the revival as emotionally impactful and relevant, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, with only a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the stellar cast and deems the revival emotionally devastating and relevant, indicating a strong positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong praise for the cast and describes the production as emotionally devastating and relevant, indicating a clear recommendation. As a single excerpt, confidence is lowered but the tone is distinctly positive.",
