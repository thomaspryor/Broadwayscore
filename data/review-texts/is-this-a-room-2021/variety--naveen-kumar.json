  "bwwExcerpt": "Satter, who serves as artistic director of the theater company Half Straddle, performs an impressive sleight of hand, coaxing suspense from a foregone conclusion like a rabbit from a hat. Satter's choreographic staging is marked by striking tableaux, as the agents circle their prey with a levity that grows cold - gradually, and then all at once.",
