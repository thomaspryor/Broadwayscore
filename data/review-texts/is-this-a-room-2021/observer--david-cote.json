  "bwwExcerpt": "The four actors - Emily Davis as Winner, Pete Simpson and Will Cobbs as Agents Garrick and Taylor, respectively, and Becca Blackwell as the slightly bumbling Unknown Male - are pure perfection. Performing with the easy rigor of a world-class string quartet, they draw tense and harrowing music from the source. The translucent Davis is like a raw nerve, glib, tough, terrified, vibrating fast to get herself out of this slow-motion bear trap. Simpson, with a fidgety, gross vibe, makes a simple cough",
