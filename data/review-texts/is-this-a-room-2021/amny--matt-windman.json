  "bwwExcerpt": "The FBI transcript is choppy, repetitive, and dull. However, 'Is This A Room' (which was conceived and directed by Tina Satter) is primarily concerned with what is not said - theatricalizing the tension, uncertainty, and awkwardness of the interrogation experience through body language. The production also employs hazy lighting, sudden blackouts, overlapping voices, pauses, and a dissonant score and sound design.",
