  "bwwExcerpt": "If you knew nothing about Winner, this effectively staged transcript - let's not call it a play - offers a vivid portrait of group male intimidation of a woman. The FBI team features a good cop (Pete Simpson), a bad cop (Will Cobbs) and a clown cop (Becca Blackwell, who even sports orange hair). As Winner, Emily Davis suffers a slow meltdown into near-hysteria as the men, search warrant in hand, literally invade her personal space. The title refers to a room in her house where the interrogation takes place.",
