    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Calls it 'one of the thrillingest thrillers ever to hit Broadway' and describes the theater as 'astonishing.' Despite being a single excerpt, the superlative language ('thrillingest,' 'astonishing') indicates strong enthusiasm warranting Rave classification. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language, describing the play as 'astonishing' and 'astonishingly emotional,' indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"thrillingest thrillers ever to hit Broadway\" and \"astonishing — and astonishingly emotional — theater.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it as positive with high end of the range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers high praise with superlatives like 'thrillingest thrillers ever' and 'astonishingly emotional,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, confidence is low as this is a single curated excerpt that may not capture the full review's nuance or any potential criticisms. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
