  "bwwExcerpt": "The show has you in the palm of its hand with the sharp observational comedy of its opening scenes and Judith Ivey’s hilarious turn as merry aunt Lavinia. And then it clenches its fist. Bone-dry one-liners calcify into a chilling portrait of parental expectations devoid of human warmth in a society where affection is inseparable from fortune.",
