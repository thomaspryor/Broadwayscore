  "bwwExcerpt": "'The Heiress' is so fine a play that it is capable of making a strong impression even in a flawed production. That's what happens here. Ms. Ivey is a knockout, and Mr. Strathairn is always worth seeing, even when, as is the case this time around, he fumbles the interpretive ball. But anyone who knows Mr. Wyler's wonderful film version, or who was lucky enough to see 'The Heiress' on Broadway in 1995, will know—and regret—what is missing from this revival.",
