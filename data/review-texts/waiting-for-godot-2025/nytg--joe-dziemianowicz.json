  "fullText": "Read our review of Waiting for Godot on Broadway, a revival of Samuel Beckett's classic tragicomedy reuniting Bill & Ted's Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter. Anyone going to see Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter in Waiting for Godot who’s hoping for a glimpse of their Bill & Ted film personas are in luck. There’s a fleeting in-joke just for them. Wait for it. Thank director Jamie Lloyd (Sunset Boulevard, A Doll’s House) for a sight gag Samuel Beckett never imagined when he wrote his absurdist tragicomedy about time, existence, and human suffering. Able star turns by Reeves as forgetful Estragon (aka Gogo) and Winter as his reflective friend Vladimir (aka Didi) ground this entertaining revival with the credible chemistry of longtime friends — hence their nicknames for each other. While the stars bring marquee magnetism, the production design lends mystery. The script’s stage directions call for “A country road. A tree. Evening.” Soutra Gilmour’s set features only a huge wood-paneled tube. Is it a hollow redwood? Arty tunnel to nowhere? Crafty storm drain? Who knows. But the circular shape squares with the play’s cyclical nature. Didi and Gogo gab and grouse. They wait for no-show Godot. Repeat. Broadway rookie Reeves (The Matrix, John Wick) shelves his surfer-dude charm to evoke melancholy as a man motoring on anxiety. He gamely throws himself around the set like a rag doll. Winter, who acted on Broadway as a kid in Peter Pan and The King and I, brings an impressive gravity as the deep-thinking Didi, who’s prone to contemplative dives. Brandon J. Dirden and Michael Patrick Thornton lend terrific support, respectively popping in as domineering grandstander Pozzo and his subservient companion Lucky, whose power dynamics eventually shift. At one point during the friends' not-so-excellent adventure, Gogo asks: “What do we do now, now that we are happy.” Didi says: “We wait for Godot.” Time loops endlessly; hope fades. Round and round they go. Like everybody else. Waiting for Godot play premiered in Paris in 1953, and Lloyd’s production marks the fifth time it has been on Broadway. While there’s scant action, there’s lots of talk. Vladimir and Estragon discuss time, suffering, Godot’s arrival, existence, memories, meaninglessness, religion, suicide, companionship, and the absurdity of life. It’s a funny-sad reflection on the human condition. Waiting for Godot is all about minimalism, but the show’s production design adds depth and dimension. Soutra Gilmour’s scruffy black costumes, from bowler hats to scuffed boots, mirror Didi and Gogo’s hardship as they languish in limbo. Jon Clark’s mood-enhancing lighting goes from glaring to shadowy to sickly green. Ben and Max Ringham’s sound design makes every word land. In the run-up to opening night, the play had earned a 71% audience approval rating on Show-Score, an online theatre review aggregator. Audience members commented on the cast, the play, and the design. Read more audience reviews of Waiting for Godot on Show-Score. Back in New York with a starry cast, Waiting for Godot makes you think about meaning in an indifferent world, and that’s a timely takeaway.

Incl. 1 15 min intermission. Samuel Beckett’s classic play is an existential comedy in which two characters, Vladimir and Estragon, wait for a man named Godot to arrive. Whether he comes at all might be besides the point. Samuel Beckett, one of Ireland’s most accomplished playwrights, wrote this play that has been staged countless times. Olivier Award winner Jamie Lloyd, most recently on Broadway with Sunset Boulevard, directs this production. It's a classic: in a poll conducted by the British Royal National Theatre in 1998/99, it was voted as the \"most significant English-language play of the 20th century.” The show does not have an age listing yet but children under four are not permitted in Broadway houses.

Terms like 'entertaining revival,' 'able star turns,' 'terrific support,' and 'makes you think' indicate a solid recommendation without overwhelming enthusiasm. | Gemini: The review is positive, highlighting the chemistry between the leads and the production design. It acknowledges the play's inherent nature (minimalism, lots of talk) but frames it as a funny-sad reflection on the human condition, making it a worthwhile experience. | Kimi: The review consistently praises the performances of both leads and supporting cast, the production design, and direction, calling the show 'entertaining' and a 'timely' reflection on the human condition with no significant reservations expressed.",
