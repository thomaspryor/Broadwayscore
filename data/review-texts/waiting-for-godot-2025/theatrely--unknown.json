  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Their finely tuned performances are unshowy and completely in service of the production. They're neither vaudevillians clowning for our enjoyment nor thespians hamming up each ponderous line. Reeves and Winters' work is quiet and grounded entirely in their genuine chemistry. When they share a quick hug at the top of Act 2, after a whole day of waiting has come and gone fruitlessly, it reveals a profound knowledge that they can find comfort in each other."
