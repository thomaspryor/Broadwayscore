  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Their finely tuned performances are unshowy and completely in service of the production. They're neither vaudevillians clowning for our enjoyment nor thespians hamming up each ponderous line. Reeves and Winters' work is quiet and grounded entirely in their genuine chemistry. When they share a quick hug at the top of Act 2, after a whole day of waiting has come and gone fruitlessly, it reveals a profound knowledge that they can find comfort in each other.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performances with specific, sophisticated language ('finely tuned', 'genuine chemistry', 'grounded'). However, this is only one curated excerpt focusing on acting, so the full review sentiment remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances as 'finely tuned' and 'quiet and grounded,' suggesting a positive view of the actors' work. However, the lack of a broader context or explicit recommendation limits the confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances as \"finely tuned\" and \"completely in service of the production,\" indicating a positive assessment. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range due to the strong language. | Kimi: The excerpt uses clearly positive language ('finely tuned,' 'profound,' 'genuine chemistry') to praise the lead performances, suggesting a solid recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is lowered since it may not capture the full review's verdict on the complete production.",
