  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Their finely tuned performances are unshowy and completely in service of the production. They're neither vaudevillians clowning for our enjoyment nor thespians hamming up each ponderous line. Reeves and Winters' work is quiet and grounded entirely in their genuine chemistry. When they share a quick hug at the top of Act 2, after a whole day of waiting has come and gone fruitlessly, it reveals a profound knowledge that they can find comfort in each other.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performances with specific appreciation for their chemistry and authenticity. However, this is only one excerpt focusing solely on acting, so the overall show assessment is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and chemistry of the actors, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious, low-confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the positive aspects of the performances, highlighting their authenticity and chemistry. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead actors' 'finely tuned' and 'profound' performances and their chemistry, though the single curated quote limits confidence in the overall verdict.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Lloyd’s vision takes place within a massive vortex (designed by Soutra Gilmour) that suggests an internet-age existence both futuristic and, by dint of its looking like a submarine cable, perilously tactile. It’s not the country road Beckett calls for, but the information superhighway. As in the best opera sets, it’s simple, gorgeous, effective and relentlessly watchable. Its brutalism creates some fantastic tableaux and allows for great moments of physical comedy, as the men run up its walls an",
