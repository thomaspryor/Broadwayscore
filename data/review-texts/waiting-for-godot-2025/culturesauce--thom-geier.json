  "bwwExcerpt": "Thom Geier , Culture Sauce: Reeves, in a striking Broadway debut, takes an approach that’s remarkably true to his persona. His Estragon recalls his slack-jawed hero from The Matrix series if Neo had refused both the red pills and the blue pills — one to see the world as it really is, and the other to live in blissful ignorance of the truth.
