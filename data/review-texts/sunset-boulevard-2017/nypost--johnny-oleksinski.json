However, the lack of broader context or evaluation of the entire production limits the strength of the recommendation. | Gemini: The review is very positive, stating that Glenn Close's performance is \"worth the price of admission alone,\" indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for Glenn Close's performance as Norma, calling it a 'force of nature' and explicitly stating she justifies the ticket price alone, indicating a strong recommendation despite the limited context.",
