  "bwwExcerpt": "Those clamouring for Glenn Close's musical return to Broadway won't be disappointed. She gives a suitably grandiose performance as the reclusive screen legend Norma Desmond in Lonny Price's production of Sunset Boulevard. Close more than matches the fiery energy of the 40-piece orchestra. With extravagant gestures, sensationalised poses, and enough shiny, lavish leisure wear to bedazzle Liberace, she makes certain Desmond will forever loom large, even if the pictures around her got small.",
