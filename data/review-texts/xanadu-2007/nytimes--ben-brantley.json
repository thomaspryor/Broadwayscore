    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic uses positive language ('cheerfully ridiculous', 'knowing send-up', 'valentine') suggesting the show succeeds as intentional camp, though the brief excerpt limits confidence in the full verdict. | Gemini: The review describes the musical as \"cheerfully ridiculous\" and a \"camp valentine,\" suggesting an enjoyable, albeit perhaps not highbrow, experience. This leans towards a positive recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: Brantley employs affectionate language ('cheerfully,' 'valentine,' 'knowing') to praise the show's campy self-awareness, framing its ridiculousness as intentional and enjoyable rather than a flaw, indicating a clear recommendation for this specific tone of entertainment.",
