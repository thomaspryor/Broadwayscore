Ha delivers as the distaff pugilist, but the mixture of comedy, drama and whimsy loses its focus in too many character subplots, positioning pic only for Asiaphile events.\n\nDevoted daughter of a onetime champ (ace action choreographer Jeong Du-hong), now a vegetable in a wheelchair, Son Myeong-ran (Ha) becomes a thorn in the side of klutzy gangster Jo Pil-je (Im Chang-jeong), hired by a realtor to clear a hillside barrio of its residents. Gradually, however, Jo starts to side with the feisty villagers. Subplots featuring two kids (Park Chang-ik, Park Yu-seon) and a wannabe businesswoman (Gang Ye-weon) cloud the main focus, which should be on Son’s prep, with her crusty trainer (Ju Hyeon, good), for a fight vs. an Asian female champ. Still, Ha throws herself into the convincing boxing scenes, proving again she has the makings of a real action heroine.",
