    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear appreciation for the show's self-aware, celebratory approach to its campy nature. 'Revels in' suggests joy and recommendation, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive tone, highlighting the show's self-awareness and enjoyment of its own style. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The quote indicates enjoyment and appreciation for the show's campy nature, suggesting a positive, albeit potentially qualified, recommendation. Given that it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt expresses clear enthusiasm for the production's confident commitment to its camp aesthetic ('revels in every... moment'), indicating a solid recommendation. Confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
