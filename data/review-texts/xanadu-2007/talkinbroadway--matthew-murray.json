    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic appreciates the show's self-aware embrace of camp, with 'revels in' suggesting enjoyment rather than criticism. Single excerpt limits confidence, but tone is clearly positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive tone, highlighting the show's self-awareness and enjoyment of its own style. The lack of full context and the single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious approach, but the language indicates a strong positive sentiment. | Gemini: The quote indicates a positive view of the show, suggesting it embraces its nature and is enjoyable. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The critic praises the show's self-awareness and enthusiastic commitment to its aesthetic, with 'revels' indicating strong appreciation, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full verdict.",
