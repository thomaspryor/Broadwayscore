The show is beautifully paced, exquisitely designed (Derek McLane), costumed (Emilio Sosa) and lit (Adam Honoré); what’s more, it pays honor to legendary actor/writer/activist Ossie Davis with love and respect.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Consistent praise for direction, pacing, design, and cast with terms like 'assured guidance,' 'magical feat,' 'beautifully paced,' and 'exquisitely designed.' Single excerpt limits confidence but tone is clearly positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction, pacing, design, and overall tribute to Ossie Davis, indicating a strong positive sentiment. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the direction, cast, and design elements. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the direction, cast, and design elements, describing the production as a 'magical feat' that is 'beautifully paced' and 'exquisitely designed.' As a single curated excerpt that may be cherry-picked, confidence is reduced.",
