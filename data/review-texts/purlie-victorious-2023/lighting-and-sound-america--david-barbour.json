  "showScoreExcerpt": "“I went into Purlie Victorious wondering if it might not feel dated or off-topic in terms of today's politics; I left in awe of the script's vigor, its distinctive mix of hilarity and righteous anger, and its insistence that, when it comes to racial injustice, we're all in it together. After a couple of seasons of plays filled with despair and anguish, Davis' humor has a bracing effect; countering evil with ridicule, he diminishes it, robbing it of its power. It's a weapon more playwrights could stand to wield.”\n\nRead more",
