  "showScoreExcerpt": "“ ‘Purlie Victorious’ was a radical play for Broadway in 1961, when the civil-rights movement was garnering national attention...The play remains radical today, and for the same reason...More important, the production, directed by Kenny Leon, Broadway’s go-to helmer of black-themed plays reinvigorates the jesting that animates the antic action.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic praises the production as 'reinvigorating' the play's comedic elements and speaks positively of Kenny Leon's direction. The word 'More important' signals the critic is emphasizing the production's strengths. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's ability to reinvigorate the play, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context slightly lower confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the production \"reinvigorates\" the play, suggesting a positive assessment. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the lower end of the upper range of the 'Positive' bucket.",
