  "showScoreExcerpt": "Purlie Victorious commits to the power of theatre to make people uncomfortable, and also the value and necessity of doing so. In today’s world of short attention spans, many of us are used to being able to stop watching when something pushes us too far, but in a theatre we don't have that luxury. I'm grateful for theatrical spaces that makes people sit with their discomfort, process it, ride it out, and keep going. In addition to laughter, the play evoked serious ideas to ponder and percolate.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear appreciation for the production's artistic merit and theatrical impact, expressing gratitude for the experience. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation and potential for cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play for its commitment to challenging audiences and provoking thought, indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the play's commitment to making people uncomfortable and evoking serious ideas, suggesting a positive and thought-provoking theatrical experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt expresses strong appreciation for the show's thematic ambition and emotional impact, with the critic noting gratitude for the theatrical experience and praising its ability to evoke both laughter and serious ideas. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
