    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows appreciation for the show's deeper meaning and themes, but limited text makes full assessment difficult. Positive language about triumph and healing suggests recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a positive evaluation of the show's themes and execution, emphasizing comedy's power to build community and heal. The tone suggests a strong recommendation, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as classic comedy with triumph over evil and healing through love, indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I've opted for a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt enthusiastically praises the show's comedic craft and thematic resonance regarding humanity's triumph over oppression, using strongly affirmative language ('heals,' 'triumph') that indicates a clear positive verdict, though the limited excerpt warrants reduced confidence.",
