The Tony hopes and 'marvelously performed' indicate strong enthusiasm warranting high Rave score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise across multiple aspects of the production, suggesting a highly positive overall impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using terms like \"truly funny,\" \"socially meaningful,\" and \"marvelously performed.\" The hope for Tony recognition further suggests a strong recommendation. However, due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise across multiple dimensions (humor, performance, social relevance) and includes award-worthy endorsement, though confidence is reduced due to single-excerpt availability.",
