    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The race car metaphor clearly frames this as an exciting, worthwhile experience despite potential repetitiveness. 'Heckuva ride' is enthusiastic praise, suggesting strong recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses a vivid metaphor to describe the show as an exciting experience, suggesting strong enthusiasm. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt compares the show to a race car ride, implying an enjoyable experience despite potential drawbacks. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic employs an enthusiastic metaphor comparing the show to a thrilling race car ride, explicitly calling it a 'heckuva ride.' While clearly positive, confidence is low due to availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
