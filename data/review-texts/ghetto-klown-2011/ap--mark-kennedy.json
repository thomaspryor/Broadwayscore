  "bwwExcerpt": "Leguizamo's pain has always been our gain through five deeply personal shows, and his new one is no exception. 'Ghetto Klown' is filled with hysterical stories...'I realized being on stage is my religion,' Leguizamo says at the end. 'Sharing my unhappiness on stage is my happiness.'
