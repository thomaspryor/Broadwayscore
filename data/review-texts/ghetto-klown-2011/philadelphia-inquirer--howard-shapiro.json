  "bwwExcerpt": "[The show] seems a bit much in two acts, and contains some business I don't understand...He's endearing when he speaks about his career, self-depricating when he speaks about himself and especially his relationship with a father who both intimidated and infuriated him, and who has left and indelible mark on his psyche.
