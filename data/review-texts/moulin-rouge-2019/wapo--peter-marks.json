  "bwwExcerpt": ": The antic unconventionality of director Baz Luhrmann's 2001 pop phenomenon \"Moulin Rouge!\" has been transformed into an eye-and-ear-pleasing - and altogether conventional - Broadway musical. With a glorious set by Derek McLane, more than 70 pop songs, and dynamic lead performances from Karen Olivo and Aaron Tveit, the show is engineered for an evening of easily digested diversions.",
