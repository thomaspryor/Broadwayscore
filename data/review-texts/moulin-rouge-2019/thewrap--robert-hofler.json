  "fullText": "Under the direction of Alex Timbers, a veteran of movie-to-stage musicals like \"Rocky\" and \"Beetlejuice,\" \"Moulin Rouge!\" re-creates that pre-show pandemonium only twice during the show itself and once again at the curtain call. Too often the stage musical gets bogged down in John Logan's uninspired book, which poorly mimics Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film about the consumptive cabaret courtesan Satine (Karen Olivo), who makes the mistake of falling in love with a novice composer named Christian (Aaron Tveit) when she's supposed to be bedding the wealthy Duke of Monroth (Tam Mutu).",
