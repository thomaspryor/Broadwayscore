    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses vivid, energetic language ('steamy', 'hot-blooded', 'vigorously performed') suggesting enthusiasm for the production. However, this is only a single curated excerpt from a larger review, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes an exciting and dynamic performance, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, with only one curated quote available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show in an intriguing and positive light, comparing it to popular songs. Due to the limited text, confidence is low, but the description suggests a positive experience. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic, evocative descriptors ('steamy', 'vigorously performed', 'hot-blooded') to paint an appealing picture of the production's energy and style. Following single-excerpt protocols for clearly positive quotes, this warrants the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
