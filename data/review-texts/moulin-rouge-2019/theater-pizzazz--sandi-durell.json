    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises the spectacle, costumes, sets, and 'stunningly talented cast' but notes the songs 'can become weary.' Single excerpt with mixed elements suggests qualified positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the spectacle and the cast, indicating a positive impression. However, it notes that the music can become weary, suggesting some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the spectacle, cast, costumes, and sets, but notes the music can become weary, suggesting a positive but not rave recommendation. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production's spectacle, costumes, sets, and 'stunningly talented' cast as driving forces of the show, with only a minor reservation about the music becoming 'weary.' This represents a clear positive recommendation despite being a single curated excerpt.",
