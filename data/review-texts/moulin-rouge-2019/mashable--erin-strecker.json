  "bwwExcerpt": "n that they disappear behind their corsetry and the love triangle so lopsided that it defies most laws of geometry. Any subtext has been shoved into a push-up bra and short shorts. It doesn't matter. Erin Strecker, Mashable : This is the best of what a jukebox musical can be: a thrilling burst of color and chorus and nostalgia and bold reimagining. There are a whopping 70 songs you know and love in the show - some full numbers, some just snippets. Happily, the songs have been updated to include the present, which means modern hits such as \"Shut Up and Dance\" sit nicely along classics like Elton John's \"Your Song.\" The tunes feel like they're coming a mile a minute, but rather causing confusion, at the performance I attended, there were gasps of recognition and excited applause breaks of delight as all the various medleys and mashups unfolded. Diane Snyder, The Telegraph : A $28 million musical championing bohemian artists? Sounds perfectly logical when that show is the stage adaptation",
