  "bwwExcerpt": "has a show that has it all: it's not just 70 songs that are rolled into one show, but also a canvas of spectacle and emotion that isn't just a floorshow but left me floored with its sublime artistry. Jesse Oxfeld, New York Stage Review : That's not to diminish any other parts of the staging or performance. Timbers, always an endlessly visually inventive director, has always had material that lived up to his specialties. ( Rocky comes to mind.) But Luhrmann's fantasia gives Timbers license to do his best work-while creating something that is a definitively theatrical experience, not just a pale imitation of the film. Melissa Rose Bernardo, New York Stage Review : No disrespect to headliners Karen Olivo (a Tony winner as Anita in 2009's West Side Story), who plays the tuberculosis-plagued performer/courtesan Satine, and Aaron Tveit (Catch Me If You Can, Next to Normal), as the lovestruck aspiring composer Christian but the real stars of this Moulin Rouge! are the artists who don't appear",
