  "bwwExcerpt": ": Imagine Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance,\" but as a steamy Spanish tango. Now imagine that's been mashed up with Britney Spears' \"Toxic\" and The White Stripes' \"Seven Nation Army,\" and vigorously performed by a group of hot-blooded bohemians in early 1900s Paris.

The Musical,\" a wildly entertaining adaptation of Baz Luhrmann's 2001 movie that opened Thursday at New York",
