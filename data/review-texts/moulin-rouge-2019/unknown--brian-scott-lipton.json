    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear enthusiasm for the production elements (scenery, ensemble, choreography) with strong recommendation language ('You'll want to'). However, confidence is low due to limited text - this could be cherry-picked praise from a mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the impressive ensemble and choreography, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the ensemble and choreography, suggesting a positive experience. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt contains explicit recommendation language ('You'll want to come early') and enthusiastic praise for the ensemble and choreography ('talented', 'like none you've ever seen'), indicating a positive verdict, though the single-excerpt limitation warrants reduced confidence.",
