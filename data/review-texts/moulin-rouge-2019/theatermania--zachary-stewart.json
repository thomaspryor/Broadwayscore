    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language using the show's own superlative ('Spectacular, Spectacular') and praising it as setting 'a high bar for showmanship.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives like 'Spectacular, Spectacular' and praises the show's high bar for showmanship, indicating a strong recommendation. However, the confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The title itself is very positive, and the excerpt states that it sets a high bar for showmanship. | Kimi: The single excerpt features enthusiastic praise ('spectacular,' 'sets a high bar') indicating a strong recommendation for the production's showmanship, though the limited context requires low confidence.",
