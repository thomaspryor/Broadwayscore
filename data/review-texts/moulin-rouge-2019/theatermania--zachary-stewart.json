    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic uses 'Spectacular, Spectacular' (repeating the show's signature phrase) and says it 'sets a high bar for showmanship.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives like 'Spectacular, Spectacular' and mentions setting a 'high bar for showmanship,' indicating strong praise. However, with only a single excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The title and excerpt are extremely positive, indicating a strong recommendation. Given it's the only excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers enthusiastic praise using superlatives ('Spectacular, Spectacular') and commends the production's showmanship, indicating a strong recommendation in the 80-84 range per excerpt guidelines. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
