The mention of 'forbidden pleasures' and 'spectacular' further supports a rave assessment. | Gemini: The phrase \"Critic's Pick\" and the description of the musical as \"spectacular\" and the performance as \"dazzling\" indicate a positive recommendation, though the single excerpt and lack of full text warrant a score in the middle of the positive range.",
