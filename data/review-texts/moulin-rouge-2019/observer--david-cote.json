  "fullText": "ng bustiers, satiny robes, and body-hugging gowns. And set designer Derek McLane has turned the inside of the Hirschfeld Theatre into a crystal-studded, heart-shaped, hopelessly romantic fantasyland. David Cote, Observer : Eighteen years later, with the property retooled, remixed and relocated to Broadway, how culturally relevant is Moulin Rouge! The Musical ? Neither rollicking prophet nor ham-fisted artifact, Luhrmann's splashy zeitflop is exactly where Broadway lives, for better or worse. The adaptation, with a tidy, problem-solving book by John Logan, female-and-trans-empowering choreography by Sonya Tayeh, and farce-with-a-heart maximalist staging by Alex Timbers, Moulin Rouge! sparkles like a million falling sequins, tickles like a chorus girls' feathers, and burns like a shot of absinthe engulfing your brain.
