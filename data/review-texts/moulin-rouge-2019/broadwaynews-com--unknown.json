  "fullText": "The Broadway exclamation point — once a marquee staple, later an overused joke — makes a roaring comeback with “Moulin Rouge!” This new musical, based on the Baz Luhrmann movie set in and around the fabled Parisian nightclub of the title, certainly earns its breathless punctuation mark. The Broadway exclamation point — once a marquee staple, later an overused joke — makes a roaring comeback with “Moulin Rouge!” This new musical, based on the Baz Luhrmann movie set in and around the fabled Parisian nightclub of the title, certainly earns its breathless punctuation mark. How eager is this show to dazzle and daze us into submission? Well, consider that the confetti gun, usually used to send the audience home in a festive mood, comes out near the top of the first act, spraying silver and gold paper out into the audience. (Fear not, if you find yourself disappointingly unbedazzled: It’s brought out later for an encore.) Already have an account? Sign in Already have an account? Log in",
