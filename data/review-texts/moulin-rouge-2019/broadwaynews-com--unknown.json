  "fullText": "The Broadway exclamation point — once a marquee staple, later an overused joke — makes a roaring comeback with “Moulin Rouge!” This new musical, based on the Baz Luhrmann movie set in and around the fabled Parisian nightclub of the title, certainly earns its breathless punctuation mark. The Broadway exclamation point — once a marquee staple, later an overused joke — makes a roaring comeback with “Moulin Rouge!” This new musical, based on the Baz Luhrmann movie set in and around the fabled Parisian nightclub of the title, certainly earns its breathless punctuation mark.
