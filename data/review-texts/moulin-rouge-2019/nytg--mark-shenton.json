Despite being a single excerpt, the superlative language suggests strong enthusiasm. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlative language ('has it all', 'left me floored', 'sublime artistry') suggesting a strong recommendation. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language indicates a rave review. | Gemini: The review excerpt is highly positive, using strong language like \"floored with its sublime artistry.\" Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the language suggests a strong positive score. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers enthusiastic praise with 'sublime artistry' and 'floored,' indicating a strong recommendation, though the single-excerpt format necessitates low confidence in the overall verdict. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
