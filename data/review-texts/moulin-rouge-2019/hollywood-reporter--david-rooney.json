The giddy 2001 screen collision of soaring romance and dazzling artifice helped resuscitate the movie musical. Stage director Alex Timbers and the creative team on this delirious theatrical reinvention take those Luhrmann impulses and run with them, crafting a gaudy and gorgeous jukebox pastiche in which eye-popping spectacle, off-the-charts energy and almost non-stop musical mashups provide the plush padding for a featherweight plot. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-article-mid-article-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\",\"mid-article\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[300,250],[2,2],[300,251],[620,350],[2,4],[4,2],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); The show is A LOT, in every sense, both intoxicating and exhausting in its unrelenting visual and sonic assault. But it virtually defies you not to be entertained. This is a wildly extravagant production that leaves no mystery as to where its reported $28 million budget has been spent. Negotiating the music rights alone must have cost a small fortune, while the sumptuous design elements induce whiplash as you try to take them all in. The massive box office during previews and effusive audience response suggest that Moulin Rouge! is a major crowd-pleaser, though it will need to sustain that business over the long haul to hit profit. But it&#8217;s safe to assume nobody will leave the Al Hirschfeld Theatre feeling they haven&#8217;t gotten a big, glitzy, sexy bang for their buck. The lush sensory overload kicks in even during the preshow, as louche demimonde denizens slink around the stage and drape themselves decadently in the boxes, the women in beaded corsets, plumage and fishnets, the men in dandyish tailcoats, puffing on cigars and shooting insinuating looks into the crowd. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article2-uid1' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid\",\"mid-article2\",\"mid-articleX\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article2\") .addSize([[300,250],[300,251],[620,350],[2,4],[4,2],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Derek McLane&#8217;s immersive set is a fantasia in hot reds and pinks, with the blades of the windmill that gives the eponymous nightclub its name slowly turning on one side of the stage and the giant elephant that houses the dressing room of the risqu&eacute; cabaret venue&#8217;s star act, Satine (Karen Olivo), on the other. The playing space is framed in filigreed hearts, nesting one inside the other, while the Moulin Rouge neon spans the entire stage width. Beneath that signage at the front of the passerelle, two shapely female sword-swallowers do their thing, inhaling steel like it&#8217;s a titillating sex act. The show proper hasn&#8217;t even started, and already, Timbers and Co. have taken Bazmatazz to a whole new level, bowing with flamboyant theatricality to the more-is-more aesthetic of Luhrmann and his wife and design collaborator Catherine Martin, who get a &#8220;creative services&#8221; credit here. Some will find it a bombastic onslaught, but plenty more will eat it up. The general contours of the story remain unchanged. With his Belle &Eacute;poque bo&icirc;te deep in debt and risking bankruptcy, impresario Harold Zidler ( Danny Burstein ) urges Satine to ply her courtesan trade on the stinking rich Duke of Monroth (Tam Mutu) to secure the club an urgent cash infusion. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid2' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"btf\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-articleX\") .addSize([[300,250],[300,251],[620,350],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setLazyLoadMultiplier(2) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); At the same time, penniless composer Christian ( Aaron Tveit ), an Ohio transplant who has come to Paris in search of Bohemian adventure, forms a fast friendship with Left Bank artist Toulouse-Lautrec (Sahr Ngaujah) and tango-dancing Argentinian gigolo Santiago (Ricky Rojas). They enlist his songwriting skills on a musical melodrama they hope to have produced at the Moulin Rouge. In scenes of goofy mistaken-identity comedy, Satine receives Christian in her chambers, believing him to be the Duke. While she writhes sensually, Christian labors under the impression he&#8217;s auditioning material for her; before they even get through a chorus of Elton John&#8217;s &#8...",
