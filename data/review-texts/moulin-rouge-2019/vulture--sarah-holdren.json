  "bwwExcerpt": ": For all its splashy, glittery, high-kicking, butt-cheek-baring, sword-swallowing maximalism, Moulin Rouge! is something more unsettling than not good. It's not even very interesting. There's a shapelessness about it, a weird enervation underneath the flash and bang.

The show veers broadly away from its beloved-by-millennials-everywhere source material, which in itself is no crime. But the path it",
