    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic uses the metaphor of an empty decorated package, calling it 'indifferent to historical context and narrative logic' - clear criticism of substance. However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict may differ from this curated quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as lacking substance and indifferent to context and logic, suggesting a negative view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is negative, describing the show as empty and indifferent to historical context and narrative logic. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: While acknowledging the production's visual polish ('brightly wrapped, intricately decorated'), the critic condemns the show as hollow ('little inside') and criticizes its narrative logic and historical care, implying it prioritizes style over substance.",
