However, confidence is low due to limited excerpt text that may not capture the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the spectacle and sensory appeal but criticizes the show for feeling 'oddly hollow at its core.' This suggests a mixed verdict with both positive and negative elements. The excerpt is limited, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's visual appeal but ultimately finds it emotionally unfulfilling, suggesting a mixed experience. The truncated text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The review offers strong praise for the production's spectacle ('feast for the senses,' 'spectacular') but balances this with significant criticism about emotional emptiness ('hollow at its core,' 'leaves you hungry for more'), creating an ambivalent assessment without a clear recommendation. Confidence is low due to excerpt-only availability.",
