  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessReview by Celia WrenAt the start of “Moulin Rouge! The Musical,” the award-winning extravaganza now at the Kennedy Center Opera House, two showgirl characters do a circus trick — a sword-swallowing act — seeming to ingest the blades until only the hilts are visible, before drawing the weapons out safely. If only the rest of the show pulled off its bold moves with as little damage.\n\n78 CommentsMost ReadMatt ViserTrump tries humor, gets some silence at black-tie dinner with ‘people I hate’February 1, 2026Janay Kingsberry, Travis Andrews, Niha Masih and Leo SandsTrump plans to close Kennedy Center for about two years, starting in July3 hours agoFaiz Siddiqui, Nitasha Tiku and Elizabeth DwoskinInside Musk’s bet to hook users that turned Grok into a porn generatorEarlier todayNewsletterFridaysBook ClubOur weekly selection of book reviews and recommendations from Book World editor Ron Charles.Sign up",

This balanced critique with no clear recommendation falls into Mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the spectacle and sensory appeal of the production but criticizes it for lacking depth, suggesting a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the spectacle but also notes a hollowness, suggesting a recommendation with reservations. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the lower end of the positive range.",
