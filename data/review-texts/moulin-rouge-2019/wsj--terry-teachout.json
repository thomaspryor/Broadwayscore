  "fullText": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/moulin-rouge-the-musical-review-pop-opera-excess-11564101001\n\nShareResizeDanny Burstein as Harold Zidler Matthew MurphyNew York\n\nIt was after seeing Baz Luhrmann’s “Moulin Rouge!” in 2001 that I decided his “Strictly Ballroom,” the 1992 film that first brought him international fame, had been a one-off fluke. Lovely though “Strictly Ballroom” was and is, nothing that Mr. Luhrmann has done since then has caused me to think otherwise, “Moulin Rouge!” in particular. A pop-music jukebox-musical rewrite of “La Bohème” shot in the style of an octillion-dollar music video, it’s the campiest movie I’ve ever seen—it may well be the campiest movie ever made—and the only thing that I now remember about it with any particular clarity was Jim Broadbent lip-syncing “Like a Virgin” in drag. It was thus inevitable that someone would bring it to Broadway, where campy big-budget musicals usually draw a crowd, and that someone turns out to be Alex Timbers, who’s good at going big (the musical version of “Rocky” that he directed in 2014 ended with a total-immersion fight scene of the utmost spectacularity). That doesn’t mean the show itself is any good—it is, in fact, horrible—but it’s definitely big. Every cent of its $28 million budget is visible.",
