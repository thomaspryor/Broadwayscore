    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The phrase 'as opulent as it is empty' suggests visual spectacle without substance, and 'camp extravaganza' implies a lack of serious artistic merit. However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict may be more nuanced. | GPT-4o: The review describes the production as 'opulent' but also 'empty,' suggesting a visually impressive but perhaps shallow experience. The lack of full text and the single excerpt warning suggest a conservative score within the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The phrase \"as opulent as it is empty\" suggests a visually impressive but ultimately shallow experience, indicating a mixed reaction. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring in the middle of the Mixed range.",
