Single excerpt limits confidence but clearly positive verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the adaptation and direction, describing the show as 'paced for maximum pleasure.' The tone is enthusiastic, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very enthusiastic language ('maximum pleasure', 'jukebox musical on steroids') suggesting a strong positive recommendation. However, because it is a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as 'paced for maximum pleasure' with a 'very savvy adaptation,' indicating strong approval. However, confidence is low as only one curated excerpt is available.",
