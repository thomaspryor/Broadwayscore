  "bwwExcerpt": "With tongue in cheek and heart in hand, not to mention assorted other body parts splitting, contorting and can-canning up a storm, 'Moulin Rouge' is a jukebox musical on steroids. And thanks to a very savvy adaptation from book writer John Logan and director Alex Timbers, it's paced for maximum pleasure. Still erotically antic with near non-stop dancing courtesy Sonya Tayeh's exhilarating choreography, it's also emotionally engaging, which says quite a lot for a show that doesn't seem to take itself all that seriously.",
