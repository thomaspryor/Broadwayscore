    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show's spectacular qualities ('glittering and indefatigable') but delivers a damning final assessment that it lacks emotional engagement. However, with only one excerpt available, this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the spectacle but criticizes the lack of emotional engagement, suggesting a mixed review. The single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review describes the show as glittering and indefatigable, but ultimately lacking substance. This suggests a mixed reaction, leaning towards entertainment without emotional investment. | Kimi: While praising the production's spectacle ('glittering,' 'indefatigable'), the critic ultimately dismisses it as hollow entertainment lacking emotional substance ('no reason to care'), placing it in mixed territory.",
