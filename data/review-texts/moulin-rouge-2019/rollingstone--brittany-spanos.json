Why Do Pop Stars Keep Threatening to Quit Pop Stardom? View all posts by Brittany Spanos July 25, 2019 Karen Olivo as Satine and Aaron Tveit as Christian. Mathew Murphy Moulin Rouge ! the Musical : 3/5 Stars There was a show. A very strange, enchanted show. Entering the red light-coated Al Hirschfeld Theatre, with the stage flanked on either side with a giant red windmill and a large elephant's head, you're immediately asked to immerse yourself in the dreamlike, fantastical world of Baz Luhrmann's 2001 romantic tragedy Moulin Rouge! As its musical adaptation blazes forth with a whiplash-inducing 70 songs, flashy can-can dancers and bohemian ideals, the fantasy is forced to be grounded in reality and loses some of the film's spectacular spectacular-ness in the process. Before the curtains open, the show begins very suddenly with two women swallowing swords. Like Cabaret , Moulin Rouge! thankfully refuses to let you forget that its setting is maybe its most important character. Even the Playbill offers a history of the storied Paris cabaret club's 130 year history. The framing of the musical is the first thing that sets it apart from its film counterpart: where Luhrmann framed the story with foreboding sadness led by the mystical song \"Nature Boy,\" the stage show looks to the bacchanalian chaos of the cabaret. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-dsk-tab-article-inbody-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article\",\"mid\",\"in-article1\",\"mid-article1\",\"inbody\",\"inbody1\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"culture\\/article\\/inbody1\") .addSize([[300,250],[620,350],[2,2],[3,3],[2,4],[4,2],[640,250],[6,6],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); We see Christian, a struggling American writer played by Aaron Tveit, stumble upon the sword swallowers. With a snap of his fingers, \"Lady Marmalade\" begins and club emcee Harold Zidler (played with booming flourish by Danny Burstein) becomes our capable host, introducing the audience to the very essence of his club, his dancers and, most importantly, his clientele. The opening number is as dizzying as the Moulin Rouge's introduction is in the film: a rapid-fire hodgepodge of dancing and pop music mashups (OutKast's \"So Fresh, So Clean\" and DeBarge's \"Rhythm of the Night\" are just two of the tracks in this scene-setting showstopper). blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-dsk-tab-article-inbody2-uid1' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article2\",\"mid\",\"in-article2\",\"mid-article\",\"inbody\",\"inbody2\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"culture\\/article\\/inbody2\") .addSize([[300,250],[300,251],[620,350],[2,4],[4,2],[3,3],[2,2],[6,6],[620,366]]) .setLazyLoadMultiplier(2) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); The party comes to a screeching halt when we break to properly meet Christian and the Bohemians. The sequence is an energy-sapping interruption; Christian delivers a monologue about his history that shifts the pace of the show entirely too early before engaging in one of the song's first, entirely new mash-ups. Editor’s picks The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century Of course, 70 songs does not mean that they're all performed in full. Most of the time, significant lines from the pop songs the show covers are used as operatic dialogue. This is where the show becomes disjointed: the mix of humor and earnestness meant to be elicited from the song references doesn't quite mesh and the lines between those prominent aren't properly drawn. The meeting of the Bohemians and introduction to Christian, Toulouse (Sahr Ngaujah) and Santiago (Ricky Rojas) starts off a bit tongue-in-cheek. Christian proves his writing prowess by singing lines from Paula Cole, Police and Rick Astley hits to his new comrades which shifts very suddenly to more sentimental reflection on the bohemian ideals via Lorde's \"Royals,\" T. Rex's \"Children of the Revolution\" and Fun.'s \"We Are Young.\" Sitting there, it was difficult to not immediately respond with snickering and shock as each song was introduced and processed, but that never-clear line between schtick and depth becomes trickier to navigate as the show progresses.
