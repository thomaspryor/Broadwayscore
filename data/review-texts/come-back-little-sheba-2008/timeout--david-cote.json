  "fullText": "By Time Out editors \n Wed Jan 30 2008\n\nWHAT A CARD Anderson plays tricks for Merkerson.\n Photograph: Joan Marcus\n\n\"Being busy is being happy,\" says the efficient Mrs. Coffman (Brenda Wehle) to her next-door neighbor Lola (Merkerson) in the Broadway revival of William Inge's 1950 hit, Come Back, Little Sheba\nThe veins of Inge's domestic melodrama bulge with the blood of pop psychology—sang-Freud, if you will—from the relationship between Lola and Doc (she has a childlike affect and calls him \"Daddy\") to the naked erotic symbolism of Marie's boyfriend Turk (Brian J. Smith), a javelin thrower (\"It's a big, long lance. You hold it like this, erect\"). In 1950 this was heady stuff, and Inge's depiction of violent alcoholism must have been genuinely shocking as well. But in the Manhattan Theatre Club's technically accomplished production, directed by Michael Pressman, the machinery of the writing is always visible, and Lola—despite Merkerson's skill—comes off as something of a simp. Come Back, Little Sheba doesn't leap into the present tense: Yesterday's play of the year has become a movie of the week.",

While praising the performances (Merkerson's 'dignity and depth,' Anderson's 'powerfully tortured performance') and calling it 'technically accomplished,' the overall verdict is that the material feels dated and mechanical, with visible dramatic machinery that doesn't translate to modern audiences. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the technical skill of the production and the actors' performances, but ultimately finds the play dated and not fully impactful. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the critic praises the technically accomplished direction and powerful performances from Merkerson and Anderson, they find Inge's writing mechanical and dated, assigning a 60 rating that reflects a genuinely mixed assessment.",
