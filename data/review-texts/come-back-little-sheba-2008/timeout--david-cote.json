    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt praises lead performances but represents only a fragment of the review. The critic's own 60 rating places this firmly in Mixed territory, suggesting the overall assessment was neither positive nor negative despite strong individual performances. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises individual performances but lacks an overall positive or negative assessment of the show. The original rating of 60 suggests a mixed review, aligning with the excerpt's focus on specific elements rather than the production as a whole. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses solely on praising the performances of two actors. Without further context, it's difficult to determine an overall recommendation, but the positive comments suggest a mixed to positive leaning. | Kimi: The critic's original rating of 60 places this squarely in the Mixed range. While the excerpt praises the lead performances, the limited context and single-excerpt warning suggest the overall production received a lukewarm assessment.",
