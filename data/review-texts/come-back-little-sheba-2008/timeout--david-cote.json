  "fullText": "By Time Out editors \n Wed Jan 30 2008\n\nWHAT A CARD Anderson plays tricks for Merkerson.\n Photograph: Joan Marcus\n\n\"Being busy is being happy,\" says the efficient Mrs. Coffman (Brenda Wehle) to her next-door neighbor Lola (Merkerson) in the Broadway revival of William Inge's 1950 hit, Come Back, Little Sheba\nThe veins of Inge's domestic melodrama bulge with the blood of pop psychology—sang-Freud, if you will—from the relationship between Lola and Doc (she has a childlike affect and calls him \"Daddy\") to the naked erotic symbolism of Marie's boyfriend Turk (Brian J. Smith), a javelin thrower (\"It's a big, long lance. You hold it like this, erect\"). In 1950 this was heady stuff, and Inge's depiction of violent alcoholism must have been genuinely shocking as well. But in the Manhattan Theatre Club's technically accomplished production, directed by Michael Pressman, the machinery of the writing is always visible, and Lola—despite Merkerson's skill—comes off as something of a simp. Come Back, Little Sheba doesn't leap into the present tense: Yesterday's play of the year has become a movie of the week.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt praises lead performances but represents only a fragment of the review. The critic's own 60 rating places this firmly in Mixed territory, suggesting the overall assessment was neither positive nor negative despite strong individual performances. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises individual performances but lacks an overall positive or negative assessment of the show. The original rating of 60 suggests a mixed review, aligning with the excerpt's focus on specific elements rather than the production as a whole. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses solely on praising the performances of two actors. Without further context, it's difficult to determine an overall recommendation, but the positive comments suggest a mixed to positive leaning. | Kimi: The critic's original rating of 60 places this squarely in the Mixed range. While the excerpt praises the lead performances, the limited context and single-excerpt warning suggest the overall production received a lukewarm assessment.",
