    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for LuPone's performance with vivid language ('ferocious specificity', 'force of nature'), but only one excerpt available makes overall verdict uncertain. Scored in upper Positive range given the intensity of praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises LuPone's performance with strong language ('ferocious specificity', 'consuming intensity'), indicating a positive view. However, with only one curated excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a strong performance by LuPone, using phrases like \"ferocious specificity\" and \"consuming intensity.\" Given the single excerpt, I am placing it in the positive range with a higher score due to the strength of the praise, but with low confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead actress's performance using superlatives like 'ferocious' and 'force of nature,' indicating a positive assessment, though the single-excerpt context prevents higher confidence.",
