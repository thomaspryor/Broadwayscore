  "fullText": "While the hardship and terror of living in constant fear of a knock on the door or a tap on your shoulder is repeatedly conveyed in Real Women, the musical somehow flattens the experience with triteness, cliche and lack of real surprise. Ana’s coming-of-age-follow-your-dreams story is trite and familiar, with no real stakes at play, and the racism and cruelty that fuels U.S. immigration policy feels watered down here, save for one moment of blunt bigotry that seems to come from a grittier production than this often light comedy.",
