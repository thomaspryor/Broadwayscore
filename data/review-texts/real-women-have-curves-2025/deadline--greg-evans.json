The critic finds strength in the cast but weakness in the material itself. | GPT-4o: The review praises a standout scene and the cast's performance but criticizes the musical for being trite and lacking stakes. The overall tone is mixed, acknowledging strengths but highlighting significant weaknesses. | Gemini: The review praises the cast and a specific scene, but finds the book and music only \"pleasant enough\" and the overall experience flattened by triteness. This indicates a mixed reaction, leaning slightly positive due to the emphasis on the cast's strength. | Kimi: While the review praises the cast as the production's 'true strength' and singles out one powerful scene that earned a standing ovation, it heavily criticizes the book and music as trite, cliched, and lacking real stakes, finding the overall experience flattened and watered down despite the committed performances.",

Machado as mother Carmen (and who is known to TV viewers for the rebooted One Day At A Time), is very good at both comic zingers and cutting put-downs, and she’s even better in dramatic moments when she lets long-simmering resentments burst open.\n\nCuenca, as Carmen’s eldest daughter Estela, nicely conveys both the heavy load of first-child responsibility – she runs the dress shop, seeing to every detail, including protecting her workers – and the love-resentment dichotomy she feels for younger sister, U.S. citizen and college-bound Ana.\n\nCórdoba, making her Broadway debut as Ana, is an amiable performer, but she doesn’t quite yet have the subtlety of motion or nuance of expression that could transform Ana into something more than a character type – the brainy kid who knows smarts and a break can get her far away from a life she hates. Here that life is a cramped sweaty factory, but it could just as easily be a coal mine, the criminal underworld or a Kansas farm. Whatever the place or situation, the old life has to exert a pull on the leaver or the leaving means little.
