  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "But politics comes most alive through the personal, and the heart of the musical lies in its characters' dreams: those that conflict with others, those that are deferred and, most poignantly, those that are never realized. The show astutely depicts the mixed emotions of grappling with obligations and expectations of one's self, family and culture.",
