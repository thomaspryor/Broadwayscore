  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "As pertinent as that notion is, it's just one empowering theme in this triumphant musical. While some might find the plot to be all-over-the-place, it's about Ana's experience. Serving as a slice-of-life, it is desperately needed now, at a time when so many women like her are dehumanized on a daily basis, whether because of their body, race, or immigration status. Just as beauty is so much more than meets the eye, Real Women Have Curves offers far more than just its body-positive title. It may not be the flashiest musical of the season, but it's real. The realest thing Broadway has seen in quite some time.",

Despite acknowledging some plot issues, the overall tone is highly positive, warranting a Rave classification. | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"triumphant musical\" and \"desperately needed.\" However, the phrase \"some might find the plot to be all-over-the-place\" suggests reservations, and the single excerpt warning suggests caution.",
