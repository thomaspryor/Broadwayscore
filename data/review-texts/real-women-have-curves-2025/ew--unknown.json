  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "The show is an absolute joy to witness with its vibrant scenery and lively choreography. It also pulls off a crucial balancing act, immersing us in the real, textured world of their East Los Angeles locale, leaning into the detail and intimate moments, and then, in the right moments, embracing fantasy by whisking us into the character's minds and letting their dreams be visualized onstage.",
