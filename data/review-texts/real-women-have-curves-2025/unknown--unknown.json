    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses positive language ('bold', 'defiantly optimistic', 'chingona spirit') but is incomplete and may not represent the full review sentiment. Scoring conservatively in lower positive range due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the show's bold and optimistic nature, suggesting a positive experience. However, the mention of 'relentlessly biased' introduces some reservation, indicating a positive recommendation with some caveats. | Gemini: The phrase \"bold and defiantly optimistic\" suggests a positive experience, but the \"despite relentlessly biased\" implies a reservation, placing it in the positive but not rave category. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a conservative score.",
