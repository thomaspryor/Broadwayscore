    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt with qualified praise - suggests the show works in certain settings/contexts but implies limitations elsewhere. Very limited text makes confidence low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the musical has strengths when focused on specific settings and themes, but it implies limitations outside of those elements. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning necessitates a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the musical has strengths in specific settings, but the overall sentiment is not clearly positive or negative, indicating a mixed review. The limited text makes confidence low. | Kimi: The excerpt identifies specific contextual strengths (factory setting, family conflicts) where the production succeeds, indicating a qualified recommendation that acknowledges the show works well in particular circumstances.",
