However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights the positive aspects of the show, particularly the design and the affirming sentiment, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation phrase lead to a score in the middle of the positive range.",
