  "fullText": "The Latina seamstresses at a dressmaking workshop in East L.A. express their credo at the top of the new musical \"Real Women Have Curves.\" With the pulsating song \"Make It Work\" these women sing about how — despite their burdens and obstacles — this community of hardworking immigrant women manage to create a vibrant life.\n\nThe same can be said for the artistic team behind this appealing, tuneful and politically potent show based on Josefina López's 1990 play and the 2002 film which she co-wrote with George LaVoo, and which starred America Ferrera.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Though sure to please many audiences, the show’s ending also feels unearned and underwritten. Perhaps if only Carmen could fully realize that Ana’s future writing will create something special that honors not only her but all the women like Carmen who, with fortitude, resilience and passion, will always be there making it work.",
