  "fullText": "The Latina seamstresses at a dressmaking workshop in East L.A. express their credo at the top of the new musical \"Real Women Have Curves.\" With the pulsating song \"Make It Work\" these women sing about how — despite their burdens and obstacles — this community of hardworking immigrant women manage to create a vibrant life.\n\nThe same can be said for the artistic team behind this appealing, tuneful and politically potent show based on Josefina López's 1990 play and the 2002 film which she co-wrote with George LaVoo, and which starred America Ferrera.",

  "dtliExcerpt": "But politics comes most alive through the personal, and the heart of the musical lies in its characters’ dreams: those that conflict with others, those that are deferred and, most poignantly, those that are never realized. The show astutely depicts the mixed emotions of grappling with obligations and expectations of one’s self, family and culture.",
