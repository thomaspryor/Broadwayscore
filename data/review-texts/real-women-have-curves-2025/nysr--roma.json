  "dtliExcerpt": "Amid all the celebrity hype on Broadway this season, Real Women Have Curves arrives with an outstanding cast of mostly unknowns, as incomparable as they are unlikely to star in a major Broadway musical. They are performing their hearts out in a production that is all heart. It is also funny, touching, tuneful and refreshingly original packed with a timely message. Put it all together and you have one spicy Mexican feast of a show – as savory as a hot tamale, smooth as flan and irresistibly tasty as a deep-fried churro.",
