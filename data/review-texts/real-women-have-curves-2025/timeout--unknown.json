  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "In a time when immigrants are being actively dehumanized throughout the United States, Real Women Have Curves provides a vital counterpointpartly by depicting the dreams and fears of immigrant workers in specific terms, but mostly just by being lovable. This show is a bona fide crowd pleaser: a warm hug that pulls you into its generous bosom. With a little luck, it could turn out to be a sleeper hit. Go now and get ahead of the curve.",
