  "bwwExcerpt": "More importantly, despite the differences, the message remains the same. There is still a very clear sense that this is a story that sees each and every one of these women; that makes no apologies as it allows them to take up space; that demands its audience accept them, gives the room to accept themselves and always believes in their ability to grow. By the end of the show, the young Ana is indeed taking flight, but she is not soaring solo.",
