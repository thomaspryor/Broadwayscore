    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic's 'best thing' about the musical is that it makes you want to watch the movie instead - a clear negative verdict suggesting the show itself is disappointing compared to its source material. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the stage production is not as enjoyable as the film, implying a negative view of the show itself. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the film as being better than the stage production, which suggests a mixed to negative assessment of the show itself. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as mixed with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic damns the Broadway musical with faint praise, suggesting its only value is reminding audiences to watch the superior original film. All positive descriptors apply to the movie, not the stage production, implying the adaptation fails to stand on its own merits.",
