    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong transformative language ('lift you up', 'better person') suggests enthusiastic recommendation, but low confidence due to limited text and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a strong, positive endorsement of the show, suggesting a transformative experience. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language used indicates a rave review. | Gemini: The single excerpt is very positive, suggesting a strong recommendation. Given the limited information, I am placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's uplifting and transformative emotional impact. Following the protocol for clearly positive single excerpts, it scores at the upper end of the Positive bucket, though confidence is low given the limited available context.",
