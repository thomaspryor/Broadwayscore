    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with transformative language ('lift you up', 'better person') suggests strong positive experience, but low confidence due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a highly positive assessment, suggesting a transformative experience. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt is strongly positive, suggesting a very favorable review. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the language warrants a high positive score. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains exceptionally glowing praise describing a transformative, uplifting experience ('better person'), warranting upper Positive range per single-excerpt guidance, though limited context prevents Rave classification.",
