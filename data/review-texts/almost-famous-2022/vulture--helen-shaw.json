  "bwwExcerpt": "To that end, the musical scrupulously duplicates the movie, delivering nearly every famous line of dialogue right where you expect it, whether shouted ('Don't take drugs!'), sung ('It's all happening'), or yelled out in the middle of a song ('I am a golden god!'). It so desperately wants to remind you of something else you might've loved that the presiding emotional affect ends up being melancholy. We've missed the tour bus twice over. This is almost Almost Famous.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The review describes the show as 'pleasant' but criticizes it as 'bloodless' and over-commercialized, suggesting a lukewarm assessment that neither strongly recommends nor discourages attendance. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'pleasant but bloodless,' indicating a lack of enthusiasm and a negative overall impression. The phrase 'focus-grouped to death' suggests a lack of authenticity or vitality, leading to a negative verdict. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the show is a \"bloodless approximation\" of the film, indicating a negative assessment and lack of recommendation. | Kimi: The critic describes the Broadway adaptation as sanitized ('focus-grouped to death', 'rough edges sanded away') and lacking vitality ('bloodless'), finding it a disappointing approximation of the film's spirit rather than a successful transfer.",
