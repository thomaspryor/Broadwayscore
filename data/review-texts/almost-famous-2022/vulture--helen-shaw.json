    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The review describes the show as 'pleasant' but criticizes it as 'bloodless' and over-commercialized, suggesting a lukewarm assessment that neither strongly recommends nor discourages attendance. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'pleasant but bloodless,' indicating a lack of enthusiasm and a negative overall impression. The phrase 'focus-grouped to death' suggests a lack of authenticity or vitality, leading to a negative verdict. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the show is a \"bloodless approximation\" of the film, indicating a negative assessment and lack of recommendation. | Kimi: The critic describes the Broadway adaptation as sanitized ('focus-grouped to death', 'rough edges sanded away') and lacking vitality ('bloodless'), finding it a disappointing approximation of the film's spirit rather than a successful transfer.",
