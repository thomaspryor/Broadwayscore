    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Pan | Claude: Calls the show 'most dispiriting' and 'creatively bankrupt' - devastating language that places this firmly in Pan territory. Single excerpt limits confidence but the condemnation is unambiguous. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'creatively bankrupt' and 'dispiriting,' indicating a strongly negative view. The language suggests a deep dissatisfaction with the production. | Gemini: The review excerpt calls the show a \"creatively bankrupt illustration\" and \"dispiriting example\", indicating a negative assessment. Given that it's a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt uses devastating language ('creatively bankrupt,' 'most dispiriting example') to condemn the show as a complete artistic failure and the worst of its genre, fitting the Pan bucket. Confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation.",
