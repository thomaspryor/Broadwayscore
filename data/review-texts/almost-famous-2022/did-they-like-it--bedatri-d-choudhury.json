    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic expresses clear appreciation with the warm metaphor of a 'good old friend' and describes being 'grateful' for the experience. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt conveys a positive sentiment, likening the show to a comforting experience and expressing gratitude. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic describes the show as a comforting and enjoyable experience, expressing gratitude for sharing a profession with the characters depicted. | Kimi: Single excerpt expresses warm appreciation and clear enjoyment without reservations, placing it in the upper Positive range per guidelines for clearly positive isolated excerpts.",
