This indicates a positive but slightly qualified recommendation. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, noting the show captures the spirit of the film, but it also states that it doesn't quite achieve the movie's perfect pitch, indicating a reservation. | Kimi: The critic praises the show's energy and heart while noting it falls short of the film's excellence, indicating a solid but qualified recommendation.",
