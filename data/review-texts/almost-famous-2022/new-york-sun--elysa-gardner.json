    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows qualified praise (\"almost always works\") and recommends staying for the curtain call, but single excerpt warning applies and tone suggests some reservations about sappier moments. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive experience with enthusiasm for the curtain call and affirmation of the show's vitality. Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone is clearly positive. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive experience, particularly highlighting the curtain call. However, the phrase \"almost always works better with such winking gestures than it does with sappier ones\" indicates some reservations. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, and the score is in the lower-middle of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic explicitly recommends staying for the 'exuberant curtain call' and praises the show's rock energy, though notes the material works better with ironic 'winking' moments than sentimental ones.",
