However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is negative, suggesting the critic does not recommend the show due to its imitative nature. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt provides a concluding verdict that criticizes the show's imitative elements as unsuccessful and unflattering. While clearly negative in sentiment, confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated quote without broader context.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Warning: Do not re-watch the 2000 movie “Almost Famous” if you plan to see “Almost Famous,” the new Broadway musical. Because the movie is so good. And the stage version is so less good. Comparisons are anathema but seem unavoidable in the case of this musical, which marked its official Broadway opening Thursday night at the Bernard Jacobs Theatre. Cameron Crowe, who wrote and directed the movie, starring Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson, recycles the screenplay, including large chunks of dialogue, for the Broadway incarnation. And though Tom Kitt — winner of a Pulitzer Prize for his own, highly original musical, “Next to Normal” — collaborated with Crowe on some new songs, the show is not much more than a wan rewind of what transpired on-screen.",
