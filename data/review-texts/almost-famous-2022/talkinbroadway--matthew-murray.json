Low confidence due to single curated quote warning. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges 'lovely moments' and 'soaring songs' but ultimately concludes that the musical 'never quite takes flight.' This suggests a mixed reception, with some positive elements but an overall lack of strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review notes \"some lovely moments and a few soaring songs\" but ultimately states that the musical \"never quite takes flight,\" indicating a mixed or neutral recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges genuine positives ('lovely moments,' 'soaring songs') but delivers a disappointed overall verdict ('never quite takes flight'), suggesting the show falls short of its ambitions without being a complete failure.",
