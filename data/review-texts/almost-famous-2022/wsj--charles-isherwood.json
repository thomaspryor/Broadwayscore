This is a clear negative recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the stage adaptation as 'tamed and out-of-focus' and 'blandly diminished' compared to the film, indicating a negative view. However, the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt clearly states that the stage version is a \"blandly diminished\" version of the film, indicating a negative assessment. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring cautiously. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Almost everything about \"Almost Famous,\" the Broadway musical adaptation of the Cameron Crowe movie from 2000, feels almost-good-enough. Stage versions of celebrated films are an annual, never-subsiding tide on New York stages, and certainly this production rises above the average by some measure. Nevertheless much of the quirky delicacy and emotional richness that made the movie so funny and moving are swamped by the inevitable need to amplify the material to fill a Broadway house.",
