'Misses every opportunity', 'mystifying muddle', 'never affecting' indicate disappointment and lack of recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'mystifying muddle' and 'never affecting', indicating a negative assessment. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the musical misses opportunities and lands in a muddle, suggesting a negative assessment. Confidence is low due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers a clear negative verdict, describing the show as a 'mystifying muddle' that fails to achieve its potential and is 'never affecting,' despite being occasionally diverting. The single-excerpt limitation requires low confidence.",
