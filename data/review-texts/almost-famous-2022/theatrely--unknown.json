  "bwwExcerpt": "In another devastating blow to the 'West Coast Has Taste' community, the musical Almost Famous has opened on Broadway, after a well-received premiere run in San Diego, to put another nail in that idealistic California coffin. It is a production so dull, with poor direction, ugly sets, uninteresting music, and flat performances, that it really needn't exist at all. Mind you, my beef here is mainly with the Pacific-facing critics who-be it through payola, their overall lack of theatre, or whichever self-help cult they've got going on over there these days-allowed me to raise my expectations for a show which counts among the most artistically lacking I've seen.",

The tone and language indicate a strong pan. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly negative, describing the production as dull, poorly directed, and artistically lacking, indicating a strong pan. | Kimi: The critic delivers a devastating pan, calling the production dull with poor direction, ugly sets, and flat performances, concluding it 'needn't exist at all' and is among the most 'artistically lacking' shows they've seen.",
