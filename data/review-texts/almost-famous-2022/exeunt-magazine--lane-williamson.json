    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt praises one element (lighting) but suggests the show overall disappoints, leaving audiences wanting. Single excerpt warning applies - this could be from a longer mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a missed opportunity and a lack of overall quality, indicating a negative sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests that the show has potential but ultimately falls short, indicating a mixed reaction. The critic expresses a desire for more, implying that the current quality is lacking. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the show for failing to extend its strongest element (lighting) to the rest of the production, noting that the audience is 'left longing for more,' indicating overall dissatisfaction with the quality. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
