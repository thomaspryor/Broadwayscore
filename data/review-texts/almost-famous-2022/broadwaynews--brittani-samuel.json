The critic finds the musical fundamentally flawed - lacking originality and failing musically ('every note falls flat'). This is clearly negative, but with only one excerpt available, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, criticizing the musical for lacking originality and effectiveness. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low due to potential cherry-picking. | Gemini: The excerpt states that the musical doesn't have anything original to say, and every note falls flat, indicating a negative assessment. Given that this is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic asserts the musical lacks originality and fails to resonate, declaring that 'every note falls flat' with no redeeming qualities mentioned in the excerpt.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "If we are to heed Lester Bangs’ earlier warning, then “Almost Famous” — like the music it celebrates — defies critique. It does not, however, defy comparison. It is equal parts groovy sexiness of “Hair,” gawky coming-of-ageness of “Dear Evan Hansen” and wild artist fantasy of “Rent.” Unfortunately, when an original musical doesn’t actually have anything original to say, every note falls flat.",
