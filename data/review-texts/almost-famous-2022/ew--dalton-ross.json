    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows qualified praise - 'capably and dutifully' suggests competent execution, but 'may not be full of surprises' indicates some limitations. Single excerpt warning applies, so scoring at lower end of Positive range due to restrained language. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a competent but unremarkable production. The lack of surprises implies a lack of innovation or excitement, placing it in the Mixed bucket. The confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review states that the show \"capably and dutifully retells\" the story, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt, the score is placed at the lower end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, acknowledging the production competently adapts the source material but lacks originality or surprises, suggesting a mild recommendation rather than an enthusiastic endorsement.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "While watching this new stage adaptation of Cameron Crowe's 2000 coming-of-age-on-a-tour-bus film, I couldn't help but wonder what the actual Bangs - the preeminent rock critic of his era obsessed with the anarchic lo-fi danger of the Stooges - would make of being a character in a splashy Broadway musical. It's safe to say he would probably not be a fan. But Bangs might also find himself wondering how a musical all about the love of music could fall so flat when it comes to the actual, you know, music. That is the biggest flaw in an adaptation that faithfully follows the original source material... sometimes a little too faithfully, with entire sections of dialogue and almost every scene and plot point seemingly lifted directly from the original film. In the end, you find yourself wishing that a production about the rebellious world of rock & roll would let its hair down a bit more and take bigger risks instead of playing it safe at almost every turn.",
