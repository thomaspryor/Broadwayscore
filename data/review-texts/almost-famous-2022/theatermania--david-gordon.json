    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Review acknowledges the show is still developing but highlights specific strengths in character moments. The 'but when it works, it really works' suggests conditional appreciation rather than clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges both strengths and weaknesses, highlighting that the show is still developing but has effective moments. This suggests a mixed but somewhat positive impression. | Gemini: The review indicates that the show is uneven, with moments that work well and others that don't, leading to a mixed assessment. | Kimi: Brief excerpt indicates uneven quality ('finding its footing') alongside genuine praise for character-driven scenes, suggesting a mixed reception without clear recommendation.",
