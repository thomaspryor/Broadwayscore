    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise for capturing the essence of beloved source material while establishing theatrical identity. However, confidence is low due to limited text from curated excerpt that may not represent full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the adaptation for capturing the essence of the original film and successfully translating it to the stage, indicating a strong recommendation. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses strong positive sentiment, stating that the musical captures the heart and soul of the original film while also finding its own voice. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the show's emotional resonance and successful theatrical translation, warranting an upper-range Positive score per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts.",
