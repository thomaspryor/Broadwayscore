    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative assessment calling it a 'mystifying muddle' that 'misses every opportunity' and is 'never affecting.' However, single excerpt warning requires caution as full verdict may be different. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the musical for missing opportunities and describes it as a 'mystifying muddle,' suggesting a negative view. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review states the musical misses opportunities and lands in a muddle, suggesting a mixed or neutral sentiment. The phrase 'occasionally diverting' implies some positive aspects, but overall it's not a strong recommendation. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates the show fails to achieve its potential, landing in a 'mystifying muddle' that is 'never affecting'—strong negative language outweighing the faint praise of 'occasionally diverting.'",
