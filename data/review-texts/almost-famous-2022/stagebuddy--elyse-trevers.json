    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic explicitly states the show 'went downhill' and concludes it reinforces that some stories shouldn't be adapted to stage, suggesting the original film is superior and the musical adaptation fails to justify its existence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates disappointment with the adaptation, suggesting the story is better suited for film. The negative tone is clear, but due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a negative assessment, stating the show 'went downhill' and that the story is 'better told on the screen.' | Kimi: The critic states the production went downhill after its opening, dismisses the music as mere backdrop, and explicitly recommends the original film over this stage adaptation, indicating the musical format fails the material.",
