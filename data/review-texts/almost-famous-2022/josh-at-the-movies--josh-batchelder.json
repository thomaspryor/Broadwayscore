    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the writing as 'fabulous' and suggests an engaging exploration of themes. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low, and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the writing as \"fabulous\" and the story as exploring an interesting angle. Given the limited text and excerpt-only warning, I'm scoring it as positive with medium confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic praise ('fabulous writing') for the show's book and storytelling, clearly indicating a positive recommendation. However, as a single truncated excerpt, confidence is reduced per scoring guidelines.",
