  "bwwExcerpt": "Kitt and Crowe also fashion several effective numbers sung by William's no-nonsense but supportive mother Elaine (Anika Larsen), a schoolteacher who frets from home. Here, she's given variations of the film's great monologues: One is a lecture to her class in which she memorably declares, 'Rock stars have kidnapped my son,' and in another, she gives Russell a dose of parental terror over the phone. Larsen lands both moments beautifully, with just the right comic gravitas and heart. But these skillful original songs only tell half the story. We never hear expressed - in a way that only musical theater can do - what this music means to these characters. Instead, at key dramatic moments we get renditions of the hits of the era, notably Elton John's 'Tiny Dancer' as a kind of carpool karaoke, Joni Mitchell's 'River' and Yusef Islam's (aka Cat Stevens) 'The Wind.' But even in minor moments the musical forgoes original songs and turns to tunes from Nancy Wilson, Ron Davies, Stevie Wonder, Greg Allman, Jimmy Page and Robert Point, among others.",

This lukewarm assessment suggests a mixed verdict - worth seeing for some audiences but not recommended broadly. Low confidence due to truncated text. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'entertaining enough' but lacking anything 'extraordinary,' suggesting a mixed verdict. The lack of a full review text and the concluding phrase 'not even almost' contribute to a low confidence level. | Gemini: The review states that the show is \"entertaining enough\" but lacks anything extraordinary, suggesting a mixed reaction. The truncated text and lack of a clear recommendation lower the confidence. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show is competent and entertaining for specific demographics but emphasizes its lack of artistic distinction or extraordinariness, resulting in a lukewarm assessment that neither recommends nor discourages attendance.",
