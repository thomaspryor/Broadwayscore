    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Strong positive language ('works on every level', 'heart as big as', 'genuinely care about') suggests enthusiastic recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict strength. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, indicating the musical 'works on every level' and has a big heart, suggesting a highly positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is strongly positive, stating the musical works on every level and has a big heart. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives ('works on every level', 'heart as big as') and emotional praise ('characters you genuinely care about') indicating a rave verdict, though the single-excerpt format necessitates low confidence. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
