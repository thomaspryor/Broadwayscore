    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic calls the show 'empty' and criticizes fundamental storytelling failures. However, this is only one excerpt from a longer review, so confidence is low as the full verdict may be different. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show for failing to provide depth or insight into its subject matter, suggesting a lack of substance. The tone is negative, but due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt criticizes the show for failing to say anything meaningful about fame and ambition. Given that this is the only excerpt, and it's negative, I'm scoring it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic condemns the show as 'empty' and criticizes the book for failing to explore the protagonist's motivations, indicating a substantial disappointment with the production's substance and writing despite this being a single excerpt.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Tom Kitt wrote the music for “Next to Normal,” and with “Almost Famous,” he is credited as co-lyricist and composer of most of the score. He is at his best with dreamy ballads like “Morocco,” nicely sung by Pfeiffer, that convey a sense of elusive longing. But after a few of these songs, Kitt’s penchant for the 4/4 time signature becomes a kind of corn syrup poured over the entire score. The real Stillwater songs “Fever Dog” and “I Come at Night” make brief appearances, when the band is practicing or performing onstage. More telling is the use of Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer” to end Act 1 – a verbatim re-creation of a scene from the movie. What is happening here as the band travels on the road in their bus? Did someone in Stillwater turn on the radio, and having a brief lapse of good taste, prefer Elton John to anything written by Tom Kitt?",
