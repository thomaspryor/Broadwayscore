The lack of a full review text leads to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt notes that the musical has heart and soul, but doesn't quite capture the movie's magic, suggesting a positive but qualified recommendation. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic praises the show's emotional core ('heart and soul') while noting it falls short of the original film's magic, indicating a qualified but genuine recommendation.",
