    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Acknowledges positive qualities ('heart and soul') but notes it falls short of expectations. Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds like qualified praise typical of lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a generally positive view, highlighting 'heart and soul,' but also notes it doesn't fully capture the original film's magic. The single excerpt and text quality warning suggest caution, leading to a low confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive sentiment, noting the show has \"heart and soul,\" but also suggests it doesn't fully capture the movie's magic. Given the limited text, a score on the lower end of the positive range is appropriate. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers qualified praise, acknowledging the show's 'heart and soul' while noting it falls short of the original film's magic, suggesting a mild recommendation in the 70-74 range.",
