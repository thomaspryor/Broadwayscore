The 'but' construction indicates mixed feelings without a clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The review praises the energy and performances but criticizes the book, indicating a mixed reception with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's energy and the cast's performance, but notes that the book needs improvement. This indicates a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The review praises the cast's energy and performances but explicitly criticizes the book as needing work, resulting in an uneven assessment that neither strongly recommends nor discourages attendance.",
