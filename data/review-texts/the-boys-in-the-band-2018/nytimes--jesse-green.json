'Thrilling' is strong praise that outweighs the 'archaeology' concern. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the dated nature of the material but praises the current production for making it thrilling, indicating a positive recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review acknowledges that the play seems dated, but the production makes it thrilling, indicating a positive, but not enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic finds the 1968 material dated, the praise for Mantello's direction as thrilling indicates a clear recommendation to see this production.",
