  "bwwExcerpt": "'Inspired' is the word for casting Jim Parsons as Michael, the vitriolic host of a totally misbegotten birthday party. Equally fortuitous is getting Joe Mantello to direct the first Broadway revival of Mart Crowley's 'The Boys in the Band,' which opened Thursday at the Booth Theatre, half a century after its Off Broadway world premiere in 1968.",
