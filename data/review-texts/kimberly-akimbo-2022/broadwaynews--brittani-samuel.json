    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows appreciation for the show's tonal balance, suggesting quality but with reservations about darker elements. Limited text requires conservative scoring within Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a balance of positive and negative elements, with laughter adding sweetness but the story also having 'bitter notes'. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall tone. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a balance of positive and negative elements, indicating a recommendation with reservations. Given the single excerpt and the note of bitterness, I've placed it in the lower-middle of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges the show's successful balance of humor and darker dramatic elements, suggesting a mild appreciation for its emotional complexity. Given this is a single curated excerpt, the mildly positive tone warrants a lower-range Positive score.",
