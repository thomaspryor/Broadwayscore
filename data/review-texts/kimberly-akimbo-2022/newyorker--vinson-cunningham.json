    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt uses strong praise language ('small miracle') with specific positive qualities. However, low confidence due to limited text - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language, describing the show as a 'small miracle' and balancing emotional tones effectively. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt is highly positive, describing the show as a \"small miracle.\" Given the limited information, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise ('small miracle') regarding the show's tonal mastery and emotional impact, indicating a strong recommendation. However, as only a single curated excerpt is available, confidence is reduced due to potential cherry-picking.",
