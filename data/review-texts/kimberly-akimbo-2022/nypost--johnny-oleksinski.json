  "bwwExcerpt": "Yes, composer Jeanine Tesori and book-writer David Lindsay-Abaire's musical at the Booth Theatre is a smidge too wacky for its own good. Lindsay-Abaire's many eccentric flourishes, at times, can come across as showing off. I often missed the grounded power of the writer's excellent play, 'Good People.' Nonetheless, this odd duck is undeniably likable. 'Kimberly' the musical and the character have a strong underdog appeal and a warmth that keeps the audience firmly on its side. While never rapturous, 'Akimbo' is always enjoyable and ultimately touching.",

However, due to the brevity of the text, confidence is set to low. | Gemini: The review praises Victoria Clark's performance as a career-best and describes the musical as deeply moving and surprisingly funny, indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives ('career-best', 'deeply moving') and enthusiastic descriptors ('surprisingly funny'), indicating a rave review despite the excerpt's brevity. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
