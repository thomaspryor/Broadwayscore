However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single quote available is extremely positive, suggesting a strong recommendation. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt describes a powerfully positive emotional experience with enthusiastic language ('floating high on good vibes'), indicating a strong recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence must remain low due to potential cherry-picking.",
