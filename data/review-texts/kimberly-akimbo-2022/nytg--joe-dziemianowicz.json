  "bwwExcerpt": "She's back! Following an Off-Broadway run that wrapped in January, Kimberly Akimbo is now in residence at the Booth Theatre with the original cast and every bit of its wondrous quirkiness intact. In fact, the show is more polished and endearing than before. Anyone (including myself) who fears this charmer might get swallowed up in a Broadway house can rest easy. The show, created by David Lindsay-Abaire (book and lyrics) and Jeanine Tesori (music), has found the ideal home.",

Single excerpt warning applies but tone is distinctly positive, suggesting upper end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's 'wondrous quirkiness' and notes it is 'more polished and endearing than before,' indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show is \"more polished and endearing than before,\" which is a strong positive endorsement. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the Broadway transfer, describing it as 'wondrous,' 'polished,' and 'more endearing than before,' indicating an enthusiastic recommendation despite the limited context.",
