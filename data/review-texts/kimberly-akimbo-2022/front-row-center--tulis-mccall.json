    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Calls it a 'perfect musical' with unqualified praise for music and ensemble. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, calling the musical 'perfect' and describing the music as 'contemporary yet still fluid and beautiful and fun.' Despite the lack of full context, the language indicates a highly positive assessment. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language, calling the musical \"perfect\" and praising the music as \"fluid and beautiful and fun.\" Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I'm scoring it as positive with a high score within the bucket, but with low confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise calling the show 'perfect' with 'excellent' ensemble and beautiful music, warranting a high Positive score. Confidence is low due to the single-excerpt format which may not represent the full review. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
