  "bwwExcerpt": "'Kimberly Akimbo' is a feel-good show that acknowledges feelings of heartbreak, nausea, and discord. It brings to mind 'Fun Home,' which also has music by Tesori, is based on unlikely source material, and explores an unconventional family and a pained adolescence. It honors the Sondheim dictum of 'content dictates form,' creating a work that is well-integrated, fresh, quirky, and heartfelt, but not flashy or over-the-top. The bittersweet ending (driving off into the sunset on a road trip, even as the end is near) is particularly effective and affecting.",
