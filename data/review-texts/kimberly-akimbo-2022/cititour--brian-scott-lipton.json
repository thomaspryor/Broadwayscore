    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows thoughtful appreciation of the show's themes with positive framing. However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential for cherry-picking from a fuller review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive takeaway from the show, indicating a mildly positive sentiment. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive message and heroic theme, indicating a recommendation. Due to the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive sentiment warrants a score in the upper range of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the show's central theme as 'truly heroic,' indicating clear appreciation for the production's message and value. However, as a single curated excerpt, the full scope of the review's verdict is uncertain.",
