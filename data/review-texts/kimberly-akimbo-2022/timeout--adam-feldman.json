    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clearly positive language - 'pop with fresh energy', 'big laughs', acknowledging both intimacy and broader appeal. Since only one curated quote is available and it's clearly positive, scoring in upper Positive range per instructions. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights positive aspects such as big laughs, collective sympathy, and energetic performances. Despite the limited context, the tone suggests a strong positive impression. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as having big laughs, moments of sympathy, and fresh performances, indicating a positive experience. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the production's successful transition to a larger venue, citing strong comedic timing, emotional resonance, and vibrant performances. While limited to a single curated quote, the evaluative language ('big laughs', 'fresh energy') indicates a clear recommendation in the upper Positive range.",
