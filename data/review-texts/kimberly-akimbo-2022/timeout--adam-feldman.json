  "bwwExcerpt": "Clever, touching and idiosyncratic, Kimberly Akimbo was the best new musical of 2021, when it premiered Off Broadway at the Atlantic. The dark absurdist comedy of Lindsay-Abaire's original play-reminiscent of Christopher Durang, John Guare and the playwright's own Fuddy Meers-remains, but it is tempered by the addition of Tesori's winding, agile melodies and a geek chorus of four students (Olivia Elease Hardy, Fernell Hogan, Nina White and Michael Iskander) twined in a daisy chain of frustrated romance. In the hands of these gifted writers, material that might have been rendered as merely zany has human and forgiving dimensions, and the score finds sneaky ways to break your heart even as it maintains a general air of cheer. (Kimberly's establishing number, known in showtune lingo as her 'I Want' song, is literally a letter to the Make-a-Wish Foundation.)",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clearly positive language - 'pop with fresh energy', 'big laughs', acknowledging both intimacy and broader appeal. Since only one curated quote is available and it's clearly positive, scoring in upper Positive range per instructions. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights positive aspects such as big laughs, collective sympathy, and energetic performances. Despite the limited context, the tone suggests a strong positive impression. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as having big laughs, moments of sympathy, and fresh performances, indicating a positive experience. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the production's successful transition to a larger venue, citing strong comedic timing, emotional resonance, and vibrant performances. While limited to a single curated quote, the evaluative language ('big laughs', 'fresh energy') indicates a clear recommendation in the upper Positive range.",
