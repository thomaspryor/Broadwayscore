    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear recommendation ('definitely worth experiencing') but with explicit reservation ('very good...not quite great'). Single excerpt warning applies - this appears to be a measured positive assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive recommendation with some reservations, noting the show is 'worth experiencing' despite not being 'great'. The single excerpt warning suggests using the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review states the show is \"definitely worth experiencing,\" which indicates a positive recommendation. However, the qualification that it's \"not quite great\" suggests reservations. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows qualified recommendation—praised as 'very good' and 'definitely worth experiencing' but explicitly contrasted with 'great' shows like Guys and Dolls, warranting a lower-range Positive score given the cherry-picking risk.",
