  "bwwExcerpt": "Meet your new favorite musical. When Kimberly Akimbo premiered at the Atlantic Theater Company last December, it was a breath of fresh air, an intimate show about teenage misfits and the unreliable adults in their world that balanced hilarious comedy with aching poignancy and quirks unfailingly grounded in emotional truth. Transferring intact to Broadway, this small-scale charmer has not only retained but enriched its distinctive qualities, sweeping in as a burst of invigorating originality in a sea of repurposed movies, jukebox compilations and revivals.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising cast performances and material harmony suggests positive recommendation, but extremely limited text requires low confidence and upper-positive scoring due to cherry-picking risk. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast's performances as being well-suited to the material, suggesting a positive view. However, with only one excerpt available, the full sentiment is unclear, warranting a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is strongly positive about the cast's performances, suggesting a positive overall assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear, enthusiastic praise for the cast ('perfect harmony'), placing it in the upper Positive range, though the single curated quote limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
