However, with only one excerpt available, the full sentiment is unclear, warranting a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is strongly positive about the cast's performances, suggesting a positive overall assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear, enthusiastic praise for the cast ('perfect harmony'), placing it in the upper Positive range, though the single curated quote limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
