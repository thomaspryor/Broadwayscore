  "bwwExcerpt": "Something different has happened to David Lindsay-Abaire's play 'Kimberly Akimbo' on its way to becoming a new musical, which opened Thursday at Broadway's Booth Theatre after its debut last winter at the Atlantic Theater Company. It's still funny and quirky and very off-center, but the story of a rapidly aging 16-year-old girl and her deadbeat family has been grounded. No, not grounded in a high school sort of way. Jeanine Tesori's music grounds the story in a way that gives the source material resonance, makes it more substantial and far more emotionally engaging.",
