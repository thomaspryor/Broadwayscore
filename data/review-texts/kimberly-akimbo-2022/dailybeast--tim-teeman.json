  "bwwExcerpt": "It was strange, leaving for a breath of fresh air at intermission during Kimberly Akimbo (Booth Theatre, booking to April 23, 2023), to realize that my face had been creased in a constant smile since curtain-up. Sometimes, many times, that smile had broken out into a laugh, because this Broadway musical based on David Lindsay-Abaire's play of the same name is extremely funny. And even when this musical, transferred from a successful off-Broadway run at the Atlantic Theater, isn't funny-because the book and lyrics by Lindsay-Abaire come with piercing, meaningful jabs too-there is something about Kimberly Akimbo's execution that feels springy and light at its heart. Under Jessica Stone's assured direction, and clever, layered music by Jeanine Tesori, it's a delight, the standout new Broadway musical of the season so far.",
