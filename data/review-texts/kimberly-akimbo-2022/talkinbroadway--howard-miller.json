  "bwwExcerpt": "Having gushed until I am pretty much gushed out, let me save this last bit for director Jessica Stone, who has led the outstanding cast through a very special journey that has taken the show to Broadway from its previous run at the Atlantic Theater Company's Off-Broadway Linda Gross Theater. It deserves a long stay at its new home. Kimberly Akimbo works a special kind of magic, one that takes an underlying sad tale and spins it around to find all the laughter, love and joy that anyone possibly could wish for.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'magic' and wishing it 'deserves a long stay,' but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness of full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('special kind of magic', 'laughter, love and joy') suggesting a highly favorable view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses strong positive sentiment, stating the show \"deserves a long stay\" and works \"a special kind of magic.\" Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a score towards the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('special kind of magic', 'deserves a long stay') and a clear recommendation to see the show. However, confidence is low given this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's balance.",
