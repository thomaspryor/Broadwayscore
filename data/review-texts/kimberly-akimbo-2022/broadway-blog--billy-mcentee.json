    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong superlatives ('undeniably the most uplifting', 'refreshingly original') with unqualified praise. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - full review context unavailable. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for its originality and uplifting nature, using strong positive language like 'nuance, grace, and belly laughs' and 'most uplifting one in New York this fall season.' Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly positive review. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"refreshingly original\" and \"undeniably the most uplifting.\" Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive with high end score. | Kimi: The single available excerpt contains superlative praise calling the show the 'most uplifting' of the season with 'nuance, grace, and belly laughs,' indicating clear enthusiasm. However, per the single excerpt warning, the score is capped at the upper end of the Positive range due to the possibility of cherry-picking. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
