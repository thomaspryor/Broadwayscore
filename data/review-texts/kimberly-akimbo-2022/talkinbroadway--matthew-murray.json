However, this is a very brief excerpt which limits confidence in the full critical assessment. | GPT-4o: The review praises the show for transforming a potentially gimmicky premise into something 'genuinely moving and theatrical,' indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review indicates that the show is \"genuinely moving and theatrical\", which is a positive sentiment. However, the phrase \"sneaks up on you\" suggests that the emotional depth is not immediately apparent, indicating a reservation. | Kimi: The critic offers strong praise for the show's emotional resonance and theatrical execution, noting it transcends its potentially gimmicky setup. The excerpt is brief but indicates a clear recommendation.",
