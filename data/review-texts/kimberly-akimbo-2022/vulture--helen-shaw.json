The excerpt is short, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review highlights the show's positive qualities, such as its sweetness and respectful treatment of characters, suggesting a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: Though only an excerpt, the text offers unqualified praise for the show's tonal balance and emotional intelligence, indicating a clear positive recommendation.",
