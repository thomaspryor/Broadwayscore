  "bwwExcerpt": "In the Broadway run, that sun shines brighter and clearer- the show-choir costumes are shinier, Danny Mefford's choreography has more room for ice-skating action, and set designer David Zinn has even deployed a revolve, though, delightfully, it's used only to turn a dinner table. You miss the closeness to the actors, since director Jessica Stone has done such lovely work in getting the cast to capture the micro-grimaces of high-school awkwardness, but the essential delicacy of the show is intact.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The metaphor of 'sunlight breaking through winter' and Broadway version shining 'brighter and clearer' indicates clear enthusiasm, but single excerpt warning requires caution about full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses positive imagery ('sun shines brighter and clearer') and suggests an improvement from a previous run, indicating a strong positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is very positive, using the metaphor of sunlight breaking through winter to describe the musical's impact. The phrase 'shines brighter and clearer' suggests an improvement over a previous production, indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic imagery ('sun shines brighter', 'glimmer of sunlight') to praise the Broadway production as improved and visually dazzling. However, with only one curated excerpt available, the full critical context remains unclear.",
