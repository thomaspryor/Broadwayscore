    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('right show at the right time', 'life-affirming', 'stomp your feet with delight') suggests enthusiastic recommendation. Single excerpt warning applied - using upper end of Positive range since this sounds clearly positive rather than mildly so. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'life-affirming' and 'the right show at the right time,' with humor that elicits strong positive reactions. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a highly enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language, calling the show \"life-affirming\" and saying it has \"laughs that make you stomp your feet with delight.\" This indicates a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise describing the show as 'life-affirming' with laughs that make you 'stomp your feet with delight,' indicating a clear recommendation, though the single-excerpt format warrants reduced confidence.",
