    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses strong praise ('remarkable', 'makes you laugh and cry') and highlights sophisticated emotional impact without manipulation, suggesting high-quality theatrical craft. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the musical as achieving something 'remarkable' and praises its emotional impact without manipulation, indicating a strong positive sentiment. However, with only a single excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses strong praise for the musical's ability to evoke emotions authentically, suggesting a positive and impactful experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the show's emotional impact and sophisticated craftsmanship, calling it 'remarkable,' though the single-quote format limits certainty about the overall verdict.",
