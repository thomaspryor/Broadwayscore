    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language with 'enchanting life' and time passing 'like a freshening breeze' suggests an engaging, delightful experience. Single excerpt limits confidence, but tone is clearly enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly positive language, describing the show as 'enchanting' and comparing the experience to a 'freshening breeze,' suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"enchanting life\" and \"freshening breeze\", indicating a positive review. Given that it is the only excerpt available, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs enthusiastic language ('enchanting,' 'freshening breeze') to praise the production's vitality and pacing, indicating a clear positive verdict despite the limited available text.",
