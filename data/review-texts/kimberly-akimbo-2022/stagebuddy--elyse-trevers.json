    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('revelation', 'uplifting', 'Don't be like me and wait') indicates enthusiastic recommendation. Single excerpt limits confidence but tone is clearly positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('revelation', 'uplifting') suggesting a highly favorable view. Despite the text quality warning, the language indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"revelation\", \"funny\", \"uplifting\", and encourages the reader not to wait to see it. Given the single excerpt warning, I've placed it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains enthusiastic praise calling the show a 'revelation' with an urgent recommendation not to wait, though confidence is reduced due to potential cherry-picking.",
