  "bwwExcerpt": "Leon's sluggish production does eventually gather some steam in the second act, expanding beyond the banal romantic focus of impassioned teacher James Leeds (Joshua Jackson) and reluctant student Sarah Norman (Lauren Ridloff) into more complex issues. When it tightens its focus on the rights of deaf people to choose the terms on which they interact with the hearing world - weighing the virtues of American Sign Language, lip-reading, and speech with conflicting ideologies - you can see why this was an important work back in its time.",
