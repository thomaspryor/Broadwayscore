  "bwwExcerpt": "Lacking that solid thematic foundation, Medoff's play deflates into just another romantic drama about mismatched lovers struggling to surmount their differences and live happily ever after. The writer doesn't seem to have any special aptitude for the language of love, and his efforts to lighten it up - as in a cringeworthy scene in which James climbs a tree to reach Sarah's room - are embarrassing. While I don't mean to cast aspersions on Jackson's appeal, he doesn't give off much heat for a lover with a burning heart.",
