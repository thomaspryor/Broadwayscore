  "bwwExcerpt": "The underwhelming revival (directed by Kenny Leon, the 2014 Broadway revival of \"A Raisin in the Sun\") does the play no favors with a slick, angular and metallic visual design that unnecessarily calls attention to itself. It also suffers from being played on the wide stage of Studio 54 instead of a more intimate venue.",
