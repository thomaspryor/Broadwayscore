  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A knockout professional debut performance by Ridloff...A lovely performance by Jackson...Leon’s direction seems random...The play falters badly in its second act...Eventually you realize that Mr. Medoff simply did not have the wherewithal to dramatize the fundamental conflict any further because James is his hero but Sarah is right. The play, written when it was, can’t quite support that — not because of its deaf politics, but because of its sexual politics.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Praises individual performances ('knockout', 'lovely') but criticizes direction as 'random' and identifies fundamental structural problems with the play itself. Single excerpt warning applies - mixed signals suggest middle-mixed range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises performances but criticizes the direction and the play's ability to sustain its conflict. The mixed signals and single excerpt lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review praises the performances of Ridloff and Jackson, but criticizes Leon's direction and the play's second act. The reviewer also notes the play's inability to fully dramatize the fundamental conflict, suggesting a mixed overall assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performances ('knockout', 'lovely') but significant criticism of the play's structure ('falters badly'), direction ('random'), and the playwright's inability to dramatize the central conflict, resulting in a mixed assessment.",
