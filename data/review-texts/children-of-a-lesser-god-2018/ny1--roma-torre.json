  "bwwExcerpt": "In 1982, I bought myself a ticket in the rear balcony to see 'Children Of A Lesser God,' and it was revelatory. But now, 36 years later in its first Broadway revival, it doesn't hold up all that well. The play, featuring deaf actors, still resonates, but the production is flawed.",
