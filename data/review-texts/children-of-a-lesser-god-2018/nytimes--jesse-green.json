  "bwwExcerpt": "The pungency of sign language is not the subject of Mark Medoff's 'Children of a Lesser God,' which opened on Wednesday at Studio 54 in a mixed bag of a Broadway revival directed by Kenny Leon. But it's a wonderful bonus to the play's fierce rivalry between those who promote spoken English as the highest attainable form of communication and those who are staunch partisans of silence.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic explicitly calls this 'a mixed bag of a Broadway revival,' which directly places it in mixed territory. However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as a 'mixed bag,' indicating a balance of positive and negative elements. The lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach, leading to a mid-range Mixed score. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the production as a \"mixed bag.\" Without the full review, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation, but \"mixed bag\" suggests a score in the Mixed range. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A knockout professional debut performance by Ridloff...A lovely performance by Jackson...Leon’s direction seems random...The play falters badly in its second act...Eventually you realize that Mr. Medoff simply did not have the wherewithal to dramatize the fundamental conflict any further because James is his hero but Sarah is right. The play, written when it was, can’t quite support that — not because of its deaf politics, but because of its sexual politics.\"\n\nRead more"
