  "bwwExcerpt": "Two more D/deaf students are played with a truthful-feeling tenacity by John McGinty and Treshelle Edmond. Kenny Leon's production additionally makes unprecedented steps towards inclusivity, offering simultaneous supertitles as well as the text on a mobile App, and providing ASL interpreters at designated performances. Leon's absorbing production is only undermined by an ugly abstract set of door frames and naked tree trunks.",
