  "bwwExcerpt": "The play made stars of two actresses, the late Phyllis Frelich, who won the best actress Tony in 1980, and Marlee Matlin, who won an Oscar for the 1986 film. The same will surely hold true for Ridloff, a former Miss Deaf America who was first hired to familiarize the revival's director, Kenny Leon, with the intricacies of sign language. She plays Sarah with a don't-mess-with-me vengeance, careful to not let vulnerabilities sneak through as she refuses the school's efforts to teach her to speak, explaining, 'I don't do things I can't do well.'",
