  "bwwExcerpt": "In spite of the confused second act, this 'Man and Boy' has a strong balance sheet, thanks mostly to Langella. As he did in 'Frost/Nixon,' Langella creates an irresistibly strong leader who draws us to him despite his despicable actions. Watch how Antonescu twirls a telephone cord while stalling for time or subtly maneuvers an opponent out of the chair with the most advantageous position in the room. You have to admire this robber baron for his skill and cunning despite his ruthlessness. Langella makes the game of international finance a fun one.",
