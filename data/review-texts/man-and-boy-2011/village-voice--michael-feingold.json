  "bwwExcerpt": "Some of this last shortcoming might stem from Maria Aitken's mostly apt-looking, but oddly off-kilter production. Faridany doesn't fit any of the clues the script gives Antonescu's wife; Kull and Siberry play effectively but without warmth. Grenier is expectably reliable; Hutchison has apparently been pushed toward caricature. Then there's Driver, one of the most arresting, and maddening, young actors around. His frequent moments of interest here are never sustained; the performance becomes a series of intermittent blurts, a sketch by an artist who doesn't know how to make his lines add up to form a picture. That's no way to hold the stage opposite Langella's canny, painstaking flamboyance.",
