  "bwwExcerpt": "“Man and Boy” isn’t first-rate Rattigan along the lines of “The Browning Version” and “The Winslow Boy.” But it’s first- class entertainment, especially in our post-Madoff era. The notion that one man’s cunning criminal behavior can have such far-reaching consequences not only for the wealthy, but for the recipients of his largesse, seems thoroughly credible.",
