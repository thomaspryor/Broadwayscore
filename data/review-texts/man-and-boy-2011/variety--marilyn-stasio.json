  "bwwExcerpt": "Frank Langella was born to play fabulous monsters like Richard Nixon, Count Dracula, and now, Gregor Antonescu, the international financier beset by ruinous scandal in Terence Rattigan's 1963 drama, 'Man and Boy.' Play is set during the Great Depression, but feels eerily contemporary in its cynical portrayal of industry barons who think nothing of robbing the innocent and endangering the economy with their reckless power games. Secondary roles are exceptionally well cast in Maria Aitken's well-oiled production, providing solid support for Langella's suave and superbly nuanced perf of a towering figure teetering on the edge of a moral precipice.",

The critic explicitly states the show 'feels hopelessly dated' and 'creaky,' indicating disappointment with the overall production. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges a strong performance by Langella but criticizes the play as 'creaky' and 'hopelessly dated,' leading to a negative overall assessment. | Gemini: The review praises Langella's performance but ultimately finds the play itself to be dated and uninspired, leading to a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: While the critic praises Langella's 'commanding' performance, the explicit verdict is that the play itself is 'creaky' and 'hopelessly dated,' with the superstar unable to save it. This is a clear recommendation against seeing the show.",
