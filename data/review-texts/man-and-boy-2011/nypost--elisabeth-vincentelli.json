  "bwwExcerpt": "Zach Grenier and especially Michael Siberry, terrific as Antonescu's shifty confidant, give excellent support, but there are too many stretches when Langella is left to fend for himself. Too bad: 'Man and Boy' isn't a great play, but with equal sparring partners, it could have been a very good show.",
