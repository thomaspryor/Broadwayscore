Few performers are as good as Mr. Langella at using an actor's instinctive narcissism to capture the egomania that fuels (and sometimes topples) the wildly successful.",

Clear rave-level praise for an extraordinary performance. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"blazing intensity\" and \"incinerate the air around it,\" indicating a highly favorable assessment of the performance. | Kimi: Though this is a brief excerpt, the language ('blazing intensity,' 'incinerate the air') represents unqualified ecstatic praise typical of a rave review. Scored at 94 within the Rave range given the extreme enthusiasm, with confidence set to low due to the truncated nature of the text.",
