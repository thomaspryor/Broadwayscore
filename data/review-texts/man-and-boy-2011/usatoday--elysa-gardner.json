  "bwwExcerpt": "It's ultimately Langella's show, though. His Gregor comes on as icy-smooth as Dracula. But as his fortunes threaten to crumble, the actor lets that fa?ade dissolve, subtly and masterfully. This mogul is a complicated man who never appears entirely defeated. 'Never, in the future, let the truth make you cry,' Gregor tells Basil in a particularly dark moment. It's a bit of practical advice that seems as timely as ever at this juncture.",
