  "bwwExcerpt": "Rattigan wrote stronger plays than 'Man and Boy,' 'The Deep Blue Sea' and 'Separate Tables' in particular, and he would have been even better served had the Roundabout revived one of them instead. Nor does this production, save for Mr. Langella's ennobling presence and Ms. Aitken's shrewd cuts, make the best possible case for 'Man and Boy.' But it's still what the Brits call a rattling good show. If you don't know how able a playwright Terence Rattigan was, you can now find out what you've been missing.",
