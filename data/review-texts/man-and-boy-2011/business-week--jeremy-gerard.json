  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Man and Boy\" isn't first-rate Rattigan along the lines of \"The Browning Version\" and \"The Winslow Boy.\" But it's first- class entertainment, especially in our post-Madoff era. The notion that one man's cunning criminal behavior can have such far-reaching consequences not only for the wealthy, but for the recipients of his largesse, seems thoroughly credible. Langella made a similarly devastating case for Richard M. Nixon in \"Frost/Nixon.\" He's every bit as riveting here.",
