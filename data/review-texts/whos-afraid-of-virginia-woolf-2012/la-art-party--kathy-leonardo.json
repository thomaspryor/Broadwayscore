  "bwwExcerpt": "The play is actually quite funny amidst the explosive dialogue and emotional nightmare. The amount of talent on that stage was apparent by the tension and suspense that filled the theatre. Director Gordon Greenberg kept the play moving with an ebb and flow of a rollercoaster. The scenic designer, Wilson Chin created a simple yet cluttered home, which added to the chaos of the evening. Kudos to the lighting designer, Elizabeth Harper, and costume designer Alejo Vietti.
