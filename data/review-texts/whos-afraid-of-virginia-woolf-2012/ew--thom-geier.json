    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The original rating of 87 indicates strong positive recommendation. The excerpt praises the lead performances with vivid language ('raw, lived-in authenticity', 'genuinely dangerous'), suggesting high quality. However, confidence is low due to very limited text that may be truncated. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses solely on the performances of the two leads. While positive, the lack of a broader assessment and the truncated nature of the text warrants a lower confidence and score within the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single-sentence excerpt offers strong praise for lead performances; original rating of 87 confirms rave recommendation despite truncated text.",
