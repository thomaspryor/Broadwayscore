    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt praising Pierce's performance but no broader show assessment. Given critic's 60 rating and limited text, this suggests qualified positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises David Hyde Pierce's performance but does not provide a clear overall recommendation for the show. The original rating of 60 suggests a mixed review, and the single excerpt does not provide enough context to determine a stronger recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses solely on David Hyde Pierce's performance, praising it as a \"masterclass in comic pomposity.\" Without further context about other aspects of the show, it's difficult to determine an overall recommendation, leading to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 60/100 places the review in mixed territory. While the excerpt offers high praise for David Hyde Pierce's comic performance, it comments only on one element and does not indicate a recommendation for the production as a whole.",
