    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Praises Rylance's 'bravura performance' and acknowledges 'genuine hilarity,' but describes the play itself as 'verbose' and an 'endurance test for audiences' - indicating neither clear recommendation nor discouragement. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a strong performance but criticizes the play as an 'endurance test,' suggesting a mixed impression. The single excerpt limits confidence in fully capturing the review's sentiment. | Gemini: The review praises Rylance's performance but also describes the play as an \"endurance test,\" indicating a mixed experience. The single excerpt and truncated nature lower confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the lead performance but condemns the play as an 'endurance test,' indicating suffering for audiences. As a single curated quote, confidence is low, but the language suggests a negative verdict.",
