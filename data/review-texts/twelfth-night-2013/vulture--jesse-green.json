    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges production values ('handsome') but the dominant sentiment is criticism ('oddly tepid', 'lacks a soul'). Single excerpt warning applies - this mixed-negative assessment suggests the full review likely doesn't recommend. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'handsome and well-meaning' but ultimately 'tepid', suggesting a lack of strong recommendation or discouragement. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review describes the production as \"handsome and well-meaning\" but also \"oddly tepid\", suggesting a mixed or neutral assessment. The comparison to a soulless luxury hotel further reinforces this mixed sentiment. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the visual presentation ('handsome') but delivers a fundamental criticism that the production lacks emotional core or vitality ('tepid', 'lacks a soul'), suggesting significant reservations without being entirely dismissive.",
