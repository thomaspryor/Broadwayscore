  "bwwExcerpt": "That also leaves us to savor impeccable performances under Tim Carroll's direction. Rylance is free to play a garrulous Richard, \"cheated of feature by dissembling nature,\" as a not-quite hunchback, with a flopping, useless left hand. His Richard crows with glee at every lethal lie, venomous kiss, broken promise. Rylance has mastered each of Richard's 1,171 lines and adds guffaws, asides, stutters and winces.",
