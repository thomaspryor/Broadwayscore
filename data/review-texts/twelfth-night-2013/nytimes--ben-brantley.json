    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising Hathaway's performance with 'fierce intelligence' and 'welcome lack of vanity' suggests positive assessment, but limited text and single excerpt warning requires conservative scoring within Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Anne Hathaway's performance, indicating a positive view of her role. However, without more context or a clear overall verdict, the confidence is low and the score reflects a mildly positive impression. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Hathaway's performance, suggesting a positive but limited assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performance with phrases like 'fierce intelligence' and 'welcome lack of vanity,' indicating a clear positive recommendation. Score placed at the upper end of the Positive bucket per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, though confidence is reduced due to limited text availability.",
