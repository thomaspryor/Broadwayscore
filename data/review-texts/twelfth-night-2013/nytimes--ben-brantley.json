    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising Hathaway's performance with strong positive language ('fierce intelligence', 'welcome'). However, one performer-focused quote from a curated excerpt cannot determine overall show verdict. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Hathaway's performance, indicating a positive view. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment of the review is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Hathaway's performance, suggesting a positive but limited assessment. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong, unambiguous praise for Hathaway's performance using words like 'fierce' and 'welcome,' indicating a clear recommendation, though the limited single-excerpt format prevents assessment of the overall production verdict.",
