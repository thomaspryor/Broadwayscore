  "bwwExcerpt": "The phenomenal Mark Rylance (Jerusalem) plays Olivia in an all-male rendition of Shakespeare's frothy comedy, in which all sorts of people are tripped up by inappropriate clothing. Stephen Fry costars as the starchy valet, Malvolio. This transfer from London's Globe Theatre and the West End plays in repertory with another all-boys take on the Bard: the history play Richard III. Rylance takes on the titular crookbacked villain.",
