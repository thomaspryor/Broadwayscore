  "bwwExcerpt": "Fact: Lifespan of a Fact is one of the three best new plays open on Broadway. Fact: it is early in the season; only three new plays are open. Facts, as the show seems to insist, are tricky things. Do we insist on scrupulous accuracy if that accuracy effaces larger truths? Can we call a thing true if we've massaged data to get there? Is truth an absolute anyway? Well, at least it's nice to see Daniel Radcliffe on Broadway again. Fact.",
