  "bwwExcerpt": "Mr. Radcliffe's post-'Harry Potter' career is a vanishingly rare testament to how serious a grown-up child star can become if he has sufficient talent-and resolve. In addition to choosing offbeat, consistently interesting film roles, he's also turned himself into a stage actor of exceptional quality, one who is more than good enough to go up against Mr. Cannavale and Ms. Jones, two of Broadway's very best performers, without getting his lunch munched. They are, of course and as always, as good as it's possible to be, and Ms. Silverman proves herself yet again to be the kind of director whose presence at the helm of a production is a sure sign of high quality.",
