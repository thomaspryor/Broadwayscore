  "bwwExcerpt": "If Fingal gets the upper hand in The Lifespan of a Fact, it's partly thanks to Radcliffe's appeal as an actor. His Fingal may be a persnickity fussbudget with a dubious sense of which battles to pick, but his bite is the bite of an underdog; he's scruffy and small, and his hyperintensity reads as passionate integrity that doesn't know how to contain itself. Cannavale's D'Agata, by contrast, is arrogant and dismissive, and his resistance to Fingal's critiques has an undercurrent of vanity and pique. (Whereas Fingal presents reams of hard evidence, in sometimes comical excess, the playwrights give D'Agata only a few philosophical arguments.)",
