  "bwwExcerpt": "Jim is the most fleshed-out character. As he morphs from earnest to rabidly overzealous, a bearded, bed-headed Radcliffe delivers a deft, deliciously sly comic performance. Alongside Cannavale's strapping John, he looks puny, an underdog in every way. Cannavale has less to work with, but digs deep and gets beyond John's puffy self-importance to find something poignant. Jones, ever indispensable, adds heaps of humor as the voice of reason. That's something we need more of - and that's a fact.",
