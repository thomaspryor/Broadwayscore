  "bwwExcerpt": "What's most impressive about this stage version, written by Jeremy Kareken, David Murrell and Gordon Farrell and directed by Leigh Silverman ('Violet'), is that it transforms something potentially insider-ish and wonky into a surprisingly funny and urgent drama. Radcliffe and Cannavale are perfectly cast foils, the one earnest to a fault, the other all swagger and self-importance. The terrific Jones functions as the audience stand-in, her allegiances shifting each time the persnickety Fingal finds another point of complaint in D'Agata's essay.",
