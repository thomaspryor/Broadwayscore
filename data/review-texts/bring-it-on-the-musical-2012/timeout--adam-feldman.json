The text highlights energy and talent but lacks genuine excitement, indicating a balanced view. | Gemini: The review acknowledges energy and talent but finds it lacking genuine excitement. Given the critic's rating of 60, this falls squarely in the mixed category. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
