  "bwwExcerpt": "The first surprise of “Bring It On The Musical\"...is that people as awesome as Tony winners Lin-Manuel Miranda and Tom Kitt were drawn to remake a largely forgettable film that spawned four direct-to-video sequels. Is Broadway really the obvious next step in this commercial franchise?...Questions of audience aside, was it a mistake for these young theatrical talents, who I feel hold the future of Broadway in their hands, to collaborate on such a trifle? It would be un-cheerleader-like of me to s",

The text cuts off mid-sentence at what appears to be a transition ('It would be un-cheerleader-like of me to s'), so the final verdict is unknown. The skeptical tone about the source material and creative choices suggests mixed-to-negative territory, but without the conclusion, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt questions the choice of project for talented individuals, suggesting it might be a \"trifle.\" The truncated text makes it difficult to determine the final verdict, but the tone leans towards mixed feelings. | Kimi: The excerpt questions why talented creators would adapt a 'forgettable' film, calling the project a 'trifle,' but the text is truncated mid-sentence before delivering a clear final verdict.",
