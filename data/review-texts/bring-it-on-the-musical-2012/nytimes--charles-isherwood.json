The excerpt indicates a mixed reception, with some highlights but overall not a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges some positive aspects like wit and songs, but ultimately places it below other musicals and describes it as a \"daffy lark.\" The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic praises the cheerleading routines and songs but dismisses the show overall as a lightweight 'daffy lark' unworthy of comparison to superior musicals, indicating a mixed verdict.",
