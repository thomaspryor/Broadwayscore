  "bwwExcerpt": "I braced, I flinched, and then, to my surprise and delight ... I applauded. Repeatedly. Bring It On certainly gives fierce face, but it also backs up that glittering grill with just enough sinew and substance — musical, physical and textual — to put it in trophy contention as a worthy, weightless delight, a guilty pleasure you needn't feel too guilty about.",

It describes the show as a 'worthy, weightless delight' and a 'guilty pleasure you needn't feel too guilty about,' indicating a strong positive recommendation despite the text quality warning. | Gemini: The critic expresses surprise and delight, applauding repeatedly and calling it a 'worthy, weightless delight' and a 'guilty pleasure you needn't feel too guilty about,' indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
