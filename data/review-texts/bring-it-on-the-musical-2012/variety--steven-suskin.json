  "bwwExcerpt": "Neither roses nor brickbats are likely to be thrown at \"Bring It On,\" the new musical at the St. James, but you'll see plenty of cheerleaders tossed up high. With a story drawn not from the 2000 film starring Kirsten Dunst, but rather from one of its four direct-to-video sequels, the tuner remains airborne often enough to overcome several obstacles along the way, starting with overly familiar plotting and characters.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - acknowledges problems (familiar plotting) but says show 'overcomes' them with strong performances and staging. Truncated mid-sentence limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mildly positive review, noting strong performances and impressive staging despite familiar plotting. The single excerpt warning and lack of a full review text limit confidence. | Gemini: The review states that neither roses nor brickbats are likely, indicating a mixed reaction. The excerpt mentions overcoming obstacles but also points out familiar plotting, suggesting a middle-ground assessment. | Kimi: While the critic notes 'overly familiar plotting' and 'obstacles,' the verdict that the show 'remains airborne' and praise for 'strong performances' and 'athletically impressive staging' constitute a qualified recommendation. The single, truncated excerpt warrants cautious scoring at the lower end of the Positive range.",
