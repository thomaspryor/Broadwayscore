  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Bring It On: The Musical\" aspires to be nothing more than a frothy distraction with just a hint of that time-honored moral \"Winning isn't everything.\" This wisp of cotton candy about a high school cheerleading competition is \"inspired\" by the Universal Pictures film franchise of the same title. Aimed squarely at teenage girls and designed to tour the country, the show would probably feel more at home at Madison Square Garden than on the stage of the St. James Theatre.",
