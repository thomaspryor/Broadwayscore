    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The review acknowledges positive elements (energy, pizzazz) but the overall assessment is lukewarm - 'reasonably entertaining' with the significant caveat 'if hardly memorable.' This suggests neither strong recommendation nor discouragement. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'reasonably entertaining' but not 'memorable', indicating a mixed reception with some positive elements but lacking strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review states the show is \"reasonably entertaining,\" which is a positive but not enthusiastic recommendation. The phrase \"if hardly a memorable one\" indicates a reservation, placing it in the lower end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show's athletic energy and entertainment value while noting the slight story and lack of memorability, delivering a qualified but clear recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
