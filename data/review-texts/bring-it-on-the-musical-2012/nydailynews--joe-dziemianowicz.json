The critic enjoyed it enough to smile, implying a mild recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review states that the show \"kept me smiling\" and that \"sometimes pretty silly — and very acrobatic — is enough,\" indicating a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation.
