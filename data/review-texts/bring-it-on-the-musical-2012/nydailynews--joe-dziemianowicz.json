Lower end of Positive bucket due to reservations and single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt indicates a positive experience despite acknowledging the show doesn't innovate ('doesn’t break new ground'). The tone suggests enjoyment ('kept me smiling'), but the lack of groundbreaking content suggests a mild recommendation. | Gemini: The review states it \"kept me smiling\" and \"is enough\", indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it cautiously. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows mild appreciation ('kept me smiling') with acknowledgment that the show is lightweight ('doesn't break new ground,' 'silly'), indicating a qualified recommendation at the lower end of Positive per the excerpt guidance.",
