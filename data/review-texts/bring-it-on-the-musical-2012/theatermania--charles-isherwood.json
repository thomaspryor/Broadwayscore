    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt presents balanced view - praises the exciting dance numbers but criticizes the formulaic book. The 'even if' construction suggests the negatives outweigh the positives slightly. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the dance numbers and routines as exciting, suggesting a positive experience, but notes the book is familiar and formulaic, indicating some reservations. With only one excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the dance numbers but notes the book is formulaic. Given the single excerpt and the positive but qualified tone, I placed it in the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, highlighting genuinely exciting dance sequences while criticizing the book as familiar and formulaic, indicating a mild recommendation to see the show for its production values.",
