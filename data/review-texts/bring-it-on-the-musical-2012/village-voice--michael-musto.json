  "bwwExcerpt": "Director/choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler's staging throws s-p-i-r-i-t in your face, with lots of people lifting other people at regular intervals. And the plot--complete with an obligatory she-messed-up twist--has draggy stretches, but when the humor clicks, it brings on spoofy amusement.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows balanced assessment - acknowledges problems (draggy stretches, formulaic plot) but finds some redeeming humor. Neither clearly recommends nor discourages. | GPT-4o: The review mentions both positive aspects (humor clicking) and negative ones (draggy stretches, obligatory plot twist). The single excerpt provides mixed signals, leading to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt notes both positive and negative aspects, indicating a mixed reaction. The phrase \"draggy stretches\" suggests flaws, while \"spoofy amusement\" points to enjoyable moments. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the heavy-handed staging ('throws s-p-i-r-i-t in your face'), repetitive choreography, and draggy plot stretches with obligatory twists, while offering only qualified praise ('when the humor clicks') for mild 'spoofy amusement.' With significant reservations outweighing the modest positive note, this falls into Mixed territory.",
