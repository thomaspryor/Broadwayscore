  "bwwExcerpt": "'Significant Other' is a slick, well-made, funny-sad new Broadway comedy, the kind that doesn't often get a first-rate commercial production these days. At its soft heart, however, the play is really a 21st century theater throwback to that old song that cried, 'Those wedding bells are breaking up that old gang of mine.'",
