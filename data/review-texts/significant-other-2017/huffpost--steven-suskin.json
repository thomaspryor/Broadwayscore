  "bwwExcerpt": "Significant Other does not sound like a traditional Broadway comedy hit in the manner of-say-Neil Simon, given that the leading man is desperately seeking a man to love. But the play is about friendship and loneliness, neither of which have gone out of style; and the good-natured feelings just about spill over the footlights to envelop the audience. Mix Harmon's warm-hearted script with Glick's superb performance and the artfully flavorful assistance of Mendez and Barrie, and you've got an exceedingly winning Broadway comedy.",
