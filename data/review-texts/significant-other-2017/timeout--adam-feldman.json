    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges positive qualities ('sharp and heartfelt') but clearly states it 'doesn't quite achieve' its goals. The original 60 rating confirms this mixed assessment. | GPT-4o: The critic describes the play as 'sharp and heartfelt' but notes it falls short of its emotional goals. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (\"sharp and heartfelt\") but also expresses reservations about its emotional impact. Given the critic's rating of 60, this falls squarely into the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic assigns a 60/100 rating, acknowledging the show's sharp writing and heartfelt moments while criticizing its failure to achieve full emotional impact, resulting in a middle-ground assessment.",
