  "bwwExcerpt": "Gay characters in mass culture often serve as supportive accessories in the marriage plots of others, but Harmon keeps Jordan in sharp, brutally revealing focus. Anyone whose heart has ever been broken can relate to his plight. Pushing 30, he has never been in a serious relationship, and his desperation to change that-sabotaged by his obsessiveness and awkwardness-only makes things worse. Glick delivers a star-making, gut-wrenching performance of deep sweetness and quicksilver mood shifts; a scene in which he considers sending an intense love email to a handsome coworker is a masterpiece of comic anxiety, and his climactic rant of pent-up resentment earns vigorous applause.",

The original 60 rating confirms this mixed assessment. | GPT-4o: The critic describes the play as 'sharp and heartfelt' but notes it falls short of its emotional goals. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (\"sharp and heartfelt\") but also expresses reservations about its emotional impact. Given the critic's rating of 60, this falls squarely into the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic assigns a 60/100 rating, acknowledging the show's sharp writing and heartfelt moments while criticizing its failure to achieve full emotional impact, resulting in a middle-ground assessment.",
