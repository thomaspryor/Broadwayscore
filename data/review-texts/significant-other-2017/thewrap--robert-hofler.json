  "bwwExcerpt": "'Significant Other' begins as a gay '40-Year-Old Virgin' and ends up a gay 'Bridesmaids.' That's not necessarily a negative thing to say about Joshua Harmon's new comedy, which opened Thursday at Broadway's Booth Theatre. The show never feels derivative, even though you might get the impression you've seen this distraught hero before through a different prism in an alternate universe.",
