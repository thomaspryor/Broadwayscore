  "bwwExcerpt": "In its 2015 Off-Broadway run, the comedy by Joshua Harmon ('Bad Jews') struck me as 'hilarious, heart-tugging and annoying.' On Broadway at the Booth Theatre, same goes. Hilarity comes from spry, occasionally crude one-liners showcased to the max by the fine cast as well as Trip Cullman's deft direction. Heart-tugging moments arise between Jordan and his age-addled grandmother (Barbara Barrie).",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Hilarity comes from spry, occasionally crude one-liners showcased to the max by the fine cast as well as Trip Cullman’s deft direction...The annoying part? Contrivances, cartoonishness and the play’s retro sensibility. Why no same-sex nuptials?
