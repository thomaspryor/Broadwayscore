  "bwwExcerpt": "The first time I saw Joshua Harmon's comedy 'Significant Other,' off-Broadway a couple of years ago, I found the main character incredibly irritating. I don't know what happened to the play - it's essentially the same production - or to me in the interim, but seeing it on Broadway, where it opened Thursday night at the Booth Theatre, my feelings about the character, Jordan, had changed. I liked him, and the play, a lot better.",
