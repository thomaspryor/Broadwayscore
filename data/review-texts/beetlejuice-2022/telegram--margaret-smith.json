  "bwwExcerpt": "All the characters find themselves on a journey that defies all physical and metaphysical dimensions, with a game show, newly-deceased football stars, a disgruntled beauty queen, an underworld hypermanaged by a cantankerous bureaucrat, and breathtaking sets, scenery and effects. Burtonesque-stylized imagery illuminates everything, so get ready for lots of lurid purple, black-and-white geometric patterns and intense neon green, all in morbid whimsy.",

However, due to the single excerpt and lack of a full review, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review describes the show as having 'breathtaking sets, scenery and effects' and 'Burtonesque-stylized imagery', which suggests a positive experience. However, due to the limited excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production design and visual effects using words like 'breathtaking' and 'illuminates,' indicating a clear positive recommendation for this aspect of the show, though the single-excerpt format limits overall confidence.",
