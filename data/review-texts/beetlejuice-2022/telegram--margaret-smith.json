  "bwwExcerpt": "All the characters find themselves on a journey that defies all physical and metaphysical dimensions, with a game show, newly-deceased football stars, a disgruntled beauty queen, an underworld hypermanaged by a cantankerous bureaucrat, and breathtaking sets, scenery and effects. Burtonesque-stylized imagery illuminates everything, so get ready for lots of lurid purple, black-and-white geometric patterns and intense neon green, all in morbid whimsy.",
