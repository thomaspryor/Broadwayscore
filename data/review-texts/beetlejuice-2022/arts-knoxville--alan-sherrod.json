  "bwwExcerpt": "It’s worth mentioning upfront that the creators have taken substantial license with some of the original Burton plot details and characters, replacing comic and cinematic nuances with brash and shallow in-your-face cartoon-ish-ness that is a louder, but a less complex alternative. For example, the role of Beetlejuice himself (Justin Collette, who clearly knows how to entertain an audience) has been inflated into a character that is even more manic and desperate, and admittedly, “more vaudeville.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Critic finds the adaptation 'brash and shallow' compared to the source material, calling it 'less complex' despite acknowledging the lead performer's entertainment value. Single excerpt warning applies - this negative assessment may not reflect the full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights significant changes to the original material, suggesting a less complex and more brash presentation. While the performance of Justin Collette is noted positively, the overall tone suggests a mixed view with reservations about the adaptation's depth and complexity. | Gemini: The review acknowledges entertainment value but criticizes the show for sacrificing complexity for loudness and cartoonishness. Given the single excerpt and aggregator context, 'mixed' seems most appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the adaptation as 'shallow' and 'less complex' than the original film, while acknowledging the lead performer entertains. The 'Flat' aggregator rating indicates an overall mixed reception.",
