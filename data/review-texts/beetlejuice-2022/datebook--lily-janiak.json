  "bwwExcerpt": "Whereas Michael Keaton rendered the film’s title ghoul as a jabbering, hyperkinetic creature — something genuinely otherworldly and fascinating, the way festering wounds fascinate — in the musical, Beetlejuice (Justin Collette) mostly lurches back and forth along the schoolyard-bully-to-sad-sack-comedian pipeline. But we’re asked to care about and psychologize him, too. He had a rough childhood, and he just wants someone to love him, in all his loathsomeness.",

However, this is one curated quote that may not reflect the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the portrayal of Beetlejuice as lacking the fascinating qualities of the film version, suggesting a disappointing adaptation. The tone implies a negative view, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt contrasts the musical's portrayal of Beetlejuice unfavorably with the film version, suggesting a less compelling and more generic characterization. The critic also notes the attempt to psychologize him, which seems to be viewed negatively. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the musical's interpretation of the title character as inferior to the film version, describing the performance as merely lurching between bully and sad-sack tropes rather than otherworldly, and objects to the psychologizing of the character.",
