  "bwwExcerpt": "Whereas Michael Keaton rendered the film’s title ghoul as a jabbering, hyperkinetic creature — something genuinely otherworldly and fascinating, the way festering wounds fascinate — in the musical, Beetlejuice (Justin Collette) mostly lurches back and forth along the schoolyard-bully-to-sad-sack-comedian pipeline. But we’re asked to care about and psychologize him, too. He had a rough childhood, and he just wants someone to love him, in all his loathsomeness.",
