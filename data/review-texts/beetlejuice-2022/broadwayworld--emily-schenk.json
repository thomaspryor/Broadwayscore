  "bwwExcerpt": "The Beetlejuice soundtrack is one you will be flying home to download because every song is extremely catchy and entices you to want to listen to it on repeat! The first time I saw this show was in New York, and I was blown away by the performances and scenic design. I feared the experience would be hard to transfer to a national tour. However, the national touring cast didn't just calm my fears but defeated them. The whole cast exceeded my expectations and truly made it their own. Isabella Esle",
