  "bwwExcerpt": "If you are a MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, ADAMS FAMILY, and THE ROCKY HORROR SHOW fan, you, like the duo of guys sitting near me, who were dressed in costumes that paralleled Beetlejuice's stripped outfit, sang along with the songs, and found the exaggeration and slapstick hysterical, will become 'Bettlejuicers.' If NEXT TO NORMAL, RENT, WEST SIDE STORY and SPRING AWAKENING are your thing, you'll probably find the whole thing trite and ridiculous.",
