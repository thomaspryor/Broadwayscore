  "bwwExcerpt": "Collette is a whirling dervish of hilarity as Beetlejuice, Esler’s portrayal of goth teen Lydia is rich and textured. Goldfarb is appropriately milquetoast as Adam, although he summons some gumption in the second act. McGinnis, as Barbara, is perfectly paired with Goldfarb. Sharp is terrific as Charles, especially in his tear-jerking scene with Lydia when they reconcile and sing “Home.” Litzsinger is a joy as spacey Delia.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Consistent praise across the entire cast with specific positive descriptors like 'hilarity', 'rich and textured', 'terrific', and 'joy'. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt limitation - this could be cherry-picked praise from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides positive evaluations of multiple performances, highlighting strong portrayals and emotional impact. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, and the score is at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is filled with positive descriptions of the performances, indicating a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers uniformly enthusiastic praise for the entire cast using vivid superlatives like 'whirling dervish of hilarity,' 'terrific,' and 'a joy,' indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited excerpt length.",
