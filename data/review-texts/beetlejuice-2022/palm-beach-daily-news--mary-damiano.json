  "bwwExcerpt": "Collette is a whirling dervish of hilarity as Beetlejuice, Esler’s portrayal of goth teen Lydia is rich and textured. Goldfarb is appropriately milquetoast as Adam, although he summons some gumption in the second act. McGinnis, as Barbara, is perfectly paired with Goldfarb. Sharp is terrific as Charles, especially in his tear-jerking scene with Lydia when they reconcile and sing “Home.” Litzsinger is a joy as spacey Delia.",
