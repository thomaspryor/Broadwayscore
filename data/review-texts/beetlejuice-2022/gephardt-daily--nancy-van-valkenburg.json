  "bwwExcerpt": "The acting is strong, and the musical also allows much more character development for Lydia, through spoken word and song, and — bonus points here — she may just be smart enough to trick a certain demon rather than becoming his unwitting victim.\n\nDespite changes, several key movie scenes and “special effects” also appear in the musical, with most of them being effective and satisfying. And the lively music and high caliber sets, costumes and dance numbers naturally add a lot of energy the movie ",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows consistent praise for acting, character development, effects, music, sets, costumes, and dance. Multiple positive elements suggest solid recommendation, but single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong acting, effective special effects, and energetic music and production elements. Despite the limited text, the positive aspects suggest a recommendation, though the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review highlights strong acting, character development, effective special effects, lively music, and high-caliber sets, costumes, and dance numbers, indicating a positive overall experience. The aggregator context also suggests a positive reception. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the acting, character development, and production elements (sets, costumes, effects) using words like 'strong,' 'high caliber,' and 'satisfying.' As a clearly positive single excerpt, it falls in the upper range of the Positive bucket.",
