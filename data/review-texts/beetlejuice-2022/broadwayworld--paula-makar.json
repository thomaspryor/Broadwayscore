  "bwwExcerpt": "OMG what a fun time I had experiencing BEETLEJUICE at Century II last night! The audience was having a blast, whooping and hollering, and gave the cast a standing ovation at the end of it all! This is not going to be my usual in depth review, as I wanted to get this out quickly before the show leaves town! Besides, something this entertaining doesn’t need a deep dive, although I could go there.",

The critic explicitly mentions the show 'leaving town,' confirming this is a tour stop rather than the Broadway engagement.",
