  "bwwExcerpt": "The script deviates a bit from the film in which Beetlejuice is, essentially, a supporting character—one who steals the show, but a supporting character all the same. In the stage production, he’s introduced in the first few minutes and is Lydia’s co-lead.

Aggregator context suggests positive verdict, so scoring in lower Positive range due to limited evidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights positive changes from the film to the stage production, such as a more complex relationship and added heart, indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes changes made to the stage production, highlighting a more complex relationship and giving the show more heart. Given the limited text, it leans towards a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the musical's modernization and character development, noting it adds 'more heart' compared to the film, though the single curated excerpt and truncation warrant conservative scoring.",
