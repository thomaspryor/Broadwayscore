  "bwwExcerpt": "Beetlejuice is a wild ride with heart. Based on the 1988 Tim Burton classic starring Michael Keaton, the Broadway adaptation brings the story to life with clever songs, magic and special effects. From the lavish (and ever-changing) set of the Maitland house to the cast of recently deceased characters found in the Netherworld, the show is a fast-paced adventure with surprises around every corner.",
