  "bwwExcerpt": "Dear Readers, warning, I’m about to be a bit of a snob here.  I know, big surprise.  But I’m not the biggest fan of the musical, “Beetlejuice”, currently playing at the Paramount Theatre.  I wasn’t a fan when I first heard the cast recording and now having seen it, I can’t say my opinion has changed all that much.  A bit, but not much.",

However, this is only one excerpt and may not capture the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses a lack of enthusiasm for the show, indicating that seeing it did not significantly improve their opinion. The tone suggests a negative stance, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The critic states they were not a fan of the musical before seeing it, and their opinion hasn't changed much after seeing it. This indicates a negative review.",
