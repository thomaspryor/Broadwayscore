  "bwwExcerpt": "Dear Readers, warning, I’m about to be a bit of a snob here.  I know, big surprise.  But I’m not the biggest fan of the musical, “Beetlejuice”, currently playing at the Paramount Theatre.  I wasn’t a fan when I first heard the cast recording and now having seen it, I can’t say my opinion has changed all that much.  A bit, but not much.",
