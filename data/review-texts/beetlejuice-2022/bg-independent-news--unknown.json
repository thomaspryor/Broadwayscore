  "bwwExcerpt": "David DuPont, BG Independent News: This is a show about death. A show that laughs in the face of mortality. A show that shocks the senses. Beetlejuice revels as he seeks to offend as he sings for the first time 'The Whole ‘Being Dead’ Thing,' a piece by composer Eddie Perfect that pops up throughout the show. Yet, the audience knows why they came. They came knowing they would be dared to be offended. They laugh along.",
