    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with positive elements (strong acting, character development improvements) but text is clearly truncated mid-sentence. Given the single excerpt warning and incomplete nature, scoring at lower end of Positive bucket with low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong acting and improved character development, suggesting a positive view. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context warrant a lower confidence and score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the acting and character development, suggesting a positive experience overall. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear, enthusiastic praise for the acting and character development ('bonus points,' 'strong'), placing it in the upper range of Positive. However, as a single truncated excerpt under 150 words, the overall verdict may not be fully represented.",
