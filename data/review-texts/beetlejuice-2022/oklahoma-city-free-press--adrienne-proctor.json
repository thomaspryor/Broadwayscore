  "bwwExcerpt": "It’s a treat to see Marc Ginsburg perform as Beetlejuice. The undead menace is abrasive and gross, inappropriate and jarring, and must be all kinds of fun to portray. Ginsburg is having a blast on stage, making the audience cringe, laugh, and shudder in delight. Ginsburg fully leans into the creep factor, yet he manages to create a likable character out of the would-be villain.",
