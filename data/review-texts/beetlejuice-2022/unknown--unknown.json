  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A creative team that includes director Alex Timbers and his inspired designers David Korins (sets) and William Ivey Long (costumes), animate this parade of eccentricity with flair and great comedy technique that turns it into a subversive delight. The score by Eddie Perfect is full of wit and grit, and Scott Brown and Anthony King's book propels it forward smartly. There are also hilarious performances from Leslie Kritzer and Sophia Anne Caruso.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for creative team, design, score, book, and performances using words like 'inspired,' 'subversive delight,' 'wit and grit,' and 'hilarious.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the creative team, score, book, and performances, describing the show as a 'subversive delight'. The language suggests a strong positive impression, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the direction, design, score, book, and performances. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it as a strong positive within the bucket. | Kimi: Multiple superlatives ('inspired,' 'flair,' 'subversive delight') and enthusiastic praise for creative team, score, book, and performances. Single excerpt limitation keeps confidence at medium, but the language is strongly positive enough to place in Rave bucket.",
