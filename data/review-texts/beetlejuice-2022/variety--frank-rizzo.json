  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The retooling done since its out-of-town tryout in D.C. gives the latest film-to-musical adaptation fresh snap, surprises and (gasp!) even heart. Sure, the narrative becomes a bit of a cluster-muck in the second act — but mostly it’s just screamingly good fun...The plotting eventually goes completely off the rails, but keeping things entertaining enough are the off-the-wall humor, endless visuals and aural delights, tuneful music and wicked lyrics of Perfect.\"\n\nRead more",

The positive tone and emphasis on entertainment suggest a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review is mostly positive, describing the show as having \"fresh snap, surprises and (gasp!) even heart\" and \"screamingly good fun\", but acknowledges a narrative issue in the second act. | Kimi: The critic enthusiastically praises the show's humor, visuals, music, and lyrics as 'screamingly good fun' with 'fresh snap' and 'heart,' though acknowledging significant plotting problems in the second act.",
