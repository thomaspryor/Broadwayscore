  "bwwExcerpt": "“Beetlejuice” is based on the 1988 Tim Burton film of the same name. For those who have seen the movie, don't expect a rerun … the characters are the same, but the plot shifts are fairly enormous. With a book by Scott Brown and Anthony King, music and lyrics by Eddie Perfect the show will leave you cheering in your seat, stomping your feet, rolling over in fits of laughter and even a little bit scared.",
