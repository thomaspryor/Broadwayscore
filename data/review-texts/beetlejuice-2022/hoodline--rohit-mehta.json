  "bwwExcerpt": "Justin Collette's performance as Beetlejuice garnered praise, with FOX 5 Atlanta noting his 'gravelly-voiced' portrayal was a standout. The role of Lydia was played by Jackera Davis, who stepped in for Isabella Esler, and was lauded for her confidence. The cast was rounded out with seasoned Broadway performers such as Megan McGinnis and Will Burton as the endearing deceased couple, Barbara and Adam Maitland.",
