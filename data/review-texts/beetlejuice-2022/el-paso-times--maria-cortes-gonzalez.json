However, confidence is low due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Collette's performance as 'captivating and hilarious' and mentions entertaining songs, suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"captivating\" and \"hilarious\", suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt and BroadwayWorld aggregator verdict, I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performance ('captivating and hilarious') and the musical numbers ('most entertaining'), indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited available text.",
