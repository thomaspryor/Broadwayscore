    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising cast performance suggests positive review, but limited text prevents assessment of overall show verdict. Using lower end of Positive range due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast's performance, indicating a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the cast, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation strength. I'm placing it in the positive bucket, but with low confidence due to the limited information. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers strong praise for the cast ('top-notch', 'giving 100%'), indicating a positive recommendation, though the limited scope and lack of commentary on other production elements prevent a Rave classification.",
