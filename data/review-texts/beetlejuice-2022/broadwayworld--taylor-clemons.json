  "bwwExcerpt": "On opening night, the titular role was played by Justin Collette who did a phenomenal job. He expertly helmed the show and you can feel how settled into the role he is, as his hilarious ad-libs came fast and furiously. Isabella Esler is a vocal powerhouse as Lydia, but she also has many wonderful and heartfelt acting moments as well, especially in her 11 o’clock number “Home”. Adam and Barbara Maitland were played by Will Burton and Lexie Dorsett Sharp (a cover for the role) respectively. Both B",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with consistent praise for performances ('phenomenal job', 'vocal powerhouse', 'expertly helmed') suggests positive review, but text is clearly truncated mid-sentence limiting confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances, especially Justin Collette's, describing them as 'phenomenal' and 'expertly helmed'. The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances of multiple actors, especially Justin Collette, suggesting a positive experience. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains clearly positive evaluative language about the performances ('phenomenal', 'expertly', 'powerhouse', 'wonderful'), indicating a recommendation in the upper Positive range, though confidence is low due to truncated text and lack of full review context.",
