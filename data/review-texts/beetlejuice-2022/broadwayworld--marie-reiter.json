    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clear praise for performers, especially the lead. However, text cuts off mid-sentence and only focuses on one aspect (performance), making full assessment impossible. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the talent of the performers, particularly Esler, suggesting a positive view of the performances. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context necessitate a cautious, lower-end Positive score. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performers, especially Esler. Given the limited text, a positive score with low confidence is appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performance, highlighting vocal ability and characterization with phrases like 'powerful belt' and 'finely tuned.' However, as this is a single curated excerpt with truncated text, confidence is reduced regarding the overall production verdict.",
