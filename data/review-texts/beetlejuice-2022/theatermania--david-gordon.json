    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('crowd-pleasing', 'delivers on its promise') but with notable reservations about emotional depth. Single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt describes the show as 'crowd-pleasing' and delivering 'irreverent fun', indicating a positive experience. However, it notes some shortcomings in emotional impact, suggesting reservations. | Gemini: The review states that the musical is \"crowd-pleasing\" and \"delivers on its promise\", which indicates a positive recommendation. However, the phrase \"even if it doesn't always hit the emotional beats it's aiming for\" suggests some reservations, placing it in the lower end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise ('crowd-pleasing,' 'delivers') with a minor caveat about emotional impact, placing it in the Positive bucket. Score reflects the 'clearly positive' instruction for single excerpts, with low confidence due to limited available text.",
