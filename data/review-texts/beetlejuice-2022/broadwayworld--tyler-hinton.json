  "bwwExcerpt": "Standby Andrew Kober commands the stage with winking brashness as the title character, which he plays on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays (otherwise played by Justin Collette).\n\nIsabella Esler’s performance as Lydia is poignant and potent.  Will Burton is a delightful Adam and Britney Coleman a wonderful partner as Barbara. \n\nOther memorable performers include Jesse Sharp as Charles, Kate Marilley as Delia, Abe Goldfarb as Otho, Jackera Davis as Girl Scout, and Danielle Marie Gonzalez as Miss",
