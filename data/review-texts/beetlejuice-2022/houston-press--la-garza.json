However, the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review text suggest a cautious approach, placing it in the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive experience due to nostalgia and iconic elements, but it's a single excerpt, so confidence is low and the score is in the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates mild appreciation for the production's nostalgic elements and iconic songs, though the 'That said' framing suggests this is a qualified concession within a potentially mixed review.",
