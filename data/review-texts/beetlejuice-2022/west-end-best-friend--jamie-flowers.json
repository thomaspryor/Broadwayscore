However, confidence is low due to limited excerpt availability. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast and highlights the fun and enchanting performances, suggesting a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the upper end of the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the cast, especially Collette as Beetlejuice, and describes the show as \"pure fun to watch.\" Given the limited text, a positive score is appropriate, but confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strong praise ('incredible cast', 'pure fun', 'enchanting') indicating an enthusiastic recommendation, though the single-excerpt limitation requires caution.",
