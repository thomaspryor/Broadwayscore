  "bwwExcerpt": "The music is incredibly catchy and witty, and when combined with the set, costumes, and a little theater magic, it adds up to a wonderful adapted version of the classic film that is equal parts high-energy, morbid, and meaningful. That’s not to say this version of “Beetlejuice” doesn’t make some changes to the classic story, it certainly does.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('wonderful', 'incredibly catchy and witty') with enthusiastic tone about the adaptation. Text appears cut off mid-sentence, and single excerpt warning applies, but available content shows clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the music, set, and adaptation, describing it as 'wonderful' and 'high-energy'. Despite changes to the story, the review is clearly positive. Due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the music, set, costumes, and overall adaptation. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing the score at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt features unambiguous enthusiasm, praising the music as 'incredibly catchy,' the production as 'wonderful,' and noting the modernization succeeds while preserving iconic moments. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive text, this falls in the upper Positive range despite truncation and curated excerpt limitations.",
