  "bwwExcerpt": "Justin Collette plays the ghost with the most, Beetlejuice.  On the positive side, Collette tried to make the character his own rather than channel Michael Keaton.  On the negative side, his portrayal wasn’t especially endearing.  I would describe him as a combination of Robin Williams meets Daffy Duck meets naughty Sponge Bob.  On paper this might seem like non-stop fun, but over the course of two plus hours, it gets tiring.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic gives balanced positive (actor tried to make it his own) and negative (not endearing, gets tiring) assessment. The aggregator context indicates a 'Flat' verdict, supporting a mixed classification. Single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review provides both positive and negative aspects of Justin Collette's performance, ultimately suggesting that the portrayal becomes tiring over time. The lack of a clear recommendation or discouragement places it in the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review presents both positive and negative aspects of the performance, ultimately suggesting it becomes tiresome over time, indicating a mixed overall impression. | Kimi: The excerpt presents a balanced assessment acknowledging the actor's effort to differentiate the role but ultimately finds the portrayal tiring over the full runtime. With only one curated excerpt available and the aggregator noting a 'Flat' verdict, this falls into Mixed territory with neither a clear recommendation nor rejection.",
