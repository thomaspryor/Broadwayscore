  "bwwExcerpt": "Justin Collette plays the ghost with the most, Beetlejuice.  On the positive side, Collette tried to make the character his own rather than channel Michael Keaton.  On the negative side, his portrayal wasn’t especially endearing.  I would describe him as a combination of Robin Williams meets Daffy Duck meets naughty Sponge Bob.  On paper this might seem like non-stop fun, but over the course of two plus hours, it gets tiring.",
