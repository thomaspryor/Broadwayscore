The 'overstay its welcome' comment suggests qualified approval at best. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the musical's ability to overcome challenges and be funnier than the movie, but also highlights issues like plot complexity and limited comic material for performers. The single excerpt suggests mixed sentiments. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the musical surmounting hurdles and being funnier than the movie, but also mentions the plot's cumbersome gyrations and the performers not being given much comic material. This suggests a mixed experience. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates the show succeeds against odds and improves on the source material, but criticizes the cumbersome plot and suggests it may overstay its welcome, indicating a qualified, lukewarm recommendation.",
