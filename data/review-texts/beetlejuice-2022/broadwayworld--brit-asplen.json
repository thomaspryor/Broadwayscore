With only one curated quote and truncated text, scoring conservatively in lower positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the show's visual appeal and suitability for the Halloween season, suggesting an enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the show's aesthetics and spectacle, suggesting a positive experience, but the truncated nature and single excerpt lower the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the production's visual design and aesthetic appeal using words like 'sparkles' and 'spectacular,' though the single-excerpt limitation and truncated text prevent a definitive assessment of the overall verdict.",
