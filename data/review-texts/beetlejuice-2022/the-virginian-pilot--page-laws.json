    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic explicitly frames the recommendation as conditional with 'Depends,' which is classic mixed review language - neither recommending nor discouraging attendance. However, confidence is low due to having only one excerpt that may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt presents an ambiguous recommendation, suggesting it may appeal to some but not others. The lack of a clear positive or negative stance places it in the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt states that whether the show is \"worth a see\" depends, indicating a mixed or neutral stance. Given the limited text, confidence is low.",
