  "bwwExcerpt": "I was a skeptic until I saw “Beetlejuice” on Wednesday at the San Diego Civic Theatre. The 2018 Broadway musical’s first national tour is playing through Sunday and tickets for the run are almost gone. Not only does the musical have a loyal cult following — who arrive costumed as characters from the musical — it has also wowed the season subscribers who are arriving with only vague memories of the movie.",
