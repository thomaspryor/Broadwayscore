  "bwwExcerpt": "Collette's Beetlejuice was lovably hilarious. The entire cast was exceptionally talented, but Collette carried the show with his wit and larger-than-life stage presence. Every minute Collette was onstage was essentially a nonstop standup comedy act. With his ceaseless energy, impeccable comedic timing and occassional breaking the fourth wall, Collette made the audience howl with laughter during much of the two-and-a-half-hour show.",
