  "bwwExcerpt": "Collette's Beetlejuice was lovably hilarious. The entire cast was exceptionally talented, but Collette carried the show with his wit and larger-than-life stage presence. Every minute Collette was onstage was essentially a nonstop standup comedy act. With his ceaseless energy, impeccable comedic timing and occassional breaking the fourth wall, Collette made the audience howl with laughter during much of the two-and-a-half-hour show.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performance with enthusiastic language ('lovably hilarious', 'made the audience howl with laughter'), but only one excerpt available from a smaller outlet limits confidence in representing the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Collette's performance as hilarious and highlights his impact on the show, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting Collette's performance and the audience's reaction. The language used suggests a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic, unqualified praise for the lead performance and comedic elements, describing the show as 'lovably hilarious' with 'impeccable comedic timing.' Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the upper Positive range (80-84).",
