  "bwwExcerpt": "The musical adaptation of 'Beetlejuice,' on the other hand, wisely embraces the fact that it's a musical — which allows for the title character to smash through the 'fourth wall' with glee, skewering everything from the eight-shows-a-week grind of live professional theater to expressing what a good many people think about a show like...oh, say, 'Brigadoon.'",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear praise ('wisely embraces') and appreciation for the show's theatrical self-awareness and humor. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence must remain low as this may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's self-awareness and humor, suggesting a positive reception. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the reviewer found the musical adaptation to be a wise and enjoyable choice. Given the single excerpt and aggregator context, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with a lower score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the show's self-aware approach and fourth-wall breaking, describing the choice as 'wise' and executed 'with glee.' As a single curated excerpt, confidence is low, but the evaluative language suggests a positive recommendation.",
