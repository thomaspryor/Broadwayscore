  "bwwExcerpt": "Between the jokes, the heartwarming storyline and musical melodies, you can’t help but leave the show smiling. Not to mention, the ensemble is full of a fantastic crew of dancers (choreography by Connor Gallagher). Their skill and flawless technique is masterfully highlighted in “That Beautiful Sound” in Act II, as they perform gravity-defying leaps, impressive turns and acrobatic stunts that only a high-caliber performer could pull off.",

However, single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive assessment of the show, highlighting enjoyable elements like jokes, storyline, and musical melodies, and praises the ensemble's performance. The tone suggests a strong recommendation, placing it in the upper range of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses a very positive sentiment, highlighting the enjoyable storyline, music, and impressive choreography. The phrase \"you can't help but leave the show smiling\" indicates a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the show's emotional impact and choreography, using words like 'masterfully,' 'flawless,' and 'fantastic' alongside an explicit recommendation that audiences will leave smiling.",
