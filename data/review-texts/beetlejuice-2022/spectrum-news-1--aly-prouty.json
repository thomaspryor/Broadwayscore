  "bwwExcerpt": "Between the jokes, the heartwarming storyline and musical melodies, you can’t help but leave the show smiling. Not to mention, the ensemble is full of a fantastic crew of dancers (choreography by Connor Gallagher). Their skill and flawless technique is masterfully highlighted in “That Beautiful Sound” in Act II, as they perform gravity-defying leaps, impressive turns and acrobatic stunts that only a high-caliber performer could pull off.",
