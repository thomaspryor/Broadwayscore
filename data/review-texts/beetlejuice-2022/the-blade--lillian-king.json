    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt focuses on content warnings and audience walkouts rather than show quality. The critic's dismissive tone toward audience complaints suggests neither strong praise nor condemnation of the show itself. | GPT-4o: The excerpt does not provide a clear recommendation or discouragement. The mention of audience members leaving suggests some dissatisfaction, but the critic also implies that the content warning was clear. The tone is neutral, leading to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The excerpt provides a content advisory and a humorous anecdote, but lacks a clear recommendation or overall assessment of the show's quality. The tone is observational rather than evaluative, suggesting a mixed or neutral stance. | Kimi: While describing audience walkouts due to profanity, the critic defends the show's PG-13 content as appropriate for the ticket price, placing blame on unprepared attendees rather than the production. This suggests mild approval of the show's edgy tone.",
