  "bwwExcerpt": "A seemingly crowd-pleasing, high-energy, sensory-overloaded Beetlejuice was resurrected at the Ohio Theatre on Tuesday night to a devoted cult fan following. While slapstick jokes, disturbing references, and visual diversions dominate much of the show, there are also moments of heart-warming tenderness, much thanks to the incredible performance of Isabella Esler who plays Lydia.",

The overall tone suggests a mixed experience with both positive and negative aspects. | Gemini: The review acknowledges both positive and negative aspects of the show, with no clear recommendation. The praise for Isabella Esler is noted, but the overall impression is mixed.",
