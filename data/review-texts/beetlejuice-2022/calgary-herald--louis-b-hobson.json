  "bwwExcerpt": "Beetlejuice acts as the narrator of the story, which means Collette addresses the audience with a patter that is crude, lewd, and sporadically devilishly clever. The fact Collette makes it sound spontaneous is just one of his glowing talents. He also has a booming singing voice and nimble feet. He’s the quadruple threat actor this show desperately needs to keep it buoyant. E",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for Collette's performance with multiple superlatives ('glowing talents', 'booming singing voice', 'quadruple threat'). However, single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked praise from a mixed review, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Collette's performance as a 'quadruple threat' essential to the show, indicating a positive view. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so a score at the lower end of the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the strength of the lead actor and his importance to the show, indicating a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Collette's performance, describing his 'glowing talents,' 'booming singing voice,' and 'devilishly clever' patter as essential to keeping the show buoyant, indicating a clear recommendation despite limited context.",
