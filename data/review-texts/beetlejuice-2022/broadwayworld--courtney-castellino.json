  "bwwExcerpt": "I do hope that last night was a one-off, opening night glitch. This really is such a great show and the cast looked like they were having a phenomenal time, so it would be nice if the audience could too. A word of advice would be to listen to the Broadway cast recording before attending the show if you are not already familiar with the lyrics, just in case.",
