  "bwwExcerpt": "Justin Collette leads the cast as the crass, larger-than-life Beetlejuice, who delights in scandalizing the wholesome Maitlands. On opening night, Will Burton’s Adam played opposite understudy Katie Griffith's Barbara. Griffith and Burton share an endearing chemistry and showcase impressive singing chops, particularly during the number Barbara 2.0.",
