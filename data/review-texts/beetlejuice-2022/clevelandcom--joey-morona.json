  "bwwExcerpt": "It’s... a lot. This musical is like that friend who is always “on.” You know the one. So desperate to entertain, they’re a constant stream of consciousness full of ideas and jokes, hoping a few of them actually land. They go off into tangents, don’t always make sense and sometimes you wish they would just relax and take a beat. Still, when they’re good, they’re really good and you remember why you enjoy their company.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review criticizes the show as overwhelming and desperate ('always on', 'hoping a few land') but acknowledges it has good moments ('when they're good, they're really good'). The friend analogy suggests tolerable but taxing experience - classic mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as overwhelming and inconsistent, with moments that stand out positively. The mixed tone suggests neither a strong recommendation nor a clear discouragement. | Gemini: The review uses mixed metaphors to describe the show, highlighting both its overwhelming nature and its moments of brilliance, suggesting a mixed experience. | Kimi: While the critic finds the show exhausting and inconsistent ('desperate to entertain,' 'don't always make sense'), the final sentiment acknowledges genuine entertainment value. Given the single-excerpt warning and 'Flat' aggregator context, this registers as a mixed assessment rather than a clear recommendation.",
