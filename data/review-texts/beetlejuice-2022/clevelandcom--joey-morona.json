  "bwwExcerpt": "It’s... a lot. This musical is like that friend who is always “on.” You know the one. So desperate to entertain, they’re a constant stream of consciousness full of ideas and jokes, hoping a few of them actually land. They go off into tangents, don’t always make sense and sometimes you wish they would just relax and take a beat. Still, when they’re good, they’re really good and you remember why you enjoy their company.",
