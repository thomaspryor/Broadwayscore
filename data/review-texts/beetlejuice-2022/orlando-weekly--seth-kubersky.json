  "bwwExcerpt": "Don’t worry if you don’t remember (or have never seen) Tim Burton’s brilliant Beetlejuice, because book writers Scott Brown & Anthony King retain only the bare bones of Michael McDowell & Larry Wilson’s original screen story, drastically reshuffling plot points and character relationships. But Lydia (Isabella Esler) is still a lonely, afterlife-obsessed teen who befriends Adam (Will Burton) and Barbara (Britney Coleman), a klutzy couple of recently-deceased ghosts.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows positive language ('brilliant') about the source material and matter-of-fact description of the adaptation choices. However, with only a single truncated excerpt available, the full verdict is unclear, warranting low confidence and lower-range positive scoring. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive but modified adaptation of the original Beetlejuice.
