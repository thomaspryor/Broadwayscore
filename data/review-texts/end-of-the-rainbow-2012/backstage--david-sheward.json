    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, the language is unambiguously enthusiastic with the imperative 'Rush' and celebration of 'glory.' This is clear must-see recommendation language that belongs in the Rave category. | GPT-4o: The excerpt strongly recommends seeing the show, highlighting a spectacular star performance and urging the audience to 'rush' to the theater. The language suggests an enthusiastic endorsement. | Gemini: The review explicitly encourages the reader to see the show to see the star's performance. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strong recommendation language ('Rush', 'spectacular star', 'revel in glory'), warranting an upper Positive score. Confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
