  "bwwExcerpt": "It’s trash. Judy swills, Judy sings, Judy vomits, Judy goes on singing. Pulp rubbish by playwright Peter Quilter. [...] In her wilder throes as Garland flailing through a number, Bennett gets awfully Kabuki about it, but you can’t deny her power even if she’s driving a third-rate hearse of a play.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Pan | Claude: Calls the play 'trash' and 'pulp rubbish' with devastating language like 'third-rate hearse of a play.' Despite praising Bennett's power, this is a clear pan following the pattern where performer praise doesn't redeem overall rejection. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is strongly negative, describing the play as 'trash' and 'pulp rubbish.' While there is some acknowledgment of the performer's power, the overall tone is dismissive and critical of the play itself. | Gemini: The critic calls the play \"trash\" and \"pulp rubbish\", but acknowledges the performer's power. This indicates a negative review with some redeeming qualities. | Kimi: The reviewer uses devastating language ('trash', 'pulp rubbish', 'third-rate hearse of a play') to pan the production, though they acknowledge the lead actress's power, keeping it from the absolute bottom of the range.",
