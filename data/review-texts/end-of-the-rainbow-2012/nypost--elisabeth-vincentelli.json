  "bwwExcerpt": "Rather than turn in another technically fine, ultimately safe Garland impersonation, Bennett gives us the Garland mystique. Without resorting to mimicry, Tracie Bennett captures Judy Garland’s legendary mix of talent and volatility. This is all the more key since Peter Quilter’s West End import isn’t very good. It’s a decent vehicle for a drunk driver.",
