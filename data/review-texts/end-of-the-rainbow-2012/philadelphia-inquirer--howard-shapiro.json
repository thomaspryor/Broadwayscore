    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes Bennett's performance as 'sensational' but calls the show itself 'erratic.' This suggests strong praise for the lead performance but significant reservations about the production overall. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Tracie Bennett's performance as 'sensational' but describes the show as 'erratic', indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the word \"sensational\" to describe the actress's performance, indicating a strong positive sentiment. While the show is described as \"erratic,\" the focus is on the positive performance, suggesting a recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt strongly praises Tracie Bennett's performance as 'sensational' while describing the show itself as 'erratic,' suggesting a qualified recommendation based primarily on the star's performance. Given this is a single curated excerpt, confidence is low.",
