    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising lead performance as 'powerhouse' suggests positive recommendation, but limited text prevents assessment of overall production verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Schreiber's performance, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment of the review is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses solely on Liev Schreiber's performance, describing it as a 'powerhouse' and highlighting both vulnerability and menace. Given the limited text, it's difficult to gauge the overall recommendation, but the strong praise suggests a positive leaning. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers strong praise for the lead actor ('powerhouse performance'), placing it in the upper Positive range per the single-excerpt guidance, though the limited scope prevents a higher confidence rating.",
