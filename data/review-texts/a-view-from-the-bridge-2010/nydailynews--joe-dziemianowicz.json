  "bwwExcerpt": "In a bright stroke, the director dreams up a wordless prologue. Eddie and coworker Alfieri (Michael Gould) wash up after a day on the docks. But the point of the drama is that nobody comes out clean. 'Whatever happened,' says Bea, 'we all done it.' Van Hove sees to it that everyone's dripping in guilt.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises director's creative choice ('bright stroke') and notes thematic coherence, but limited text and lack of overall verdict requires cautious scoring in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a creative directorial choice but suggests a thematic focus on guilt and unresolved issues. The lack of explicit positive or negative language and the single excerpt warning suggest a mixed review. | Gemini: The excerpt highlights a positive directorial choice and summarizes the play's theme, suggesting a worthwhile experience despite the heavy subject matter. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the director's creative choices, describing the wordless prologue as a 'bright stroke' and commending how Van Hove effectively executes the play's themes of guilt. As a single curated excerpt with clearly positive language, it falls in the upper range of the Positive bucket.",
