  "fullText": "This article is more than 14 years oldReviewA View from the Bridge – reviewThis article is more than 14 years oldRoyal Exchange, ManchesterFew things signify New York quite so succinctly as a cast-iron fire hydrant. And nothing suggests a rough, unkempt outer borough of New York more than a hydrant standing in a pool of filthy, rust-coloured water.\n\nJames Cotterill's basin-like set drains towards a central sluice; Eddie Carbone, the longshoreman who snitches his own family to the immigration authorities, is condemned as \"a rat who belongs in the sewer\". In Sarah Franckom's production, the sewers have already risen up and flooded the stage. Frankcom is alert to the fact that Arthur Miller's waterfront tragedy works best if there's a concrete sense of the waterfront to begin with. The action commences with a vignette in which Eddie takes his place among exhausted, hungry men unloading a crate that comes swinging down, delivering a shipment of implacable fate before the action has even begun.\n\nThe chorus-like figure of the lawyer Alfieri (Ian Redford) observes that men of Eddie's station were \"never supposed to have had a destiny\"; Con O'Neill's shattered stevedore stoops and groans as if under the weight of every sack he has ever unloaded. Too often the play is reduced to the grindingly obvious moral of a man who cannot let go; O'Neill suggests that what he really wants is for the girl he has raised to fly high and free of this foul neighbourhood.\n\nThere's impressive work from Anna Francolini's worldly Beatrice, while Ronan Raftery's charmingly effete Rodolpho proves an irresistible catch for the faun-like innocence of Leila Mimmack's Catherine. But it's the rough sense of community that gives Franckom's reading its power.\n\nAt any point, you can opt out of the sale of all of your personal information by pressing",

However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Liev Schreiber's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the production. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation strength. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance using the word 'compelling,' indicating a clearly positive assessment. Per guidelines for single excerpts with clearly positive language, this scores in the 80-84 range, though confidence is low due to limited context.",
