    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising lead performance as 'compelling' suggests positive view, but insufficient context for full verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Schreiber's performance as compelling, indicating a positive view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Liev Schreiber's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the production. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation strength. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance using the word 'compelling,' indicating a clearly positive assessment. Per guidelines for single excerpts with clearly positive language, this scores in the 80-84 range, though confidence is low due to limited context.",
