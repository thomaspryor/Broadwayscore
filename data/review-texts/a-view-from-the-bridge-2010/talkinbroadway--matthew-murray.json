The tone is enthusiastic and unqualified. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the production 'succeeds' and speaks to contemporary audiences. This indicates a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states the production 'succeeds' and praises its contemporary vitality and 'startling relevance,' indicating a clear recommendation despite the excerpt's brevity.",
