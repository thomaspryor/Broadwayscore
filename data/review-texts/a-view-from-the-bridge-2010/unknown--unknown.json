At the end of its uninterrupted two hours, you are wrung out, scooped out and so exhausted that you’re wide awake...Mr. Strong’s is the most powerful single performance you’re likely to see this year.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Calls van Hove's direction 'magnificent' and describes an intense, transformative theatrical experience. Declares the lead performance the 'most powerful...you're likely to see this year' - superlative language indicating a rave. Single excerpt warning noted, but the language is unambiguously enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong superlatives like 'magnificent' and 'most powerful single performance,' indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"magnificent\" and \"most powerful single performance\". Given the limited text, I am scoring it as positive with high end score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise with superlatives ('magnificent', 'most powerful'), indicating a rave review, though confidence is limited due to availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
