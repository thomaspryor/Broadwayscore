    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: 3.5/4 stars indicates solid positive recommendation. The excerpt praises the casting as 'most inspired' but limited to single curated quote reduces confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a 3.5 out of 4 star rating, indicating strong praise. The mention of 'most inspired piece of movie-star casting' suggests a high level of enthusiasm. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt gives the show 3.5 out of 4 stars, indicating a positive review. The phrase \"most inspired piece of movie-star casting\" further supports this. | Kimi: The 3.5/4-star rating and praise for the 'most inspired' casting indicate a strong recommendation, though the single excerpt limits confidence.",
