    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance ('towering') suggests positive review, but single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Schreiber's performance, indicating a positive view of his role. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment of the review is unclear, leading to a cautious, lower-end positive score. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a strong performance by the lead actor, suggesting a positive experience despite the limited information. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The sole available excerpt offers strong praise for Schreiber's 'towering' performance, indicating a positive assessment, though the limited text prevents a complete evaluation of the overall production.",
