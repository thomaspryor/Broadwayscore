    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for both lead performances with 'fine' and 'titanic' as positive descriptors. Single excerpt warning noted - positive language suggests solid recommendation, scoring in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of the lead actors, indicating a positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low and the score is set at the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights positive performances from the leads, suggesting a worthwhile production despite the lack of further details. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for both lead performances, particularly Schreiber's 'titanic' turn, indicating a positive recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is low but the tone is distinctly favorable.",
