    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Extreme superlatives ('revolutionary', 'staggering', 'required destination') and calling it essential viewing for serious drama lovers. Single excerpt warning noted, but language is unambiguously ecstatic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong, unqualified praise ('simply staggering', 'required destination') and places the director among 'the most revolutionary theater makers', indicating a rave review. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"staggering\" and \"required destination,\" indicating a rave review. The critic clearly admires the production. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise calling the production 'staggering' and a 'required destination,' indicating strong enthusiasm. However, per the single-excerpt warning, confidence is low as this curated quote may not represent the full review's balance.",
