    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong praise for lead performance ('burning intensity') and production ('muscular revival', 'sure hands'). Given single excerpt warning and clearly positive language, scoring upper end of Positive bucket, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Schreiber's performance and the direction, suggesting a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper range of Positive. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Liev Schreiber's performance and the direction, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low, and the score is placed in the lower-middle range of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance ('burning intensity') and direction ('sure hands'), describing the revival as 'muscular.' With only one curated excerpt available per the warning, confidence is low, but the tone is clearly and unambiguously positive.",
