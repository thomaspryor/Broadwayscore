  "bwwExcerpt": "The actors walk around barefoot for no apparent reason, accompanied by snippets of the Fauré Requiem that are played on an endless loop, with a drum tapping at maddeningly metronomic intervals to signify...what? Only, it seems, that Mr. Van Hove is so determined to put his personal stamp on 'A View From the Bridge' that he doesn't seem to care whether any of his over-familiar avant-garde tricks are organically related to the script. Instead, they're poured over it like a rancid sauce. What I find most puzzling about Mr. Van Hove's method is that when you scrape away the sauce of self-regard, what you find underneath...is a staging that gets to the point of Miller's play with near-naturalistic directness. Not only does he move actors around fluidly, but he also knows how to pick them: Mark Strong is simple and forceful as Eddie Carbone...Unfortunately, [Van Hove] neither trusts them nor the play, which is pretentious in its own way...but can be shatteringly effective when done well.",

The straightforward praise suggests solid recommendation despite brevity. | GPT-4o: The review provides a positive assessment of the production and cast, describing it as 'straightforward and effective.' However, the lack of superlatives or detailed praise suggests a solid but not enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review states that the production is \"straightforward and effective\" and that the cast \"serves Arthur Miller's drama well,\" indicating a positive, though not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers unqualified praise for the production and cast, calling them 'effective' and saying they serve the drama 'well,' though the language is restrained rather than enthusiastic. The brevity of the excerpt warrants low confidence.",
