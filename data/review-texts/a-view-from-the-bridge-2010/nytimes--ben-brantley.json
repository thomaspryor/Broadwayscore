  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Mr. Schreiber is such a complete actor that he has often thrown productions into imbalance, highlighting the inadequacy of the performances around him. That is not a problem here. That the excellent stage veteran Ms. Hecht holds her own with Mr. Schreiber is no surprise. That Ms. Johansson does - with seeming effortlessness - is.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for all three lead performances with emphasis on how well they work together. Single excerpt warning noted - this reads as solid positive assessment of the acting ensemble. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of the cast, particularly highlighting the strong acting of Schreiber, Hecht, and Johansson. The tone suggests a positive view of the production's acting quality. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the performances of the actors, particularly Scarlett Johansson, suggesting a positive experience, but the lack of full context makes it difficult to assess the overall recommendation strength. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for all three lead performances, highlighting Schreiber's complete command and the ability of both Hecht and Johansson to match him. Per the single-excerpt guidelines for clearly positive quotes, this scores in the upper Positive range despite limited context on overall production quality.",
