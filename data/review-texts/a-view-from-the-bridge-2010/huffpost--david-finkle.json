  "bwwExcerpt": "Van Hove knows what he's doing, all right. Where I've often thought the playwrights he's toyed with would greatly disapprove of the toying, I suspect that were Miller to have seen this treatment, he would've applauded. As the actors aren't being asked to underline subtexts along with the text, they're free to play Miller's script to the utmost.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic praises Van Hove's direction as knowing and effective, suggests Miller would approve, and commends the actors' freedom to play the script 'to the utmost.' However, with only one excerpt available, this could be cherry-picked praise from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the director's approach and implies that the production is faithful to the playwright's intent, suggesting a strong positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the director's choices and the actors' performances, suggesting a positive overall assessment. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Van Hove's direction, suggesting the playwright would approve of this interpretation and commending the approach to the script. However, as a single curated quote, it may not represent the full review's sentiment.",
