    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises both lead performances with strong language ('fine stage debut', 'titanic performance') and calls it a 'revival of Miller's classic tragedy' without criticism. Single excerpt warning means this could be cherry-picked positive language, but the tone suggests solid recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of the lead actors, suggesting a positive reception of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances of the two leads, suggesting a positive experience overall, but without more context, it's difficult to gauge the strength of the recommendation. | Kimi: The Bottom Line verdict offers clear praise for both leads, with 'titanic' indicating particularly strong commendation for Schreiber. However, as a single curated excerpt, the overall assessment confidence is reduced.",
