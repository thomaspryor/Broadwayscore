  "fullText": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/theater/review-in-hughie-with-forest-whitaker-two-desolate-lost-souls.htmlGive this articleAdvertisement\n\nThe dim and cavernous hotel lobby is, as one of its two inhabitants puts it, “about as homey as the morgue.” But for Erie Smith, the fidgety man who comes up with that desolate description, this morgue is the only place to be.\n\nOutside there’s the brusque and bustling city, New York in 1928, where unfriendly creditors wait in ambush for him; upstairs, in Room 492, there’s the silence of the bed, where unwelcome thoughts can echo until they deafen. But here, amid the shadows of a deserted antechamber, a guy like Erie can pretend — at least fleetingly — that his life counts for something.\n\nIn Michael Grandage’s gentle, churning dream of a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s “Hughie,” which sighed open on Thursday night at the Booth Theater, Erie is portrayed by that excellent actor Forest Whitaker, in a transfixing yet modest Broadway debut. Mr. Whitaker provides all the anchoring physical detail that you might expect from his meticulously observed screen performances (“Bird,” “The Butler”).\n\nClad in an off-the-rack sporty suit that aspires to jauntiness but might well double as his pajamas, this Erie is a creation of solid, sometimes sweaty flesh, replete with subtle tics and quirks. Yet as you watch Mr. Whitaker pacing, twirling, brooding and taking endless inventory of his pockets before an impassive audience of one (a somnolent night clerk, embodied by a perfectly cast Frank Wood), you wouldn’t be surprised if he just evaporated before your eyes.\n\nLingo of the 1920s is back on Broadway. Test your knowledge, with help from Forest Whitaker.\n\nThis is not to suggest that Mr. Whitaker is low on stage presence. But instead of cranking up the heat and the volume in the way you associate with barnstorming star turns, he gives the impression of someone who always feels the tug of invisibility, of nothingness. As Erie natters on in an eager, fitful string of clichés, bringing to mind the sort of garrulous salesman you’d normally cross the street to avoid, Mr. Whitaker quietly breaks your heart.\n\n“Hughie” is, by many measures, a slender offering from a playwright best known for density and heft. O’Neill is the man who gave us such lumbering colossi of the theater as the “Mourning Becomes Electra” trilogy, “The Iceman Cometh” and the ultimate American drama of domestic pathology, “Long Day’s Journey Into Night,” which is being revived on Broadway this spring.\n\nIn contrast, “Hughie” feels as vaporous as smoke, though the kind that might come from an opium pipe (to use a favorite O’Neillian image). Written in the early 1940s as a relief for O’Neill after the heavy lifting of “Journey” and “Iceman,” “Hughie” lasts only an hour in performance, and it has the poetic single-mindedness of a short story.\n\nO’Neill had envisioned it as part of a series of plays to be grouped under the title “By Way of Obit.” But “Hughie” is the only one that survives, and he had doubts about its suitability for the stage.\n\n“It would require tremendous imagination,” he said. “Let whoever does it figure it out. I wouldn’t want to be around to see it.”\n\nHe wasn’t. O’Neill died in 1953; “Hughie” was first produced — in Stockholm — in 1958.\n\nBut if the script is lean — and bare of events that usually qualify as dramatic — its meaty central part has attracted actors of towering stature, including Jason Robards Jr. (the first Broadway production in 1964), Ben Gazzara (1975) and Al Pacino (1996). You can imagine the intensity with which those fabled stars might have endowed Erie.\n\nMr. Whitaker, who won an Oscar for playing the maniacal tyrant Idi Amin in “The Last King of Scotland” (2006), is perfectly capable of dining with gusto on scenery. Instead, he here bravely dares to be as small as Erie fears he may be, and I hope his performance isn’t underappreciated because it lacks showy bravado.\n\nFor though this Erie still remembers the oleaginous, Damon Runyonesque patter of the small-time grifter he is, he can no longer deliver it with his customary all-American cheer and assurance. Part of this is a matter of his having just come off a bender when he enters the hotel in the wee hours after last call.\n\nBut what’s really dislodged him from his usual groove is the bleak fact that the play’s title character is dead. Hughie was the hotel’s night watchman for years, and he was a witness to Erie’s days of glory as a gambler and a lady’s man — or at least to Erie’s overblown tales of those days.\n\nWhen Mr. Whitaker first encounters the new night clerk, he starts as if he has truly seen a ghost — the ghost of Hughie. Erie is wrong about that, but he’s also right. Mr. Wood’s cadaverous, perpetually abstracted character rarely seems to register what Erie’s saying.\n\nYet by the end, a couple of dropped words have made this custodian of the night prick up his ear. The new clerk morphs into the old one. And Erie is given license to lie with conviction once again. In O’Neill’s universe of frauds and losers, people exist to confirm one another in the stories they tell about themselves; such mutual support is both a cosmic kindness and a curse.\n\nThat’s all there is to “Hughie,” and you could glean its shape and substance in a 20-minute reading of the script. But you wouldn’t feel the full mortal ache and ghostly chill that this production summons.\n\nMr. Grandage, the ace British director of “Red” and “The Cripple of Inishmaan” on Broadway, and the designers Christopher Oram (set and costumes), Neil Austin (lighting) and Adam Cork (sound and music) have transformed the play’s seedy hotel into what feels like a halfway house between the living and the dead. There are some rhythmic glitches in the staging, and Mr. Cork’s solemn, cinematic music can occasionally be intrusive.\n\nBut while you may feel this show is only a trifle at first — an hors d’oeuvre of a play next to the multicourse meals of “Journey” and “Iceman” — it keeps growing larger in your mind, the way a quietly told ghost story might. And you’ll be unlikely to forget the image of Mr. Whitaker poised with anxiety and resignation on the staircase to his room, terrified of saying good night to the imaginary life he has created below.",

The 'vaporous as smoke' comment suggests some reservation about the material, but the final verdict emphasizes what makes this production special and worth experiencing. | GPT-4o: The review praises Forest Whitaker's performance but describes the production as 'vaporous,' suggesting it lacks substance. The excerpt's tone is mixed, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses. | Gemini: The review praises Forest Whitaker's performance and the production's ability to evoke emotion, but also notes that the play's substance could be gleaned from a short reading. This suggests a positive but somewhat qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Forest Whitaker's performance ('breaks your heart,' 'transfixing') and the production's atmospheric impact ('mortal ache and ghostly chill'), but notes the source material is slight ('vaporous,' '20-minute reading'). With only one curated excerpt available, this appears to be a qualified recommendation that values the execution over the substance.",
