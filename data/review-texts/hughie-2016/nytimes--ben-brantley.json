  "bwwExcerpt": "In Michael Grandage's gentle, churning dream of a revival of Eugene O'Neill's 'Hughie'...Erie is portrayed by that excellent actor Forest Whitaker, in a transfixing yet modest Broadway debut. Mr. Whitaker provides all the anchoring physical detail that you might expect from his meticulously observed screen performances...Yet as you watch Mr. Whitaker pacing, twirling, brooding and taking endless inventory of his pockets...you wouldn't be surprised if he just evaporated before your eyes. This is not to suggest that Mr. Whitaker is low on stage presence. But instead of cranking up the heat and the volume in the way you associate with barnstorming star turns, he gives the impression of someone who always feels the tug of invisibility, of nothingness. As Erie natters on in an eager, fitful string of clichés...Mr. Whitaker quietly breaks your heart.",
