  "bwwExcerpt": "Forest Whitaker is blessed with an air of warmth and decency that shines through in film roles like the one he played in 'The Butler.' Michael Grandage...has directed him with considerable sensitivity as Erie, the forlorn gambler in Eugene O'Neill's 'Hughie.' Erie feels abandoned after the death of the hotel clerk who was his only friend and lucky mascot. But Whitaker's warmth can also be a hindrance, as it is when the star, making his Broadway debut here, must also convince us that in better days he was a confident and happy-go-lucky sporting man...What Erie wants is his luck back, a need made palpable in Whitaker's heartfelt performance.",
