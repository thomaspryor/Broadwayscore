  "bwwExcerpt": "The likable actor, an Oscar winner for 'The Last King of Scotland,' is brave to spread his wings to Broadway, but his performance, at least for now, is disappointingly one-note...Whitaker, north of 6-feet-tall, manages to slouch and slink into the role. He plays Erie as consistently content, but such joviality doesn't seem to fit the circumstances...There must be a deep unhappiness and loneliness within him; we just aren't seeing it. Whitaker delivers his dialogue in an oddly staccato style. Maybe he's still trying to find his footing with O'Neill's rhythms. Wood's challenge, as the new clerk, is to react professionally, even though he'd rather not engage in mindless chatter...Wood does a remarkable job radiating detachment.",
