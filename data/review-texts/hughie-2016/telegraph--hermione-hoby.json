  "bwwExcerpt": "Whitaker must make sure that, unlike Eerie's audience of the lone night clerk (played by Frank Wood, perfecting an eyes-open narcolepsy), we are not bored to stupefaction. Instead, he must be sufficiently magnetic and compelling in his patter that we, the real audience, never want him to shut up...Also, the grandstanding here has to be the opposite kind of Amin's: that of a man who, deep down, knows he holds next to no power. Accordingly, Whitaker imbues Eerie's showboating with impressive understatement...it's curious that Grandage would have chosen to intersperse the play with several heavy-handed interludes in which the lights intensify, the spooky music swells and the clerk's stare becomes even more eerily vacant. Perhaps these moments are simply there for Whitaker to catch his breath.",
