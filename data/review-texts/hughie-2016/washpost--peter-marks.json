  "bwwExcerpt": "In Whitaker's eager-to-please though slightly pushy manner, Erie comes across as one of those fellows whose need to disclose overwhelms your ability to retreat. The intermittent nervous giggle betrays a soul of deeper insecurities than he otherwise cares to expose. And yet Erie can't help but reveal the truth of his situation, the losses and rejections he's racked up. All of this registers in the countenance of a terrific American actor, who's found a comfortable home on the stage of the Booth, when the man he plays never truly can.",
