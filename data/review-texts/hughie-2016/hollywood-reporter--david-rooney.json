  "bwwExcerpt": "Eugene O'Neill's 1942 play, Hughie, is a moody character study about the comforts of self-deception as a buffer against bleak reality...In Hughie, the central character's purgatorial imprisonment in empty boasts and fragile illusions is ongoing, generating more muted drama...Whitaker conveys the tireless braggadocio but also the pathos and creeping desperation in this unquiet character, a classic O'Neill type who plasters over the void in his life with exaggerations and lies. With his sleepy eyes, soulful voice and fluttering hands, Whitaker is a superb actor who can wear sorrow like a baggy overcoat. However, as watchable as he is, the real star of Michael Grandage's production is the design team.",
