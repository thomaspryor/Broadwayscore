    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Clear praise for the lead performance with language indicating transformation and profundity. The original 87 rating confirms strong positive territory, though the brief excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review praises Forest Whitaker's performance as transformative, elevating the play to a profound experience. The original rating of 87 supports a Rave classification. | Gemini: The review praises Forest Whitaker's performance and its impact on the play, suggesting a positive experience overall. However, it doesn't explicitly recommend seeing the show, so it's a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: The critic praises Whitaker's performance for elevating the material to something profound, and the original rating of 87 confirms this falls in the enthusiastic recommendation range despite the excerpt's brevity. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
