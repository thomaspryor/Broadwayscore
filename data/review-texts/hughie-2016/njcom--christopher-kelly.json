  "bwwExcerpt": "Now comes Forest Whitaker, who in the new revival of Eugene O'Neill's 'Hughie' swallows his words and looks deeply uncomfortable onstage. This is especially problematic given that this one-act play is essentially a monologue delivered by Whitaker's character...for any of this to work, 'Hughie' requires a lead actor who can bring to Erie's mythmaking and self-aggrandizement to life; someone who can show us a man who is both pitiful yet also poignantly noble. That actor is not Whitaker, whose awkwardly staccato delivery and occasional long pauses make you wonder if he's successfully memorized his lines.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Forest Whitaker swallows his words and looks deeply uncomfortable onstage…Whitaker doesn't even begin to illuminate Erie or make it clear to the audience why we should care about him…‘Hughie’ does feature a very beautiful set and lighting design…The designers gorgeously evokes a place gone to seed. But that's about all this undercooked, altogether listless production has going for it.”\n\nRead more"
