  "fullText": "Let’s call it “Nightclerks.” It’s the best painting that Edward Hopper never painted, and you can see it at Broadway’s Booth Theatre in the new revival of “Hughie,” which opened Thursday.\n\nNo one captured urban isolation on canvas better than Hopper, and if he’d ever decided to paint the inside of a once elegant, now slightly crumbling lobby of a hotel in Times Square, placing a faceless clerk alone behind the counter, this “Hughie” as designed by Christopher Oram and directed by Michael",

This suggests a mixed review with potential positive elements, but the lack of a clear conclusion necessitates a cautious approach. | Gemini: The review is positive in its description of the set design and direction, comparing it to a Hopper painting. However, the truncated text and lack of a clear overall verdict lower the confidence. | Kimi: The available text offers strong praise for the production design using the Hopper comparison and invites readers to see the show, but the review is truncated mid-sentence before delivering a final verdict on the overall production.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "In between Erie's many monologues, Grandage interjects speechless longueurs in which the actor either sits or stands around with nothing to do as shades of green sweep over him like waves of smog...On stage, Whitaker's voice is much higher pitched than in the movies...Whitaker uses that contrast in sound and appearance to superb effect, giving a whimsical edge to the character...Whitaker delivers a most endearing Erie, right down to the nervous giggle he adds to punctuate the character's otherwise bottomless despair. It's a sign he's still living. That kind of vital sign is completely missing in Wood's equally disturbing night clerk.",
