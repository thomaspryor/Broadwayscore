  "bwwExcerpt": "Forest Whitaker may have an Oscar under his belt (for 'The Last King of Scotland') but his Broadway debut is largely inconsequential -- he brings no heft or insight to Erie Smith, the small-time gambler in Eugene O'Neill's two-hander, 'Hughie'...Whitaker's soft-toned take is laudable -- without making much of an impression. You're more likely to remember the gorgeous set: the darkened lobby of a ghostly hotel, dominated by a steep, foreboding staircase. Michael Grandage's direction emphasizes a spooky atmosphere that makes you wonder if the characters -- Frank Wood plays the other, mostly silent, one -- are dead and in some kind of purgatory.",
