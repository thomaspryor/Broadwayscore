  "showScoreExcerpt": "“This is a two person show that lasts 60 minutes…Forest Whitaker enters the elegantly designed set and he rambles for 60 minutes. Then the show ends. This is all. I didn't have a clue why we were watching him, why he was there, and frankly was bored and disgusted at his pointless babbling. Dumb, Expensive, Meaningless.
