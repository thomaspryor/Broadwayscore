  "fullText": "The bad ones are easy to write. The worse they are the easier it is. This one is simple. Do not pay Broadway prices (the box office lists the ticket prices for REGULAR seats - $25 to $149!). Folks this is a two person show that lasts 60 minutes! You pay the same price for a 2.5 Hour musical with 25 cast members, an orchestra, and multiple sets! This is a RIP OFF of grand proportions. Forest Whitaker enters the elegantly designed set (clearly some money was spent on this) and he rambles for 60 minutes. Then the show ends. This is all. I didn't have a clue why we were watching him, why he was there, and frankly was bored and disgusted at his pointless babbling. He's supposed to be a drunk and he recounts the ups and downs of the dead guy who used to helm the front desk of the hotel, (the play's namesake), Hughie. The new hotel clerk is \"played\" (i use quotes because the 14 words he uttered were such a waste) by Frank Wood. Dumb, Expensive, Meaningless. This was my waste of a Wednesday night at the Theatre.",
