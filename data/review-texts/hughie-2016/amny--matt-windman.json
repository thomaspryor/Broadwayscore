  "bwwExcerpt": "There's a reason why Eugene O'Neill's 1942 two-hander 'Hughie' is usually presented on a double bill with another play: it is only an hour long and is essentially a rambling monologue, with a few lines here and there for a secondary character...Christopher Oram's towering set design of a decaying hotel lobby is visually impressive but inappropriate for such a small piece. Whitaker gives a hyperactive yet sensitive performance that reveals the unease and desperation behind Erie's jovial exterior, while Wood does a fine job serving as the blank-faced listener.",
