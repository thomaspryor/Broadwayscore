  "bwwExcerpt": "Never mind that Forest Whitaker's distinctly textured baritone has added authority and nuance to a range of complex and sometimes outsize characters...Erie Smith, Whitaker's role in a new revival of Eugene O'Neill's Hughie (* * * out of four stars)...is, in contrast, a diminished figure...Erie's voice sounds higher and more nasal than Whitaker's does normally, and he wields it with a New York accent...and a strained sense of self-assurance...British director Michael Grandage...emphasizes the play's bleak intimacy here...Whitaker makes his character worthy of compassion. Erie can, without question, come across as a lout...But Whitaker brings an awkward sweetness that makes his desperation not only pitiable but accessible.",
