  "bwwExcerpt": "There's really no middle ground when it comes to the late English playwright Harold Pinter. You're either mesmerized by his mysterious, menacing, pause-filled psychological dramas or you find them puzzling, inert and empty -- as I usually do. That being said, the Roundabout's new revival of his 1971 three-actor, 65-minute drama 'Old Times' (which has an all-English cast and is directed by Tony-winning English actor Douglas Hodge) more than captures the playwright's distinctive style, packed with steel and sexiness. It is far better than the 2013 Broadway revival of Pinter's 'Betrayal,' which starred Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz.",
