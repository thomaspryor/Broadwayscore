  "bwwExcerpt": "s it possible to be dazzled by the cast, especially by Clive Owen in his Broadway debut, stunned anew by the elusive meanings of Pinter's 'Old Times' and yet appalled by the production?...Let's say that director Douglas Hodge's tricked-up staging of this 65-minute 1971 gem is bizarre, at best, and betrays a lack of trust in the lean, unnerving brilliance we know as Pinteresque. Hodge...chose to superimpose an over-animated, high-concept spectacle on a playwright whose menace radiates from silence and things unsaid...The drama, such as it is, is built on innuendo and insinuation, not overacting and special effects. Owen is deliciously slick, but not too slick, and, every so often, intentionally, fantastically obnoxious as Deeley...Eve Best...has an imposing elegance as the guest who married well, and Kelly Reilly, as the wife, has the quiet feline languor of one who feels the desire simmer off the others in the room...Printed scripts are not holy writs but, at least in this case, Pinter knew best.",
