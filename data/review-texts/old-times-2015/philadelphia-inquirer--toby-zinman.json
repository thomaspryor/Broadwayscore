  "bwwExcerpt": "To borrow a great line from Harold Pinter's Homecoming: 'You never heard such silence,' and in this brilliant Broadway production of Pinter's Old Times, directed by Douglas Hodge, the silences are simply deafening. The mysteries of memory, like the mysteries of marriage are the subjects of this elusive, tantalizing play but the great Sub-Texter himself, and this sleek and stylish British cast deepens the mysteries without ever solving them...The characters are isolated in space, silenced in mid-sentence, while jokey moments of coffee-sipping in unison and legs flung over chair arms break the tension momentarily. Similarly, the eerie electronic music by Thom Yorke and a sound design by Clive Goodwin bolster the atmosphere of dis-ease. Owen is sexy and swaggering and bewildered; Reilly, with her superb profile, is sexy and stern and unyielding; Best is sexy and opulent and, to use a word you don't hear much anymore, beguiling. All told is this a great and unnerving production.",
