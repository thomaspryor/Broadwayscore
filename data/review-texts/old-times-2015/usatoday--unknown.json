  "bwwExcerpt": "It's our individual, subjective truths that Pinter is most interested in -- as a dramatist in general, and particularly in this memory play. In the new Roundabout Theatre Company production...director Douglas Hodge and a cast that includes Broadway newbie Clive Owen bring a darkly hypnotic pull to the challenging material. Having helmed and acted in Pinter's work extensively across the pond, Hodge understands the musicality of the language. The rhythms in Pinter's dialogue, punctuated by pauses, can be played at different tempos. There is a languid quality to this staging that, while seductive, doesn't always encourage the alert attention the text demands. Hodge does cull consistent, robust performances from his cast. As Kate, who speaks the least but gets the most attention, Kelly Reilly brings a perfect mix of elusiveness and quiet knowing. With her bell-like speaking voice and understated prettiness, Reilly is a compelling foil for the haughty glamour that Eve Best, excellent as always, brings to the more worldly Anna. Owen...captures the insecurity that can make Deeley seem both awkward and callous.",
