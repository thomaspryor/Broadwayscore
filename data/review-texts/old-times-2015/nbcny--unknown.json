  "bwwExcerpt": "Bright flashes of light and discomforting noises make for a jarring start to Harold Pinter's 1971 'Old Times'...The sensory-assault -- truly, some may find the play's first half-minute or so hard on the eyes and ears -- announces we're back in Pinter territory: abstract, and make-of-it whatever we will...All the performers manage the tricky dialogue with finesse, making this the sort of revival you'd want to see a second time just to catch all the nuances. Owen, in his Broadway debut, is louche and bemused, at first pushing brandy on his wife's guest with cocky and jerky movements that seem particular to, well, Old Times ... or, at the very least, 'Mad Men.'
