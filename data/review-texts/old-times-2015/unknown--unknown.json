The final wish for a different approach suggests the current production misses the mark. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some enjoyment and pleasures in the production but also notes potential irritation for purists and a mismatch in style. The excerpt suggests a mixed reception with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges pleasures but also criticizes the production's flashiness and suggests the cast needs to be more comfortable in their roles. The overall tone is mixed, leaning slightly positive. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows qualified praise: critic acknowledges 'pleasures' and praises cast enjoyment, but clearly dislikes the flashy, posed production style and deviation from Pinter's tone. Reads as mildly positive with significant caveats.",
