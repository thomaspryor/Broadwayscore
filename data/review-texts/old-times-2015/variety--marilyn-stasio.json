  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Douglas Hodge...has made some curious production choices, but once the erotic games begin, you hardly notice that the writer's signature pauses and ominous silences have been trimmed. The most baffling aspect of the production isn't the play's elusive meaning or Pinter's ambiguous dialogue -- it's the setting...what to make of that solid block of ice in the shape of a door that dominates the room, which itself takes a twirl on a turntable for no earthly reason? Or the eyeball-searing strobe lights and that giant psychedelic whirligig and the loud metallic assault on our ears? It's a blessed relief when things settle down and Pinter's seductive parlor game for grownups can begin in earnest. In Reilly's controlled performance as the play's most controlling character, Kate doesn't seem to be looking forward to a visit from an old friend she hasn't seen in years...Owen has perfected the smoldering, could-be dangerous look of an imperfectly civilized hoodlum, so it's a nice jolt when he drops his cool facade and jumps at the idea that Kate's old friend might provide some insights into his inscrutable wife...There's nothing reserved about Anna, who exudes that air of confidence that comes from being married to a rich man.",
