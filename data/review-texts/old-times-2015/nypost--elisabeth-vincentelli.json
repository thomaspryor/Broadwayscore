  "bwwExcerpt": "he stars of 'Old Times' always look like they're a second away from having sex. Clive Owen, Eve Best and Kelly Reilly generate such heat, you may need a cold shower after the show...But then it's also rare that you'd need to cool off at a show by Harold Pinter, the British playwright famous for mind games and maddeningly vague plots...The game here is all about ultra-smoldering looks between Owen and Best -- and between Best and Reilly. An ominous score by Radiohead's Thom Yorke adds to the creepy-sexy vibe. This may be his Broadway debut, but Owen...radiates a confident masculinity. His Deeley is the kind of guy who can get away with manspreading, and he's perfectly matched with Best, a voluptuous panther, and Reilly, she of the frostier sensuality. Altogether, the three generate genuine sexual chemistry...You may not tell what it all means, if anything, yet the message comes through: Game on!",
