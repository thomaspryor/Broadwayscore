  "bwwExcerpt": "In a 1971 interview, Harold Pinter spoke about his recently completed Old Times, a love triangle that is less a problem of geometry than metaphysics. 'I'll tell you one thing,' he said. 'It happens. It all happens.' It is now happening on Broadway, in a faintly compelling revival, directed by Douglas Hodge and starring Clive Owen, Eve Best and Kelly Reilly. It is happening on an extravagant set, perhaps somewhat far from Pinter's call for 'a converted farmhouse.' (His request for two sofas and an armchair have been honoured more literally.)",
