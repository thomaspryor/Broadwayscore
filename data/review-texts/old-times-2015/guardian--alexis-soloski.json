  "bwwExcerpt": "In a 1971 interview, Harold Pinter spoke about his recently completed Old Times, a love triangle that is less a problem of geometry than metaphysics. 'I'll tell you one thing,' he said. 'It happens. It all happens.' It is now happening on Broadway, in a faintly compelling revival, directed by Douglas Hodge and starring Clive Owen, Eve Best and Kelly Reilly. It is happening on an extravagant set, perhaps somewhat far from Pinter's call for 'a converted farmhouse.' (His request for two sofas and an armchair have been honoured more literally.)",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Dwarfed by a vast set, this production of a Pinter play intrigues but never really disturbs it's audience...What should feel haunting, upsetting, frightening and menacing never quite does. This 'Old Times' feels smaller than its set would suggest. In the first scene Kate suggests, 'Anyway, none of this matters.' It should matter more.\"\n\nRead more"
