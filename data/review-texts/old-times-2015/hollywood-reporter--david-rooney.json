  "bwwExcerpt": "Clive Owen makes a riveting Broadway debut in Harold Pinter's Old Times, playing a man whose cocky suavity slowly unravels as he negotiates his hold on two elusive women, who may be different sides of the same person...But director Douglas Hodge doesn't make the mistake of imposing explanations where none were intended as he charts a transfixing course from gamesmanship to the consuming loss of a fantasy that was perhaps never attainable to begin with. Audience response will depend largely on the appetite for Pinter at his most opaque -- or some might even say attenuated. This is not a play with the biting menace of earlier landmark works like The Birthday Party...Its fascination is quieter and more cryptic, to the point where some will find it bloodless. Hodge, a seasoned Pinter interpreter as both actor and director, proclaims rather loudly from the outset that the drama is unfolding in a disorienting void adjacent to reality.",
