  "bwwExcerpt": "The musical's book, written by John Logan and Brian Yorkey, settles for simply pushing the story forward, from A to B to C. But the failure also falls on Sting, who created the inexpressive score, in his theater-writing debut. The songs permit the characters to reveal their feelings - 'I love you. I hate you' - but not who they are and why they have those feelings. And while there are some nice melodies, especially a gentle courting song, 'What Say You, Meg?' much of the score consists of thumping declarations and anthems. A lot of effort obviously went into 'The Last Ship,' with very little reward.",
