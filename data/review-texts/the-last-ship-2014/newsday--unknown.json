  "bwwExcerpt": "If sincerity and noble intentions were enough to make a good musical, 'The Last Ship' would be a smash. If haunting folk-tinged melodies and choruses of rousing determination could float this boat, Sting's heartfelt debut musical would justify the years he devoted to the $14 million epic about a depressed English shipbuilding town very much like the one where he grew up.",
