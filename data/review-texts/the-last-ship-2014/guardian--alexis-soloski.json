  "bwwExcerpt": "But if the structure is slack, the book indifferent, the love story lopsided, and the gender politics unreconstructed, Sting's folk-inflected songs, with their bright percussion and yearning strings, are a pleasure and they are performed here with vigour and swagger and joy. As the working men sing in the show's most rousing song, 'We've got nowt else.' Well, that's plenty. Underneath all the metaphors and self-consciousness and strange earnestness, there's a seaworthy show.",
