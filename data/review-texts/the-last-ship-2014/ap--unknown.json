  "bwwExcerpt": "Sting's stage composing is nicely complex, mixing sassy ballads with brooding duets and big, violin-led crowd pleasers. Outstanding are 'Dead Man's Boots' and 'The Night the Pugilist Learned How to Dance,' which here is wonderfully staged between a father and son behind bars, and the simply beautiful title track, which the creators clearly know is good: It's leaned on no less than four times.",
  "bwwScore": 9
