  "bwwExcerpt": "The biggest selling point of The Last Ship is also its greatest stumbling block: multiple Grammy winner and Tantra enthusiast Sting, who provides the music and lyrics to his first-ever Broadway show. Fans hoping for the same pop sensibility that turned 'I'll Be Watching You' and 'Desert Rose' into hits will be left wanting, as the bulk of Ship's songs lack the big melodic flourishes that stick around well after the curtain drops.",
