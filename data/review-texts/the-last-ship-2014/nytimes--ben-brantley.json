Neither recommends nor discourages attendance. | GPT-4o: The review suggests the show lacks the depth and completeness expected of a Broadway musical, despite acknowledging Sting's passion. This indicates a negative recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges Sting's passion but ultimately finds the show lacking in its realization as a fully formed musical, suggesting a mixed or lukewarm reception. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a fundamental criticism of the show's form while acknowledging the creator's genuine commitment, suggesting significant reservations without a clear recommendation to see or skip it.",
