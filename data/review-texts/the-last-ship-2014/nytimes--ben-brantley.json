    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Acknowledges genuine passion but fundamentally questions the show's success as a musical theater piece. This is a qualified criticism that neither recommends nor strongly discourages. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the show lacks the qualities of a fully realized musical, despite acknowledging Sting's passion. This indicates a negative assessment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges Sting's passion but ultimately finds the show lacking as a fully realized musical, suggesting a mixed or lukewarm reception. | Kimi: The critic fundamentally criticizes the show's theatrical construction, describing it as incomplete ('not a fully realized musical'), with the acknowledgment of Sting's passion framed as insufficient to redeem the production's structural failures. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
