    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The review acknowledges positive elements (handsome look, game cast) but identifies a fundamental flaw in the musical structure. The critic's 72 rating supports Mixed bucket classification. | GPT-4o: The review notes the show's aesthetic appeal and cast but criticizes the music for lacking cohesion. The original rating of 72 suggests a mixed to slightly positive view, but the critique of the score indicates a mixed verdict overall. | Gemini: The critic acknowledges the show's appealing visuals and cast, but expresses reservations about the cohesiveness of the music. Given the critic's rating of 72, this aligns with a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 72 places this firmly in the Positive bucket (70-84), indicating a mild recommendation that appreciates the production design and performances while criticizing the score's lack of narrative cohesion. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
