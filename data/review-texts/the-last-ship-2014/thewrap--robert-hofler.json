  "bwwExcerpt": "In 'The Last Ship,' director Joe Mantello gives us one scene in which workmen stomp around (intense choreography by Steven Hoggett) and brandish blowtorches (big sparklers, actually) that literally scorch the air around them. But nothing really happens. Eventually, something like a ship is vaguely indicated when the stage rises, everybody jumps aboard singing, there's light from heaven, and a tsunami of sound envelopes us. It's all as visually stunning and earsplitting as Mantello's staging of 'Defying Gravity' in 'Wicked.'",
