  "bwwExcerpt": "In a refreshing change of protocol, Sting has written a new score in a folk Celtic style, full of sweeping choral and orchestral arrangements and unabashed, open-hearted sentiment. The originality and sincerity of the enterprise are certainly worthy of applause. Joe Mantello's production manages to be thoroughly atmospheric without turning into a spectacle. (Spoiler alert: We only see a small portion of the ship.)",
  "bwwScore": 7
