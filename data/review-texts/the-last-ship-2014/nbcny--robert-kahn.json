  "bwwExcerpt": "It's a familiar story that in lesser hands would quickly wobble under its weight.\nAs it happens, a great cast, led by Esper and Rachel Tucker (a one-time West End Elphaba, in 'Wicked') as Meg, that one-time love, prevent that from transpiring. It's bracing to see Esper in a more adult, even paternal role, and it's one he pulls off with charisma. That Esper's Gideon must somehow make peace with his past, the abusive father and so on, is a foregone conclusion, but his methods of doing so struck me as exceedingly honest.",
