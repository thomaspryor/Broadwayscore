    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. Acknowledges good intentions and lovely songs but identifies fundamental theatrical problems. | GPT-4o: The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review. The critic acknowledges the musical's earnestness and the quality of Sting's songs but notes a lack of cohesion in the theatrical narrative. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (earnest, well-intentioned, lovely songs) but ultimately finds the musical lacking, aligning with a mixed assessment. The critic's rating of 60 supports this classification. | Kimi: The critic's explicit 60/100 rating confirms a Mixed assessment, praising Sting's songs as 'lovely' but criticizing their theatrical integration while acknowledging the show's good intentions.",
