Neither recommends nor discourages. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the beauty of the songs and the cast's performance but ultimately labels the show a failure due to its weak story. This indicates a mixed review with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the beauty of the music and the commitment of the cast, but ultimately labels the show a 'failure' due to the story's shortcomings, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic explicitly labels the show a 'failure' due to story problems, but offers genuine praise for Sting's songs and the cast's committed performances, creating a balanced mixed verdict that acknowledges quality elements while withholding a recommendation.",
