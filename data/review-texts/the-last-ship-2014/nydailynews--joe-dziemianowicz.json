  "bwwExcerpt": "Sting brings it. The pop god delivers his A-game in 'The Last Ship,' a new musical about coming home and letting go that overflows with heart. Not bad for a Broadway debut as a composer. Chalk it up to beginner's luck. Or to decades of experience writing songs that tell stories. Either way, the rich and lively score, which includes two songs from earlier solo work, courses with meaning and emotion.",
