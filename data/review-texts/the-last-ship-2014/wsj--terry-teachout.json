    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The phrase 'saves from total disaster' clearly indicates this is a negative review. While acknowledging Sting's charisma and heartfelt songs, the critic implies the show would otherwise be a disaster, placing this in negative territory but not a complete pan due to the saving grace mentioned. | GPT-4o: The review suggests the show is close to a 'total disaster' but acknowledges Sting's performance as a redeeming factor, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Gemini: The review states that Sting saves the show from \"total disaster,\" but acknowledges his limitations and the songs' lack of theatricality. This is a negative review with a slight positive aspect, placing it in the negative bucket. | Kimi: The critic describes the production as being on the brink of 'total disaster,' rescued only by Sting's charisma and heartfelt songs, which are themselves qualified with criticisms ('limitations as a stage actor,' 'not especially theatrical'). This faint praise indicates a negative verdict.",
