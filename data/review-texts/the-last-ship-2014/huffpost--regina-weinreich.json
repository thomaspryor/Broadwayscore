  "bwwExcerpt": "At its core, The Last Ship poses a religious quest for redemption: Father Jim (Fred Applegate) hears Gideon's confession of sins of the flesh, drink, and foul talk. But hey, this father has a few foibles of his own. His heart is so big, he inspires Gideon and the entire community, characters we come to know and love in the pub, and at the ship yard where industry is closing, turning from the actual building of ships, the mainstay of these hearty, lively folk, to jobs akin to pencil pushing. The company, led by Jimmy Nail as Jackie White and Sally Ann Triplett as his wife Peggy, won't have it, and they rally to erect just one more ship, the last one, which, as in the epics of old, will carry a body out to sea.",
