    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | No bucket consensus - using median score | Claude: Single sentence suggests confusion and lack of clear identity, but not definitively negative. Very limited text makes confidence low. | GPT-4o: The review is clearly negative, indicating the musical lacks direction and coherence, suggesting it fails to meet expectations. | Gemini: The review states that the musical doesn't know what it wants to be, implying a lack of direction and a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic delivers a fundamental criticism that the musical suffers from an identity crisis and lack of focus, offering no positive counterbalance or recommendation. The very brief text suggests the review may be truncated, warranting low confidence. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Negative",
