The acknowledgment of 'elaborate production values' doesn't redeem the overall negative verdict. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong negative language ('bloodless affair') and indicates a failure to engage audiences, suggesting a strongly negative verdict. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the show 'fails to sink its teeth into audiences' and is a 'bloodless affair,' indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic delivers a clear negative verdict, describing the show as 'bloodless' and ineffective at engaging audiences, though acknowledges its elaborate production values.",
