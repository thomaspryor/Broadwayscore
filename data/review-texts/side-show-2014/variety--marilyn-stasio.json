  "bwwExcerpt": "The new, improved 'Side Show' smells like a hit. Helmer Bill Condon's shrewd reworking of this short-lived 1997 cult musical by Henry Krieger and Bill Russell...is both darker in tone and lighter in theme than memory has it. Leading ladies Emily Padgett and Erin Davie are perfection as Daisy and Violet Hilton, conjoined twins in real life who were plucked out of a carnival midway by a rascal showman and transformed into vaudeville stars. A lot of things that didn't work in the original version still don't work now, but no question about it, this show has the best freaks on Broadway.",

The mention of honoring the memory of the original suggests some reservations but overall a solid endorsement. | Gemini: The review describes the production as \"handsome\" and \"expertly crafted,\" indicating a positive assessment. The phrase \"honors the memory\" suggests respect for the original, further supporting a positive, though perhaps not ecstatic, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers warm praise for the revival's craftsmanship, calling it 'handsome' and 'expertly crafted' while noting it honors the undervalued original.
