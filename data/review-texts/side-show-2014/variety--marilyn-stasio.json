The mention of honoring the memory of the original suggests some reservations but overall a solid endorsement. | Gemini: The review describes the production as \"handsome\" and \"expertly crafted,\" indicating a positive assessment. The phrase \"honors the memory\" suggests respect for the original, further supporting a positive, though perhaps not ecstatic, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers warm praise for the revival's craftsmanship, calling it 'handsome' and 'expertly crafted' while noting it honors the undervalued original. The tone is clearly approving, though the extreme brevity suggests this may be an excerpt.",
