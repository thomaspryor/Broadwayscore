  "bwwExcerpt": "Those who saw the original 1997 Broadway production might see Condon's 'Side Show' as more of a reworking than a revival...Many of the changes work, especially new numbers like 'Ready to Play' and 'Stuck With You,' which present Violet and Daisy at their vaudeville-best...But there are problems...What remains constant in both productions of 'Side Show,' though, are the near flawless performances by its two leading ladies. Davie and Padgett, like Emily Skinner and Alice Ripley before them, are masterful here. Each colors her twin with a distinguishable personality, yet gracefully moves together as a single unit...They sound great, too, with bright, bold vibratos on display in perfect harmony...There's not a weak link among our ensemble...They do an excellent job at establishing the community among society's outcasts...Still, there's something amiss in this new 'Side Show.' It could be the polish of Condon's direction, which can leave you feeling empty. Or the production design itself, which appears far more grand and cinematic than the story can support. The danger never feels dangerous enough. The challenges, never that hard to overcome.",
