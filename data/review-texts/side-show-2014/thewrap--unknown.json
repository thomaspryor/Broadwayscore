  "bwwExcerpt": "Condon shows musical-theater veterans how it's supposed to be done...Back in 1998, the Tonys nominated the two actors playing Daisy and Violet, but gave them only one nomination to share. It's a credit to Condon, Davie, and Padgett that the Tonys probably won't repeat that mistake; these are two utterly different, equally riveting performances, and Davie and Padgett take divergent paths to win our empathy...Henry Krieger's songs, a few of them new, never sounded this good...Krieger's plaintive melodies now have their own space in which to shimmer. Not fixed, unfortunately, are some of Russell's more pedestrian lyrics, which bring ordinary rhymes to some very extraordinary emotions. But those looking for perfection in the arts should stay home and read Yeats. 'Side Show' now takes its place in the pantheon of great American musicals.",
