  "bwwExcerpt": "Although the best parts of the show have not been touched (including virtually the entire second half), the new dialogue and songs and added back-story do not make the show any more effective. If anything, they take away from its sense of momentum. But for the most part, Condon's production is a stunning achievement and a must-see attraction for anyone who cares about serious, Sondheim-style musical theater. Unlike the original production, which was light on design elements, the new 'Side Show' is ultra-elaborate and realistic when it comes to depicting the so-called 'freaks.' Erin Davie and Emily Padgett may lack the starry presence of Alice Ripley and Emily Skinner (the original Violet and Daisy), but they credibly portray the twins and convey their conflicted emotions.",
