  "bwwExcerpt": "The Front Page is a classic not only for its playability but also for its timelessness: No one will ever need footnotes to understand the idea of journalists competing venally to expose venal politicians. What they may need, though, is internet access, because the presses that printed Atkinson's review, and the reviews of every Broadway revival since then until this one, are as obsolete as the typewriters and candlestick telephones and 'Get me rewrite!' commands depicted in the play. So may theater critics be. Therefore, let me use my end-times platform to contradict Atkinson, who advised 'squeamish folk' to stay home. On the contrary, squeamish folk will love it, and when it comes to politics and journalism, who isn't squeamish?",
