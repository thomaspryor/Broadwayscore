However, the brief text limits the depth of evaluation, leading to medium confidence. | Gemini: The review praises the casting and describes the revival as \"crackling,\" indicating a positive assessment. | Kimi: The critic offers unqualified praise for the lead performances ('perfectly cast') and describes the revival as 'crackling,' indicating strong approval of the production's energy and quality despite the brevity of the excerpt.",
