  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Jack O'Brien begins and ends each act with a tableau. Until Lane arrives, the action in between those stylish freezes rarely unthaws. The direction is stately when it needs to be raucous. Likewise, Douglas W. Schmidt's set is grand, not grungy enough to be a press room in a prison. Occasionally, a few supporting players break through. Robert Morse in the cameo of a boozed-up messenger emerges as lower than the worn linoleum. Sherie Rene Scott goes period with an uncanny Joan Crawford impersonation, right out of 'Rain.' Jefferson Mays, once again, recycles Franklin Pangborn, playing a persnickety poem-writing (wink, wink) reporter. Oddly enough, Mays received a big ovation at his entrance. Were people applauding his recent 'Oslo' triumph, or did they think Lane was reprising his performance from 'The Nance'? From a few rows away, the two men look a lot alike.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Nathan Lane manages to deliver a truly evil, unlovable Burns, who, of course, is always a delight to watch. But again, some uncredited writer got in the way of his portrayal, reworking the original text...The direction is stately when it needs to be raucous...But what’s 'The Front Page' without a dynamite Hildy Johnson? John Slattery‘s hedonistic 'Mad Men' boss was always that show’s greatest comic asset, but he shows none of that flair, timing, or panache here.\"\n\nRead more"
