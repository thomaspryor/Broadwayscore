  "fullText": "While it is debatable that the life of the newly emancipated Britney Spears is a fairy tale at present, the singer's catalog of hits surely has the feel of a fable with feminist-forward empowerment. That's what writer Jon Hartmere and director-choreographers Keone and Mari Madrid use as the basis for \"Once Upon a One More Time,\" their Broadway twist on staid, storybook romanticism and tired male-centric tropes. With its giddy, surprisingly caustic script and rapier-fast score, this pop-musical course correction (authorized by Spears, post-conservatorship) is built for speed and social awareness.",
