  "showScoreExcerpt": "“I'm afraid that, this time, Cinderella has stayed too late at the ball. That's my takeaway from this strenuously gyrating romp through fairytale land, which applies a not terribly fresh feminist twist -- and a batch of Britney Spears standards -- to a gaggle of storybook characters, most of whom already have musicals of their own, if not a Disney picture or two. Timing counts for a lot in the theatre, and despite a talented company dedicated to ramming home their production numbers, Once Upon a One More Time often feels sadly passé. It suffers from princess fatigue.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative verdict calling the show 'sadly passé' and suffering from 'princess fatigue', but single excerpt warning requires caution about incomplete assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'sadly passé' and suffering from 'princess fatigue', indicating a negative impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"stayed too late at the ball\", \"not terribly fresh\", and \"sadly passé\", indicating a negative overall assessment despite acknowledging the talent of the company. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as 'passé' and suffering from 'princess fatigue,' finding the concept stale despite a talented cast. The 'despite' construction signals that the negative assessment overrides the performer praise.",
