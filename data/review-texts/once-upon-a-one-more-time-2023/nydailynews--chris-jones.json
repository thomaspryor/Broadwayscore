  "dtliExcerpt": "The truly awful “Once Upon a One More Time,” which opened on Broadway Thursday night at the Marriott Marquis Theatre under the “creative consultancy” of David Leveaux, is not that musical.

  "fullText": "To use the Britney Spears catalog as the material for a musical preaching feminist enlightenment is, to put it mildly, a stretch. The now reclusive pop star’s heavily sexualized and self-objectifying body of work includes such fodder as “Baby, One More Time,” (”hit me baby...”), “Make Me” (”I just want you to make me move...”) and, of course, the inimitable “Oops, I Did It Again,” wherein the singer declares she’s “not that innocent.”\n\nSure, there has been the more recent “Free Britney” movement on social media and the long-troubled star, who is in her 40s, now is reasonably viewed as a victim of exploitation by family, the music industry and the entire 1990s. Most things Spears, though, remain shrouded in mystery and the absence of externally verifiable facts.\n\nErgo, the ideal jukebox Britney Spears show would imagine a star, or a fictional surrogate thereof, who came with great talent, neediness, complexity and vulnerability, riding on a knife edge of victimhood and ironic power, influencing the millions of impressionable teenagers who followed her music from around the globe for good and ill and defining her moment.\n\nThis image released by Vivacity Media Group shows the company during a performance of the musical \"Once Upon a One More Time.\" (Matthew Murphy/AP)\n\nThe truly awful “Once Upon a One More Time,” which opened on Broadway Thursday night at the Marriott Marquis Theatre under the “creative consultancy” of David Leveaux, is not that musical.\n\nInstead, it tries to cash in on the repetitive fashion of the moralistic musical moment and uses Spears’ songs as a way to critique and deconstruct “problematic” fairy tales.\n\nThe show, written by Jon Hartmere, has a plot very, very much akin to “Bad Cinderella,” another disaster that trashed a beloved fairy tale, and to the current multi-artist juke show “& Juliette,” which looks like “Sweeney Todd” in comparison to the other two attractions. “Once Upon a One More Time” takes an apparent cue from “Free Britney,” except that we’re watching a show about the emancipation of Snow White, the Little Mermaid and Sleeping Beauty, as led by that dangerous radical Cinderella.\n\nThe antagonist here is the Narrator, who comes with an authoritarian British accent, now a Broadway signal for evil. He’s played by the typically brilliant Adam Godfrey, last seen on Broadway in “The Lehman Trilogy” and who here just has to stand and bark commands like some Orwellian interloper ruining tea parties at the American Girl store. It goes on for two acts, god help us, and it is painful to watch.\n\nSo is most of the show, which stars Briga Heelan as Cinderella and Justin Guarini as a Prince Charming with a lot to learn. The plot, frankly, is nearly impossible to understand, which is absurd given the facile nature of the musical’s themes. There seems to be a semblance of an outer frame, wherein a little girl is reading a fairy tale, but that comes and goes and arrives again without cohesion. It’s never clear how all these fictional characters know each other (they seem to have a club) nor in what world they operate and under what rules. It’s not even clear when the Little Mermaid is losing and finding her voice. There are people with weird clutches of authority: the Narrator can trap princesses in not so happy ever after, apparently, and a hipster Original Fairy Godmother (Brooke Dillman) is powered by Betty Friedan’s “The Feminist Mystique” (she may even be Betty Friedan).\n\nThis image released by Vivacity Media Group shows Briga Heelan during a performance of the musical \"Once Upon a One More Time.\" (Matthew Murphy/AP)\n\nIt’s all utterly bereft of any requisite grounding reality or narrative cohesion and there is nothing in the plot to make you even remotely look forward to Act Two. The only actor on the stage whose work makes even the remotest sense is Jennifer Simard, who thus is often funny as Cinderella’s sardonic Stepmother, the humor flowing entirely from the performer’s top-drawer comedic skills, not the book.\n\nWhen you are trapped in one of these shows, the mind and heart usually goes to the possibility of just enjoying the big musical numbers. Alas, if Spears comes to this show, she will not find her formidable vocal skills honored as she surely would wish. The singing is mediocre and often strained. It’s only in the number “Circus,” as choreographed by Keone and Mari Madrid (also credited as joint directors), that the show really delivers a worthy snapshot of a Spears concert, or at least the wild spectacle I remember seeing years ago. Buyer beware.\n\nThe rest of this summer dud is just a pale and pandering whitewash. The most inventive idea at the Marriott Marquis is the little photo booths available in the lobby that allows fans to put themselves in their own Britney story. Any of them surely would be better than this one.",
