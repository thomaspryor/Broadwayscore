    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Positive language ('genuine wit and surprising emotional depth') but qualified by 'at its best' suggesting inconsistency. Single excerpt warning requires caution - this could be cherry-picked praise from a mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for its wit and emotional depth, suggesting a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper range of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive view, highlighting wit and emotional depth. Given it's a single excerpt, a mid-range positive score is appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the show's genuine wit and emotional depth, though the conditional phrasing ('at its best') suggests some inconsistency in the production. As a single curated excerpt potentially subject to cherry-picking, confidence is reduced.",
