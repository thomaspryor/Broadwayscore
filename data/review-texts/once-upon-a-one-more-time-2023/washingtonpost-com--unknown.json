  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessReview by  Peter MarksNEW YORK — You don’t have to wait for the first AI musical. It’s here. Well, the artificial part, anyway.\n\nThe ingredients of “Once Upon a One More Time” — various fairy tales, a bunch of Britney Spears songs, a how-to-strut-and-tut manual — may very well have been fed into a computer and reformulated by Chatbot GPT. For all I know, the musical might unfold in a different, random sequence of songs, words and dance every night at the Marquis Theatre, where it had its official Broadway opening Thursday.",
