    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic uses 'enjoyable' which indicates a positive recommendation, though 'dizzy' and 'goof' suggest it's not high art. The comparison to '& Juliet' (a successful jukebox musical) reinforces this as a fun, if lightweight, recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'enjoyable,' indicating a positive experience, albeit with a lighthearted or frivolous tone. The comparison to 'similar in many ways to “& Juliet”' suggests it shares qualities with another known production, likely in a positive light. Given the single excerpt and aggregator's flat verdict, a mid-range positive score is appropriate. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as \"enjoyable,\" indicating a positive, though not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. The word \"goof\" suggests it's not high art, hence the reservation.",
