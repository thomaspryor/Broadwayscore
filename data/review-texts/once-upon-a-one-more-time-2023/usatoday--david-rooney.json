  "fullText": "LETTERSPublic OpinionAdd TopicLetters: Newark Granville Symphony Orchestra's 'glow' leading way Licking County artsLetters to the EditorJune 17, 2023, 6:00 a.m. ETChooi performance an example of symphony's importanceThe Newark Granville Symphony Orchestra is a rare gem in Licking County.\n\nGuest violin soloist, Timothy Chooi, was given a standing ovation April 13 after his passionate performance of Felix Mendelssohn’s Hebrides Overture, Op. 26. The audience response was lengthy, a powerful demonstration of this 25-year-old violin virtuoso playing on the 1790 Stradivarius. As an avid educator, he taught master classes at Granville, Newark and Zanesville high schools while visiting Licking County. Many of those students attended the concert at the Midland Theatre in Newark, and during the intermission waited in a long line for his autograph.\n\nOutreach is a vital part of the NGSO's mission. The board has planned for free family concerts at the Reese Center. “Tunes and Tales” will be presented at the Newark Public Library on Saturday mornings beginning this fall. There was a concert June 11 and will be three other Sunday concerts this summer at the Robbins Hunter Museum at 221 E. Broadway in Granville.\n\nHigh school musicians have the opportunity to play in the Youth Orchestra under the direction of Susan Larson. The Chamber Strings is an opportunity for elementary students to play in an orchestra.\n\nThe NGSO’s glow is leading the way for the arts in Licking County. The major fundraiser for the orchestra, Symphony of Flavor, will present “A Gaelic Gala” on Saturday, Aug. 12, at 5:30 pm at Snapshots Lounge in Granville. Make your plans to attend this gala with friends for an entertaining evening, and demonstrate our gratitude and support for NGSO.\n\nPlease excuse me while I pick my chin up off the floor. Rep. Al Cutrona (R-Canfield) and Sen. Tim Schaffer (R-Lancaster) are proposing that this state eliminate sales taxes on guns. The kinds of guns that are quite capable of killing people of any age.\n\nLet me get this straight: Each time I buy food for my dog, I pay sales tax. Each time my neighbor buys shoes or clothing for their children, sales tax is part of the price. The set of dishes you bought to feed your family on? The furniture you purchased for them to sit on? Sales tax!\n\nBut guns should be exempt? Is there any sanity left in this state? Any at all?",
