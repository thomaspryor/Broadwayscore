  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The dance is truly what makes ‘Once Upon a One More Time’ worth the price of admission...also ultimately urges us not only to be willing to change the stories we tell and be open to new ideas, but also that sometimes, we must pass the pen to new writers to tell their stories themselves. That message has continued relevance — if anything, it's continually stronger than yesterday.”",
