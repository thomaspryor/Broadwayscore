    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic finds the show lacking in substance ('not much happens') and criticizes its limited conception of empowerment. However, this is only one excerpt, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a lack of substance and limited thematic depth, indicating a negative view. However, due to the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the show is lacking in substance and doesn't offer much beyond a superficial take on empowerment. The phrase \"not much happens\" is a negative assessment. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
