    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt describes show as both 'undeniably entertaining' and 'a bit of a mess.' The 'but' structure and 'mess' characterization suggests significant reservations despite entertainment value, placing it in mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as entertaining but also messy, indicating a mixed review. The single excerpt and text quality warning suggest caution, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review states the show is \"undeniably entertaining\" but also \"a bit of a mess.\" This suggests a positive but qualified recommendation. Given that it is only one excerpt, I am scoring it at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt describes the show as undeniably entertaining and compelling despite significant structural flaws, indicating a mildly positive, qualified recommendation in the lower range. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
