    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic describes the show as 'earnest' (positive) but 'uneven in its execution' (negative), indicating a mixed assessment with no clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'earnest' but 'uneven,' indicating a mixed review. The lack of full context and single excerpt warning suggest caution, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as \"earnest\" but \"uneven,\" indicating a mixed assessment. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt presents a balanced but lukewarm assessment: praising the show's earnest feminist messaging while criticizing its inconsistent execution. The single-excerpt limitation prevents determining if the critic ultimately recommends the show or advises skipping it, but the explicit 'uneven' criticism places this firmly in mixed territory.",
