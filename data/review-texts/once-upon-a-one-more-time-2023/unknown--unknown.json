  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The musical’s primary assets are its splendid cast and the silly smartness of the integration of song and story. Which brings to mind the splendid, silly and smart performance of Jennifer Simard in the role of Cinderella’s stepmother...Ms. Simard, is one of Broadway’s unsung, or undersung, treasures, and her performance alone brings sufficient pleasure to make this trip to Britney-land worth a visit.”\n\nRead more",

The phrase 'worth a visit' suggests a positive recommendation, though the single excerpt limits full context. | Gemini: The review highlights the strength of the cast, particularly Jennifer Simard, and explicitly states that her performance makes the show \"worth a visit.\" Given the single excerpt warning, a score in the middle of the positive range is appropriate.",
