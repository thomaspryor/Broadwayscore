  "bwwExcerpt": "The big difficulty at this point in the musical's evolution - a production with Broadway on its agenda - is that no song gets the space and time necessary to truly break out. This frustratingly rushed sensation is emblematic of a production that packs in too many competing conceits and devices. The numbers are set off here in little explosions, courtesy of the Madrids' rat-a-tat tutting moves. Their dances are sharp but abbreviated: mere quotes, where an audience wants full sentences, and a bigger charge out of hearing Spears's repurposed music. (Along with Spears, Max Martin and Pharrell Williams are among the numerous songwriters.)",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic identifies significant structural problems (rushed pacing, too many competing elements, abbreviated numbers) but the tone suggests disappointment rather than outright dismissal. The 'frustratingly rushed' language indicates unmet potential. | GPT-4o: The review highlights significant issues with the production's pacing and execution, suggesting a negative impression. However, the single excerpt limits the ability to fully gauge the critic's overall sentiment, leading to a conservative score within the Negative range. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the production as \"frustratingly rushed\" and suggests that the musical numbers are underdeveloped. This indicates a mixed assessment, as it highlights both positive and negative aspects without a clear recommendation.",

  "fullText": "‘Once Upon a One More Time,’ a sassy fairy-tale extravaganza featuring the Spears songbook, is a storybook mess NEW YORK — You don’t have to wait for the first AI musical. It’s here. Well, the artificial part, anyway. The ingredients of “Once Upon a One More Time” — various fairy tales, a bunch of Britney Spears songs, a how-to-strut-and-tut manual — may very well have been fed into a computer and reformulated by Chatbot GPT. For all I know, the musical might unfold in a different, random sequence of songs, words and dance every night at the Marquis Theatre, where it had its official Broadway opening Thursday. The Tony Awards show was unscripted. Who knew it would be incomparable? Well, actually, having seen an earlier incarnation of this bombastic, mechanical entertainment in 2021 at D.C.’s Shakespeare Theatre Company, I know that it plays out as it did before. Little has been done to address its deficiencies. The central flaw is a slipshod story that just doesn’t track — I know, I know, it’s all supposed to be a sugary coconut-cream cupcake of a show, not meant to awaken serious palates. Still, Jon Hartmere’s book is such a hodgepodge of disjointed ideas that software intervention might actually have helped. The premise is that all of a child’s favorite fairy-tale princesses — from folklore and Disney alike — live out their days in a metaphysical green room, waiting to be summoned to work by a wizardly Narrator, played by Adam Godley (of the Tony-winning “The Lehman Trilogy,” among other great things. Oh, why, Adam?). Their labors commence (how? where?) whenever a real kid reads their story. Everything is copacetic until the day Cinderella (the mega-appealing Briga Heelan) is gifted by her fairy godmother (Brooke Dillman, channeling Josephine the Plumber from the old Comet commercials) a copy of Betty Friedan’s “The Feminine Mystique.” Freeing the women — Cinderella, Snow White (Aisha Jackson), Rapunzel (Gabrielle Beckford), Sleeping Beauty (Ashley Chiu), the Little Mermaid (Lauren Zakrin) among them — from their male-identification fixation leads us in and out of a couple dozen Spears numbers. Such well-known Britney songs as “Toxic,” “… Baby One More Time” and “Oops! … I Did It Again” rotate in with several lesser-known titles by Spears, Max Martin and many others. Linking a millennial superstar to proto-feminist versions of storybook characters is potentially a lucrative idea for Broadway, if not exactly an original one (e.g. the recent Andrew Lloyd Webber disaster “Bad Cinderella,” which did a quick Times Square disappearing act). “Once Upon a One More Time” also seems revved up — with beat-hitting dances by director-choreographers Keone and Mari Madrid — to go toe-to-toe with a much savvier jukebox musical, “& Juliet.” That show, a pop riff on “Romeo and Juliet,” also features Max Martin songs, several from Spears’s repertory. Some cast members have been switched out for Broadway: Among the newcomers are Godley and the indispensable Jennifer Simard, who assumes the role of Cinderella’s wicked Stepmother. Her portrayal of a glammed-up troublemaker, a snooty fashion plate out of the Miranda Priestly mold, is fun, because Simard in anything is fun. Heelan reprises her role, as do Jackson and several of the young actresses playing famous fairy-tale denizens. They’re all to satisfactory degrees cheery and silly and polished, and wear Loren Elstein’s witty candy- and pastel-colored frocks as if they’re heading to the prom on Magic Mountain. Justin Guarini, the production’s magnetic marquee name (by dint of Season 1 of “American Idol”) is back, too, as a vigorous, sexually mischievous Prince Charming. He gives a pleasingly preening, self-parodying account of male vanity. Which, in the moral universe of “Once Upon a One More Time,” is punishable by — well, let’s just say that for all his duplicity, this prince gets off pretty much scot-free. (Only a reticent gay couple played by Ryan Steele and Nathan Levy are exempted from abrasive romantic entanglement.) The Madrids attempt to express the declarations of freedom and defiance in the Spears songbook through their angular movement, but there’s no particular development of choreographic style over the show’s 2½ hours. The exhilaration wears off as the moves repeat again and again. Too much tutting, and a show set in a fantasyland starts to look like a recycled concert routine. Once Upon a One More Time, book by Jon Hartmere, based on music performed by Britney Spears. Directed and choreographed by Keone and Mari Madrid. Set, Anna Fleischle; costumes, Loren Elstein; lighting, Kenneth Posner; sound, Andrew Keister; projections, Sven Ortel; music director, Ben Cohen; orchestrations, Matt Stine and James Olmstead; creative consultant, David Leveaux. With Tess Soltau, Ryann Redmond. About 2½ hours. At the Marquis Theatre, 210 W. 46th St., New York. onemoretimemusical.com.",
