  "bwwExcerpt": "The big difficulty at this point in the musical's evolution - a production with Broadway on its agenda - is that no song gets the space and time necessary to truly break out. This frustratingly rushed sensation is emblematic of a production that packs in too many competing conceits and devices. The numbers are set off here in little explosions, courtesy of the Madrids' rat-a-tat tutting moves. Their dances are sharp but abbreviated: mere quotes, where an audience wants full sentences, and a bigger charge out of hearing Spears's repurposed music. (Along with Spears, Max Martin and Pharrell Williams are among the numerous songwriters.)",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic identifies significant structural problems (rushed pacing, too many competing elements, abbreviated numbers) but the tone suggests disappointment rather than outright dismissal. The 'frustratingly rushed' language indicates unmet potential. | GPT-4o: The review highlights significant issues with the production's pacing and execution, suggesting a negative impression. However, the single excerpt limits the ability to fully gauge the critic's overall sentiment, leading to a conservative score within the Negative range. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the production as \"frustratingly rushed\" and suggests that the musical numbers are underdeveloped. This indicates a mixed assessment, as it highlights both positive and negative aspects without a clear recommendation.",

Well, the artificial part, anyway. The ingredients of “Once Upon a One More Time” — various fairy tales, a bunch of Britney Spears songs, a how-to-strut-and-tut manual — may very well have been fed into a computer and reformulated by Chatbot GPT. For all I know, the musical might unfold in a different, random sequence of songs, words and dance every night at the Marquis Theatre, where it had its official Broadway opening Thursday.",
