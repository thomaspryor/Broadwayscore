  "bwwExcerpt": "The big difficulty at this point in the musical's evolution - a production with Broadway on its agenda - is that no song gets the space and time necessary to truly break out. This frustratingly rushed sensation is emblematic of a production that packs in too many competing conceits and devices. The numbers are set off here in little explosions, courtesy of the Madrids' rat-a-tat tutting moves. Their dances are sharp but abbreviated: mere quotes, where an audience wants full sentences, and a bigger charge out of hearing Spears's repurposed music. (Along with Spears, Max Martin and Pharrell Williams are among the numerous songwriters.)",

Well, the artificial part, anyway. The ingredients of “Once Upon a One More Time” — various fairy tales, a bunch of Britney Spears songs, a how-to-strut-and-tut manual — may very well have been fed into a computer and reformulated by Chatbot GPT. For all I know, the musical might unfold in a different, random sequence of songs, words and dance every night at the Marquis Theatre, where it had its official Broadway opening Thursday.",
