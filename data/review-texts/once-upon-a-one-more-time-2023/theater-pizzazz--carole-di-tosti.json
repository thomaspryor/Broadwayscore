However, limited text and excerpt warning requires low confidence and upper Positive range scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the creative teams, ensemble work, and performances, suggesting a positive view. However, the single excerpt warning indicates potential cherry-picking, so the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review indicates that Britney fans will appreciate the show and gives kudos to the creative teams, ensemble work, and performances, suggesting a positive, but not rave, recommendation. The single excerpt limits confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers clear praise ('outstanding performances,' 'kudos') but qualifies appeal to Britney fans specifically. Lacks superlatives for universal 'Rave' status.",
