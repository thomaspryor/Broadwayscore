    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a comparison to other musicals with similar themes, but lacks clear evaluative language indicating strong praise or criticism. The mention of 'blatant messaging' implies a mixed reception, without a definitive recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt compares the show negatively to other musicals, suggesting a lack of originality and potentially heavy-handed messaging. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the negative bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt uses critical language ('blatant', 'broad strokes') to describe the show's feminist approach, comparing it to both the well-received 'Six' and the panned 'Diana', suggesting a lack of subtlety. However, with only one truncated excerpt available, the full verdict remains unclear.",
