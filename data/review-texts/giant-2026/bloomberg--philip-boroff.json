  "bwwExcerpt": "The redoubtable Brian d'Arcy James, Kate Baldwin and John Dossett lead a cast of 22 singing sumptuous melodies by Michael John LaChiusa. They're backed by a 17-piece orchestra, a rare luxury for off-Broadway. But before fantasizing about \"Giant\" gushing onto Broadway and upending the season's Tony Award derby -- as I did during those thrilling opening minutes -- be mindful of its excesses...too many peripheral characters bog down the story. Especially given Bruce Coughlin's sublime orchestration",
