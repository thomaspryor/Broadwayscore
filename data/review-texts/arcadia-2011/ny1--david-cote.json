    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic acknowledges the play's potential but clearly states this revival is 'misjudged' and 'doesn't really crack the equation,' indicating disappointment and non-recommendation despite the source material's quality. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates that the revival fails to meet its potential, suggesting a negative view. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review states that the revival is \"misjudged\" and \"doesn't really crack the equation,\" indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging the play's potential, the critic explicitly calls this Broadway revival 'misjudged' and states it fails to 'crack the equation,' constituting a recommendation against this specific production.",
