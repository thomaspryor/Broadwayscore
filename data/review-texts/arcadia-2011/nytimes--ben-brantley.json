More Photos »\n\nA suspicion lingers in the heart of the constant theatergoer that if you are too clever, then you must be made of ice. This prejudice has misguidedly dogged, among others, that greatest of songwriters, Stephen Sondheim, like a peevish, affection-starved beagle. But it has never clung to anyone more tenaciously and erroneously than it does to the playwright Tom Stoppard.\n\nFollow @NYTimestheater for theater news and reviews from Broadway and beyond.\n\nTom Riley as a tutor and Bel Powley as his pupil in Tom Stoppard's “Arcadia.” More Photos »\n\nSo I encourage you to feel the heat rising from the stage of the Ethel Barrymore Theater, where a half-terrific revival of Mr. Stoppard’s entirely terrific “Arcadia” opened on Thursday night. Though this play finds Mr. Stoppard at his most luxuriantly wordy, it is not hot air of which I speak. Watching David Leveaux’s production I realized more than ever that “Arcadia,” a tale of two centuries in pseudopastoral England, is propelled by genuine, panting passion.\n\nAnd not just physical passion. This may be a work that begins with the question, posed by a 13-year-old girl in 1809, of just what “a carnal embrace” is. But good old lust is only one complicating element within the deeper impulse that animates both the characters in “Arcadia” and the play itself.\n\nThat is the unquenchable human urge to acquire knowledge, whether carnal, mathematical, historical or metaphysical. It is the itch to discover what lurks beneath concealing clothes and clouds and dusty layers of accumulated years. Success in these quests is irrelevant, since full and true knowledge of anything is impossible. As one character says toward the play’s end, in a declaration that soars, “It’s the wanting to know that makes us matter.” Though I have seen and read “Arcadia” many times since it was first staged in London in 1993, Mr. Leveaux’s interpretation brings out the irresistible force of “wanting to know” better than any version in my experience. This is by no means a perfect production. Several central roles are slightly miscast. Worse, some of the performances from the Anglo-American cast are pitched to the point of incoherence in those nasal passages where upper-class twangs are thought to dwell.\n\nYet if this “Arcadia” lacks the uniform surface sparkle it had when I saw it (with a different cast) in London in 2009, it has acquired something more important: an emotional depth, viscerally rooted, to support its intellectual shimmer. This conviction comes across — with gusto and delicacy — via four performers who embody two almost-couples of two different eras.\n\nThat would be Tom Riley and Bel Powley, portraying an early-19th-century tutor and his aristocratic pupil, and Lia Williams and Billy Crudup, in the late 20th century, as literary rivals and occasional collaborators. (For the record, though I said “gusto and delicacy,” the delicate part really applies only to Mr. Riley and Ms. Williams.)\n\nSharing the same set — a room in the stately Derbyshire country home, Sidley Park (designed with ideal simplicity by Hildegard Bechtler) — these four actors exude a thrilling energy that flows across the centuries and reminds us that intellectual and erotic magnetism are not mutually exclusive. Their characters all clearly belong to an ages-crossing, Breugel-like march of humanity. But they are also as vividly individual as the subjects of portraits by Gainsborough or, in Mr. Crudup’s case, by a sharp social caricaturist like George Cruickshank. (The pitch-perfect costumes are by Gregory Gale.)\n\nQuickly summing up the plot of “Arcadia” is as doomed an undertaking as solving the riddles of the universe before breakfast. When the play opens, in 1809, Sidley Park, the demesne of the worldly Lady Croom (Margaret Colin), is undergoing a relandscaping that will change its look from classical to Gothic. Subsequent alternating (and eventually overlapping) scenes take place some 180 years later, when Hannah Jarvis (Ms. Williams), a best-selling author, arrives to research a book on “the nervous breakdown of the Romantic imagination.”\n\nAlso in 20th-century Sidley is Bernard Nightingale (Mr. Crudup), a self-promoting academic looking for clues to a previously unknown chapter in the life of Lord Byron. The evidence that Bernard and Hannah gather (and misinterpret) — papers, drawings, workbooks — is mostly material we see being shaped in the 19th-century scenes, as Thomasina Coverly (Ms. Powley), Lady Croom’s daughter, pursues her studies with her tutor, Septimus Hodge (Mr. Riley).\n\nGet 50% Off The New York Times & Free All Digital Access.\n\nBillions of dollars have poured into the continent to fight killer diseases.
