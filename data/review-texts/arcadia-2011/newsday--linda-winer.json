  "bwwExcerpt": "Arcadia, back on Broadway for the first time since 1995, is a heady, aching thrill of a tragicomedy. Part historical-literary mystery, part academic satire, Tom Stoppard's time-traveling masterwork is, above all else, a ravishing romance -- a great love story, really -- between the worlds of the mind and the heart. See it when you're not tired, and try to sit close. The production's acoustics are not brilliant. Stoppard is...Director David Leveaux's celebrated English revival, mostly recast for the Broadway import, is visually lean and emotionally exuberant.",

The caveat about acoustics is a minor reservation. | Kimi: The excerpt contains enthusiastic praise ('masterwork,' 'ravishing romance') and an explicit recommendation to attend, though the single-excerpt format and note about acoustics warrant placement in the upper Positive range rather than Rave.",
