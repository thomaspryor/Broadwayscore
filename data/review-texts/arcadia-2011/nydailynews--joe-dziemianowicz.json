  "bwwExcerpt": "On the plus side, Williams brings believability and ample humor to her role, and Riley is perfection. He provides a calm and steady-beating heart, while at the same time hinting at the heat burning below Septimus' cool surface. Less successful is Powley, who has a high-pitched voice that cuts like a serrated knife and obscures her lines. Margaret Colin, as her landscape-obsessed mother, tends to swallow words, too.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Mixed assessment praising some performances (Williams, Riley) while criticizing others (Powley, Colin). Single excerpt with no clear overall recommendation makes confidence low. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt provides both positive and negative evaluations. While Williams and Riley are praised, Powley's performance and Colin's delivery are criticized. The mixed nature of the feedback suggests a balanced view with no clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises two performances but criticizes two others, resulting in a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and lack of an overall recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers high praise for two performers ('perfection', 'believability and ample humor') but significant criticism of others ('voice that cuts like a serrated knife', 'swallow words'), resulting in a balanced mixed assessment.",
