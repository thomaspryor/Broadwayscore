  "bwwExcerpt": "Enough about 'Spider-Man' already—Tom Stoppard is back on Broadway! Only time will tell whether 'Arcadia' is Mr. Stoppard's masterpiece, but it isn't premature to call it one of the key English-language plays of the postwar era, and even in a staging that is less than satisfactory, it makes a rich and affecting impression. Now for the bad news: David Leveaux's revival of 'Arcadia,' which was originally mounted in London two years ago with a different cast, isn't much better than adequate. When you're talking about a high-profile revival of a great play, good enough won't cut it.",
