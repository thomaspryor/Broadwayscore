  "bwwExcerpt": "Crudup, who originated the role of the tutor on Broadway in 1995, delivers a quite brilliant portrayal of the weasellike university don desperate to find a Lord Byron connection and burnish his credentials. Esparza, as a graduate student of mathematics who focuses on grouse population, has taken a quieter role and made it heartbreaking.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performances ('quite brilliant', 'heartbreaking'), but this is only one curated excerpt so full verdict unclear. Single excerpt warning suggests upper end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of Crudup and Esparza, highlighting their brilliance and emotional impact. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of a full review, the confidence is low, and the score is at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances of the actors, calling Crudup's portrayal \"quite brilliant\" and Esparza's \"heartbreaking.\" Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive with a slightly higher score due to the strong praise. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong praise for lead performances ('quite brilliant', 'heartbreaking'), indicating a clear positive recommendation, though limited context prevents full assessment.",
