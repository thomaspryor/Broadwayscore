  "fullText": "It's all about the witches in Lincoln Center Theater's new revival of Macbeth. The Weird Sisters  the craggy all-male trio of Malcolm Gets, John Glover, and Byron Jennings  pull all the strings, popping up in minor roles and causing toil and trouble at every turn. Head witch Hecate (a fabulous Francesca Faridany)  styled as some brilliantly bizarre cross between Medusa and Cruella de Vil  even gets high with Macbeth (Ethan Hawke). When you're smoking funny stuff with a bunch of ''secret black and midnight hags,'' you know you're in too deep.\n\nThough his scruffy, still-boyish looks suggest the prototypical Hamlet, Hawke makes a very convincing (and wonderfully sleazy) Scottish king. And as Macbeth gains power, so does the actor. As Lady Macbeth, the sleepwalking, hand-washing, regicide-plotting woman behind the man, English actress Anne-Marie Duff maintains a delicate balance between imperious and docile, sexy and demoralizing.\n\nBut director Jack O'Brien's stylish production  see Catherine Zuber's uber-trendy military-chic costumes  practically comes to a grinding halt when the pious Macduff (Graceland's Daniel Sunjata) and heir-to-the-throne Malcolm (Jonny Orsini) begin plotting their takedown of Macbeth. Sunjata overdoes every line he speaks, and Orsini is overwhelmed by the speech. The good news: After that slog of a scene comes Duff's ''out, damned spot'' moment  a spellbinding slice in an evening that is less than spellbinding otherwise. B–\n\n(Tickets: Telecharge.com or 800-432-7250)",

Strong praise for lead performances (Hawke 'very convincing', Duff's 'delicate balance') and stylish direction, but significant criticism of supporting performances that make the production 'come to a grinding halt'. | GPT-4o: The review highlights issues with pacing and specific performances, resulting in a D rating. Despite some praise for individual actors, the overall tone is negative, aligning with a 'Negative' bucket. | Gemini: The review assigns a 'D' grade. While praising Hawke and Duff, it criticizes Sunjata and Orsini's performances and states the production 'comes to a grinding halt,' indicating a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: While the critic praises lead performances by Hawke and Duff as well as the costume design, the explicit D grade and verdict that the production 'practically comes to a grinding halt' indicate a clear recommendation against seeing the show.",
