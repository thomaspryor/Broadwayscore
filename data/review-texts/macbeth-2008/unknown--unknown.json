    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt criticizes the production as 'overthought' and suggests it fails to connect with audiences despite strong star power. However, with only one curated excerpt available, the full review verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests uncertainty about the production's reception despite star power, indicating a mixed review. The single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the production is \"overthought\" and \"unsure of its welcome,\" indicating a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers a clearly negative assessment, criticizing the production as 'overthought' and 'unsure of its welcome' despite the presence of major stars, suggesting it fails to engage its audience. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt available. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Negative",
