    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('sleek', 'perfect pitch') with praise for the production and leads. Single excerpt limits confidence, but tone is distinctly favorable. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'sleek' and praises its balance between 'cynicism and romance,' indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language like \"perfect pitch\" and \"sleek revival\", suggesting a strong recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise ('sleek', 'perfect pitch') for the revival's execution and tone, indicating a clear recommendation. Per the single-excerpt guidance, the distinctly positive language warrants the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
