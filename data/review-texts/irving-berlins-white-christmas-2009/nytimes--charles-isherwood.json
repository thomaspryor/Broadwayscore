  "fullText": "“The Best Things Happen While You’re Dancing” is the title of one of the Irving Berlin songs in “White Christmas,” and it is also a fitting description for the production now at the John W. Engeman Theater at Northport.\n\nDrew Humphrey, the choreographer, has put a lot of imagination into the jumps, taps and slides that permeate the show’s many musical numbers. Drew Humphrey, the actor, is also a blissfully nimble interpreter of his own intricate steps. He is ideally matched by Darien Crago, who plays his character’s love interest and most frequent dance partner.\n\nMs. Crago, who starred last year as the young hoofer Peggy Sawyer in “42nd Street” at the Engeman, exudes an appealing sparkle. Mr. Humphrey appeared in ancillary roles in the 2008 and 2009 Broadway productions of “Irving Berlin’s White Christmas” — the full name of the stage musical based on the 1954 movie called merely “White Christmas”— and in 2009 he also understudied his current role of Phil Davis, one of the four leads. He has Berlin’s rhythms in his bones.\n\nIn most other areas, this is a pleasant but often pedestrian holiday show. Under the direction of Mark Adam Rampmeyer, it comes off as a pastiche of songs rather than a cohesive musical. The book, by David Ives and Paul Blake, did not win plaudits on Broadway either, but a production in Patchogue last year by the Gateway Performing Arts Center of Suffolk County demonstrated how good cheer and fine acting can overcome a lackluster script.\n\nThe musical begins on Christmas Eve, 1944, “somewhere on the Western Front of World War II.” Phil and his pal Bob Wallace are starring in a makeshift revue for their fellow troops that includes the title song. Fast forward a decade for Scene 2, and the duo is a hit Broadway team appearing on “The Ed Sullivan Show.”\n\nIt is difficult to imagine this pair as nationally famous performers, partly because they wear neon-green suits (among Ryan J. Moller’s undistinguished costume designs) but mostly because Aaron Ramey, who plays Bob, remains wooden, in contrast to the advice he gives in one of his songs, “Let Yourself Go.”\n\nThese two guys are not a good match. However, Bob, with his reserved style and mellifluous voice, turns out to be a nice complement to Betty Haynes (Kennedy Caughell), the quieter half of a sister act the fellows check out for their next Broadway show. Phil is immediately smitten by Judy — that’s the part played by the exuberant Ms. Crago — but Bob and Betty relate their cautious ambivalence in the song “Love and the Weather,” both of which they find “can’t be depended upon” in Berlin’s always wise and delightful lyrics.\n\nThrough plot twists as chancy as the qualities bemoaned in “Love and the Weather,” Bob and Phil board a train traveling to Vermont, where the sisters are headed for their next gig. A catchy production number, “Snow” (not be confused with “Let It Snow”), brightens the journey.\n\nAfter they arrive, the men learn that the failing inn where they have landed is owned by retired Gen. Henry Waverly (Drew Taylor), their former beloved leader. They decide to bail him out by producing a Broadway-level show in his barn theater and enticing their old Army buddies to attend.\n\nAlong the way, they encounter Martha Watson, the general’s loyal right-hand gal, played with fervor and a booming voice by Kathryn Kendall, and his granddaughter, Susan, enthusiastically played by Katie Dolce (who alternates in the role with Claire Levasseur). Betty is captivated by Bob after hearing him sing “Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep” to Susan, though later she falls out of love (temporarily) after a misunderstanding.\n\nAct II begins with a huge production number, “I Love a Piano,” which has no real excuse for being in the musical except that it is to be part of the show that will save the inn, and it is a great tune. Mr. Humphrey, Ms. Crago and the talented ensemble, supported by the orchestra led by James Olmstead, pull out all the stops.\n\nThe number is far more rousing than the closing scene, which includes an audience singalong of “White Christmas” and an ensemble rendering of “I’ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm” against an incongruous backdrop of a snow-covered village (in an area where snow has supposedly just begun to fall), part of Jonathan Collins’s low-budget set. Sentimentality settles in. Too bad the show couldn’t end with songs more suitable for rapid-fire tapping.",
