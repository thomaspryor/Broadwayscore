  "bwwExcerpt": "Like its mouthful of a title, 'Shuffle Along or the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed,' is not a conventional show...The result is a bold and wistful, playful and important musical-about-a-musical. It is overstuffed with ambition and talent, sure, but why shouldn't it be? There is so much to tell and as much to soak in and enjoy, thanks to a thrilling A-list cast...Indeed, there is a lot of exposition, a few too many back stories and, every so often, the narrative inertia of an illustrated history. But what illustrations these are -- choreographed for the terrific dancing chorus by Savion Glover with both a combination of the dazzling, syncopated black-tapping tradition and his own special full-footed, stomping identity.",
