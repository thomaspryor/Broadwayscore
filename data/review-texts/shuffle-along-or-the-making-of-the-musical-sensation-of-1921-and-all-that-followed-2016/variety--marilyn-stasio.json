  "bwwExcerpt": "Both the opening and closing numbers of this ebullient show pay homage to alumni of the original production of 'Shuffle Along' and those who followed. Florence Mills didn't join the show until Gertrude Saunders was fired (both characters are played here by the dynamic Adrienne Warren), and Josephine Baker had to wait until she turned 16 to officially sign on. But Adelaide Hall was in the chorus of Jazz Jasmines. And the refined Lottie Gee, played here by that goddess we mortals know as Audra McDonald, was the star of the original production.",
