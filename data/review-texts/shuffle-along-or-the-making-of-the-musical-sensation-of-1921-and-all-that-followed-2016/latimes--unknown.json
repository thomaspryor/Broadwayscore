  "bwwExcerpt": "A Broadway history lesson is being delivered these days at the Music Box Theatre, and never has anything this educational been so sensationally staged. All credit to Professor George C. Wolfe, holder of a PhD in theatrical pizazz, for adapting and directing this homage to 'Shuffle Along'...Wolfe has assembled an African American dream team of theatrical talent, led by six-time Tony-winner Audra McDonald, to channel the pluck, perseverance and panache of artists who might be forgotten by Broadway but only after they changed it for good. Just when you think McDonald can't impress us anymore than she already has, she blows you away with a tap dancing prowess that must have left even choreographer Savion Glover in awe.",
