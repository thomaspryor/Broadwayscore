  "bwwExcerpt": "So just what is it, this tart and sweet, bubbly and flat, intoxicating and sobering concoction being dispensed from the stage of theMusic Box Theater?...As staged by Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Glover...routines first performed nearly a century ago come across as defiantly fresh...Often you sense that Mr. Wolfe has a checklist of historic points he must, but must, cover before the show's end...The clunky, shoehorned-in exposition doesn't overwhelm the sweeping grace of 'Shuffle Along' whenever it sings or dances...The show's principals...all more or less manage to bend their distinctive charismas into the sinuous contours of early Broadway jazz. But Ms. McDonald is a one-woman time machine de luxe, who translates the precise stylistic quirks of a bygone era into a melting immediacy. She also provides the most fully fleshed character in the show.",
