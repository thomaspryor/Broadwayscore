  "bwwExcerpt": "Shuffle Along...is an angry musical, its solid outrage sublimating not into bitterness or brutality but instead into a kind of suffusing sorrow over the cultural loss that is as fundamental to the legacy of racism as its more violent aspects...The more serious problem is that an idea is not a focal point, and so Shuffle Along...never resolves into a story. Instead, it's a series of historical scenes that tell, rather than show, and that's deadly for a musical. It's unquestionably entertaining to watch the five principal actors here at work, none less than consummate (though, brilliant as she is, McDonald has long since aged out of ingenue roles)...And yet Shuffle Along...struck me as both rough and unfinished.",
