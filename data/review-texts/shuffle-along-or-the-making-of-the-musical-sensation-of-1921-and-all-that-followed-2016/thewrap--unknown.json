  "bwwExcerpt": "Wolfe is both director and book writer, and what a story he delivers! He turns every '42nd Street' cliché on its head to celebrate these artists' tremendous achievement against impossible odds in racist America...There's a lot of history to tell here, and Wolfe doesn't skimp...Four -- count 'em, four -- leading men in one musical! It's a very didactic approach, but whenever their words threaten to turn into a Wikipedia entry, Wolfe the writer hands the reins to his better half: Wolfe the director, with an assist from Savion Glover the choreographer. Both have no equal on Broadway this season. In a year of pandering, corn-pone musicals, 'Shuffle Along' exudes elegance and intelligence at every turn. While it's big in its ambitions, theatrical thrills, and the emotions it stirs, Wolfe achieves much in very small ways.",
