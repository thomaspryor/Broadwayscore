  "bwwExcerpt": "...Shuffle Along...a sometimes inspired and sometimes listless exploration of a path-breaking theatrical work...George C Wolfe has written a script detailing the struggle to bring the show to the stage. Amid these scenes -- some dramatic, some didactic -- are the original songs of Noble Sissle (Henry) and Eubie Blank (Dixon), choreographed in kinetic, hard-striking fashion by the tap mastermind Savion Glover...This Shuffle Along is sometimes edifying and sometimes entertaining, but rarely do these twin aims coincide...it's only when the feet are tapping, the fringe is swaying and the voices of the leads and chorus are celebrating the thrill of syncopation that the musical lives again.",
