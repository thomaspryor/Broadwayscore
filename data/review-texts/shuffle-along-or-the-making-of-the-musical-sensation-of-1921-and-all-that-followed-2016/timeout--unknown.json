  "bwwExcerpt": "The first half is sensational; the second is difficult, in terms of our heroes' postsuccess fates and how engagingly their narratives play out. But with a cast this incandescent (I haven't even mentioned Audra McDonald's tender, guarded brilliance as diva Lottie Gee) and Wolfe staging a constant flow of miracles, there's an overflow of joy and style that smooths over stylistic rough edges and knotty stitching of history to myth...Above all, we can luxuriate in a breathtaking piece of showmanship, featuring more talent crowding a stage than pretty much any other Broadway show at present (and yes, that includes Hamilton)...Oh, and there's dance-miles and miles of ecstatic, syncopated genius courtesy of Savion Glover.",
