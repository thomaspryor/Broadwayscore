  "bwwExcerpt": "Theater legend George C. Wolfe aims to right a historical wrong with 'Shuffle Along,' a new musical -- and it sure feels new, despite what a key producer is arguing -- about the making of an often-overlooked show...Audra McDonald, groundbreaking in her own right, plays Lottie Gee, who was considered the first black ingenue featured in a Broadway musical. Lottie is lusty, busty and trusty...'Shuffle Along' is stylized to evoke an era and focus on big scenes, which can become burdened with exposition...'Shuffle Along' is moving, in fits and starts, as a story about artists who risk their critical and financial fortunes, sculpting a musical from their most raw emotional expressions and their sophisticated artistic heritage, instead of toning down that spirit for mass consumption.",
