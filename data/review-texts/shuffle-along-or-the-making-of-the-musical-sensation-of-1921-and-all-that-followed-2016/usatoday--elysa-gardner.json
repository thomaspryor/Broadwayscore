  "bwwExcerpt": "In this season of Hamilton, it's been a tall order for any new Broadway production to rise to the level of an event. But Shuffle Along... (* * * ½ out of four) qualifies, and not just for the length of its title...The names recruited to appear in this new Shuffle Along...are equally impressive...The stars, all excellent, provide portraits that are at once recognizably human and lavishly entertaining, from Porter's wry, aspirational Aubrey to Henry's imperious but thin-skinned Noble. McDonald and Dixon have a charming, ultimately bittersweet chemistry relaying the sparks that flew between Shuffle Along's star and its married composer. The new Shuffle Along also benefits, greatly, from the exuberant gifts of choreographer Savion Glover.",
