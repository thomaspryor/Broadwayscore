  "bwwExcerpt": "The show packs in an inordinate amount of music - including the now-classic 'I'm Just Wild About Harry' - and dance. You're always looking forward to what choreographer Savion Glover will come up with next, and his set pieces here are just thrillingly fun. The pace doesn't flag until sometime in the second act, although the 'whatever happened to them' epilogue is simultaneously poignant and acerbic. The curtain comes down on a bittersweet note, though without dimming the immense joys that preceded.",
