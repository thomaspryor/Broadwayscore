  "bwwExcerpt": "The first half of George C. Wolfe's 'Shuffle Along' is to 2016 what 'Hamilton' was to 2015: It's the musical you've got to see, even if you've got to hock your Maserati to pay for the ticket. The cast, led by Audra McDonald, Brian Stokes Mitchell and Billy Porter, is as charismatic as you'd expect, and Savion Glover's near-nonstop choreography explodes off the stage with the unrelenting impact of a flamethrower. But then comes intermission, and what had looked like a masterpiece goes flat and stays that way.",
