  "bwwExcerpt": "...the project's strengths far outweigh its flaws. The cast is magnificent. It goes without saying at this point that there's nothing the superhuman McDonald can't do onstage, but rarely do we get to see her cut loose in exuberant comedic mode to the extent she does here...Even beyond her numbers, McDonald kills it with her timing -- every word, look or gesture smacks its target...The four male leads are equally consummate stage artists who go a long way toward finding depth in their underdeveloped characters...even if the structural limitations of Wolfe's undertaking are unable to support the scope of his noble intentions, it's a genuine thrill to watch this outrageously talented cast herald the achievements of a team that brought innovative black artistry to mainstream American theater.",
