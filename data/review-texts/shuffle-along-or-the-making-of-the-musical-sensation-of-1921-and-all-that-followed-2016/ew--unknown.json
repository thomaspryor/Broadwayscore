  "bwwExcerpt": "Shuffle Along...is a refreshing burst of energy, no caffeine necessary...the jazzy musical boasts so much star power, at times it seems unfair to the rest of the Broadway circuit...Enter McDonald as actress Lottie Gee, the Kentucky-bred, headstrong feminist whose dreams of stardom outweigh all four of the show's collaborators combined...There's a reason McDonald has six Tonys and counting: Her honey-like voice captivates, whether she's singing bebop or intentionally trying to outshine an ingenue...Glover's rhythmic tap is the true pulse of Shuffle Along...Clocking in at just shy of three hours, Shuffle Along never feels long -- it's a dazzling production that celebrates art, dreams, and equality.
