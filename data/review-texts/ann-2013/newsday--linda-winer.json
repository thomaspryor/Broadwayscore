  "bwwExcerpt": "Even her defeat by George W. Bush and her cancer, which killed her at 73 in 2006, do not sour her gusto for a fairer government. The production, which already toured Texas, Chicago and Washington, feels primed to get out there on the road again. A 'fresh from Broadway' label can't hurt the marketing. Otherwise, this trip does not feel necessary.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt ends with 'this trip does not feel necessary,' suggesting the critic finds the Broadway production lacking in purpose or impact, despite acknowledging it's tour-ready. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the production lacks necessity and implies it is not a must-see. The mention of a 'fresh from Broadway' label for marketing suggests it might be more about commercial appeal than artistic necessity. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review states the production \"does not feel necessary,\" suggesting a mixed or slightly negative sentiment. Given the limited excerpt, I've placed it in the middle of the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the Broadway run as commercially motivated rather than artistically necessary, suggesting the production is better suited for touring and lacks compelling reason to be on Broadway. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
