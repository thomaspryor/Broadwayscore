  "bwwExcerpt": "Taylor, who often plays snarky WASPs on TV shows like Two and a Half Men, looks almost unrecognizable with her high white perm (dubbed 'Republican hair') and Texas drawl ('I wudn't drinkin' for nothin''). She may be a workmanlike playwright, but as a performer she commands the stage with authority as big as Texas itself. No wonder they call it the Lone Star State.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt focuses entirely on praising Holland Taylor's transformative and commanding performance. However, with only one curated quote available, this may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performer's commanding presence, suggesting a positive view of her performance. However, the text is limited and lacks a full verdict, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on praising the performer's stage presence and authority, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. The single excerpt and lack of overall verdict information lead to a lower confidence score. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers strong praise for Taylor's stage presence ('commands the stage with authority') that outweighs the qualified criticism of her writing. Following single-excerpt protocol for clearly positive curated quotes, assigned upper-range Positive score with reduced confidence due to limited context.",
