Given the single excerpt warning and clear praise for the leads' talents, scoring in upper positive range but with low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performers' abilities to fill a large stage, suggesting a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates that the performers were able to overcome the challenge of a solo show on a large stage, suggesting a positive experience. Given the limited text, a score in the middle of the positive range seems appropriate. | Kimi: Single available excerpt offers clear praise for the performers' ability to command the large Broadway stage, with language ('dynamism,' 'outsize talents') indicating strong approval despite the caveat of limited context.",
