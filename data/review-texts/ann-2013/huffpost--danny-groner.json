  "bwwExcerpt": "The best parts of the show come at the beginning and the end when Taylor is back at the front of the stage, comfortable at the podium, making eyes with the crowd. That's where Richards became most prominent and established herself as a political force. Sure, she needed time to campaign behind the scenes to get voters behind her. But that's the part of politics that's left unseen. We prefer to see our politicians in the spotlight. Otherwise, they look just like the rest of us.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise ('best parts') but implies weakness in the middle sections. With only one curated quote available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights specific strong moments but implies the rest of the show lacks the same impact, suggesting a mixed experience. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The review praises specific moments of the show, but also implies that other parts are less engaging. The excerpt focuses on the beginning and end, suggesting an uneven experience. | Kimi: The reviewer identifies the opening and closing podium scenes as the production's strengths while implicitly criticizing the middle sections depicting behind-the-scenes campaigning as less compelling, indicating an uneven structural experience.",
