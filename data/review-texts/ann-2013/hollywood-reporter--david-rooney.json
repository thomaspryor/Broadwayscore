  "bwwExcerpt": "Taylor’s intention is admirable in shining a spotlight on a woman driven by a heroic passion for public service. But the longer the show runs on, the more its lack of shading becomes apparent. She peppers the dialogue with pandering audience nods to racial and gender equality and gun laws. But she glosses over the potentially juicy stuff such as the dirty politics that tried to keep Richards out of office the first time and succeeded when she ran for a second term. It also might have been interesting to include a wry acknowledgment that Richards’ failed re-election bid gave her the dubious distinction of opening the door to the political career of George W. Bush.",

The performer praise doesn't redeem the overall negative assessment of the theatrical experience. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the lead's performance but criticizes the overall production as lacking in theatrical engagement, suggesting it is not recommended. | Gemini: The review praises the performance but ultimately finds the play lacking as compelling theater, suggesting it's more of a history lesson. This indicates a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging the lead performer's fierce commitment, the critic ultimately judges the show itself to be dry and theatrically inert, offering a clear thumbs-down on the overall experience.",
