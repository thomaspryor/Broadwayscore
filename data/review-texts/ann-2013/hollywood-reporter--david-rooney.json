    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite praising the lead performance ('fierce intelligence and unwavering commitment'), the critic finds the show fundamentally flawed as theater, calling it more like a 'history lesson than compelling theater.' The performer praise doesn't redeem the overall negative assessment of the theatrical experience. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the lead's performance but criticizes the overall production as lacking in theatrical engagement, suggesting it is not recommended. | Gemini: The review praises the performance but ultimately finds the play lacking as compelling theater, suggesting it's more of a history lesson. This indicates a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging the lead performer's fierce commitment, the critic ultimately judges the show itself to be dry and theatrically inert, offering a clear thumbs-down on the overall experience.",
