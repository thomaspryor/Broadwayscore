  "bwwExcerpt": "It’s cliche to say it, but Taylor becomes Ann Richards, mostly thanks to her witty script, and with a nice assist from costume designer Julie Weiss, who’s clothed her in a white, all-business jacket and skirt, with a sparkling Lone Star brooch. The transformation is all the more remarkable for the fact that Taylor only once met Richards, when they were briefly introduced at New York’s Le Cirque in 2004 by the columnist Liz Smith.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising lead performance and creative elements, but limited scope makes overall verdict unclear. Positioned at lower end of Positive range due to excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Taylor's transformation into Ann Richards, highlighting the effectiveness of the script and costume design. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review text suggest a cautious approach, placing it at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Taylor's performance and the script, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt and lack of overall verdict, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performance and script, describing the transformation as 'remarkable.' While clearly positive, the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
