    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies. The text acknowledges flaws (wrong venue size) but praises the lead performance. Mixed assessment with both criticism and praise, but insufficient context for clear verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the performance, indicating it will appeal to a wide audience. However, the mention of a better-suited venue implies some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the theater size issue but praises Taylor's performance, suggesting a positive but qualified recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the venue as ill-suited but strongly praises the lead performance as 'dynamic' and broadly appealing, suggesting a qualified recommendation based on the acting. Score reflects the mildly positive tone of this single curated excerpt.",
