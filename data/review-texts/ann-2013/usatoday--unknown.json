  "bwwExcerpt": "Richards is treated, in other words, much like a sitcom character. Her notable achievements are alluded to -- revitalizing the local economy, reforming the prison system, championing civil and reproductive rights -- but in ways that are both simplistic and pedantic. There's also something slightly patronizing about all the 'y'all's and 'yegods' with which Taylor -- a Yankee, as she admits in her author's notes -- litters her speech.",
