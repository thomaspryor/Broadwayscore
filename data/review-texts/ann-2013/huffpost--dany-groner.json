  "bwwExcerpt": "The best parts of the show come at the beginning and the end when Taylor is back at the front of the stage, comfortable at the podium, making eyes with the crowd. That's where Richards became most prominent and established herself as a political force. Sure, she needed time to campaign behind the scenes to get voters behind her. But that's the part of politics that's left unseen. We prefer to see our politicians in the spotlight. Otherwise, they look just like the rest of us.",

Praises specific elements but implies structural issues with pacing and focus. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights specific strong moments but implies the middle part of the show is less engaging. The focus on the beginning and end suggests a mixed experience overall. | Gemini: The review highlights the beginning and end as the best parts, suggesting the middle is less engaging. The overall sentiment is mixed, with some positive aspects but not a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise highlighting specific strong portions (beginning and end) while implying middle sections are less compelling. Single excerpt availability necessitates low confidence and lower-end Positive score.",
