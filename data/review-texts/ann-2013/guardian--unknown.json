  "fullText": "Cort Theater, New YorkAR Gurney play about a middle-aged man who falls in love with a mutt might be a shaggy dog story, but Matthew Broderick and his co-star make it sing – or howl Will someone please give Annaleigh Ashford a biscuit? After a star-making supporting turn in Kinky Boots and a Tony-winning stint as a would-be ballerina in You Can’t Take it With You, Ashford finally takes the stage in a lead role. And she does it on all fours. Ashford plays the title character in AR Gurney’s Sylvia, a comedy as predictable as it is indestructible. Sylvia is a winsome stray whom dreamy banker Greg (Matthew Broderick) finds lolloping in New York’s Central Park. In an innocuous answer to a midlife crisis, he brings Sylvia home, much to the displeasure of his wife, Kate (Julie White), an English teacher who is done with dogs. And shouldn’t we be done with plays like Sylvia? It is antiquated, it is self-congratulatory, it is conservative in both form and content with its focus on the non-problems of upper-middle-class white New Yorkers. (Sylvia is white, too, or perhaps golden.) But if you have ever loved a pet, it is almost impossible not to feel moved by the interspecies romance of Greg and Sylvia or to tear up when they sing Every Time We Say Goodbye. (Kate joins in, too.) The schtick of the play is that Greg and Kate, like all pet owners, anthropomorphise their animal. They speak to Sylvia like a person and they imagine her responses as more or less logical and grammatical. Dressed in a fuzzy sweater, Daisy Dukes, a velour bodysuit, and a collar, her jumble of blond hair spilling to her shoulders, she looks less like a dog than like some bridge-and-tunnel teen on a tear. And her acting isn’t particularly doggy either, although there’s a way she tosses her head that does suggest the canine. But there’s something sunshiny and genuinely irrepressible about her that transcends any species categories. (And which also serves to make Kate seem like a real pill.) How could anyone not love Sylvia? Especially when she says, “Excuse me, I have to check my messages,” and then hunkers down, nose to the ground, sniffing exuberantly. Sylvia was written in 1995, so that makes it pretty old in dog years. The director Daniel Sullivan can’t teach it many new tricks, but he can give it a typically adroit and able production. Broderick, who sometimes underplays his roles, is a glove-like fit for the moony, diffident Greg. White plays Kate as tightly wound, but not entirely unsympathetic and she allows herself a few moments to showcase the daffiness she otherwise keeps buttoned up and belted in. Robert Sella, in a variety of roles, oversells his punchlines, but he still has a way of making them very funny. But make no mistake, it’s Ashford’s play. There is no curbing this dog. We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could support the Guardian at this crucial time for journalism in the US. In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year into his second term, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one. From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump returned to office. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced. While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts. While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel. Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less. But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, we’ll show you far fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you for protecting the free press.",

The positive elements outweigh the criticisms. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the play's flaws but ultimately suggests it's moving for pet lovers, making it a positive but not rave review. The text is also followed by a request for support, which may have truncated the review. | Kimi: While criticizing the play itself as antiquated and predictable, the reviewer delivers a clear recommendation based on Annaleigh Ashford's irrepressible star turn and the production's emotional resonance for pet owners.",
