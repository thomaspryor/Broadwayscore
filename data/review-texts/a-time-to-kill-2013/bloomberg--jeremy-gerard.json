However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt limitation and truncated text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'satisfying' courtroom drama with an 'engaging cast', indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review describes the play as a \"satisfying\" courtroom drama with an \"engaging cast.\" The phrase \"if unsettling\" suggests some reservations, but overall the tone is positive. Given the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
