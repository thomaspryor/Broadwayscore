  "bwwExcerpt": "The audience becomes the jury in A Time To Kill, Rupert Holmes' by-the-numbers stage adaptation of John Grisham's page-turning 1989 debut novel. But unlike the workings of a real jury, there's no room for ambiguity, moral complexity or startling insight in this formulaic courtroom drama about institutionalized racism in the Deep South, in which every liberal-pandering response has been hardwired into the dated material. Sturdy ensemble acting and Grisham's compelling storytelling make this go down easily, but the production provides little persuasive evidence that the thriller needed to become a play.",
  "bwwScore": 5
