However, this is only a single excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show as a 'mechanical legal procedural' that fails to stand out against TV competition, suggesting a negative view. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt compares the show unfavorably to TV and calls it \"mechanical.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring in the negative range with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic delivers a clear negative verdict by calling the show 'mechanical' and stating it fails to surpass television procedurals, while comparing it unfavorably to the movie ('blurry lens'). Despite limited context from a single excerpt, the evaluative language indicates a recommendation against attendance.",
