However, confidence is low due to truncated text that cuts off mid-sentence when mentioning 'talented cast' and 'standouts.' | GPT-4o: The excerpt advises to 'save your money,' suggesting a negative recommendation despite acknowledging a talented cast. The lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review starts with \"Save your money,\" which is a clear indication of a negative recommendation. The truncated text makes it difficult to assess the full extent of the negativity, but the initial statement is strong enough to place it in the negative bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly advises readers to save their money rather than purchase tickets, despite acknowledging the cast's talents, indicating a negative overall assessment.",
