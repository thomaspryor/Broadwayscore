  "bwwExcerpt": "It's the glory of courtroom melodrama that all kinds of flaws can be overlooked if the story is tense and dramatic, with juicy revelations and legal fireworks. But this production has all the snap of a plate of overcooked linguine. There are a couple of trial tricks, as Jake tries to get Hailey acquitted with an insanity defense, but the evening mostly just bumbles tediously along.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic directly criticizes the production as having no energy ('snap of overcooked linguine') and calls it tedious. Despite acknowledging the potential of courtroom drama, finds this execution severely lacking. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the production for lacking tension and drama, describing it as tedious and unimpressive. The negative tone suggests a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"flaws\", \"tediously\", and compares the production to \"overcooked linguine\", indicating a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic describes the production as tedious and lacking tension, using the vivid metaphor of 'overcooked linguine' to convey its dramatic flaccidity. With no positive qualities mentioned in the excerpt and explicit criticism of the pacing ('bumbles tediously along'), the review clearly does not recommend the show.",
