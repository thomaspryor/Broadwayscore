However, with only one curated quote available, the overall review sentiment is unclear, warranting lower-end Positive scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances, particularly Thompson's portrayal, indicating a positive view of the acting. However, the limited text and single excerpt warning suggest caution, leading to a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Thompson's performance and describes the character as \"richly human.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the lower end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performances, particularly Thompson's nuanced portrayal, though the limited scope prevents a full assessment of the production.",
