Single excerpt warning noted but language is unambiguously negative. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the adaptation and staging, suggesting a negative view. However, with only one excerpt, the full context is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt clearly states that the production is \"hobbled\" by the adaptation and staging, indicating a negative assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the negative sentiment is clear. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains unambiguous negative verdict: 'hobbled,' 'pedestrian,' and unfavorable comparison to television indicate the critic does not recommend the production. Score reflects clear criticism while acknowledging limited context.",
