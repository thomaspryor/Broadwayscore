    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The text is heavily truncated with only the opening setup available. The critic calls it 'quaint' but explicitly states this 'is not necessarily a bad thing,' suggesting neutral to mildly positive assessment. However, without the full review and verdict, confidence is very low. | Gemini: The review uses the word \"quaint\" to describe the show, which is neither positive nor negative. The truncated text makes it difficult to determine a clear recommendation. | Kimi: The critic labels the show 'quaint'—damning with faint praise—while acknowledging this isn't inherently negative. The truncated text cuts off before any clear verdict, but the tone suggests mild tolerance rather than enthusiasm. The comparison to the more intense source material implies disappointment in the stage version's toned-down approach.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "the producers of 'A Time to Kill' have lavished Holmes' play with an old-fashioned cast of players, numbering no fewer than 17 actors. Too bad that huge cast doesn't have a vintage story to tell, because when you strip Grisham's panoramic tale of racism and injustice in a small Mississippi city down to a courtroom drama, there really isn't much of a trial at the heart of it...Under Ethan McSweeny's direction at the Golden Theater, only John Douglas Thompson, Tonya Pinkins as his supportive wife and Patrick Page as the smarmy prosecutor (the Spacey role) are able to tweak this character dross into star turns. In his Broadway debut, Tom Skerritt keeps entering and exiting like a lost ghost in white hair and designer David C. Wollards's equally bleached-out linens.",
