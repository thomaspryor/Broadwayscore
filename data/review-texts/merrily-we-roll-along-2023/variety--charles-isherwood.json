    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt uses superlative praise ('ravishing') and suggests this is the ideal production ('perfect moment'). However, confidence is low due to limited text - this could be cherry-picked from a more qualified review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('ravishing revival') and suggests the show has reached its 'perfect moment,' indicating a highly favorable view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the word \"ravishing\" to describe the revival, indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic, unqualified praise ('ravishing,' 'perfect moment'), but as a single curated quote that may be cherry-picked, the score is capped at the upper end of the Positive range per guidelines.",
