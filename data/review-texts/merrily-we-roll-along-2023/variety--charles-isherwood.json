    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The word 'ravishing' is strong praise, and calling it the 'perfect moment' for the show suggests high enthusiasm. However, single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked from a longer review with more reservations. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly positive language ('ravishing revival') and suggests the show has reached its 'perfect moment', indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is set to low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"ravishing\" to describe the revival, which indicates a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, I am placing the score towards the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise using words like 'ravishing' and 'perfect moment,' suggesting a strong endorsement of this revival, though as a single curated quote, the full context of the review remains unknown.",
