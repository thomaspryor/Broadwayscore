  "fullText": "For the entirety of the almost two hour and forty five minute run time, all 970 audience members seated at the Hudson Theatre for Merrily We Roll Along are quietly attentive as they behold a true Sondheim classic, reborn.",
  "isFullReview": false,
  "bwwExcerpt": "Further, it's hard to go wrong when you have Daniel Radcliffe, Jonathan Groff, and Lindsay Mendez above the title. The heart of the show lies with this trio whose genuine connection and truth shines out across the Hudson stage eight times a week. Groff, who has the charisma down pat, dazzles as Frank. When paired with Radcliffe’s Charley, filled with loveable charm, and Mendez’s Mary who is utterly gut-wrenching to watch as her true love slips away, this trio equals Broadway perfection.",
