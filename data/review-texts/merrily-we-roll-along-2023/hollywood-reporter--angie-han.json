    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('revelation', 'sparkles with possibility') suggests enthusiastic recommendation, but confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - full review verdict unknown. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('revelation', 'sparkles with possibility') indicating a transformative and highly successful production. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a rave review. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, calling the production a \"revelation\" and saying it \"sparkles with possibility.\" Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the language suggests a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic uses superlative language ('revelation,' 'sparkles with possibility') to praise the production's transformation of a previously failed work, indicating strong enthusiasm. However, as a single curated excerpt, the overall verdict may not be fully represented.",
