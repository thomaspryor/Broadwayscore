    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt describes 'unmitigated joy' and 'ecstatic' moments in Act Two, suggesting positive sentiment. However, with only one brief excerpt available, confidence is low and this could be cherry-picked praise from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a positive moment in the show, describing a song as 'unmitigated joy' and 'ecstatic'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment is uncertain, warranting a low confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt describes a joyful and ecstatic moment in Act Two, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the limited context and truncated nature of the text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic language ('unmitigated joy', 'ecstatic') to praise a specific musical number, indicating a clearly positive response to this portion of the production, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the overall verdict.",
