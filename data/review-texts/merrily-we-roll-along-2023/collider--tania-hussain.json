  "bwwExcerpt": "Filmed at the Hudson Theatre in New York during its two-year run from 2023 to 2024, Merrily We Roll Along — starring Jonathan Groff, Lindsay Mendez, and Daniel Radcliffe — has a magnetic ease to its production. While the camera softens some of the rougher edges that once made the show a harder sell in 1981, it doesn’t do away with its former critical elements.\"",
