  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Much like Hamilton on Disney+ or Spike Lee’s filmed version of the brilliant Passing Strange, the big screen Merrily We Roll Along is simply a live recording of the Broadway show. It was shot at the Hudson Theater in June 2024 with Friedman, who directs the filmed version as well, adding cutaways to hide edits, judiciously chosen close-ups to direct our eye, and also the rare shot that looks a little too artfully blocked for the camera.\"",
