  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Usually in directly filmed stage productions the audience figures more heavily, but Friedman’s approach here is far more cinematic than just getting a filmed record of a theatrical performance. What she achieves with her cast is an intimacy I have never experienced in any of the productions of this legendary musical I have seen over the years, and indeed it is that intimate nature of Merrily We Roll Along that makes this a perfect candidate for this kind of presentation.\"",
