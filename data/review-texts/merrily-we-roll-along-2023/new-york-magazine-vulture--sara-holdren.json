It even adds a faint glimmer of something resembling hope...With their irresistible energy and chemistry, Mendez, Groff, and Radcliffe lift ’Merrily’ up, yet keep it grounded with real, apparent affection and emotional heft. They are the ones reviving the play, by revealing and jump-starting its heart.”",
