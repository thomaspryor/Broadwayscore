  "bwwExcerpt": "\"But this production isn’t exactly perfect either. And where it disappoints is in how Friedman’s staging is captured on film. Sam Levy’s cinematography features far too many close-ups and quick cuts. Not once do we even see the theatre’s proscenium arch in its entirety. It’s as if Friedman and Levy want to pretend that this production wasn’t originally a stage musical.\"",
