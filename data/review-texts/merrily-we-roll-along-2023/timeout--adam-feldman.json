  "bwwExcerpt": "Merrily We Roll Along is the femme fatale of Stephen Sondheim musicals, beautiful and troubled; people keep thinking they can fix it, rescue it, save it from itself and make it their own. In the decades since its disastrous 1981 premiere on Broadway, where it lasted just two weeks, the show has been revised and revived many times (including by the York in 1994, Encores! in 2012 and Fiasco in 2019). The challenges of Merrily are built into its core in a way that no production can fully overcome. ",

Forecast models are currently toying with big numbers for the New York City area as a sprawling winter storm barrels toward the East Coast this weekend. Depending on which model you trust (and that’s a big caveat), the city could see anywhere from a few inches to something much more headline-worthy, with early projections ranging from roughly 3 to 12 inches across the five boroughs. Some forecasts for the broader tri-state area go even higher. The storm’s track is driving the uncertainty. A slight shift north or south will determine whether New York gets hours of fluffy snow or whether warmer air sneaks in, turning part of the event into a messy mix of sleet and freezing rain, especially closer to the coast. When will it snow in New York? Here’s what does seem consistent across forecasts: timing. Snow is expected to start early Sunday, intensify through Sunday afternoon and evening and taper off late Sunday night into Monday. Even if totals end up on the lower end, the storm’s peak coincides with the worst possible window for travel and forecasters are already warning that Monday morning could be rough. How much snow will fall? City officials are preparing for a wide range of outcomes. Mayor Zohran Mamdani said the city is planning for up to a foot of snow, with pre-treatment of streets beginning Friday. About 2,000 sanitation workers will shift to 12-hour...These 7 new restaurants in New York were just voted the most beautiful in AmericaEatingPhotograph: Courtesy of Quality BrandedNew York has never been short on places that look good on camera but, this year, the city is officially cleaning up in the design Olympics. Robb Report just dropped a new national ranking of the most beautiful new restaurants in America and seven New York City spots made the cut, proving, once again, that dinner is rarely just about what’s on the plate. From moody supper clubs to sun-splashed atriums, these are the restaurants turning meals into full-on visual experiences. Leading the aesthetic charge is Cafe Zaffri, a downtown stunner tucked inside a historic building once tied to Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt’s home for ambitious women. Today, it features soaring atrium light, layered textures and design details that are both old-world and theatrical, like you accidentally wandered into the best scene of a period drama. In Tribeca, Huso takes the opposite approach, dialing things way down with a serene palette of oak, cream and gray that feels more like a spa retreat. Curved corners, deep blue banquettes and carefully placed art, including pieces by Keith Haring, make it one of those spaces that instantly lowers your blood pressure as you walk in. Also in Tribeca, Musaafer NYC goes big with lotus-flower chandeliers, mother-of-pearl inlays, hand-painted panels and a dining room inspired by India’s iconic palaces. Brooklyn gets its own glow-up with ABC Kitchens, Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s first foray into the borough. The room has airy modern vibes with one serious...New York, it's only going to get colder out there todayThings to doCity LifePhotograph: ShutterstockIf today feels brutally cold, that’s because it is and, unfortunately, it’s also the coldest weekday of the stretch. Tuesday delivers peak midwinter energy across New York City, with plenty of sunshine and almost no moderation. Highs are hovering near 25 degrees, while morning lows dipped into the mid-teens. The sun is out today, but it’s purely decorative since a steady west wind is knocking a few extra degrees off the actual feel. Tonight will stay clear and sharply cold, with temperatures falling back toward the mid-teens. Any leftover moisture on sidewalks or side streets will freeze quickly, so expect slick patches, particularly on bridges, on-ramps and shaded areas that never really see the sun. Wednesday will climb into the upper 30s under increasing cloud cover, followed by Thursday, which will hover near 40 degrees. It’s not warm by any stretch but, after today, it will feel merciful. These two days offer the most manageable conditions for errands, longer walks and anything that doesn’t involve sitting in front of your radiator. By Friday, temperatures dip again toward freezing, setting the stage for another hard reset. Saturday brings the cold roaring back. Highs are expected to stall in the upper teens, with overnight lows near 11 degrees, making it one of the most brutally cold days of the forecast period. If you’re making weekend plans, outdoor time should be limited. What this means for real life: today and this weekend are the days to respect.

The 60,000-square-foot expansion, designed by OMA’s Shohei Shigematsu and Rem Koolhaas in collaboration with Cooper Robertson, doubles the museum’s gallery space and gives the Bowery icon a major glow-up. The new addition slips in right next to the existing SANAA-designed building, bringing a larger Sky Room, a new 74-seat forum for talks and screenings and a street-level entrance plaza that finally gives the museum some breathing room. Rendering: Courtesy OMA/bloomimages.de Inside, the reopening exhibition, \"New Humans: Memories of the Future,\" takes over the entire expanded building with work by more than 200 artists, writers, scientists and filmmakers, exploring how technology and social change keep reshaping what it means to be human. There’s a mix of contemporary heavy-hitters like Hito Steyerl, Wangechi Mutu and Anicka Yi alongside 20th-century visionaries including Salvador Dalí, Hannah Höch and H.R. Giger. There are also new site-specific commissions, like a façade work by Tschabalala Self and a monumental sculpture by Klára Hosnedlová. As part of the reopening, the museum is debuting its first full-service restaurant, run by the Oberon Group and led by chef Julia Sherman, plus a doubled-in-size store packed with artist-made objects you can browse without even buying a ticket. ...These are the 10 most in-demand NYC neighborhoods according to StreetEasyThings to doCity LifePhotograph: ShutterstockNew Yorkers never stop window-shopping for their next neighborhood—and StreetEasy just revealed where everyone’s looking. The real estate site’s new list of Neighborhoods to Watch in 2026 tracks the biggest year-over-year jumps in searches from buyers and renters and, perhaps not surprisingly, the results read a downtown love letter to downtown convenience with a dash of outer-borough value. The Financial District topped the list, seeing searches surge nearly 47 percent. Once known mainly for suits and salad bars, FiDi’s ongoing shift toward residential life is clearly catching on. Median rents now hover around $4,690, with asking prices just under $1.2 million, making it one of the borough’s more comparatively attainable zones, at least by Manhattan standards. Right behind it is the East Village, where interest jumped 45.8 percent as renters, in particular, leaned back into one of the city’s most storied neighborhoods. Rents climbed fast here—up more than 13 percent year over year—but the area’s mix of nightlife, culture and classic walk-ups still lures plenty in. Brooklyn, of course, makes a strong showing with Windsor Terrace in third place. Searches there jumped almost 45 percent, thanks to its sweet spot between Prospect Park calm and Park Slope energy, just without the Park Slope prices. Carroll Gardens, Downtown Brooklyn and Fort Greene also land in the top 10, showcasing how important to trifecta of space, greenery and strong transit. Sunnyside, Queens, ranks as...This NYC night market is the 7th most popular in the world according to a new studyTravelTransport & TravelTime Out/Ali GarberExploring the food scene in Queens is like taking a culinary world tour in a single neighborhood. So it's no surprise that the Queens Night Market ranked among the world’s best night markets in a new study compiled by long-haul travel specialists Travelbag. The report looked at at safety, online buzz, search demand and real-world reviews of night markets around the world to come up with the ranking. The Queens Night Market stands out as the highest-ranked market in New York and one of only two in the U.S. to make the top ten list. Held seasonally in Flushing Meadows Corona Park, it’s a weekly celebration of Queens at its best. From Tibetan momos to Salvadoran pupusas, Nigerian suyato Colombian arepas and sweet treats from Thailand and Trinidad, it's a certified global feast. Prices are famously low, which keeps things accessible and encourages adventurous ordering. According to the study, Queens Night Market racks up around 74,000 monthly searches and boasts a strong average rating of 4.6. Its nighttime safety score of 68 makes it a comfortable place to linger, while TikTok reveals thousands of posts showing first bites, food hauls and dancing crowds. The market also features live music, performances and local artists. At the top of the global ranking sits Bangkok’s Chatuchak Weekend Market, a giant by any measure with more than 15,000 stalls. Pub Street in Siem Reap takes second place and Jodd Fairs Night Market, known for its modern spin on Thai street food and viral...This popular London lunch spot just opened its first-ever U.S. location in NYCEatingPhotograph: Courtesy of Farmer JMidtown just got a serious lunch upgrade and London’s cult-favorite Farmer J is the one making it happen. After a buzzy opening celebration this week, the fast-casual spot beloved across the pond for its farm-to-fork Fieldtrays has officially opened its first-ever U.S. location at 31 W. 52nd Street, right in the heart of Rockefeller Center territory. Founded in London in 2014, Farmer J built its reputation on serving real, cooked-from-scratch food at the speed of a quick lunch run. The signature order is the Fieldtray, a choose-your-own combo of a base, a hot main and two seasonal sides, that changes regularly to keep things interesting. The veg-forward options feel like food that came from a restaurant kitchen, not a sad desk drawer. The brand has long been a go-to for busy Londoners who want better than a chain salad without committing to a sit-down lunch. It’s also quietly earned a fan base among celebrities like Harry Styles and Dua Lipa, but the real draw here is how well it fits New York’s midday reality: fast, flavorful and actually filling. “Over a decade ago, I sat at my desk and was fed up with lunch options around my office. I sought to upgrade the boring, sad deli sandwich for healthy, tasty food that I could easily grab and bring with me,” explained co-founder Jonathan Recanati in an official statement. “Thus, Farmer J was born. We have expanded this vision across London and are planting new roots in the U.S. to revolutionize the lunch scene with always fresh...The best things to order at NYC Restaurant Week’s top spots for winter 2026Photograph: Courtesy of Carl TimponeNew York City Restaurant Week’s winter edition is back!

Luckily, we've thumbed through the list and highlighted the top options to snag that reservation. Check out the best places to visit and everything to order during NYC Restaurant Week this winter. Updated January 2026: The beginning of the year can spell a slump for restaurants, as most of us have fallen into hibernation, particularly after the holiday spending period.

As of January 7, Restaurant Week reservations are now live at over 580 restaurants, all boroughs included.

We also removed a few places that are not participating this year, as well as a few restaurants whose menus are not yet live, including The Fulton, Gage & Tollner, Gui Steakhouse and Nudibranch.
