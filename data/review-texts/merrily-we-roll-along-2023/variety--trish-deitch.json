  "fullText": "Commercial theater — theater written mostly to entertain audiences, for the purpose of making money — is the enemy in Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's 1981 musical, \"Merrily We Roll Along,\" now on Broadway at the Hudson Theatre. According to \"Merrily,\" it's theater that doesn't sacrifice its profundity to make it easy on audiences that has any real value at all. But if commercial theater is the enemy, then it's not surprising that \"Merrily We Roll Along\" flopped after 16 performances on Broadway in 1981: It's not a show written to easily entertain.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "“What makes the musical hard for first-time audiences is the fact that it’s like a jigsaw puzzle doled out one piece at a time, so you don’t see a complete picture until the last piece is placed and the show is over...That’s why ‘Merrily We Roll Along’ is art and not comfortably commercial theater.”",
