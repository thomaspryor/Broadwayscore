    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for Radcliffe's performance with superlatives like 'absolute marvel' and 'emotional bombshell,' but single excerpt warning applies - confident positive language suggests upper end of Positive bucket despite limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for Radcliffe's performance, describing it as 'an absolute marvel' and anticipating a standing ovation, which suggests a highly positive reception. However, the single excerpt warning indicates that this may not fully represent the review, leading to low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt contains high praise for Radcliffe's performance, calling it an 'absolute marvel' and an 'emotional bombshell'. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper range of positive. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
