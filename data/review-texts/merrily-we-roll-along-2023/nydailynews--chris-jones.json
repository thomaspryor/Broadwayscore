However, given this is only one curated excerpt, I score conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the current production as improved and highlights its deepened intimacy, suggesting a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the positive range. | Gemini: The review states the show is \"even better\", indicating a positive sentiment. However, due to the limited text and single excerpt, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range.",
