  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Combining three live shows with audience-free tapings, Merrily straddles the line between stage and film production. Friedman carefully guides our eyes with closeups that omit much of the action outside of the frame. The camera moves with the actors, and only occasionally allows the applause or reaction of the audience to bleed through.\"",
