    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with positive descriptors ('lighthearted and fun') but 'stereotypically' could imply formulaic. Given single excerpt limitation and potential mixed signals, scored at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'lighthearted and fun,' which suggests a positive experience, though the single excerpt limits confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as \"lighthearted and fun,\" which suggests a positive, though possibly qualified, recommendation. Given the single excerpt and the warning, I've scored it in the middle of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise describing the show as enjoyable, though the brevity of the available text and moderate enthusiasm ('fun' rather than 'superb') warrant a lower-positive score and low confidence.",
