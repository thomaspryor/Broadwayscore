    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Explicit 'must-see' language with urgent recommendation ('don't let another day go by') and praise for the production as working 'splendidly' with 'equally brilliant' performances. Despite being a single excerpt, the language is unambiguously enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong language ('must-see production') indicating an enthusiastic recommendation. Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone suggests a rave review. | Gemini: The phrase \"must-see production\" indicates a rave review. The additional praise of the co-stars further supports this classification. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains enthusiastic praise ('splendidly', 'brilliant') and an explicit 'must-see' recommendation, but limited context requires cautious scoring in the upper Positive range per excerpt guidelines.",
