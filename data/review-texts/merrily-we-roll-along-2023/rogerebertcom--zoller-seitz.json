  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Visually, things get tighter and more elegant as the story moves from the 1970s into the ‘60s and ‘50s. The narrative focus tightens as the number of significant characters shrinks, allowing the crew to devote more time and thought to each image. The fewer bodies onstage, the sharper the filmmaking becomes.\"",
