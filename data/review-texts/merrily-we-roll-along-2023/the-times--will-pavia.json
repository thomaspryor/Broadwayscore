He talks like a machinegun, he makes you laugh, he belts out a jazzy chorus, he fills the stage and he never leaves his chair. It’s the greatest thing in the show.\n\nThe night I saw it, as he sat there afterwards, his chest heaving, there was a long and rapturous ovation and I heard an incredulous lady in my row say: “My God, he’s gonna win a Tony.”\n\nRadcliffe made his debut on Broadway in Equus in 2008. For those of you wondering if he can sing, in this show he acquits himself in all respects. (In the programme he thanks his singing teacher). In fact he steals the show.\n\nMerrily, which Stephen Sondheim wrote with George Furth, was a flop when it first opened in 1981. It tells the story of three friends: a composer, Frank, a playwright, Charley, and Mary, a novelist, who meet as bright-eyed young things on a Manhattan rooftop, who find success, and who fall apart as the composer abandons them for an empty life as a big-shot Hollywood producer. The story is told in reverse, beginning with the characters at 40, and winding back scene by scene from 1976 to 1955, when they were young.\n\nThe British director Maria Friedman is credited with fixing Merrily, making it a West End smash in 2013 and now getting it back, at long last, to Broadway. Friedman’s fix was to focus on the friendship at the heart of the piece. Jonathan Groff as Frank, the composer, Radcliffe, as Charley, and Lindsay Mendez, as Mary, have an obvious chemistry: you immediately believe that they really like each other, even though the first time you see them they are falling apart.\n\nMerrily is still rather perverse in this way. The first time you see Frank’s first wife, Beth, for instance, she is beating the floor and weeping and singing her big number about how he has betrayed her. The audience is expected to engage with this, even though they still have no idea who she is.\n\nBut this Broadway show is so beautifully produced, so full of zippy lines and outrageous Seventies and Sixties costumes, that you are distracted and seduced. When you get back to 1960 there’s a wonderfully funny number about the Kennedy family that would do very well on TikTok.\n\nAnd there is Radcliffe. He told Variety recently that he loved Broadway because it was “the first place that I felt like I could become an actor and not just Harry Potter’’. But every audience he delights cannot help but recall that they knew him first as a teenager, in those films that cannot be named.\n\nIn Merrily you see him in the final scene as a fresh-faced young man in a dressing gown and striped pyjamas, sitting on the rooftop with his whole life in front of him, the stage lights glinting off his spectacles. His past, his present and his future are there in front of you.To March 24, 2024, merrilyonbroadway.com\n\nFollow @timesculture on Twitter to read the latest reviews",
