  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Guess again. The revival of Friedrich Schiller's 1800 play \"Mary Stuart,\" which opened Sunday at the Broadhurst Theatre, is vibrant, audacious and, as the plots are hatched that will send Mary to the gallows, improbably funny. This alchemy is the result of a charged and witty adaptation by Peter Oswald, imaginative direction by Phyllida Lloyd and glorious performances by Janet McTeer (Mary) and Harriet Walter (Elizabeth).\"",
