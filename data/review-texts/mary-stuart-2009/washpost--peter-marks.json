The critic acknowledges the source material is 'creaky' but finds the production 'surprisingly vital' due to the performances. | GPT-4o: The review praises the performances of the lead actors for revitalizing the play, indicating a positive recommendation. However, the mention of 'somewhat creaky' suggests some reservations about the material itself. | Gemini: The review praises the performances of the leads, stating they make the play feel surprisingly vital despite its age. This indicates a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers enthusiastic praise for the lead actresses' performances, noting they overcome the dated source material to create vital theater, resulting in a solid recommendation despite acknowledging the play's structural limitations.",
