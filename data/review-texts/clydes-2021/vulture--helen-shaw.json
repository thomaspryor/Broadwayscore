However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt compares Clyde's to Sweat, highlighting contrasting qualities. It doesn't offer a clear recommendation, suggesting a mixed or neutral stance. Given only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt favorably contrasts Clyde's with Sweat, praising its concise length, buoyant tone, and atmospheric quality as offering a 'hopeful' theatrical experience, indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited context.",
