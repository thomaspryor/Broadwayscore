  "dtliExcerpt": "A boss who spends their life berating their employees instead of tending to the business is one with something to hide, and not much to show for it. In Clyde’s, a new play by Lynn Nottage which just opened at the Hayes Theater, this infernal chief is played with irresistible gusto by Uzo Aduba. With sketchy gambling ties and a passion for making her employees’ life hell, she runs her titular roadside sandwich shop with a punishing fist, always ready to swing should any backtalk arise. This funny, poignant production by 2nd Stage Theater matches her commanding wit, even if Aduba’s magnetic performance takes a kitchen knife to her vaguely undercooked character.",
