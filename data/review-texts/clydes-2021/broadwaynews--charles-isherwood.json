However, this is only an excerpt, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt describes the play as 'lively and funny,' suggesting a positive tone, but also notes it can be 'ham-handed,' indicating some reservations. The lack of full context limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the play as \"lively and funny\" but also \"ham-handed.\" This suggests a positive but qualified recommendation. Confidence is low due to the truncated text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise ('lively and funny,' 'symbol of redemption') with only a playful caveat about heavy-handedness, indicating a positive recommendation. Confidence is low due to limited excerpt availability.",
