However, confidence is medium due to very brief excerpt that may not capture full verdict. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"small miracle of empathy\" and \"profound meditation\", indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: Though brief, the excerpt uses unequivocal superlatives ('small miracle', 'profound meditation') to praise the play's empathetic storytelling and thematic resonance, indicating an enthusiastic, unqualified recommendation.",
