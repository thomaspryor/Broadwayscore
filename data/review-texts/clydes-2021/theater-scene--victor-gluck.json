In plays like her Pulitzer Prize-winning Ruined and Sweat she dazzled with the big panorama; in her recent plays like Mlima’s Tale she dealt with one theme. In her latest Broadway play, Clyde’s, now at The Helen Hayes Theater in a production by The Second Stage Theater, she writes a very entertaining and satisfying comedy-drama about the rehabilitation of formerly incarcerated people now working in the kitchen of a roadside sandwich shop. \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic describes the play as 'very entertaining and satisfying,' which is clear praise. However, this is only a curated excerpt that cuts off mid-sentence, so confidence is low despite the positive language. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as 'very entertaining and satisfying,' indicating a positive review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low and the score is placed at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt calls the play \"very entertaining and satisfying,\" which indicates a positive review. However, it is only a single excerpt, so confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise ('very entertaining and satisfying') for this Broadway production, warranting a score in the upper Positive range. However, confidence is low due to the single truncated excerpt format, which may not capture the full critical verdict.",
