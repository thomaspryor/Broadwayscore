The tone is dismissive and suggests the show is not worth seeing. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the play is a 'royal pain,' indicating a negative assessment and a lack of recommendation. | Kimi: The critic explicitly calls the show a 'royal pain,' indicating a negative viewing experience, though the extreme brevity of the excerpt necessitates low confidence.",
