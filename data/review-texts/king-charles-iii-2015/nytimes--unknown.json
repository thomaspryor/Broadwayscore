Any echoes you may infer regarding a certain Danish prince are entirely appropriate to this dazzlingly presumptuous drama...Directed with fiery wit and rushing momentum by Rupert Goold...What could have been only a cleverly executed stunt is instead an intellectually and emotionally gripping study of the strangely enduring anachronism that is the British monarchy.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong superlatives ('flat-out brilliant', 'dazzlingly presumptuous', 'fiery wit') with no reservations expressed. Uses 'blazed open' suggesting excitement, calls it 'intellectually and emotionally gripping'. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as 'flat-out brilliant', 'dazzlingly presumptuous drama', and 'intellectually and emotionally gripping', indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"flat-out brilliant\", \"dazzlingly presumptuous\", \"fiery wit\", and \"intellectually and emotionally gripping\". Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it high positive with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise with superlatives like 'flat-out brilliant' and 'intellectually gripping,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, the score is capped at the upper end of the Positive range per scoring guidelines. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
