However, the lack of superlatives or strong enthusiasm keeps it from being a rave. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"absorbing\" and \"intelligent\" and praises the treatment of the characters, indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers unqualified praise for the show's intelligence and dramatic quality, describing it as absorbing and treating characters with dignity. While the tone is clearly recommending, the brevity of this excerpt limits certainty about the overall verdict strength.",
