However, the praise is somewhat qualified, suggesting a solid but not enthusiastic endorsement. | Gemini: The review calls the play \"fascinating and largely successful,\" indicating a positive recommendation, but the qualification that it \"works best when it focuses on the personal drama\" suggests some reservations. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise, calling the show a 'fascinating and largely successful experiment' while noting it only 'works best' in specific portions, suggesting a solid but not unreserved recommendation.",
