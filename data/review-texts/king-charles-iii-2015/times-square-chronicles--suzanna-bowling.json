  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Mike Bartlett’s 'King Charles III' is like an adult fantasy done Dr. Seuss style (iambic pentameter) with a plot that makes no sense…This whole cast is simply marvelous…Maybe, I am not so mesmerized by the Brits, especially Charles. Maybe, if I was going to hear iambic pentameter, I’d rather read the book. Maybe, the King has no clothes and I just can’t buy the Kool-Aid.”\n\nRead more",
