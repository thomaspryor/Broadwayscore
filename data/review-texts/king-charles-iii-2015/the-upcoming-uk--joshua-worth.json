  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The dialogue is rich and complex throughout, with moments of grand, Elizabethan drama and thoughtful soliloquies. It’s brilliant. It’s funny too. No character is good or evil, and the play’s refusal to cast judgment on such divisive material is to its strength. 'King Charles III' is a rare thing: a play that’s tackles a controversial subject without being hectoring or dogmatic. If you only see one play next year, make it this one.\"\n\nRead more",
