  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Mike Bartlett’s 'King Charles III' has what sounds like an ideal formal device up his sleeve. He has written this self-styled “future history play” in blank verse, thereby echoing Shakespeare’s history plays about past kings. Too bad, therefore, that his execution and Rupert Goold’s production are only fitfully as strong as the play’s headline-grabbing concept...A plodding approach to exposition — all talk, no action — and overly explanatory dialogue bedevils much of the lengthy and slack first half...The shorter second half, in which the dramatic means are overtaken by plot machinations, is far more successful.\"\n\nRead more",
