  "bwwExcerpt": "The production, under the immaculate, tightly focused direction of Michael Grandage, comes from London's Donmar Warehouse, where Grandage is artistic director. Grandage allows Rothko's barbed, brutish yet often insightful comments on art to unfold with a theatrical flair that educates as well as entertains. After experiencing 'Red,' 'What do you see?' is a question audiences will be able to answer with enormous satisfaction.",
