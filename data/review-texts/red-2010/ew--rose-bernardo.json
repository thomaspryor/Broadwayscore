  "bwwExcerpt": "\"There's a little too much talk of how paintings 'pulse' - though Donald Holder's lighting simulates the effect magically - and a few of the assistant's background details seem unnecessarily maudlin. No doubt these were inserted to give his character depth, so he'd be more than just Rothko's sounding board. While the role may not be as well-drawn as Rothko's, Redmayne certainly knows what to do with it. But what would any work about a tortured artist",
