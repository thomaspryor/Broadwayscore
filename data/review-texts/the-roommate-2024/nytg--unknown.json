However, this is only one curated quote and may not represent the full review's verdict. | GPT-4o: The review highlights LuPone's ability to entertain and engage the audience, but also notes a lack of deep character engagement, suggesting a mixed performance with both strengths and weaknesses. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes LuPone's performance as knowing and capable of getting laughs, but not deeply engaged with the character. This suggests a mixed assessment, neither strongly positive nor negative.",
