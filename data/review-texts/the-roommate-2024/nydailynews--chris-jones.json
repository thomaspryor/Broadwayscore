  "fullText": "It’s near-impossible to look away from Mia Farrow’s riveting performance as a lonely Iowan in Jack O’Brien‘s staging of Jen Silverman’s quirky one-act, one-set play “The Roommate.” One fears looking down at the floor for a second and missing an implosion. Maybe “explosion” is the better word. It’s hard to know. That’s because Farrow’s organic fusing of externals and internals is so central to her work as an actress.

However, due to the single excerpt and lack of a full review, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on a \"riveting performance\" and the experience of seeing Farrow live, suggesting a positive experience, but the lack of full text and the \"flat\" aggregator verdict suggest a more tempered recommendation.",
