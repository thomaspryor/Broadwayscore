Playwright Jen Silverman’s slightly dark comedy, written nearly a decade ago, employs a familiar structure: two actors, one act, zero frills. The show drops us into the lives of a pair of 60-something women — the timid Sharon (Mia Farrow) and the mysterious Robyn (Patti LuPone) — who become roommates in Sharon’s modest Iowan home.
