Not even the ever-reliable director Jack O'Brien can get a firm grasp on this squiggly story, but at least he doesn't have to make the effort alone: Who wouldn't want Farrow and LuPone on their team?\"",

With only one curated quote available, the mixed elements suggest neither strong recommendation nor dismissal. | GPT-4o: The review highlights significant flaws in pacing and mood, and suggests that even a reliable director struggles with the story. The mention of the director not having to make the effort alone with Farrow and LuPone implies some redeeming qualities, but overall the tone is negative. | Gemini: The review points out flaws in pacing and story, but also highlights the strength of the cast. This suggests a mixed experience, not strongly recommending or discouraging.",
