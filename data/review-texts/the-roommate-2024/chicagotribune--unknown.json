However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The quote suggests a positive experience, but the single excerpt and lack of full context warrant a score in the middle of the 'Positive' range. The phrase 'will regret their attendance' implies a worthwhile experience.",
