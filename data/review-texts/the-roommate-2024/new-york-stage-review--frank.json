  "dtliExcerpt": "Despite the fine efforts of the performers and solid production values including music by an overqualified David Yazbek,&nbsp;The Roommate, running 100 minutes without an intermission, always feels predictable despite its procession of narrative surprises designed for easy laughs. But that’s no reason not to take advantage of the unique opportunity to watch Farrow and LuPone play off each other with the expert comic timing of seasoned vaudevillians.",
