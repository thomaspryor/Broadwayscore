Without full review context, scoring conservatively in mixed range due to balanced positive/negative elements. | GPT-4o: The review highlights a significant flaw in the plot but praises Mia Farrow's performance. This suggests a mixed review, as the positive aspect of the performance is countered by criticism of the plot. | Gemini: The quote acknowledges plot issues but praises Mia Farrow's performance, suggesting a positive but not rave review. Given the limited text, a score in the middle of the positive range is appropriate.",
