  "fullText": "Tweet  \nPatti LuPone and Mia Farrow. (Photo credit: Julieta Cervantes)\n\n\n\nBy: Darryl Reilly\n\nMia Farrow giddily employing a French accent to pull a phone scam on an acquaintance is among the hilarious highlights of playwright Jen Silverman’s charming two-character quaint comedy, The Roommate. The formidable Patti LuPone equally dazzles as Farrow’s foil in this new spin on older female opposites thrown together in a living situation; of course they smoke marijuana. Their star wattage is cleverly acknowledged and utilized by venerable director Jack O’Brien for his strategic opening tableau, this estimable duo silently appear together standing; thunderous audience reaction occurs, then the play begins without such distraction. With her blonde pigtails, Ms. Farrow is clad in jeans and a plaid shirt, and the dark shaggy-haired Ms. LuPone is decked out in all black including a leather biker jacket. We instantly get it; we’re in for a good time because of them.\n\nIllinois-born 65-year-old divorcee Sharon (played by Farrow) putters around her big old Iowa City house when not attending her book club, volunteering weekly in a gift shop, or pestering via phone her not out to her gay son in Park Slope, Brooklyn. To cut down on expenses she has recently made arrangements to get a roommate. The similarly aged, brassy cigarette smoking lesbian Robyn (played by LuPone) from the Bronx arrives to take up residence. A warm friendship develops but is complicated after Sharon snoops through a carton box of Robyn’s, inciting unsettling revelations and developments.\n\nOur kids don’t have to like us, they just have to survive long enough to become us.\n\nIt’s mostly safe here, except for the tornadoes.\n\nHerbs only become drugs when capitalism is involved.\n\nIn addition to echoing The Odd Couple and The Golden Girls, skillful dramatic writing pervades in Silverman’s well-crafted scenario. It is laden with sharp sitcom-style zingers, contains two expertly delineated figures, and has a classic plot which is both predictable and surprising.\n\nMr. O’Brien’s inventive and precise physical staging mines the play’s humor and pathos for maximum emotional and visual impact. Scenic designer Bob Crowley’s homey kitchen is surrounded by artful wood frame dwelling portions authentically conveying the look of an Iowa house on the plains. Cheeky animal prints appear in Mr. Crowley’s neat costume design which suitably ranges from drab to flamboyant. Lighting designer Natasha Katz’s zesty varying hues ravishingly complement the piece’s tones, she even conjures a film noir-style sheen for a bit of larceny. David Yazbek’s atmospheric original music and effects are smoothly realized by Mikaal Sulaiman’s clear sound design. Robert Pickens and Katie Gell’s superior hair, wig and makeup design, allow for Farrow and LuPone to truly resemble their characters. It is wonderful to see Marsha Mason listed as assistant director.\n\nThe Roommate had its world premiere at the 2015 Humana Festival of New American Plays at Actors Theatre of Louisville, and was produced by Williamstown Theatre Festival in July 2017. With its affective writing and polished presentation, this Broadway incarnation succeeds as a thoughtfully entertaining star vehicle for Mia Farrow and Patti LuPone.\n\nThe Roommate (through December 15, 2024)Booth Theatre, 222 West 45th Street, in ManhattanFor tickets, visit www.theroommatebway.comRunning time: one hour and 40 minutes with no intermission\n\nTweet      \t\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tLeave a comment Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
