  "fullText": "There's something loose, rebellious, and even wild hiding within the trappings of \"The Roommate,\" a new Broadway production of a play written by Jen Silverman. One just has to wait for it to reveal itself.\n\n\"The Roommate\" has had a long life, beginning with its first performance in 2015. And, in moments, its age seems to show. Here, Mia Farrow plays Sharon, an Iowa City resident who takes in Patti LuPone's Robyn, a leather-jacketed agent of chaos fleeing the Bronx for unspecified (at least at first) reasons. Sharon's house, a set we never leave, is bare and exposed to the sky beyond, with striking projections of an Iowan landscape behind the wood-frame set. But it feels to Sharon like a prison; alone in the world, her only lifelines are a friend's \"reading group\" (don't call it a book club), her attempts to pick up French via language-learning tapes, and relentless phone calls to her son, living in Brooklyn. Sharon seems to be blocking out the truth that her son, her one connection to a world beyond Iowa, is gay; a \"not that there's anything wrong with that\" punchline in the play's early going lands with a thud. (How long ago did \"Seinfeld\" popularize that catchphrase?)",
  "bwwExcerpt": "In the main, “The Roommate” is a spirited entry on Broadway and a welcome showcase for LuPone and — in particular — Farrow. That actress’s last scenes in the play, giving nothing away, are utterly haunting, having moved beyond been-there-done-that comedy to something outright wrenching, an examination of a character whose whole point is that she’d gone through her whole life not examining herself. It wouldn’t be right to say that these scenes, at the play’s end, make you forget what came before,",
