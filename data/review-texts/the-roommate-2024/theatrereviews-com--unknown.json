  "fullText": "It has been a long journey for “The Roommate,” the dark comedy by Jen Silverman, to finally arrive on Broadway since its premiere in 2015 at the Actors Theatre of Louisville, Humana Festival. It was well worth the wait, since the current production now playing at The Booth Theatre stars Mia Farrow and Patti LuPone in a two hander that plays like an in-depth character study. These two legends have a chemistry that is magnetic, symbiotic, and human. They exhibit a craft that is incomprehensible as they feed off each other, like parasites attached to their host. This may not be the greatest play to open on Broadway, but it is undeniably, a theatrical event for any avid theatergoer. Ms. Silverman provides a weak script, that is disguised by two brilliant performances. The plot centers around two unlikely roommates who are gradually revealed to be very dark and desperate individuals making an unusual “odd couple.” Robyn (a complex Patti LuPone) is looking for a change, a chance to start over. So, she finds a room to rent in Iowa City and is moving there from the Bronx. Her new landlady and roommate is Sharon, (a pliable Mia Farrow), who appears to be a simple and naive country soul. Robyn is Gay, a vegan, and grows her own “medicinal” marijuana. Sharon is a hearty meat and potato fan, belongs to a neighborhood book club, doesn’t get out much, and has a son who is a fashion designer living in Park Slope. She assures Robyn that he is not a homosexual. Robyn has an estranged daughter we know nothing about. As these two actors peel away the layers of their characters to the core, they manage to form an unusual bond that is both welcomed and strained. They both need what the other cannot or refuses to provide, so there is no winner in this tug of war. Sparks fly, fuses burn slowly, and bombshells are constantly dropped, but all would be spoiler alerts. What may come to mind is that they are not fighting each other on the front line but rather prisoners of a past life they are trying to escape. Both actors are at the top of their game, trying to overcome the shortcomings of a weak and implausible script. Ms. LuPone surrounds herself with a tuff exterior, then slowly reveals her flaws, insecurities and vulnerability. She can open, let you in, then shut you out before you discover who she really is. She is in complete control of her character’s emotions. Ms. Farrow works the opposite, completely transparent, putting everything on the table in full view. She then begins to dig deep to discover herself along with the audience. Her character becomes a self-realization taking every opportunity to experience the danger and excitement that might result from her actions. Their performances are a master class in the craft and a testament to their talent. Director Jack O’Brien guides these two actors through an emotional maze with ease, using every inch of the beautiful and functional set designed by Bob Crowley, which captures the wide-open country space of Iowa. Lighting design by Natasha Katz beautifully captures the change of time and punctuates subtle mood changes with accuracy. It is worth a visit to the Booth Theatre to catch a glimpse of these two actors navigating complex characters and creating some dazzling magic on the Broadway stage. Something old becomes new again with the current production of “Yellow Face” by Roundabout Theatre, which has been produced nationally, and internationally since it opened off-Broadway at the Public Theatre in 2007. That premiere production was directed by Leigh Silverman, who takes the helm in this current incarnation on Broadway.… The box office for the critically lauded and wildly popular new musical, Kimberly Akimbo, will open on Wednesday, September 7 at 10 a.m. at the Booth Theatre (222 West 45th Street). The Booth Theatre box office will be open Monday through Saturday from 10am to 6pm. After opening to rave… By agreeing to carefully examine the sex-role stereotypes attributed to women, five disparate women named ‘Betty’ cautiously approach self-acceptance and self-understanding in Jen Silverman’s “Collective Rage: A Play in 5 Betties” at MCC Theater’s Lucille Lortel Theatre. Their collective rage about their loneliness, their fears, their submission, and their dismissions…",
