  "fullText": "Megawatt performers Patti LuPone and Mia Farrow sprinkle stardust on playwright Jen Silverman’s hollow comedy about 60-something roommates. Good morning, and welcome to Broadway News’ Broadway Review by Brittani Samuel — our overview of reactions, recommendations and information tied to last night’s Broadway opening of “The Roommate.” Hollywood-star power and the brazen use of pre-show bows for its performers aside, “The Roommate” is less a bold, blockbuster-worthy event and more a slow-burn play. Playwright Jen Silverman’s slightly dark comedy, written nearly a decade ago, employs a familiar structure: two actors, one act, zero frills. The show drops us into the lives of a pair of 60-something women — the timid Sharon (Mia Farrow) and the mysterious Robyn (Patti LuPone) — who become roommates in Sharon’s modest Iowan home.
