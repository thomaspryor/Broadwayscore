  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessPatti LuPone and Mia Farrow in “The Roommate.” (Julieta Cervantes)Review by  Naveen KumarSeptember 12, 2024 at 9:00 p.m. EDTMia Farrow and Patti LuPone walk onstage beneath pink neon lights emblazoned with their names before “The Roommate” on Broadway even begins, the audience erupting in customary entrance applause. The gesture seems intended to dispense with the hoopla of fame so the actors can get to work. But it also points to their stardom as the reason everyone’s here, regardless of what happens next.\n\nThere’s no escaping the pair’s towering reputations, which turn out to be both a blessing and a trap. In this odd-couple comedy by Jen Silverman, Farrow and LuPone are cast as unlikely housemates in rural Iowa, lost souls eager to move on from their pasts. Directed by Jack O’Brien, the production leans generously into the distinctive qualities associated with its stars: Farrow plays a delicate and curious open book, and LuPone a blunt and sardonic riddle.\n\nLike most cohabitations, the results are uneven but not without tangible rewards.\n\nThe most captivating among them is Farrow, who is subtly astonishing in a role that seems at first to be all aw-shucks naiveté. A divorced mother of one, Sharon is prone to calling her adult son and leaving dotty, stream-of-consciousness voicemails. A book club is the extent of her social life. When LuPone’s Robyn barrels curiously into town from the Bronx, looking for a place to disappear in the middle of nowhere, it’s immediately obvious how unsuited Sharon has been to living alone.\n\nRobyn, a vegan, pot-smoking lesbian, appears biologically engineered to shock someone like Sharon, and the women are presented as a study in opposites. LuPone, sporting a Pat Benatar shag and black leather jacket, dispenses cynicism from the side of her mouth with a snarl; Farrow, enveloped by downy blond pigtails and worn-in flannel, showers her strange new companion with questions, greeting each revelation less with judgment than with awe.\n\nSome version of this Rizzo-wows-Sandy routine continues for the better part of the play’s 100 minutes, as the two sip morning coffee at the kitchen island over a handful of weeks. (Bob Crowley designed the airy, exposed-beam interior and on-the-nose costumes.) Robyn teaches Sharon to puff her first joint, and the two predictably start to rub off on each other.\n\nRobyn clearly has plenty to hide, and for a while it seems like her secrets might jolt the plot forward at any minute. But the slow trickle of details about her unsavory past turns out to be less compelling than the transformation it inspires in Sharon, whose country-bumpkin demeanor belies a desperate desire for self-determination.\n\nToying with these expectations is a tricky move, making much of the play feel like a waiting game. But Silverman is drawing attention to the ennui as much as its potential disturbance: Sharon is used to stewing in regret over her perceived failures as a mother, but she trembles with excitement in the presence of someone like Robyn, an avatar for future possibilities.\n\nFarrow, known for her doe-eyed transparency in films like “Rosemary’s Baby,” is tremendous onstage, a rare caliber of performer who is so unceasingly present that looking away from her would feel like a cruelty. Her radical sense of vulnerability can raise a catch in your throat with a mere straightforward question or furrowed brow. And she has rich material at her disposal here, in a character who undergoes dramatic change with delight.\n\nLuPone, whose Broadway résumé is stacked with iron wills from Eva Perón to Mama Rose, steps into familiar shoes, as a woman whose brassy exterior guards a closely held tenderness. There’s no question about her ability to deliver a convincing variation on the type, nor does the role pack much room for surprise. It’s not a knock on LuPone to say that she could play it in her sleep. But there is a natural ease to her and Farrow’s rapport, and they lend aching insight to the play’s meditation on loneliness and reinvention.\n\nStories so often imagine women as objects of desire, caregivers or mirrors for the fantasies of others. The ones who defy or outlive expectations can find themselves shoved off the map. Despite the occasionally meandering pace of “The Roommate,” it’s a privilege to watch two formidable talents traverse underexplored territory.\n\nThe Roommate, through Dec. 15 at the Booth Theatre in New York. 1 hour, 40 minutes with no intermission. theroommatebway.com.",
