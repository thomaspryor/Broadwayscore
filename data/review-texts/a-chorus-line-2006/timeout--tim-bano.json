    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The quote suggests high production values but a fundamental mismatch with the material's intentions, indicating mixed feelings. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be cherry-picked from a more definitively positive or negative review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a contradiction between the production's spectacle and the musical's intent, indicating a mixed assessment. The lack of full context and the single excerpt warning contribute to low confidence. | Gemini: The single excerpt presents a mixed assessment, praising the production while criticizing the musical itself. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt uses strong praise ('spectacular production') but qualifies it with tension regarding the material's nature. With only one curated quote available, scoring at the upper end of Positive per guidance for clearly positive excerpts, but confidence is reduced due to cherry-picking risk.",
