This is neither a recommendation nor a strong discouragement. | GPT-4o: The review describes the revival as 'competent' but lacking inspiration and the original's impact, indicating a mixed assessment without a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review states that the revival is faithful but not particularly inspired, indicating a mixed assessment. It acknowledges competence but criticizes the lack of raw electricity compared to the original. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the revival is technically faithful and competent but criticizes it for lacking the inspirational spark and revolutionary energy of the original production, resulting in a lukewarm assessment without a clear endorsement.",
