    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising performances as bringing 'joy' suggests positive assessment, but extremely limited text and potential cherry-picking requires caution with lower positive score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the performances, but lacks comprehensive context. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is clearly positive, praising the performances. Due to the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive sentiment warrants a score in the upper end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt attributes the show's appeal to 'punchy performances' that provide 'joy,' indicating a clear positive recommendation focused on the acting, though the limited context prevents a higher confidence rating.",
