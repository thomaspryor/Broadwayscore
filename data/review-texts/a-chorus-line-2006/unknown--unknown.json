    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, the language is exceptionally enthusiastic with superlatives like 'singular sensation' and promises audiences will 'fall head over heels in love.' This is clear rave language even in isolation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly enthusiastic language ('head over heels in love', 'singular sensation'), suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single quote available is very positive, suggesting a strong recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt employs exuberant, unqualified praise ('head over heels in love,' 'singular sensation') that clearly indicates a strong recommendation. However, per the single-excerpt protocol, the score is capped at the upper end of the Positive range to account for potential cherry-picking. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
