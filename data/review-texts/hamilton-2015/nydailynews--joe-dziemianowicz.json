With “Hamilton,” Broadway is officially the coolest place on the planet. And the smartest. And most exhilarating. Yes, composer, lyricist, author and leading man Lin-Manuel Miranda’s magical musical tour of the life of the “10-dollar Founding Father,” Alexander Hamilton, is that great. It’s even richer and more eloquent since its run earlier this year at the Public Theater. The star of this show is the show itself. And it begins with a simple yet intriguing question: How did a nobody — in this case Hamilton, a penniless, illegitimate immigrant orphan — become a somebody, rising to become the right-hand man to George Washington (Christopher Jackson, excellent), a Revolutionary War hero and founder of the banking system? And how did someone of such intellect and respect fall for a messy sextortion plot and then end up in a fatal duel with longtime frenemy Aaron Burr (Leslie Odom Jr., commanding in the villain role)? Miranda’s Hamilton is a complicated guy — a patriot, narcissist and know-it-all, an unfaithful husband but true-blue politico more concerned with preserving his reputation than protecting his marriage. The show, inspired by Ron Chernow’s 2004 biography and cast with a color-blind eye, is just as complex in terms of its themes, melodies and rhythms. Hip hop is one flavor of the score. It’s as if the speechmaking Founding Fathers are in the next room. And it’s a deft way to depict the often-fractious relationships between these competitive 18th-century power players — men of the past carving out America’s future in the language of today. But to call this a “hip hop musical” is simplistic: rhythm and blues, jazz and Broadway are also part of a work that nods to Rodgers and Hammerstein, Gilbert and Sullivan and beyond. Since the Off-Broadway run, performances have all deepened, including Miranda’s. He better conveys Hamilton’s cockiness, contrition and all-too-human flaws. The charismatic Daveed Diggs aces his roles and lends laughs as Thomas Jefferson and the French general Lafayette. Jonathan Groff (HBO’s “Looking”) is the picture of pouty petulance as King George III, who appears now and again to warble a Brit-pop tune of vengeance, venom and venality. As much as this is a play about politics, it is also an opus about emotion. Any great Broadway classic — and “Hamilton” is one for the ages — needs a head and a heart. The latter organ is fully utilized in the form of the wealthy Schuyler sisters, Eliza, Angelica and Peggy — who arrive from upstate like Destiny’s Child with voices blending into thrilling R&B harmonies. But each actress breaks out and gets to be the Beyoncé. The breathtaking Renee Elise Goldsberry brings grit and grace as the indomitable Angelica, Hamilton’s confidante. As Eliza, the lovely Phillipa Soo captivates with her pure, sweet singing as Hamilton’s devoted-despite-everything wife. Jasmine Cephas Jones, is underused as Peggy, but plays the key role as the married woman who seduces Hamilton and precipitates his fall. A slightly sluggish second act and some murky diction don’t dim the beauty, power and poignance constantly on stage at the Richard Rodgers. Indeed, an intelligent confidence underscores every moment in this production directed by Thomas Kail and choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler, who had the same duties in Miranda’s Tony-winning “In the Heights.” You can’t overstate their contributions, which are exceptional and inseparable, in making this show a one-of-a-kind theatrical experience. If only every history lesson — and Broadway musical — dazzled so completely. Subscribers are entitled to 10 gift sharing articles each month.
