  "fullText": "With \"Hamilton,\" Broadway is officially the coolest place on the planet. And the smartest. And most exhilarating...It's even richer and more eloquent since its run earlier this year at the Public Theater...Hip hop is one flavor of the score. It's as if the speechmaking Founding Fathers are in the next room. And it's a deft way to depict the often-fractious relationships between these competitive 18th-century power players...But to call this a \"hip hop musical\" is simplistic: rhythm and blues, jazz and Broadway are also part of a work that nods to Rodgers and Hammerstein, Gilbert and Sullivan and beyond. Since the Off-Broadway run, performances have all deepened, including Miranda's. He better conveys Hamilton's cockiness, contrition and all-too-human flaws. The charismatic Daveed Diggs aces his roles and lends laughs as Thomas Jefferson and the French general Lafayette. Jonathan Groff (HBO's \"Looking\") is the picture of pouty petulance as King George III, who appears now and again to warble a Brit-pop tune of vengeance, venom and venality...The breathtaking Renee Elise Goldsberry brings grit and grace as the indomitable Angelica, Hamilton's confidante. As Eliza, the lovely Phillipa Soo captivates with her pure, sweet singing as Hamilton's devoted-despite-everything wife...If only every history lesson -- and Broadway musical -- dazzled so completely.",
