The excerpt uses superlative language ('remarkable achievement', 'truly special') with no reservations, matching the high numerical score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives like 'remarkable achievement' and 'truly special,' indicating a strong, enthusiastic recommendation. The original rating of 93 aligns with a Rave classification. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"remarkable achievement\" and \"truly special\", and the critic's rating is 93, indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives ('remarkable achievement', 'truly special') and the critic's original rating of 93 indicates strong enthusiasm, though confidence is reduced due to the risk of cherry-picking from a single excerpt.",
