  "bwwExcerpt": "Miranda's singular gift for storytelling and wordplay makes even the Federalist Papers sound sexy, but the play's intrigue come mostly from its potent stew of friendship and romance and outsize ambition; it's as if House of Cards were folded into a sort of Days of Our Colonial Lives fever dream, then filtered through the minds of Tupac and Sondheim.
