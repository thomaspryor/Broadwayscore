  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"With Kail's clever direction and Blankenbuhler's athletic choreography, 'Hamilton's' large cast embodies a bloody war, heated political rivalries, and the outright joy of starting a new nation...Miranda's score is a triumph by itself with a wide range of influences and some of the best lyric writing seen yet this century...The modernity of the production is refreshing and prescient - we might actually be entering a new era of musical theatre.\"",
