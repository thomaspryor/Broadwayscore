  "bwwExcerpt": "pera...It's thrilling to watch...Miranda has a star's charisma...He hasn't shaped a new country. But he has reacquainted us with somebody who did -- and in doing so may wind up shaping a new theater. Robert Hofler, The Wrap : Yes, \"Hamilton\" is that good, and the still youthful Lin-Manuel Miranda can be mentioned in the same sentence with Sondheim and even Cole Porter. No need to go into all the lyrics here, but Miranda has a syllable-by-syllable rhyme for \"pseudonym,\" and many other words, that is absolutely delicious. Leah Greenblatt, Entertainment Weekly : Miranda's singular gift for storytelling and wordplay makes even the Federalist Papers sound sexy, but the play's intrigue come mostly from its potent stew of friendship and romance and outsize ambition; it's as if House of Cards were folded into a sort of Days of Our Colonial Lives fever dream, then filtered through the minds of Tupac and Sondheim. It's that strange and that spectacular, and you'd be crazy to miss it. A Steven Su",
