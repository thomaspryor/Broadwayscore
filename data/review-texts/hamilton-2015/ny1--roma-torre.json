'Hamilton' is that rare musical that fires on all cylinders, even ones we never knew existed...In a sense, the collective talents of this bravura company pay homage to Broadway's founding fathers - and mothers - by pushing the envelope on an artform that at best, teaches us, enlightens us and entertains us like nothing else.\"",
