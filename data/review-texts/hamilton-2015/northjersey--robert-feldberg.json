  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The first question critics usually consider when a hit off-Broadway show moves to Broadway is whether it works as well in a larger space. 'Hamilton' does. Emphatically...It's an event that hasn't been over-hyped. The show is spectacularly unique, an endlessly clever history lesson that links us to the country's Founding Fathers in an ingenious and compelling theatrical way...There are probably a half-dozen more things I could rave about, but, essentially, 'Hamilton' is just a really, really terrific show.\"",
