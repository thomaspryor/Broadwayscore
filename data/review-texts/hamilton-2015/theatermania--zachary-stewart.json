  "fullText": "Sometimes a show is crushed under the weight of its own hype. In recent weeks, Hamilton (now making its world premiere at the Public Theater with book, music, and lyrics by the show's star, Lin-Manuel Miranda) has been compared favorably to Tony Kushner's Angels in America and William Shakespeare's Henriad. Many have called it a game-changer. TheaterMania even predicted a Pulitzer Prize for the hip-hop bio-musical before it began public performances. How could any theatrical production live up to such expectations? Well, like its extraordinary subject, Hamilton exceeds all expectations. Exceptionally smart and unexpectedly timely, this story of an American patriot is the best new American musical in years. Electricity pervades the air from the earliest moments, in which a chorus introduces us to the \"bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman,\" who would grow up to become Alexander Hamilton (Miranda), the \"ten-dollar founding father without a father.\" This prologue takes us from Hamilton's impoverished childhood in Nevis to his new life in New York City, all on the power of his brains and industry. The first person he meets off the boat: Aaron Burr (Leslie Odom Jr.), the man who is now mostly remembered for killing him.",
