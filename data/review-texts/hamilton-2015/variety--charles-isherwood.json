The lack of full context and single excerpt warning lowers confidence, but the tone is clearly enthusiastic. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"wit, intelligence and an infectious energy\" and indicates that the show's length \"fly[s] by,\" suggesting a highly enjoyable experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the show's wit, intelligence and infectious energy, strongly recommending the production despite the limited context available.",
