  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Would 'Hamilton' really live up to the hype? The evening I went, there was electricity in the air. A great sense of excited anticipation. And when the lights dimmed, before the first note was sung, the audience began to cheer. Does 'Hamilton' live up to all of this? Well, yes, it actually does...Even though 'Hamilton' is nearly three hours long, it does not feel tedious...As soon as 'Hamilton' ended, I wanted to see it again. Now, that is the way to kick off a Broadway season.\"",
