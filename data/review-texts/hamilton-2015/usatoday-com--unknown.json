  "fullText": "LIFEAndy BlankenbuehlerAdd Topic'Hamilton' will win hearts and mindsElysa Gardner@elysagardner, USA TODAYUpdated Aug. 6, 2015, 10:40 p.m. ETNEW YORK — If the notion of American exceptionalism always struck you as a tad chauvinistic, there's a new musical that may change your tune.\n\nThe USA is, undeniably, where musical theater — storytelling featuring fleshed-out characters, propelled by words, music and dance — took shape and thrived in the 20th century. But there has been nothing on Broadway in the past 20 years to rival the riveting, exhilarating and haunting Hamilton (**** out of four stars), which premiered at the Public Theater last winter to wild acclaim, and opened Thursday at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, its vitality and ingenuity fully intact.\n\nConceived by composer/lyricist/librettist/star Lin-Manuel Miranda while reading Ron Chernow's 2004 biography Alexander Hamilton, the show revisits our nation's extraordinary birth and explores its unique, complicated promise.\n\nAs written and played by Miranda, Hamilton — architect of our financial system, chief author of the Federalist Papers, first secretary of the treasury — is a man of ferocious intelligence, enormous drive and devastating flaws. He has the outsize passions of an epic musical hero, and the verbal dexterity and bravado of a rap star; and Miranda's pulsing score and dazzling, piercing rhymes accommodate both. The music not only fuses hip-hop and musical theater influences, but also nods to the genres and styles that have informed them, from operetta to girl-group R&B to orchestral rock.\n\nIt's noted that Hamilton was born in the British West Indies, out of wedlock. Aaron Burr, the rival who will kill Hamilton in a duel, calls him \"a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman.\" Miranda's own parents are from Puerto Rico, and the superb cast is racially diverse, with African-American actors playing Hamilton's fellow founding fathers. Director Thomas Kail has crafted a nascent USA that looks contemporary, emphasizing our debt to the different people who have defined our country by carving out new lives here — often under difficult circumstances, and sometimes not by their own choice. (Slavery is referenced several times.)\n\nAs musicals demand creative synergy, Miranda and Kail have key collaborators in music director Alex Lacamoire and choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler. Lacamoire's muscular orchestration mines the melodic pull of Miranda's score, whether the performers are rapping or singing. Blankenbuehler keeps the dancers in almost constant motion, sustaining a sense of urgency that heightens our engagement and excitement.\n\nThe individual performances are too varied and rich to give full credit here, but standouts include Leslie Odom, Jr.'s slick but gritty Burr and Christopher Jackson's robust, dignified George Washington. Daveed Diggs does blazing double duty as the Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson — who takes Hamilton on in a pair of fiercely witty rap battles — and Jonathan Groff's King George III is a delightful comic tyrant.\n\nThe personal scandal and wrenching family tragedy that plagued Hamilton are also movingly documented, with Phillipa Soo cast as his gentle, noble wife and a sparkling Renée Elise Goldsberry as her feistier sister. Just as Hamilton makes history as emotionally compelling as any love story, it reveals historical figures as nuanced human beings who yearn and suffer.\n\nAmerican musicals have long combined social criticism with unabashed romance, a sharp eye with an open heart. Watching that tradition move boldly forward in Hamilton, a fan can't help but feeling a little pride.",
