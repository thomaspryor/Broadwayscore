  "bwwExcerpt": "ging like a virtuoso, and Phillipa Soo is a tender and swanlike wife to Hamilton...mostly [Miranda} seems to have cut back the historical underbrush that sometimes bogged the show down. Frank Scheck, The Hollywood Reporter : The almost entirely sung-through show is remarkably faithful to the historical facts, packing immense amounts of detail into its sprawling narrative. But it does so in such riotously entertaining fashion that it never feels like a history lesson, although it surely delivers one...Largely unaltered from its original production save for one important cast change, the lyrically dense show makes an even greater impact on the large Broadway stage, which provides ample room for its large ensemble. The performers have only gotten better, with Miranda in the title role...delivering a commanding star turn that is as charismatic as it is emotionally affecting. But there's also terrific work from Leslie Odom, Jr. as the scheming Burr, stopping the show with the rousing number",

  "dtliExcerpt": "There's rarely been a history lesson as entertaining as Lin-Manuel Miranda's new hip hop-infused musical about Alexander Hamilton, or, as the opening number puts it, \"The ten-dollar founding father without a father.\" Based on Ron Chernow's best-selling biography, Hamilton brings American history to musical-theater life in a style akin to the classic 1776, only with a hipper, more multi-cultural attitude. Currently enjoying a virtually sold-out off-Broadway premiere engagement at the Public Theater, where its run has already been extended twice before the official opening, the show seems inevitably destined for a Broadway transfer.Miranda, previously responsible for the 2008 Tony Award-winning musical In the Heights, is clearly enamored of his subject. In addition to writing the book, music and lyrics for the nearly three-hour show, he also plays the title role. And while he's had the audacity to cast Hispanic and black actors as the Founding Fathers commonly referred to as \"old dead white men,\" Miranda's work is remarkably faithful to the historical facts, imparting great amounts of information in such rollicking fashion that high school history teachers will find themselves profoundly grateful for the assist.",
