From my perspective, the answers are, respectively, a definite no and a solid yes...Though much has been made of the myriad musical and lyrical references that pockmark the evening, they're more about calling attention to themselves than contributing to a consistent texture or sensible narrative. To my reckoning they brand 'Hamilton,' even in its slightly altered, more precise uptown incarnation, as unsatisfying and unrealized dramatically, and a piece that's forever at war with itself.\"",
