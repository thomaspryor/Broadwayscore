  "fullText": "Daveed Diggs (from left), Okieriete Onaodowan, Anthony Ramos and Lin-Manuel Miranda in \"Hamilton.\" \n Joan Marcus \n \n \n \n \n \n \n At last, bipartisanship! “Hamilton” may be the only thing the Obamas and Cheneys ever agree on.\n\nBut then, there’s a lot of love for this energetic telling of the story of Alexander Hamilton, architect of the Treasury and founder of this newspaper, among other things. Its Public Theater run this spring was beyond sold out, and the show opened on Broadway Thursday night with a $30 million-plus advance. That’s a lot of Hams.\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda’s “In the Heights” may have been a hit — but his “Hamilton” is a phenomenon.\n\nMiranda, who wrote the score and book and plays the title role, deftly melds hip-hop, R&B, ’60s pop and traditional show tunes. Thomas Kail’s direction and Andy Blankenbuehler’s choreography is inventive and kinetic, suggesting the story is always in motion on the bilevel wooden set.\n\nBut “revolutionary” the show is not. Truly radical art is divisive, and under its brash exterior, “Hamilton” is warmly reassuring — a love letter to a land of opportunity where “The 10-dollar founding father without a father/Got a lot farther by working a lot harder/By being a lot smarter/By being a self-starter.”\n\nThis is all in the opening song, by the way, which is as heavily expository as most of the first act. In it we follow Hamilton’s involvement in the Revolutionary War and his lifelong connection with Aaron Burr (the charismatic Leslie Odom Jr.), who finally kills him in a duel.\n\nJust as important is Hamilton’s relationship with the Schuyler sisters: Eliza, whom he married, and the older Angelica, his soul mate. Phillipa Soo and Renée Elise Goldsberry, respectively, are sublime, and do heartbreaking justice to songs drawing from TLC-type hooks and R&B-styled soul-baring.\n\n“Hamilton” shines brightest when it gets into the characters’ heads and hearts, especially concerning our hero’s personal life — though those are the scenes in which Miranda’s limitations as an actor are obvious.\n\nLess effective is the history-with-a-capital-H stuff. Turning political debate into a rap battle is clever, but overall, Hamilton’s big-picture importance is diluted — what did that guy do, exactly?\n\nMore shrewd is Jonathan Groff’s slyly funny recurring turn as King George. Looking like an overgrown teenager in regal red and a crown, the British monarch taunts the young country: “You’re on your own./Awesome. Wow./Do you have a clue what happens now?”\n\nWell, America turned out to have a long, successful run. So, no doubt, will “Hamilton.”\n\nIf you switch this toggle to “no,” we will not sell or share your personal information with third parties for advertising targeted to this device.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Excerpt shows clear appreciation ('lot of love', 'inventive and kinetic', 'shines brightest') but includes notable reservations ('revolutionary the show is not'). Single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses appreciation for the show's energy and direction, but notes it is not 'revolutionary.' The positive elements suggest a recommendation, but the lack of full context and the caveat about not being 'revolutionary' temper the enthusiasm. | Gemini: The review excerpt is generally positive, praising the energy and direction, but also notes it's not \"revolutionary\" and is \"warmly reassuring\". Given the single excerpt and the reservations, a score of 75 seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production's energy, direction, and choreography as 'inventive and kinetic' and notes 'a lot of love' for the show, though it criticizes the work for being 'warmly reassuring' rather than truly radical. Despite reservations about its artistic ambition, the overall assessment recommends the production.",
