  "fullText": "But then, there's a lot of love for this energetic telling of the story of Alexander Hamilton...Thomas Kail's direction and Andy Blankenbuehler's choreography is inventive and kinetic, suggesting the story is always in motion on the bilevel wooden set. But \"revolutionary\" the show is not. Truly radical art is divisive, and under its brash exterior, \"Hamilton\" is warmly reassuring -- a love letter to a land of opportunity... \"Hamilton\" shines brightest when it gets into the characters' heads and hearts, especially concerning our hero's personal life -- though those are the scenes in which Miranda's limitations as an actor are obvious. Less effective is the history-with-a-capital-H stuff. Turning political debate into a rap battle is clever, but overall, Hamilton's big-picture importance is diluted...Well, America turned out to have a long, successful run. So, no doubt, will \"Hamilton.\"",
