  "fullText": "rning political debate into a rap battle is clever, but overall, Hamilton's big-picture importance is diluted...Well, America turned out to have a long, successful run. So, no doubt, will \"Hamilton.\" Matt Windman, AM New York : I must confess that I gave one of the less enthusiastic reviews of \"Hamilton\" back in February, finding the plot to be too dense (it is, after all, a biography) and the hip-hop sound to be monotonous. On second viewing, I was determined to accept the show on its own terms, and I ended up being absolutely entranced by Miranda's inventive writing, Thomas Kail's masterful direction and Andy Blankenbuehler's nonstop movement. I may be the last critic to join the \"Hamilton\" fan club, but better late than never. Miranda tackles Hamilton's life, as well as the chaos and culture of the Revolutionary War and early years of the Republic, with genuine historical analysis, humor, tenderness and an eye for contemporary relevance. Jeremy Gerard, Deadline : Lin-Manuel Miranda'",
