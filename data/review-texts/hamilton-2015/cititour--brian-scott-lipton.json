  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The show creates a swirling intellectual and emotional portrait of one individual that matches, if not bests, any we've previously seen on stage. To accomplish this rare feat, Miranda is aided by the seamless direction of Thomas Kail, the extraordinary, and the stirring orchestrations of Alex Lacamoire, who finds the precisely right sounds for Miranda's wonderfully wide musical vocabulary...Its inventiveness is practically unparalleled. Miranda's book is a marvel, as well.\"",
