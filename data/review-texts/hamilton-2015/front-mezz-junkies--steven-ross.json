  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"I was intoxicated by 'Hamilton', exquisitely directed by Thomas Kail...It has an energy, a beat, a rhythm, and a rebelliousness that swept me up and kept me thoroughly engaged and enchanted. It's a powerhouse three-hour telling of this pushy historical figure...Act One is an adrenaline-fueled history lesson in politics, war, revolution and love but Act Two is the clincher, which gives this show its emotional core and depth. It is truly amazing what Miranda has done here.\"",
