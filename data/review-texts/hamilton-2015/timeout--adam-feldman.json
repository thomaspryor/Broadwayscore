The original rating of 100 further supports a Rave classification. | Gemini: The review uses the word \"masterpiece\" and states that the show succeeds on every level, indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The critic declares the show a 'masterpiece' that 'succeeds on every level' with 'brilliant' writing and 'exceptional' performances, indicating the highest possible recommendation despite the limited excerpt context.",
