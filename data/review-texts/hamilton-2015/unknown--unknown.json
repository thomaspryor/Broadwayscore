But 'Hamilton,' directed by Thomas Kail and starring Mr. Miranda, might just about be worth it — at least to anyone who wants proof that the American musical is not only surviving but also evolving in ways that should allow it to thrive and transmogrify in years to come.\"\n\nRead more",

The phrase 'CRITIC'S PICK' and the emphasis on the show's significance in the evolution of the American musical further support a rave classification. | Gemini: Despite the initial hesitation, the critic ultimately states the show is 'worth it' and highlights its importance to the evolution of the American musical, indicating a very strong positive recommendation.",
