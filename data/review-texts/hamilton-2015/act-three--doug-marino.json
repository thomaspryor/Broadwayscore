  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"This show, despite a major cast change, is a 10 out of 10. It's crisp, loud, and strong. I saw the swing cast - and even with these 3rd stringers - the show was magnificent and I cannot imagine it being better...To be fair - it's dense - very dense...I think the ensemble may just be the hardest working ensemble on Broadway today...It's a bona-fide hit and I am incredibly thankful for the ticket and will treasure my experience even more because of it.\"",
