    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Unqualified superlatives calling it potentially 'the nation's greatest musical' and suggesting no comparable work will emerge for a decade. This is extreme praise warranting the highest rave scores. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlative language, placing 'Hamilton' among the greatest American musicals and suggesting it may be the greatest ever. This indicates a strong, enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses superlatives and strongly suggests that Hamilton is one of the greatest American musicals, indicating a rave review. The excerpt expresses high praise and admiration for the show's quality and impact. | Kimi: While limited to a single excerpt, the provided quote offers unambiguous superlative praise ('nation's greatest musical'), warranting the upper range of the Positive bucket per scoring guidelines for curated excerpts.",
