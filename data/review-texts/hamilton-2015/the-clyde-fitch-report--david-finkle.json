    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Rave | Claude: The critic places Hamilton among the greatest American musicals ever written and suggests it may be THE greatest, with language indicating it's an exceptional, generational work that sets an extraordinarily high bar for future productions. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises 'Hamilton' as potentially the greatest American musical, indicating a strong positive assessment. The caution about a single excerpt suggests scoring conservatively within the 'Rave' bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, placing 'Hamilton' among the greatest American musicals and suggesting its quality is unlikely to be matched for years. This indicates a 'Rave' recommendation.",
