  "fullText": "New Broadway musical, at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, 226 W. 46th St.\n\nBook, music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Directed by Thomas Kail.\n\nWith Miranda, Daveed Diggs, Leslie Odom Jr., Phillipa Soo, Jonathan Groff and Christopher Jackson.\n\nTickets: $65.75 to $156.75. 877-250-2929, or at ticketmaster.com.\n\nThe first question critics usually consider when a hit off-Broadway show moves to Broadway is whether it works as well in a larger space.\n\nTo remove the suspense: \"Hamilton,\" which opened Thursday night at the Richard Rodgers Theatre — and much to no one’s surprise — does. Emphatically.\n\nEven before coming to Broadway, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical biography of Alexander Hamilton had become a major cultural event, building an anticipation that was evident in the happy, buzzy eagerness that suffused the audience before the show started the other night.\n\nFor once, though, it’s an event that hasn’t been over-hyped. The show is spectacularly unique, an endlessly clever history lesson that links us to the country’s Founding Fathers in an ingenious and compelling theatrical way.\n\nMiranda, who wrote book, music and lyrics, as well as starring as Hamilton, found his key in viewing his title character, born poor in the West Indies, as a prototypical striving immigrant, an outsider equipped with brains and a drive to succeed who makes it because he works harder than anyone else, although with an abrasiveness that creates enemies along the way.\n\nThe author goes one step further, though, in connecting us to Hamilton and his illustrious contemporaries. He’s cast them with African-American and Latino actors, emphasizing the diversity of our heritage and population. And, entirely befitting the revolutionary spirit of men who were creating a country on the fly, they often converse in inspired hip-hop lyrics.\n\nWhile Miranda is a good actor, who fits in neatly with a superb ensemble cast, it’s his writing and dramatic imagination that lift \"Hamilton\" to its exalted perch. For example, the debate between Hamilton and Jefferson (a funny, exuberant Daveed Diggs, who doubles as Lafayette) over whether the national government should assume the states’ debts is presented as a raucous rap competition between the two men. (Hamilton: \"Thomas, that was a real nice declaration. Welcome to the present. We’re running a real nation. Would you like to join us, or stay mellow, doin’ whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?\")\n\nA precious George III (a delightful Jonathan Groff) makes several disapproving appearances, singing numbers written in bouncy 1960s Brit-pop style.\n\nAnd Hamilton’s socialite wife, Eliza (the silken-voiced Phillipa Soo), and her two sisters perform a trio with some emphatic girl-group moves.\n\nThe spine of the musical’s story is the tangled relationship between Hamilton and Aaron Burr (given a sly deviousness by Leslie Odoms Jr.). Alternately friends and rivals, the equally ambitious New York lawyers are ultimately divided by their personal characters. The passionate, voluble Hamilton is emphatic in declaring his beliefs, while Burr — you can compare him to the current presidential candidate of your choosing — prefers to smile and keep his ideas to himself in case the political winds shift direction.\n\nThe entire evening, which includes Hamilton’s wartime service as an aide to George Washington (warmly played by Christopher Jackson as a wise and humane leader), his battle for a strong national government and his killing by Burr in 1804 in a duel in Weehawken, is encased in a production that’s total musical theater.\n\nThe feeling of movement, thanks to director Thomas Kail and choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler, is constant, whether in the forefront of big production numbers or as a kind of background embroidery in more intimate moments. And almost every scene has something urgent going on, sometimes touching, often funny, and even political.\n\nThere are probably a half-dozen more things I could rave about, but, essentially, \"Hamilton\" is just a really, really terrific show.",
