  "fullText": "The wonderful dancing chorus seems to have more room to perform its leaps and bounds, and the individual characters have always been larger than life in the first place. In fact, Leslie Odom Jr. seems even more invested in the difficult character of Aaron Burr, really sinking his teeth into the frustration and yearning that this troubled character reveals...Like any true landmark, \"Hamilton\" stands up to repeated viewings. After six months, the show's initial impact hasn't dulled a bit; in fact, the qualities that made it so extraordinary the first time around are all the more striking...That rapper style, with its interlocking interior rhymes and pounding cadences, perfectly captures Hamilton's feverish intelligence and hyperarticulate manner. But instead of keeping to a single uniform musical style (hip-hop or otherwise), as traditional shows often have, Miranda continues to draw from all available styles and musical sources, from nursery lullaby to rock 'n' roll and operetta, in order to capture the soul of a character and the spirit of the moment. If this sort of thing catches on, the old, reliable Broadway showtune may be a thing of the past.",
