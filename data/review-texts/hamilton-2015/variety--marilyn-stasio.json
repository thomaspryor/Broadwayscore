But this innovative show is shaping up to be just as much of a phenomenon uptown, playing in a Broadway house with four times the seating capacity, and to a more traditional but no less enthusiastic audience. That universal appeal to crossover audiences is one unmistakable sign of a groundbreaking show. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-variety-article-mid-article-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\",\"mid-article\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[300,250],[2,2],[300,251],[2,4],[4,2],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Whatever technical adjustments might have been necessary to move the production into a larger space are not evident from an audience&#8217;s perspective. The wonderful dancing chorus seems to have more room to perform its leaps and bounds, and the individual characters have always been larger than life in the first place. In fact, Leslie Odom Jr. seems even more invested in the difficult character of Aaron Burr, really sinking his teeth into the frustration and yearning that this troubled character reveals in &#8220;The Room Where It Happens.&#8221; And Christopher Jackson&#8217;s manly General Washington is even more moving when he acknowledges, in &#8220;One Last Time,&#8221; that his days as the nation&#8217;s leader are indeed over.
