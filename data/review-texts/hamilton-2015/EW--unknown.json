  "bwwExcerpt": "ndheim and even Cole Porter. No need to go into all the lyrics here, but Miranda has a syllable-by-syllable rhyme for \"pseudonym,\" and many other words, that is absolutely delicious. Leah Greenblatt, Entertainment Weekly : Miranda's singular gift for storytelling and wordplay makes even the Federalist Papers sound sexy, but the play's intrigue come mostly from its potent stew of friendship and romance and outsize ambition; it's as if House of Cards were folded into a sort of Days of Our Colonial Lives fever dream, then filtered through the minds of Tupac and Sondheim.

Ham. from the $10 greenback; even so, the man seems to have a considerably wider smile this morning.
