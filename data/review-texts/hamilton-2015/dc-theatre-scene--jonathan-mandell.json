  "fullText": "Now that it has opened on Broadway, Hamilton has the potential to do something revolutionary -- to help dissolve Broadway's dependence on British imports, and throw off the tyranny of Hollywood adaptations...In almost three dozen songs over three hours, we witness the extraordinary high points and peculiar low points in Alexander Hamilton's life...But the most interesting relationship in the musical is between Hamilton and Burr...Musically bold and eclectic...Hamilton is the first to use rap to tell a story that has no direct connection to contemporary hip-hop culture -- done so well that it never feels like a campy anachronism, but rather like a translation that adds clarity and even a kind of heft to the proceedings...Rap, however, is not the only color on the musical palette. Miranda's score features some delightful jazz, rhythm and blues, Beatles-like pop, contemporary ballads, and even a smidgen of light opera...It's thrilling to watch...Miranda has a star's charisma...He hasn't shaped a new country. But he has reacquainted us with somebody who did -- and in doing so may wind up shaping a new theater.",
