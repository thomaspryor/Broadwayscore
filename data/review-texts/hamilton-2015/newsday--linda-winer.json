  "fullText": "Instead, the show -- which tells early American history in its own time but shot through with multicultural urban sensibility -- is even more nuanced, more cohesive in individual performances and its more focused finale. Most important, Miranda and director Thomas Kail have fine-tuned it without losing a shiver of its audacity and thrill. The musical -- written and composed by its star -- manages to be radical and satirical, yet good-hearted...The jagged, sly poetry and overlapping storytelling barrel through, dense and fast, except when choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler's lusciously visceral dancers shock us in slow motion. Miranda, who plays Hamilton with wit and an exquisitely endearing inelegance, doesn't preach...However, this is anything but a one-man show. Every supporting character is a vivid personality.",
