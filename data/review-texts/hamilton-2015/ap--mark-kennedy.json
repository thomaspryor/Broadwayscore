  "bwwExcerpt": "nals Broadway's greater acceptance of diverse contemporary music, the musical's major appeal is as old as Rodgers and Hammerstein: good writing. They loved it in the 1700s, and they're loving it now. Mark Kennedy, Associated Press : The hip-hop-based musical about Alexander Hamilton, the first treasury secretary of the United States, has gotten even more \"scrappy and hungry\" like its hero...This is a musical often stunning in its audaciousness...Perhaps Act 2 wanders a bit and the ending is a slight let-down. But there's no denying the show's sheer brashness and freshness. It is a revolution: A reclaiming of America's founding story by a multicultural cast using modern music and themes...The standout performances are Leslie Odom Jr. as a wary Aaron Burr, a cautious yin to Hamilton's impulsive yang. Odom throws down a career-defining marker here, graceful and cunning and haunted as both the narrator and the man who will kill Hamilton in 1804. Renee Elise Goldsberry as Hamilton's sister-",
