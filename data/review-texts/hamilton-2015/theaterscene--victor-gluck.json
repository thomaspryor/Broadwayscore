  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'Hamilton' does for the American Revolution what 'Les Miserables' does for French 19th century history. However, its contemporary sound turns 'Hamilton' into a theatrical revolution that is just short of titanic. From the expert cast to the impeccable design team to the splendid score and text, 'Hamilton' makes musical theater history. Just a warning: don't come tired! 'Hamilton' is fast moving and jam-packed with information. You will want all your faculties about you.\"",
