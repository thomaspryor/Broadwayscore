Miranda’s sung-through biographical musical delivers a portrait of 18th-century political rivalries inflamed to the boiling point by ambition, ego, partisanship, opportunism, and a thirst for power that feels all too contemporary. Even, at times, Trumpian.\n\nYet “Hamilton’’ does not seem primarily driven, as the more snarky, take-no-prisoners “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson’’ did, by a desire to demystify and demythologize. Instead, by casting performers of color and telling the nation’s origin story in a contemporary idiom, “Hamilton’’  aims to give that story a present-day urgency while putting a broader frame around the democratic experiment of which that nation is the embodiment, as if Miranda is saying that 1) it belongs to all of us, and 2) it remains a work in progress.\n\n“Hamilton’’ is infused with reminders that we are a nation of immigrants; in one defiantly knowing nod to that hot-button issue, Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette declare in unison: “Immigrants: We get the job done.’’\n\nBrilliantly staged by director Thomas Kail, “Hamilton’’ features dynamic choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler that consistently infuses movement with meaning. Which is not to say that words take a back seat here. Quite the contrary: This is a show intoxicated by language.\n\nMiranda gives free rein to his talent for communicating ideas and personalities in the staccato rhymes of hip-hop — a gift also evident through much of “In the Heights,’’ his 2008 musical about the Dominican-American community in New York’s Washington Heights (presented at Boston’s SpeakEasy Stage Company two years ago). To cite just one instance in “Hamilton,’’ the title figure engages in a rap battle with Thomas Jefferson, played (superbly) as a scheming and irreverent egomaniac by Daveed Diggs, who also doubles as Lafayette.\n\nVivid performances are also delivered by Leslie Odom Jr., as Aaron Burr, a man to be reckoned with from the start; Christopher Jackson, embodying gravitas as George Washington; Phillipa Soo, all grace and heart as Hamilton’s wife, Eliza; the luminous Renee Elise Goldsberry as Eliza’s sister Angelica, to whom Hamilton is initially attracted; and Okieriete Onaodowan as James Madison. Jonathan Groff is hilarious as a sniffy King George, airily treating the rebellious colonies like a wayward spouse in “You’ll Be Back.’’\n\nAt the musical’s center is the man described in the show’s lyrics as “the ten-dollar Founding Father without a father’’: Alexander Hamilton, born out of wedlock on a Caribbean island.  Miranda endows Hamilton with the restless intelligence of an outsider determined to claw his way inside and stay there. In an early musical number, the galvanic “My Shot,’’ Miranda’s Hamilton declares: “Hey yo, I’m just like my country/ I’m young, scrappy and hungry/ And I’m not throwing away my shot.’’\n\n“Hamilton’’ covers a lot of ground — emotional, historical — on the wooden scaffolding of David Korins’s set, with a rotating turntable at center stage that is put to effective use by director Kail. The show chronicles Hamilton’s private life, including a costly infidelity and the devastating loss of a son, and his remarkable public life. Hamilton progresses from Washington’s chief aide to primary author of the Federalist Papers. He serves as the first secretary of the US Treasury, creates the country’s financial system, and becomes a fierce political opponent of Burr, which leads to the duel that costs Hamilton his life.\n\nArriving on Broadway burdened with the weight of expectation, having become a much-coveted ticket after its earlier run at the Public Theater, “Hamilton’’ proves more than able to carry that weight. This musical is young, scrappy, hungry — and exhilarating.\n\nBook, music, and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda; inspired by the book “Alexander Hamilton,’’ by Ron Chernow.\n\nMusic direction and orchestrations, Alex Lacamoire. Choreography, Andy Blankenbuehler. Set, David Korins. Costumes, Paul Tazewell. Lights, Howell Binkley.\n\nAt: Richard Rodgers Theatre, New York.
