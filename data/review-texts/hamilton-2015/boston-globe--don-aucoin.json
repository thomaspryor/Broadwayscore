  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"In his stylish and electrifying 'Hamilton,' Miranda fuses the immediacy and storytelling power of hip-hop and R&B with the revolutionary passions of a new nation heaving itself into existence... Arriving on Broadway burdened with the weight of expectation, having become a much-coveted ticket, 'Hamilton' proves more than able to carry that weight. This musical is young, scrappy, hungry - and exhilarating.\"",
