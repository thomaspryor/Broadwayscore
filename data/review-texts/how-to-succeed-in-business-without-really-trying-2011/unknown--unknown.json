    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Single excerpt clearly criticizes the production as suffering from extremes and being exhausting with excessive runtime. However, confidence is low due to limited text availability - this could be from a longer mixed or more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the production for being 'cartoonish' and 'exhausting,' suggesting a negative view. However, with only one excerpt, the full context is unclear, leading to low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the production as cartoonish, exhausting, and too long, indicating a negative assessment. Given that it is only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers an unambiguous negative verdict, criticizing the production for exhausting excess and excessive runtime. However, confidence is low as only a single curated excerpt is available, which may not capture the full review's balance.",
