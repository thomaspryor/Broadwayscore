  "bwwExcerpt": "You start hoping for the best. Radcliffe's charm quotient is high, he showed significant stage chops two seasons ago in 'Equus,' and he grew up loving musical theater. In the opening number he displays a thin but true singing voice. But by the time he and a subdued Rob Bartlett get through Loesser's hilarious paean to yes men, 'The Company Way,' without generating a single laugh, it's clear we're in trouble. Once we get to Finch's Act 2 showstopper 'I Believe in You,' and Radcliffe merely stands there staring determinedly in the washroom mirror during the instrumental fills designed to give Morse room for sublime bits of comic business, well, the jig has long been up.",
