However, the review is brief, so the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review is positive, highlighting Daniel Radcliffe's performance and describing the revival as \"buoyant.\" However, it's a brief statement, so I've scored it in the middle of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic offers unambiguous praise for both the revival ('buoyant') and the lead performance ('charming,' 'youthful energy'), indicating a solid recommendation despite the brevity of the excerpt.",
