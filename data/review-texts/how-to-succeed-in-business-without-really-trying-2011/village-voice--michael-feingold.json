  "bwwExcerpt": "Radcliffe is mainly earnest. He doesn't come off as someone trying to act earnest to get ahead but as someone who's just plain earnest. It's weird. But he's perfectly game and is to commended for continually trying to break out of his ascribed teen idol role. Alas, the big number 'I Believe In You' falters without any sense of unrequited self love to propel it. Ironically, Radcliffe looks terrified! But he does nicely on the song 'Rosemary' and scores every time he turns to the audience with a grin whenever he's gotten another promotion.",
