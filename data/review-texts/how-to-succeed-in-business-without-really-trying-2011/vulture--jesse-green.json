    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Faint praise that acknowledges Radcliffe's energy and suggests fans will be pleased, but lacks any strong recommendation or evaluation of the production's quality. The truncated nature and lukewarm tone place this in mixed territory. | Gemini: The review acknowledges Radcliffe's energy and appeal to his fans, but it doesn't offer a strong recommendation or discouragement, placing it in the mixed category. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the lead performance and suggests the show satisfies its target audience, though the extreme brevity prevents a definitive assessment of the full critical verdict.",
