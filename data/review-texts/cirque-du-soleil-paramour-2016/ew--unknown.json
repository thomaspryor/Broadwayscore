  "bwwExcerpt": "About 45 minutes into Paramour, the Cirque du Soleil musical that opens at Broadway's Lyric Theatre tonight, the twin aerialists Andrew and Kevin Atherton are suspended over a stage set of what's supposed to be a movie set of Ancient Egypt. They're a striking pair: platinum blond, lantern-jawed, impossibly toned, and mirror images, each hanging from a strap and effortlessly contorting himself, dozens of feet above the stage. It's the sort of breathtaking, beautiful athleticism you expect from Cirque du Soleil, and it's thrilling. The audience is rapt. At the end of their number, the Atherton twins get the evening's biggest applause.",
