  "bwwExcerpt": "..their latest effort attempts to combine Cirque's trademark acrobatic acts with an original Broadway musical. Unfortunately, the resulting hybrid, Paramour, is more Frankenstein's monster than love child...The $25 million production is a traditionally-styled Broadway musical, albeit a very mediocre one, infused with the sort of acrobatic routines normally seen under a big top...And so it goes throughout melodramatic proceedings in which the humor is largely unintentional...Granted, audiences going to a Cirque du Soleil show expect extravagant acrobatics. But the creators of Paramour - tellingly, no writer is credited - seem to have gone out of their way to produce as banal and generic a musical as possible. Featuring atrocious dialogue and forgettable songs, it feels more like a parody than the real thing...The show does have some imaginative, thrilling sequences...Kushnier delivers a thoroughly professional performance in his thankless role, and Lewis and Vona are both appealing....",
