  "bwwExcerpt": "All things considered, 'Paramour' is a lame, harmless alternative for international tourists who want to see a Broadway show but would prefer something with the Cirque du Soleil imprimatur than a long-running hit like 'Chicago,' 'The Lion King' or 'The Phantom of the Opera.' Frankly, I think they can do better.",
