  "bwwExcerpt": "All things considered, 'Paramour' is a lame, harmless alternative for international tourists who want to see a Broadway show but would prefer something with the Cirque du Soleil imprimatur than a long-running hit like 'Chicago,' 'The Lion King' or 'The Phantom of the Opera.' Frankly, I think they can do better.",

Clear negative recommendation despite acknowledging it as 'harmless.' | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'lame' and suggests that audiences 'can do better,' indicating a lack of recommendation. The tone is dismissive, though not extremely harsh, placing it in the Negative bucket. | Gemini: The review calls the show \"lame\" and suggests that tourists can do better, indicating a negative recommendation. The single excerpt and lack of a clear rating make confidence medium. | Kimi: The critic explicitly advises against seeing the show, dismissing it as 'lame' and directing tourists toward superior Broadway options like 'Chicago' or 'The Lion King' instead.",
