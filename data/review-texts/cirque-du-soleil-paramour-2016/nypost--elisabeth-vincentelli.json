The 'but' construction emphasizes that aesthetic positives don't overcome fundamental structural problems. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the visual appeal but criticizes the show as an 'incoherent mess,' indicating a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review presents conflicting opinions, praising the visuals while criticizing the narrative incoherence, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging the visual appeal ('undeniably gorgeous'), the critic delivers a clear non-recommendation using harsh language ('incoherent mess'), indicating the production fails at a fundamental level despite its aesthetics.",
