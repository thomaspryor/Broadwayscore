  "bwwExcerpt": "This week, after numerous, internationally popular productions, the enterprise now called Cirque du Soleil Theatrical opened 'Paramour,' the first musical created by Cirque Du Soleil for Broadway...only the circus acts soar, sometimes literally, as the show's musical and film elements play, at best, dutiful and uninspired parts...The music...is undistinguished and overamplified...Jeremy Kushnier, looking and sounding mostly mousey, plays AJ, a bearded, wax-mustached, egotistical film director. Ruby Lewis-wide of face, short of neck and plain of voice-portrays Indigo...The Golden Age of Hollywood invoked in the program and in the art-deco look of Jean Rabasse's sometimes impressive settings dims noticeably when projection designers Olivier Simola and Christophe Waksmann add video images to the stage pictures....Daphné Mauger's choreography for the various ensembles and for the leads serves as little more than filler throughout....",
