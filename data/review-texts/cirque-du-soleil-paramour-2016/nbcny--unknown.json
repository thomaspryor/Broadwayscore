  "bwwExcerpt": "...The $25 million 'Paramour' goes heavy on the company's signature stunt sequences to our relief, because there isn't much to be extracted from the often eye-glazing book and score...'Paramour' earns props for the ways it employs aerialists and acrobats as doppelgängers for the leads. Thanks to clever costuming conceits, we almost believe we're watching the trio in some blur of elastic trickery...Kushnier...makes the most of his cliché-ridden role, exuding confidence and hubris as needed. Lewis...has a beautiful voice and gamely follows the worn path laid out ahead.",
