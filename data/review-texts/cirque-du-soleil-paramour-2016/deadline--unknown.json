  "bwwExcerpt": "...this is the show with which the Montreal-based global franchise plants its standard on Broadway, promising - and, in spades, delivering - a mashup of 42nd Street backstage romance, non-stop Ziegfeld folly and Cirque's brand of acrobatic arts...It's as eye-popping as Christmas at Radio City Music Hall, if not quite as intimate or touching....We've come for the visuals and while it's doubtful that Paramour audiences will come away disappointed in that department, they may wonder why that annoying story kept stopping the action dead in its computer-assisted tracks...did I mention the horrible music? Well, with Cirque that's a given.",
