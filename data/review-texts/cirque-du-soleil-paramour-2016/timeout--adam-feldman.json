    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic's 40/100 rating and description of internal conflict ('at war with itself') indicates a mixed assessment that neither recommends nor discourages viewing. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 40 aligns with a negative assessment. The review describes the show as conflicted and lacking coherence, suggesting a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The critic uses language that indicates a struggle between good and bad elements, but ultimately the show is 'at war with itself,' suggesting a negative overall experience. The original rating of 40 confirms this. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as fundamentally conflicted between quality and mediocrity, and the explicit 40-point rating places it firmly in the Negative range. The excerpt is extremely brief, warranting low confidence.",
