  "bwwExcerpt": "Fitfully thrilling and consistently baffling, Paramour - Cirque du Soleil's first attempt at a Broadway book musical - is the story of a young singer torn between the megalomaniacal director, who wants to make her his star, and the tender songwriter, who wants to make her his muse. Or perhaps it's a parable of forbidden love as enacted by shirtless twins in an erotic aerial pas de deux. Or maybe it's a wacky caper comedy with a culminating chase scene performed atop a giant trampoline. Honestly, it's hard to tell.",
