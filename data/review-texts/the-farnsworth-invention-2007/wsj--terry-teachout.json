    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic finds the play both 'engrossing' and 'irritating' - classic mixed language. However, with only one excerpt available, this could be cherry-picked from a longer review with a clearer verdict either direction. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as both 'engrossing' and 'irritating', indicating a mixed reception. The single excerpt warning and lack of a clear positive or negative tilt suggest a balanced view. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a mixed assessment, describing the play as both \"engrossing\" and \"irritating,\" indicating a lack of clear recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt balances strong positive qualities ('engrossing', 'slick') against clear negatives ('irritating'), indicating an uneven, mixed verdict without explicit recommendation. Single excerpt availability limits confidence.",
