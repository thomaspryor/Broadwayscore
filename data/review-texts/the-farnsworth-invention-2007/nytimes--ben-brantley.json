    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it 'clever, fast-paced' and 'entertaining and instructive' but qualifies with 'sometimes feels more like a very good lecture than a fully realized play.' This suggests a positive but reserved recommendation. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as 'clever, fast-paced' and 'entertaining and instructive,' suggesting a positive tone. However, the mention of it feeling like a 'very good lecture' indicates some reservation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the play as \"clever, fast-paced, entertaining and instructive,\" but also notes that it \"sometimes feels more like a very good lecture than a fully realized play.\" This suggests a positive but qualified recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it cautiously. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, commending the show as clever and entertaining while criticizing it for feeling more like a lecture than a fully realized play. Given the single excerpt limitation, this represents a mild recommendation.",
