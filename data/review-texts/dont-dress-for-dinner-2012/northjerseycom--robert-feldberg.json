    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic describes the show as a 'labored farce' and finds it 'distressing,' indicating clear disappointment. However, with only one curated excerpt available, the full verdict remains uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses a strong negative sentiment, describing the show as 'distressing' and 'labored'. Given the single excerpt warning, this may not reflect the entire review, but the tone suggests a pan. | Gemini: The single excerpt expresses a negative sentiment about labored farces, suggesting the reviewer did not enjoy the show. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as a 'labored farce' that is 'distressing,' indicating the critic found the production painful to watch and ineffective. Given this is a single curated excerpt, confidence is low as the full review may contain additional context or counterpoints.",
