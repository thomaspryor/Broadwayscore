  "bwwExcerpt": "I found “Don’t Dress for Dinner” to be head-knockingly convoluted. So do its characters, as they try to explain what’s going on as the two-act moves to resolve itself; part of the gag is that when they attempt to sort everything out, you can’t follow a thing they are saying past the first two sentences...In the end, it didn’t matter, since the situation of the moment becomes clear with a nastily aimed squirt of a seltzer bottle or a shove that has people falling over the side of a couch.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | No bucket consensus - using median score | Claude: The critic finds the show confusing and hard to follow, but acknowledges some effective physical comedy moments. However, with only a truncated excerpt available, the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The review describes the play as 'head-knockingly convoluted' but notes that the confusion doesn't matter due to comedic physical actions. The single excerpt suggests a mixed experience with some entertaining moments, but the limited text and lack of a clear verdict reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the play as convoluted and difficult to follow. The critic uses negative language and the ending is cut off, suggesting a negative overall assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic finds the plot 'head-knockingly convoluted' and difficult to follow, they indicate that the physical comedy and slapstick ultimately make the show work ('it didn't matter'), representing a qualified recommendation. Score reflects the single-excerpt, truncated nature of the text. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Positive",
