  "bwwExcerpt": "'American Psycho' creates another sub-genre - ersatz horror - an odd variation that fails to tingle your spine with its copious bloodletting or titillate you via the writhing bodies in its mechanical sex scenes (complete with pornographic video illustrations). Director Rupert Goold's shiny production, churning vapidly to the beat of composer Duncan Sheik's surprisingly clunky, characterless songs, charts the homicidal rampage of Patrick (Benjamin Walker) through the cash-engorged precincts of the Manhattan of the decadent '80s; Es Devlin's eye-catchingly sleek sets are the production's best asset. And then, in an odd departure from the novel, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa's script pulls the blood-soaked rug out from under us, with the suggestion of a Patrick reborn, as a better man.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Critic finds the production 'vapid' with 'clunky, characterless songs' that fails to achieve its horror goals. While acknowledging some positives (sleek sets), the overall assessment is clearly negative. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the production for its lack of impact and mechanical execution, despite acknowledging the sleek set design. The overall tone suggests disappointment, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"fails to tingle\", \"surprisingly clunky, characterless songs\", and \"churning vapidly\". The best asset is the set design, which is not enough to make it a positive review. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic pans the production's effectiveness as horror, criticizes the music as 'clunky' and 'characterless,' and finds the staging mechanical, though offers limited praise for the set design as the 'best asset.'",
