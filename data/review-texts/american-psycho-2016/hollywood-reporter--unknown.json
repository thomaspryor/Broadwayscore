  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Rupert Goold, composer Duncan Sheik and book writer Roberta Aguirre-Sacasa crank up the satirical volume on Bret Easton Ellis' cult novel in a musical with design to die for and a cool, period-appropriate electro-pop score... the show is a very sharp, distinctly theatrical treatment of its source material, in many ways improving on Mary Harron's movie version from 2000...Goold and Aguirre-Sacasa have been prudent in toning down the book's perceived misogyny and sexual violence while honing its acerbic portrait of late capitalism in a milieu where surface is everything...Walker is charismatic and commanding, but it's the broken, corrosively conflicted aspects of his characterization that make the performance so hypnotic...Helene Yorke, hilarious as Patrick's aggressively superficial fiancée Evelyn...Alice Ripley...can't do much with the role of Patrick's medicated mother...But Jennifer Damiano finds poignancy in the good-girl part of Patrick's smitten secretary Jean...Still, even with its flaws the musical is a bloody good time.",
