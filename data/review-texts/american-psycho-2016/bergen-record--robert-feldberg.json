  "bwwExcerpt": "With its stark black and white design, projections, flashing lights and pounding music, 'American Psycho' is insistently modish, and Goold, who staged a memorably headlong production of 'Macbeth' with Patrick Stewart several years ago, is certainly a dynamic director. But while heartless flash might be the perfect style for depicting the empty '80s, it doesn't make for a very fulfilling 2 1/2 hours in the theater.",
