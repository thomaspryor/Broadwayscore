  "bwwExcerpt": "With its stark black and white design, projections, flashing lights and pounding music, 'American Psycho' is insistently modish, and Goold, who staged a memorably headlong production of 'Macbeth' with Patrick Stewart several years ago, is certainly a dynamic director. But while heartless flash might be the perfect style for depicting the empty '80s, it doesn't make for a very fulfilling 2 1/2 hours in the theater.",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the dynamic direction and stylish elements but ultimately criticizes the show for being unfulfilling, suggesting a negative overall impression. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the dynamic direction and stylish design but ultimately finds the experience unfulfilling. Given the limited text, a mixed score seems most appropriate. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the production's stylish visuals and dynamic direction as appropriate to the material, but explicitly states the show does not provide a fulfilling theatrical experience, recommending against seeing it.",
