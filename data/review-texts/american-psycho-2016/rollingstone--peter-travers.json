    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'bloody brilliant piece of theater' with positive assessment of lead performance. Single excerpt limits full context understanding. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, calling the adaptation 'bloody brilliant,' which suggests a highly positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"magnetic\" and \"bloody brilliant piece of theater,\" indicating a strong recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers enthusiastic praise ('bloody brilliant', 'magnetic') suggesting a strong recommendation, but as a single curated quote it may not capture the full review's nuance or potential reservations.",
