    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic directly calls the show 'a mess' and criticizes its 'terminally undecided tone,' indicating a clear negative assessment. However, confidence is low due to the truncated excerpt warning - the full verdict may be more nuanced. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'mess' with a 'terminally undecided tone,' indicating a negative assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt calls the show a \"mess\" due to its \"terminally undecided tone.\" This indicates a negative assessment, though the truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers a clear negative verdict ('is a mess') citing fundamental tonal problems, despite acknowledging the polished visual design. With only a single curated excerpt available, confidence is reduced, but the language clearly places this in the Negative bucket.",
