  "bwwExcerpt": "That depends on what you're in the mood for. If topping your list of requirements is a stunning enterprise, you're advised to speed yourself-not necessarily on speed-to the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, where Es Devlin has constructed a sleek white-and-grey set that instantly announces the film-noirish treatment director Rupert Goold has committed to make of Bret Easton Ellis's 1991 American Psychonovel.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic uses 'stunning enterprise' and actively advises readers to 'speed yourself' to see it, praising the set design and direction. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive recommendation, highlighting the impressive set design and film-noir treatment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive experience, particularly highlighting the set design. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low, and the score is placed at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly advises audiences to attend if they appreciate visual spectacle, praising the 'sleek' set and 'film-noirish' direction as a 'stunning enterprise'. While the recommendation opens with a conditional caveat, the evaluative language is clearly positive and enthusiastic about the production values.",
