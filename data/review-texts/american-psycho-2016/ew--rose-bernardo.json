    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it a 'perversely enjoyable experience' and praises the script for deftly capturing the source material, but the conditional phrasing 'if you can resign yourself' suggests reservations. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive recommendation with the phrase 'perversely enjoyable experience,' despite acknowledging the story's ambiguity. The curated nature of the excerpt and lack of full context necessitate a cautious approach, placing the score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review suggests an enjoyable experience, but with the caveat of accepting the story's ambiguity. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('perversely enjoyable,' 'deftly skewers') despite a caveat about the story's ambiguity, indicating a positive recommendation. Single excerpt limits confidence.",
