    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Critic explicitly calls it 'a failure' while acknowledging intellectual interest. Single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked from a longer mixed assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'failure', indicating a negative verdict. However, the term 'interesting failure' suggests some redeeming qualities or thought-provoking elements, which prevents it from being a complete pan. The single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review explicitly calls the show a failure, but qualifies it as an \"interesting failure,\" suggesting a mixed assessment. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic finds intellectual value in the show's ambition ('interesting failure,' raises questions about the form), the explicit verdict is that 'the show is a failure,' indicating a recommendation against seeing it despite acknowledging its artistic risks.",
