Given strong praise elements and single excerpt warning, scoring upper end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction, music, and design, describing the show as 'very sharp' and 'distinctly theatrical'. Despite limited text, the positive tone suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the direction, music, and design, suggesting a positive overall experience. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers strong praise for the creative team's adaptation and the production design ('to die for'), indicating an enthusiastic recommendation despite limited available text.",
