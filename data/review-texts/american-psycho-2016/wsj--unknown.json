  "fullText": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/american-psycho-the-musical-review-serial-killer-chic-1461285000\n\nTwenty-five years ago, Bret Easton Ellis published a novel about a Wall Street yuppie who killed and dismembered women after hours. “American Psycho” purported to be a satire, but the critics either didn’t get the point or (far more likely) failed to find it funny, and the book got nothing but bad reviews. Nowadays, though, serial murder is all the rage, and “American Psycho: The Musical” has just arrived on Broadway after a critically acclaimed, commercially successful London run. Will it do as well with the New York tourist trade? Beats me, but if it does, then you really can fool some of the people all of the time: “American Psycho” is slick, sleek and empty, a one-joke show that drowns its message, such as it is, in red sauce and fake emotion.",
