  "bwwExcerpt": "Patrick - a young investment banker who moonlights as a serial killer - popped up on a London stage a few years ago, in a musical adaptation that actually proved more entertaining and poignant than its source. That show has now brought Patrick and his story home, and they're scarier and more thrilling than ever...reminds us how little has changed in the past 30 years. Patrick's idol Donald Trump, mentioned more than once in Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa's razor-sharp libretto, looms larger and sparks more debate than ever...The triumph of this American Psycho, directed with gale force and fabulous style byRupert Goold, is that it doesn't get lost in the details informing its brilliant, brutal satire... Es Devlin's cold, sleek set design...Katrina Lindsay's alternately slick and garish costumes reinforce both the superficiality of Patrick's lifestyle and the throbbing tension underneath....Walker's witty, terrifying Patrick - disturbingly sexy, then unexpectedly moving- holds us rapt throughout.",

The 'which may be the point' suggests uncertainty about whether this is intentional artistry or a genuine flaw, indicating ambivalence rather than clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the production's style but criticizes its emotional depth, suggesting a mixed impression without a clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (\"slick and stylish\") but ultimately finds the show \"emotionally hollow,\" suggesting a mixed or neutral recommendation. | Kimi: The review offers genuine praise for the production values ('slick and stylish') but levels a significant criticism about the show's emotional impact ('hollow'), resulting in a balanced but unenthusiastic assessment without a clear recommendation to see or skip the show.",
