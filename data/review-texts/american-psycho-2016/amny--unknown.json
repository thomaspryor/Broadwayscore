  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Rupert Goold, songwriter Duncan Sheik and book-writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa persuasively capture the designer chic milieu, materialistic attitude and dance club sound of 1980s Manhattan while adding a pervading sense of eerie unease...Benjamin Walker's Bateman brings to mind a Ken doll with a dirty mind and a butcher knife. He captures the character's crisp, cocky demeanor and the lost, twisted psyche underneath the impeccable exterior. The strong cast also includes Heléne Yorke as Bateman's high-strung girlfriend, Jennifer Damiano as his sweet young secretary and Tony winner Alice Ripley as his heavily medicated mother...Notwithstanding all this, the piece has serious structural problems...It also ends on an unapologetically depressing note.",
