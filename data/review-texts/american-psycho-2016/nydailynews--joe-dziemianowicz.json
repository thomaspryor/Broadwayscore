    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt shows initial enthusiasm ('killer buzz', 'wicked wit', 'catchy ear candy') but indicates the show deteriorates ('Euphoria sinks once corpses pile up'). This suggests a mixed experience that starts strong but disappoints. Single excerpt warning requires caution - this could be from a longer negative review. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights positive elements like 'wicked wit' and 'catchy ear candy' but notes that 'euphoria sinks' as the show progresses. This suggests a mixed experience with initial appeal that diminishes, leading to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The review starts with praise but then mentions the euphoria sinks, indicating a mixed opinion. The truncated text and single excerpt make it difficult to determine the overall recommendation with high confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the show's style, music and cast but indicates the energy and appeal decline significantly as the violent plot progresses, suggesting an inconsistent experience rather than a full recommendation.",
