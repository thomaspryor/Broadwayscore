  "bwwExcerpt": "A bold and perilous artistic endeavor, this musical is also something of a tonal muddle, approaching the material from myriad angles - some serious, some sleazy, some nice, some nasty - which don't ultimately form a persuasive whole...As adapted by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, scored by Duncan Sheik, and directed by Rupert Goold, this is an inarguably stylish undertaking and sometimes an exciting one...Often the production delights, in ways camp and comedic, in the ugly extravagance of the period...Walker, looking like a brilliantined Ken Doll, gives another galvanic turn, communicating the seductiveness, playfulness, and terrible vacancy that define Bateman...So is this satire or psychodrama, monstrous comedy or moral horror? It's all and it's nothing, too.",

This suggests a mixed verdict with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges stylishness and excitement but ultimately finds the show a \"tonal muddle\" that doesn't form a \"persuasive whole.\" The final question suggests a lack of clear direction, placing it in the Mixed category. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the stylish direction and galvanic lead performance while criticizing the show as a 'tonal muddle' that fails to cohere into a 'persuasive whole,' ending on an ambiguous note that suggests it succeeds and fails at everything simultaneously.",
