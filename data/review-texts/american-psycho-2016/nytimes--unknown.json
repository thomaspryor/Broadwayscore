  "bwwExcerpt": "Though it often looks as carefully and cosmetically arranged as a window at Barneys, Patrick's favorite store,...'American Psycho' is a mess. That's not because of all that sloppy, sloshy blood, but because of its terminally undecided tone. This latest incarnation...suffers from the weight of having to be a big Broadway musical...Even more than Matt Smith, who originated the role in London, Mr. Walker presents Patrick as an insecure man who deeply needs to fit in and despises himself for doing so...Mr. Walker, who oozed charisma in 'Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,' holds the show together, for sure...Mostly, though, this psycho is neither scary nor sexy, nor is the show in which he appears.",
