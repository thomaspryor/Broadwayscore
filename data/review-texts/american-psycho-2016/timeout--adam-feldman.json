The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the musical's success in adapting the novel but notes that it doesn't fully capture the book's 'savage bite,' indicating a mixed assessment. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60 rating and the qualified praise ('succeeds... even if') indicate a middle-ground assessment that acknowledges the production's competence while noting it fails to fully capture the source material's edge.",
