    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Single excerpt shows praise for production values and lead performance but identifies a fundamental structural flaw. The 'but' pivot and 'never quite finds its footing' suggests the critic sees promise but finds the execution lacking. Given only one excerpt available, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The original rating of 40 suggests a negative review. The excerpt highlights a strong lead performance but criticizes the show for not finding its footing, indicating overall disappointment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (slick, stylish, strong lead) but ultimately states the show 'never quite finds its footing,' indicating a negative overall assessment. Given the critic's rating of 40, I've placed it in the negative bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production values and lead performance but identifies a critical tonal confusion that undermines the show, aligning with the critic's 40/100 rating. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is low.",
