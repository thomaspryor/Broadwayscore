  "bwwExcerpt": "Sheik's music gives Bateman a soul. It's the nature of musical theater...Walker emerges as far more tortured than Bale, who becomes a touch more manic...Musicals need more narrative drive than movies, and Walker (with help from Aguirre-Sacasa) supplies it...Es Devlin's set design also provides a marvelous journey...Depending on how you look at 'American Psycho,' it's either horrifying or a hoot...Goold and his book writer sometimes scrape the bottom.",
