  "bwwExcerpt": "Benjamin Walker is toned and resplendent in his tighty whities...his fiancée, played with hilarious archness by Heléne Yorke...The second act flags...but the score is strong...Duncan Sheik's synthesizer-heavy music - radical by Broadway standards...finally delivers a worthy follow-up to his 'Spring Awakening.' A comic 'American Psycho' you can dance to? Somehow, it works.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite noting second act issues, the critic concludes positively with 'Somehow, it works' and praises the strong score and Duncan Sheik's worthy follow-up to Spring Awakening. Single excerpt context suggests cherry-picked positive elements, warranting upper-positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and music, noting that it 'works' despite some issues with the second act. The positive tone is clear but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, suggesting a mild recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the lead actor, a supporting actress, and the score, while noting that the second act flags. The final verdict is positive ('Somehow, it works.'). | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the performances and Duncan Sheik's score, calling it a worthy follow-up to Spring Awakening, and concludes the show 'works' despite noting second act pacing issues.",
