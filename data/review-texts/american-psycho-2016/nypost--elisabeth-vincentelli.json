  "bwwExcerpt": "Benjamin Walker is toned and resplendent in his tighty whities...his fiancée, played with hilarious archness by Heléne Yorke...The second act flags...but the score is strong...Duncan Sheik's synthesizer-heavy music - radical by Broadway standards...finally delivers a worthy follow-up to his 'Spring Awakening.' A comic 'American Psycho' you can dance to? Somehow, it works.",
