However, with only one curated excerpt available and incomplete text about the lead performance, confidence is low and score reflects cautious positive assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the production's success in capturing the 1980s Manhattan vibe and creating an eerie atmosphere, suggesting a positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the direction, songwriting, and book, suggesting a positive experience, but the lack of a clear overall recommendation and the single excerpt lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the director, songwriter and book-writer for convincingly realizing the 1980s Manhattan atmosphere and materialistic attitude, while noting the lead's effective performance, indicating a favorable assessment of the production.",
