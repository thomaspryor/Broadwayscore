  "fullText": "“American Psycho,” a musical about a fashion-conscious serial killer, is not the most misbegotten show ever on Broadway. It only feels that way for a couple of moments – such as the production number that features zombie-like movements by half-naked cast members smeared in blood. Overall, the musical has a stylish visual design and stylized violence; a catchy 80s techno-pop score presented like a series of live 80s MTV music videos; and a cast with impressive physiques, starting with Benjamin Walker, dressed only in underpants for much of the show’s nearly three hours.

Low confidence due to limited text and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the style and a lead performance but criticizes the show as 'emotionally hollow.' With only one excerpt, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (slick, stylish, strong performance) but ultimately finds the show emotionally hollow, indicating a mixed reaction. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production's style and lead performance but offers a fundamental criticism of its emotional emptiness, suggesting a mixed assessment rather than a clear recommendation.",
