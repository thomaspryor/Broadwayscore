  "fullText": "“American Psycho,” a musical about a fashion-conscious serial killer, is not the most misbegotten show ever on Broadway. It only feels that way for a couple of moments – such as the production number that features zombie-like movements by half-naked cast members smeared in blood. Overall, the musical has a stylish visual design and stylized violence; a catchy 80s techno-pop score presented like a series of live 80s MTV music videos; and a cast with impressive physiques, starting with Benjamin Walker, dressed only in underpants for much of the show’s nearly three hours.
