The single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a mixed assessment, describing the musical as \"alternately dazzling and dull.\" The \"yes, no, and sometimes\" verdict suggests an uneven experience, placing it in the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The review describes the show as inconsistent ('alternately dazzling and dull') with qualified praise for the lead actor, indicating a balanced mixed assessment without clear recommendation or rejection.",
