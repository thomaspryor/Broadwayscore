  "bwwExcerpt": "And the show anchored by a tour-de-force, star-is-born performance by Walker, whose Patrick is much more human and oddly endearing than either Christian Bale's smirky, scenery-chewing version in the 2000 film adaptation, or Ellis' wholly vile original creation. 'American Psycho' still has ice in its veins - Patrick spews his venom at gays, women and pretty much anyone who didn't go to Harvard - but Walker (best known for 'Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson' and the film 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter') also allows you to feel the faint stirrings of a beating heart within. He makes the convincing case that Patrick is as much a victim in this story as the people he brutalizes.",
