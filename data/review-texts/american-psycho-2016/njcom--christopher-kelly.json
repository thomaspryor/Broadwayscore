  "bwwExcerpt": "And the show anchored by a tour-de-force, star-is-born performance by Walker, whose Patrick is much more human and oddly endearing than either Christian Bale's smirky, scenery-chewing version in the 2000 film adaptation, or Ellis' wholly vile original creation. 'American Psycho' still has ice in its veins - Patrick spews his venom at gays, women and pretty much anyone who didn't go to Harvard - but Walker (best known for 'Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson' and the film 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter') also allows you to feel the faint stirrings of a beating heart within. He makes the convincing case that Patrick is as much a victim in this story as the people he brutalizes.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for Walker's 'tour-de-force, star-is-born performance' with detailed analysis of how he improves upon previous versions. However, single excerpt warning applies - confidence low due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Walker's performance as 'tour-de-force' and 'star-is-born', suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses heavily on praising the lead performance as a 'tour-de-force' and 'star-is-born', indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the praise is strong. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance ('tour-de-force,' 'star-is-born') and finds emotional depth in the production, but as a single curated excerpt, the overall verdict requires caution.",
