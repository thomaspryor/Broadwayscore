  "bwwExcerpt": "Under the deft manipulation of an ensemble of puppeteers, each finds spectacular — and often grisly — life in their movements, from the sinuous, stalking slink of the tiger to the spastic twitch of the poor goat chosen to be the zoo animal’s lunch. Whenever they and the rest of the production are forced to retreat into the confines of reality, Lolita Chakrabarti’s script sputters. It, like Pi, is eager to avoid the gruesome truth of the teen’s survival in favor of of the fantastical.",
