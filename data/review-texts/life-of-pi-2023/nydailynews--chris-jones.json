    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Critic praises the show as unprecedented in its theatrical achievement and acknowledges the immersive experience will satisfy audiences. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's immersive nature and unique ability to convey its theme, indicating a strong positive impression. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a low confidence level. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses a positive sentiment about the show's immersive nature and its ability to convey the sea and its creatures effectively. The phrase \"more than enough\" suggests a positive experience, but the \"despite watching decades worth of attempts\" implies some reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong superlative praise for the production's visual and immersive qualities, recommending it based on those elements, though limited context from a single curated quote warrants caution.",
