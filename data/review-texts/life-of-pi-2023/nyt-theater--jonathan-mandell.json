However, with only one curated excerpt available and 'Read more' indicating truncated text, confidence is low as the full verdict may not be represented. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the stage adaptation for its puppetry and stagecraft, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the stagecraft and puppetry, indicating a positive experience, but the truncated nature of the text and the lack of a clear overall recommendation lowers the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear, enthusiastic praise for the production's puppetry and stagecraft, indicating a recommendation to see the show based on these technical achievements. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning and truncated text.",
