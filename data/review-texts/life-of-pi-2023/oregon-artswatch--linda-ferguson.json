  "bwwExcerpt": "Among the deep pleasures of Life of Pi are its puppetry and its visually sumptuous design. All of the puppets, which were designed by Nick Barnes and Finn Caldwell, are skeletal, sinewy things, allowing plenty of space for us to see the brown-clad puppeteers who manipulate them. For the April 8 show, it took three puppeteers – Shiloh Goodin, Aaron Hasell, and Betsy Rosen – to bring Richard Parker to life as he ducked his head, arched his spine or stretched his tail.",
