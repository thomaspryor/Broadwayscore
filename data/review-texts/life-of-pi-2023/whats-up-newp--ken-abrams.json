  "bwwExcerpt": "Great theater can take you away for a couple of hours, immersing you in a story as your connection to the narrative deepens. Life of Pi, playing at the Providence Performing Arts Center through Sunday, February 16, does just that. It’s a powerful, captivating, and unforgettable tale, filled with fascinating characters, both human and animal.",
