    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling it 'a marvel of stagecraft' with vivid appreciation for the production design. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation - the full review verdict could differ significantly. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as a 'marvel of stagecraft' and highlights the transformation of the theater, suggesting a highly positive view of the show's technical achievements. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the stagecraft and transformation of the theater, indicating a positive experience. However, due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's technical achievements and visual spectacle, using words like 'marvel' to describe the immersive stagecraft and lifelike puppetry, though the single-excerpt context prevents assessment of narrative or performance elements.",
