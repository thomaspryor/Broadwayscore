  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Life of Pi\" is a unique theatrical experience with its animal puppetry, depiction of days on the ocean and bringing to life an Indian city, circa 1977. It tells a fantastical story with brio and flair making use of all of the theatrical arts. With a cast led by Olivier Award winner Hiran Abeysekera, you could not imagine anyone else in these roles. However, the playwriting and the production do have their flaws which are eventually overcome by its theatricality and storytelling. Kudos to director Max Webster for orchestrating the production so well.\n\nRead more",
