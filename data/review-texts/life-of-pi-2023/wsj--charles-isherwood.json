With its fantastical tale of a teenage boy adrift at sea for more than 200 days, his only company an injured zebra, an orangutan and, more dangerously, a hyena and a tiger, the novel would seem to elude the embrace of stagecraft. Film, with its arsenal of special effects, makes a more natural medium for such a book’s translation, and Ang Lee has already made a popular movie version of it.\n\nResume Subscription\n We are delighted that you'd like to resume your subscription.\n\nYou will be charged\n $ + tax\n (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.\n You may change your billing preferences at any time in the Customer Center or call\n Customer Service.\n You will be notified in advance of any changes in rate or terms.\n You may cancel your subscription at anytime by calling\n Customer Service.\n\nPlease click confirm to resume now.\n\nArticle viewed iconAn icon to mark the viewed articles\nRead3 hours ago | Kevin Kennedy\n\nArticle viewed iconAn icon to mark the viewed articles\nRead4 hours ago | Ruth R.
