    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights potential issues with the play's length and suitability for children, suggesting a mixed reception. However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning limit confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the play is longer than it needs to be and contains gruesome scenes, but doesn't explicitly recommend or discourage seeing it. This indicates a mixed reaction. | Kimi: The excerpt raises specific criticisms about the show's length and warns about gruesome content suitable only for adult audiences, yet lacks any clear praise or recommendation to balance these reservations. With only a single truncated excerpt available, the overall verdict remains unclear.",
