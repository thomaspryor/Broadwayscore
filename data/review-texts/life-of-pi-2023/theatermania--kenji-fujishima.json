    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises both lead performance and calls show 'visually enchanting,' suggesting positive recommendation, but limited text requires low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises both the performance of Abeysekera and the visual elements of the show, suggesting a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the lead performer as a major reason to see the show, alongside the visually enchanting puppets, indicating a strong positive recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am placing the score at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic explicitly identifies the performer as a 'reason to see' the show alongside its famous puppets, and describes the production as 'visually enchanting,' indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited excerpt.",
