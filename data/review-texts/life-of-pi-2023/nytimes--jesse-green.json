    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the production's success with superlatives like 'magnificently' and 'dazzling', but confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed overall review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('succeeds magnificently', 'technically dazzling', 'emotionally resonant'), indicating a highly favorable view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"succeeds magnificently\" and describes the puppetry as \"technically dazzling and emotionally resonant,\" indicating a strong recommendation. Given that this is the only excerpt available, I'm scoring towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise using superlatives ('magnificently', 'dazzling') for the production's puppetry and emotional resonance, indicating strong recommendation, though confidence is lowered due to the single-excerpt format.",
