    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with 'succeeds magnificently' and 'technically dazzling and emotionally resonant,' but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness of full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('succeeds magnificently', 'technically dazzling', 'emotionally resonant') indicating a highly favorable view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"succeeds magnificently\" and \"technically dazzling and emotionally resonant,\" indicating a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise using superlatives like 'magnificently' and 'dazzling' to describe the puppetry and emotional impact, indicating a strong recommendation despite the limited context.",
