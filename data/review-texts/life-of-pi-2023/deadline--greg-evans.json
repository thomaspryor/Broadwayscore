    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt suggests the show has visual merits but fundamental story problems that undermine it. The critic seems unconvinced by the production's choices, placing it in mixed territory but toward the lower end given the structural criticisms. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests mixed feelings, noting visual appeal but criticizing the ending and plausibility. With only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests reservations about the ending and the show's plausibility, but doesn't explicitly recommend against seeing it. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges the production's visual strengths but criticizes the narrative as unconvincing and manipulative ('stacked-deck ending'), resulting in a qualified assessment that neither recommends nor strongly discourages.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Still, the kid knows how to spin a terrific yarn. Even Broadway audiences still tickled by the bovine Milky White of Into the Woods and the massive prehistoric creatures of Lincoln Center’s The Skin of Our Teeth will be charmed by the creatures of Pi, courtesy of puppetry and movement director Finn Caldwell and his co-designer Nick Barnes. Same goes for the work of set and costume designer Tim Hatley, video designer Andrzej Goulding, and lighting designer Tim Lutkin (their combined Olivier trophies could capsize a ship of their own). At one point, Pi jumps overboard and is swallowed by the sea/stage, a bit of theatrical trickery no less effective for its simplicity. Still, visual appeal can’t quite wash away a stacked-deck ending, or make a convincing case for the fanciful over the plausible. Deep down, Mr. Okamoto probably agrees.",
