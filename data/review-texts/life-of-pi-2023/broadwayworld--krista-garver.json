  "bwwExcerpt": "Mandviwala’s performance is matched by the production's incredible artistry. All of the animals are puppets, manipulated with such delicacy and lifelike precision that it's easy to forget the puppeteers are even there (especially impressive since three puppeteers are required for Richard Parker alone). This reinforces the play's central theme of storytelling and the suspension of disbelief.",
