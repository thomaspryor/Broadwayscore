  "bwwExcerpt": "The cast is led by Taha Mandviwala as Pi, and I must say, his is one of the most astounding performances I’ve ever had the pleasure of witnessing. The emotional complexity and the physical stamina required for the role are quite vast. As the central character of the show, he carries it like a seasoned professional – absolutely flawless.",
