  "bwwExcerpt": "Ultimately, “The Life of Pi” delivers a message that we never know what difficulties life will throw at us, and whatever they are we must do all we can to survive. As his father says to him early in the show, ‘Life will defend itself, no matter how small it is.’ It is a story of faith — both in oneself and a higher power and understanding that this combination can help us overcome virtually any challenge.",
