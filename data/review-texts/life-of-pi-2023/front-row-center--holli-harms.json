    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for multiple production elements with 'excellent' and 'risks that pay off,' but single excerpt warning requires low confidence and caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides high praise for multiple aspects of the production, indicating a strong recommendation. However, given the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising multiple aspects of the production. Given the single excerpt, I am placing it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the production's technical and directorial elements, using words like 'excellent' and noting that creative risks 'pay off,' indicating strong approval. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
