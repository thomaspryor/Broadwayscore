  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It's a peculiar production, staged with tremendous brio yet never as engaging as one might hope. Certainly, audiences will get their money's worth in terms of theatrical thrills. (For the full effect of the projection design, I recommend sitting in the mezzanine.) But don't expect the emotional payoff of, say, War Horse, another stage epic noted for its elaborate puppetry, picaresque narrative, and visual effects. The problems of this production come built-in from its source material, but the excitement it offers is purely its own.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review acknowledges theatrical excitement and production values ('tremendous brio', 'audiences will get their money's worth') but explicitly states it's 'never as engaging as one might hope' and lacks emotional payoff. This balanced assessment with both praise and significant reservations places it in Mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the production's excitement and theatrical thrills but notes it lacks emotional payoff and has inherent problems from the source material. The excerpt suggests a mixed verdict, with positive elements but significant reservations. | Gemini: The review acknowledges theatrical thrills but tempers expectations, suggesting a mixed experience overall. The excerpt is not strongly positive or negative. | Kimi: The critic praises the production's energy and theatrical spectacle ('tremendous brio,' 'theatrical thrills') but emphasizes significant shortcomings in emotional engagement and source material problems, resulting in a qualified assessment that neither fully recommends nor discourages attendance.",
