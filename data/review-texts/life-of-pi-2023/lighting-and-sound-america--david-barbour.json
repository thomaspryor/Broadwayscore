  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It's a peculiar production, staged with tremendous brio yet never as engaging as one might hope. Certainly, audiences will get their money's worth in terms of theatrical thrills. (For the full effect of the projection design, I recommend sitting in the mezzanine.) But don't expect the emotional payoff of, say, War Horse, another stage epic noted for its elaborate puppetry, picaresque narrative, and visual effects. The problems of this production come built-in from its source material, but the excitement it offers is purely its own.”\n\nRead more",
