  "bwwExcerpt": "The puppetry team (involving many but led Finn Caldwell and Nick Barnes) will make you rethink puppets forever on the stage. No wonder this play has won three Tony Awards and the Olivier Award for Best Play. You have to see it to believe it, and even what you see will make you question what you believe. That is just part of what “Life of Pi” achieves and leaves for the audience to consider long after the curtain falls.",
