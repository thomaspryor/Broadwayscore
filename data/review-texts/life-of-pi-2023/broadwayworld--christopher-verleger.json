  "bwwExcerpt": "The stage and lighting design of the production are wondrously spectacular and exciting, with vibrant colors, persuasive imagery, and pulsating sound effects that perfectly depict the turmoil and uncertainty of his predicament. As Pi describes the timeline of past events, the visual transformation from hospital bed to time spent afloat is seamless and exquisite, ranging from serene, star-filled night skies to drab, ominous storm clouds.",
