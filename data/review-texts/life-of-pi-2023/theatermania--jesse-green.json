    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Uses strong praise language 'triumph of theatrical imagination' with specific commendation of key production elements. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this may be cherry-picked positive quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'triumph of theatrical imagination,' indicating a highly positive evaluation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"triumph\", which is a strong positive indicator. Given that this is the only excerpt, I am scoring it as positive with a high score in that range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise using the word 'triumph' and celebrating the production's puppetry and imagination. However, confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt which may not represent the full review's complete verdict.",
