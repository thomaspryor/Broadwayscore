    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic describes the play as 'unprecedented' and praises its sophisticated examination of complex themes. However, this is only a single curated excerpt, so confidence is low despite the clearly positive language. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play's innovative approach and thematic depth, suggesting a positive reception. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence. | Gemini: The quote suggests a highly innovative and thought-provoking play, indicating a positive assessment. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise, calling the work 'unprecedented' and highlighting its sophisticated thematic depth, indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited text available.",
