    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the work as 'unprecedented' and praises the playwright's achievement in using theater to examine complex themes. However, confidence is low due to limited text from a single curated quote that may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as 'unprecedented' and highlights its thematic depth, suggesting a positive view. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive assessment of the play's ambition and thematic exploration, but without more context, it's difficult to gauge the overall strength of the recommendation. I am scoring it as positive but with low confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers strong praise ('unprecedented') for the play's artistic ambition and thematic depth, indicating a clearly positive verdict. Per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, scoring at the upper end of the Positive bucket (80-84).",
