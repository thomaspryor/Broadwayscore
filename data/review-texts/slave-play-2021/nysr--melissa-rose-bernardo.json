  "bwwExcerpt": "Because Slave Play-sharply and smartly directed by Robert O'Hara-is a show that needs to be processed. Admittedly, that is a terribly clinical way to put it. 'Can you stop saying processing?' yells one character, Jim (Paul Alexander Nolan). 'We aren't computers. My emotions aren't materials.' But fair warning: As the program note by poet-novelist Morgan Parker begins, 'This might hurt.'",
