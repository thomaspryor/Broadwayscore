The tone is diplomatically critical without being harsh. | GPT-4o: The review suggests the musical has gained some substance but not in a way that aligns with the creators' intentions, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review indicates a change from Off-Broadway but doesn't offer a clear recommendation. The phrase \"not necessarily the kind its creators were hoping for\" suggests a mixed or neutral assessment. | Kimi: The critic uses 'featherweight' pejoratively to describe the show as trivial and suggests its Broadway transfer added unwanted baggage rather than artistic merit.",
