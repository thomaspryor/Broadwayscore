  "bwwExcerpt": "Unlike some other famous dramas that have been uncomfortably adapted for African-American casts, Michael Wilson's tender revival of 'The Trip to Bountiful' works extraordinarily well with the Watts family played by African-American actors...Cicely Tyson delivers a fully animated, very spirited performance that makes the audience want to root for her to finally arrive home. The statuesque Vanessa Williams is also an ideal choice for the self-centered Jessie May. Cuba Gooding Jr., who is making his professional stage debut, stresses Ludie's boyish persona, but looks ill-at-ease compared with his colleagues. 3 stars",
