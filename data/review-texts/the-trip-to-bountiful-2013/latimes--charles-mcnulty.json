  "bwwExcerpt": "Broadway for Cicely Tyson is clearly like riding a bike. Her last rendezvous in the rialto was in 'The Corn Is Green' in 1983, but you'd never know that 30 years had passed by her exquisitely understated performance in the revival of Horton Foote's 'The Trip to Bountiful'...This is Tyson's Carrie Watts, and not a false note is struck...It's a shame that the rest of the production, directed by Michael Wilson, one of Foote's most reliable interpreters, isn't up to Tyson's level. Gooding...is the weak link in the cast. What he brings in name recognition he takes away in inexperience.",
