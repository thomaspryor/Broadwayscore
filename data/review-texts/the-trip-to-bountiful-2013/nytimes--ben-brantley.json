  "bwwExcerpt": "The title destination in Horton Foote's 'Trip to Bountiful'...is said to be a small, obscure town in Texas. But on the evidence of the performance of Cicely Tyson, who stars in the production that opened on Tuesday night under Michael Wilson's slow-handed direction, Bountiful is a code name for the Fountain of Youth...'Bountiful' often undercuts itself by broadening comic moments, especially in the early family-friction scenes in the Houston apartment...By the production's end...Ms. Tyson's Carrie has blossomed into genuine beauty during her nostalgic road trip, which makes the play's final moments considerably less sorrowful than they usually are. The 2005 Signature Theater revival of 'Bountiful,' starring Lois Smith, left me drenched in tears. But at the end of this one, I felt kind of optimistic.",
