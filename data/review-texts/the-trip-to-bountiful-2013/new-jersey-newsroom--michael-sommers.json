  "bwwExcerpt": "Bountiful doings on Broadway indeed: Cicely Tyson gives a beautiful performance in a sterling new production of Horton Foote's touching play, 'The Trip to Bountiful.' The show...marks Tyson's first Broadway appearance in 30 years. It is obvious from her sensitive yet secure work here that Tyson has lost none of her stage technique. Expect to enjoy a memorable performance that you will cherish always.",
