  "bwwExcerpt": "This is a tender, deceptively simple work that requires great sensitivity. Director Michael Wilson has the right touch, but the dynamic seems off in the earlier scenes. Vanessa Williams comes on so strong, the other two characters seem in danger of being eaten by her. Later on, they all seem to find their stride, and by the end, Cuba Gooding Jr. delivers a moving portrayal.",
