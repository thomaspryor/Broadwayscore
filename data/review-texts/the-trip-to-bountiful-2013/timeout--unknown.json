  "bwwExcerpt": "Cicely Tyson may be small of frame and advanced in years, but she can still bust clear through a wall. The fourth wall, I mean: the one that separates the audience from Horton Foote's wistful, beautifully wrought diorama, The Trip to Bountiful...Rashad is understated and touching as Carrie's temporary traveling companion...Gooding and Williams flesh out their roles with acute sensitivity and humor...Tyson, returning to Broadway after 30 years, looks perfectly at home...This soul-stirring and flawless staging performs the same rejuvenation: Bountiful seems as fresh and vibrant as the day Foote finished it.",
