  "fullText": "Spontaneous audience sing-alongs may be popular on stage these days (see: Motown the Musical), but they don't characterize the somber, contemplative dramas of the late Texas playwright Horton Foote  particularly not The Trip to Bountiful, which follows a woman on her long, slow march toward death. But in the new, lovingly staged Broadway revival, when fierce and feisty Carrie Watts (played by fierce and feisty octogenarian Cicely Tyson) erupts in a chorus of ''Blessed Assurance,'' hymn-loving theater-goers may be moved to join in.\n\nFollowing a 30-year Broadway absence, Tyson gives an awe-inspiring performance. She sings, she dances, she does everything but cartwheels. She's well matched by Vanessa Williams  wickedly funny as her bossy daughter-in-law  if not by Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. (Jerry Maguire), who's out of his emotional depths as her broken-down son. Yet perhaps Tyson's best scene is with ex–Dukes of Hazzard star Tom Wopat. You'd think a burly, white small-town sheriff going nose to nose with a tiny black woman would be unsettling. But it's simply, quietly moving. B+\n\n(Tickets: Telecharge.com or 800-432-7250)",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite the D rating mentioned, the review text is overwhelmingly positive with B+ grade and consistent praise for Tyson's 'awe-inspiring performance' and Williams being 'wickedly funny.' The text appears to end with the B+ rating, suggesting this may be the complete verdict. | GPT-4o: The review praises Cicely Tyson's performance as 'awe-inspiring' and highlights the production as 'lovingly staged.' Despite some reservations about other performances, the overall tone is positive. The original rating of B+ aligns with a strong positive recommendation, but the text is truncated, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review assigns a 'D' grade, which is clearly negative. While praising Tyson and Williams, it criticizes Gooding Jr.'s performance. The truncated nature lowers confidence. | Kimi: The review awards an explicit B+ grade and praises the 'lovingly staged' revival and Tyson's 'awe-inspiring' performance, despite noting one supporting actor is weaker. Confidence is medium due to truncation warning, though the verdict appears complete.",
