    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('deeply moving theatrical experience', 'honors') suggests clear recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires caution about full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('deeply moving', 'honors') suggesting a highly favorable view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as a \"deeply moving theatrical experience\" that \"honors\" its subject, indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong praise ('deeply moving') indicating clear recommendation, but cherry-picking risk and lack of full context warrant upper-positive range score and low confidence.",
