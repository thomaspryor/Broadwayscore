    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('deeply moving theatrical experience', 'honors') suggests enthusiastic recommendation. Single excerpt warning applied - using upper Positive range due to clearly laudatory tone, but medium confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'deeply moving' and honors the subject's legacy, indicating a strong positive impression. However, the single excerpt warning necessitates a cautious approach, leading to a low confidence level. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"deeply moving\" and \"honors.\" Given the single excerpt, I am placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
