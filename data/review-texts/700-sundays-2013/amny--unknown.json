  "bwwExcerpt": "Dozens of autobiographical one-person shows have come and gone since Billy Crystal stormed Broadway in 2004 with '700 Sundays,' his Tony-winning tribute to his father, who died of a heart attack when Crystal was just 15 years old, and growing up in Eisenhower-era Long Island with an unshakable desire to become an entertainer. Seeing as few of these shows, if any, have surpassed Crystal's heartwarming and hilarious tour de force, it's a pleasure to have it return for a run before the 'Les Miz' revival takes over the Imperial Theatre.",

Strong positive language despite being only an excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a 'heartwarming and hilarious tour de force' and expresses pleasure at its return. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses pleasure at the show's return, calling it \"heartwarming and hilarious.\" Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('heartwarming and hilarious tour de force') and expresses clear enthusiasm for the show's return, indicating a solid recommendation despite limited context.",
