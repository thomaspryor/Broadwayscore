  "bwwExcerpt": "Dozens of autobiographical one-person shows have come and gone since Billy Crystal stormed Broadway in 2004 with '700 Sundays,' his Tony-winning tribute to his father, who died of a heart attack when Crystal was just 15 years old, and growing up in Eisenhower-era Long Island with an unshakable desire to become an entertainer. Seeing as few of these shows, if any, have surpassed Crystal's heartwarming and hilarious tour de force, it's a pleasure to have it return for a run before the 'Les Miz' revival takes over the Imperial Theatre.",
