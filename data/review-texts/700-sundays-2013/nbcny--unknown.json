  "bwwExcerpt": "It's next to impossible to experience Billy Crystal's still side-splitting '700 Sundays'without recalling the absurdist characters and hallmark moments of your own youth. The veteran entertainer, a city slicker-turned-awards-show-hosting-juggernaut, has turned the story of his own coming-of-age into such a relatable piece of theater that any one anecdote may start your waterworks flowing, even while you're doubled over in laughter.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling the show 'side-splitting' and 'relatable piece of theater' that evokes both laughter and emotional response. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked positive content. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'side-splitting' and 'relatable,' suggesting a strong positive experience. The lack of full text and single excerpt warning lowers confidence, but the language indicates a rave. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"side-splitting\" and \"relatable piece of theater,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low, but the enthusiastic tone warrants a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strongly positive evaluative language ('side-splitting', 'relatable piece of theater') and promises an emotional, laughter-filled experience, indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited available text.",
