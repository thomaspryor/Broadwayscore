  "bwwExcerpt": "With Mr. Crystal, jokes move quickly; everything else is slow. The show rambles for two-and-a-half easy-to-trim hours...At the show's heart, which is worn on its sleeve among other places, is an adoring portrait of his father, who died when Billy was 15...All the reverent stories don't add up to a flesh-and-blood character. Jack Crystal remains remote, larger than life, which may be where Mr. Crystal wants to keep him. It's the kind of show that you wish your son made about you.",
