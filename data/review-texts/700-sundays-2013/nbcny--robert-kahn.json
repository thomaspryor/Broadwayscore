    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt describes the show as 'still side-splitting' and emphasizes its emotional resonance, suggesting strong positive reception. However, this is only one curated excerpt and may not represent the full verdict, hence low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'still side-splitting' and evokes a strong personal connection, suggesting a highly positive experience. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the phrase \"still side-splitting\" which indicates a positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strong positive language ('side-splitting') praising the show's humor and emotional resonance, warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket. However, confidence is reduced due to the single-excerpt limitation and truncated text.",
