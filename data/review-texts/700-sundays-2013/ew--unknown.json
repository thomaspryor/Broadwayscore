  "fullText": "Billy Crystal loves to command a stage. In a laugh-out-loud  if quite long  revival of his 2004 one-man, autobiographical show 700 Sundays, you can practically hear his heart soaring as he recounts wacky and sentimental stories about his childhood. (The title refers to the number of Sundays Crystal had with his father, a jazz-loving record store owner, before he died of a heart attack.)\n\nSure, some of it feels like Old Jew Telling Jokes, but Crystal knows his audience and he kills with lines like ''Bris is the prefix for brisket'' and ''Yiddish is a combination of German and phlegm.'' Some of the script (comic Alan Zweibel provides ''additional material'') has been updated in the decade since Crystal last worked a Broadway stage, and now offers references to Obamacare, Rand Paul, and Osama bin Laden. (Crystal imagines that if the terrorist showed up in the Catskills in the 1950s, the Jewish mothers would ask if he was single.)\n\nMany of the stories are riveting (I could hear a whole show about Billie Holiday, a pal of Billy’s father, taking a young Billy to see his first movie, Shane). Others drag on for too long (Crystal looooves a fart joke). Still, it's hard to begrudge the guy, who, at the show I attended, was so eager to stay in the spotlight after two-and-a-half hours that he continued telling stories after a long standing ovation and even did some impressive-for-a-grandfather moves. ''I'm the only 65 year old doing cartwheels on Broadway!'' he said, beaming. That's true, and no one loves that fact more than he does. A-",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite the D grade, the review is consistently positive about Crystal's performance and audience connection. The critic finds it 'laugh-out-loud,' calls many stories 'riveting,' and shows affection for Crystal's enthusiasm. The D grade appears to be a typo or error given the positive tone throughout. | GPT-4o: The review praises Crystal's performance and the show's humor, despite noting some parts drag. The original 'D' rating suggests a positive but qualified recommendation. The text is truncated, so the final verdict may be missing. | Gemini: The critic gives the show a D, which is a negative rating. While there are some positive comments about Crystal's stage presence and some of the stories, the review also mentions that some parts drag on and feel like \"Old Jew Telling Jokes.\" | Kimi: The review carries an A- grade and consistently praises Crystal's performance as 'laugh-out-loud' and 'riveting,' with the critic noting it's 'hard to begrudge' the star's evident joy. While noting the show runs long and some jokes drag, the overall tone is warmly appreciative.",
