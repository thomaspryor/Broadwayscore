Language is appreciative ('warmth and wit', 'touching tribute', 'resonates long after') but lacks superlatives for rave territory. | GPT-4o: The review praises the show for its emotional impact and the performance of Crystal, aligning with the critic's original rating of 80, indicating a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises Crystal's performance and the show's emotional impact, indicating a positive recommendation. The original rating of 80 aligns with this assessment. | Kimi: The critic gives the show an 80/100 rating and describes it as a touching, resonant celebration of family with praise for Crystal's performance, indicating a solid recommendation without reaching the highest ecstasy of a rave.",
