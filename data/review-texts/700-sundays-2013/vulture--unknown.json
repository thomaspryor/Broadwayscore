  "bwwExcerpt": "At one point in the return engagement of 700 Sundays, Billy Crystal recalls the first comedian he ever saw: an old-school tummler, circa 1958, prowling the stage at Kutsher's 'like a panther.' All these decades later, Crystal impersonates this creature, with his disowned aggression and tired shtick - 'Good evening, ladies and Jews' - way too well, and not just because he quickly borrowed the material to perform for his family back home in Long Beach. Crystal, now 65, is himself a brilliant repackager of tired material, with the timing of that panther, if a humbler presentation. (He wears, instead of a tux, black jeans and a sweater.) But make no mistake, he will eat you if you let him.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls Crystal 'brilliant' with 'panther' timing and uses vivid, admiring language about his prowess ('he will eat you'). However, this is a single curated excerpt which may not represent the full verdict, warranting reduced confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Crystal's performance, noting his brilliance and timing, suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review acknowledges Crystal's brilliance and timing, but also notes the use of 'tired material,' suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt admires Crystal's skill and stage presence ('brilliant,' 'timing of that panther,' 'will eat you') while acknowledging the material is recycled ('tired material,' 'borrowed'). This qualified praise indicates a solid recommendation based on the performer's excellence rather than the content's freshness.",
