  "bwwExcerpt": "Each of the four acts plays in real time. Wolfe's approach is occasionally to suggest the surface realism of 'Iceman,' but more often he is stripping it away to expose the play's absurdist core. Maybe this is the 'Iceman' that Samuel Beckett saw in his mind's eye that led him to write his own masterpieces, particularly 'Waiting for Godot.' Illusion and reality. O'Neill and Beckett's characters are flattened by the one, and so they can't live without the other.",
