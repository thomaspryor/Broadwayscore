  "bwwExcerpt": "What makes the show so fascinating is the contrast between its cerebral approach and Hall's compassionate performance. In her Broadway debut, the English actress effortlessly navigates stream-of-consciousness monologues while helping us relate to this opaque character. Helen may feel like a cog in a machine, but Hall makes her all too human.",
