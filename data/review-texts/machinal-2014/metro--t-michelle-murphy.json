  "bwwExcerpt": "Hall's acting is perfectly decent, but she nonetheless may have been miscast. Despite posturing meekness and 'purity,' there's something about the star's worldliness - not to mention her 5-foot-9 frame - that makes the character's authenticity suspect even before she goes off the rails (literally, fighting her way off a crowded subway car because she can't breathe)...it's clear director Lyndsey Turner put lot of work into all the little details of 'Machinal,' with the right mix of star power and media momentum, and we wouldn't be surprised if there's an extension or two in the show's future.",
