However, confidence is low due to the very brief text that may be truncated. | GPT-4o: The review praises Rebecca Hall's performance as 'riveting' and the direction as 'stark intensity', indicating a positive recommendation. However, the text is very brief, leading to low confidence. | Gemini: The review praises Rebecca Hall's performance as 'riveting' and the direction as having 'stark intensity,' indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: Strong praise for both the lead performance ('riveting') and direction ('stark intensity') without any visible reservations, though the brevity of the text suggests it may be an excerpt or truncated review.",
