    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Very brief excerpt praising Hall's 'riveting performance' and Turner's 'stark intensity' direction. Positive language but insufficient text for full assessment. | GPT-4o: The review praises Rebecca Hall's performance as 'riveting' and the direction as 'stark intensity', indicating a positive recommendation. However, the brevity of the text and lack of broader context or additional evaluative content makes the confidence medium. | Gemini: The review highlights a \"riveting performance\" and \"stark intensity\" in the direction, indicating a positive experience overall. | Kimi: The review offers unqualified praise for both the lead performance ('riveting') and direction ('stark intensity'), indicating a strong recommendation despite the brevity of the text.",
