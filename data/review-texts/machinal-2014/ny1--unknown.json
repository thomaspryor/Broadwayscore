  "bwwExcerpt": "The large cast is in top form, with Suzanne Bertish as the mother, Michael Cumpsty, the husband, and Morgan Spector, the lover, standing out. But Rebecca Hall has the toughest job as the nondescript murderess. Resisting the urge to soften her, Hall manages an honest, wrenching portrayal of a woman you'd be very hard pressed to call a friend. 'Machinal' is not for the faint of heart. But if you're up for an intense theatrical experience, this one's a first-class punch to the gut.",
