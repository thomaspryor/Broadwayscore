  "bwwExcerpt": "This 2014 staging is notable for giving Rebecca Hall her stunning Broadway debut and proving that 'Machinal' is an arresting and not some old chestnut that deserves to be cracked open only once every century. It helps, too, that director Lyndsey Turner (another Broadway deb) and her design team (Es Devlin, Michael Krass, Jane Cox, Matt Tierney) have choreographed this story, based on a real-life case of a woman who murdered her husband, as if it were a very modern atonal opera.",
