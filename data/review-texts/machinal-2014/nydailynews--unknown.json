  "bwwExcerpt": "Hall, known for films like 'The Town' and 'Iron Man 3,' hides her beauty and plummy English accent as Helen. She's sturdy at some times, singsong in others. Hall's stature and height allow her to strike a physical presence, but when it comes to Helen's freeform monologues, she's emotionally empty. 'Machinal' doesn't elicit strong reaction - but it's well served by the world and well-oiled machine created by Turner.",
