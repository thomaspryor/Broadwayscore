Given this is curated and sounds clearly positive, scoring upper end of Positive bucket, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Rosie Sheehy's performance as 'astonishing,' indicating a positive view. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment of the review is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is overwhelmingly positive about the lead performance, suggesting a strong recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt provides strong praise ('astonishing') for the lead performance. Per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, scored at upper end of Positive bucket (80-84). Confidence is low due to limited context from curated excerpt.",
