  "fullText": "Stars lend their glamour to this warhorse, giving a new generation reason to roar.\n\nAudiences from Boca Raton to Baden Baden have been laughing themselves silly at “Lend Me a Tenor” since 1986, when Ken Ludwig’s opera buffa was first produced on the West End by Andrew Lloyd Webber. After its 1989 Broadway premiere, show’s been done around the world and is a perennial favorite of regional and community theaters in the USA. Not to be denied their own fun, helmer Stanley Tucci and a contingent of Broadway and Hollywood stars toplined by Tony Shalhoub and Anthony LaPaglia are now lending their glamour to this warhorse, giving a new generation reason to roar.\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n VIP+\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n 10 Years Post-Sony Hack, Hollywood Isn’t Ready for Next Big Cyberattack \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n 'The View' Hosts Defend Nicole Scherzinger Against 'Out of Control' Backlash; Whoopi Goldberg Says 'Relax. She Liked a Hat About Jesus. It's Just a Hat'\n\nYou have to be a little nuts to do justice to farce, with its maniacal fixations and blinding panics and fears. Tucci & Co. qualify all around, but none more than Tony Shalhoub, who comes off eight seasons as the adorably obsessive TV detective on “Monk,” as well as comic foils in such bizarro films as “Galaxy Quest” and “Men In Black,” to play Saunders, the beleaguered manager of the Cleveland Grand Opera Company.\n\nTout le Cleveland is keen to party in the fall of 1934, but Saunders has just learned that the world famous Italian opera singer known as “Il Stupendo” who is scheduled to appear that night at a gala benefit has disappeared. When the great man does show up at his hotel suite (in John Lee Beatty’s tongue-in-cheek design, six doors strategically placed among fussy furnishings done up in faux-French elegance), a series of well-intentioned missteps makes it uncertain that Il Stupendo will ever appear on this or any other opera stage.\n\nIt’s the classic farce situation — disaster; denial; recovery; complication; catastrophe — and it’s a joy to watch Shalhoub attack it.\n\nAfter the initial explosion, executed with splenetic vigor, thesp absorbs the implications of each subsequent setback with deadly calm. But even as he feverishly assesses the potential damage of a no-show we can see the steam coming out of his ears. And by the time he gets on his knees to plead his last-ditch strategy for avoiding disaster, the wild desperation in his eyes is enough to bring out the guys with the butterfly nets.\n\nIt’s a given that farce turns on the mechanics of its plot. Ken Ludwig, who has penned such farcical gems as “Crazy for You” and “Moon Over Buffalo,” is a master of these technical tricks — the slamming doors and mistaken identities, the split-second collisions of purpose, the confusing double entendres, et al.\n\nBut the true comedy depends on characters with super-sized needs and desperate wants, and that’s where Tucci’s helming pays off — in well-chiseled perfs from thesps who get Ludwig’s sly humor in tossing a glamorous celebrity into the clutches of culture-starved Midwesterners.\n\nThere are honest laughs and no condescension in clean perfs of the three ladies (and one bellhop) who throw themselves at their idol: Mary Catherine Garrison’s Maggie, the silly girl eager to lose her virginity to a sexy star; Jennifer Laura Thompson’s Diana, the soprano determined to screw her way to the Met; Brooke Adams’ Julia, the elegant culture vulture who just wants to touch an authentic artist; and — the most desperate of them all — Jay Klaitz’s opera-mad bellhop, too crazed to care that he’s certifiable.\n\nAs the object of all this insanity, Anthony LaPaglia, who specializes in deep-thinking men like his Tony-winning Eddie Carbone in “A View from the Bridge” and the brooding TV detective on “Without a Trace,” is probably too serious a guy to carry off Tito Merelli’s flamboyant egotism.\n\nBut LaPaglia looks big and handsome in Martin Pakledinaz‘s beautifully cut suits (although not as sparkly as the women in their swishy sequined gowns). And when he stands to lose what matters to him most in the world — his spitfire wife, Maria, played with magnificent abandon by the brilliant Jan Maxwell — his childish howling is both hilarious and touching.\n\nThesp also scores in scenes with Justin Bartha as Max, the hapless functionary who finds himself in the terrifying situation of having to suit up in blackface and impersonate Merelli in “Otello.” Bartha (“The Hangover”), who has that young heartthrob look, also has the chops of a polished comic actor and he seems made for this part.\n\nFor all Tucci’s helming savvy, the elaborately choreographed curtain call (a 90 second precis of the entire show) was slightly ragged on the night this reviewer saw it; but a hoot nonetheless, if only to watch Shalhoub stop himself from walking through an invisible stage wall.",

  "wrongFullText": "A Keith Jarrett solo concert is a combination of the strange and the sublime.\n\nA Keith Jarrett solo concert is a combination of the strange and the sublime – acoustic grand piano music beyond category made on the wing interspersed with personal quirks that are the musician’s trademark. So it was in one of Jarrett’s now-infrequent solo gigs before a sold-out crowd at Walt Disney Concert Hall Monday night. The structure may have changed since these ventures began in the early-1970s, but the values that Jarrett crusaded for in these concerts have remained the same – and ECM’s microphones were there to take it all down, hopefully for future release.\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n 'Paralyzed by Hope: The Maria Bamford Story' Shares the Tears, Fears, Insights of a Unique Clown \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Ruben Östlund Admits He Bought a Plane to Make 'The Entertainment System Is Down,' Cast Keanu Reeves as an Electrician and Says It's About Today's Society: 'We're Harming Ourselves and We Know It'\n\nThe solo concerts once consisted mainly of two, mesmerizing, longform rambles, but when Jarrett revived them in the early 2000s, they became strings of short thoughts, often based on one idea each.\n\nHis current ECM album “Testament” – a sprawling three-CD set recorded in Paris and London in the wake of some turmoil in his personal life – adheres to that format, as did his Disney Hall concert.\n\nWhere once all of Jarrett’s influences flowed together in a stream-of-consciouness sequence, they now usually sort themselves out, as if he was composing a suite instead of a tone poem. The first segment was easily the longest – nearly 15 minutes – beginning with atonal abstractions (think Pierre Boulez or Milton Babbitt) and eventually working its way back in time to Prokofiev. The tiny, rolling 2-minute third section sounded like an homage to the howling-wind finale of Chopin’s “Funeral March” Sonata, followed abruptly by a segment of foot-stomping slow funk.\n\nPart of the weird charm of a Jarrett solo concert are his pointed spoken comments – and he compulsively went back to the open mic again and again. Now and then, there may have been a method in the madness. He would lament the passing of old values in the Apple Computer age – “What happened to mastery?” – and then come up with a nostalgic, lyrical piece of fragile beauty. He would cut off a stillborn boogie after a few seconds – “That’s not what I meant to play” – ask for requests (!), complain about the Internet again, and then launch a better boogie that rocked the hall.\n\nAs always, this was high-wire playing, with all of Jarrett’s keyboard skills – the variety of touches, the sparkling technique, the great instinct for the groove, the roving independent mind – still intact. Sometimes, you get the feeling that Jarrett’s explorations have reached their limits and tend to re-plow old ground. But Jarrett is aware enough to kid himself about it – and in the end, his encores, like a rollercoaster “Carolina Shout” and a simple, tender “Over The Rainbow,” settled contentedly into an earlier, Google-free time. Or perhaps he would call it a timeless time.",
