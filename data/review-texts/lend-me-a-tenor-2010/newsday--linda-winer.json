  "bwwExcerpt": "The hotel farce, about chaos behind 'Otello' at a Cleveland Opera gala, is not nearly as clever as Kaufman and Hart comedies, nor does it have the loony danger of 'Noises Off.' But after a self-conscious start (much of it about wax fruit), Tucci's ensemble nails just about every hyper-physical take in the comedy archives, building to the recap (around designer John Lee Beatty's timelessly ornate hotel suite) that telescopes all the action into about 45 seconds of sweet dazzle.",
