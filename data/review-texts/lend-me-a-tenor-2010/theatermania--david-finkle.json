    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising cast performances suggests positive reception, but with only one quote available about acting quality, the overall verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast and highlights a standout performance, suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment is uncertain, warranting a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the cast, especially LaPaglia. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as a low-end positive recommendation with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt contains strong praise for the cast ('uniformly excellent', 'particularly deft'), indicating a clearly positive assessment of the performances. Following the single-excerpt protocol for clearly positive quotes, this scores in the 80-84 range, though the limited context warrants low confidence.",
