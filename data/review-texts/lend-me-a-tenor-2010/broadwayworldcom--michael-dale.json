  "bwwExcerpt": "Ken Ludwig's hotel suite farce, making comic fodder out of what happens when a 1934 Cleveland opera company arranges for a world famous Italian star to play the title role in a one-night gala performance of Otello, only to have him suddenly unable to perform minutes before curtain, may not be the most uproarious of entertainments, but it's certainly good for a decent stream of laughs when the pacing crackles and the door slamming is well-timed. Tucci, however, directs the piece as a comedy, seeming to want the laughs to come from a realistic exploration of the characters. And, of course, realistic explorations are what kills farce. While he does come up with some appropriately nutty visuals, the production suffers from too much thinking time.",
