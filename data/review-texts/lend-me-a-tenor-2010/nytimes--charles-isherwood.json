Yes, that’s five doors on the stage of the Music Box Theater, where a revival of Ken Ludwig’s “Lend Me a Tenor” opened Sunday night. Five doors, primed for slamming, in a single hotel suite. All but incontrovertible physical evidence that farce is on the bill.\n\nAnd slam they do, as Mr. Ludwig’s cast of buffa characters churns through a dizzying plot about an ailing Italian tenor, his jealous wife, a sexy soprano, a scheming impresario and his mousy factotum with dreams of opera stardom. But the heady ether of prime farce never materializes in this labor-intensive but laugh-deficient evening, directed by Stanley Tucci and starring Tony Shalhoub as the desperate impresario and Anthony LaPaglia as the troublesome tenor.\n\nWaiting in antsy boredom for the comic payoff that Mr. Ludwig’s elaborate setup promises, I felt like a kid on Christmas morning, squirming in frustration as Dad labors to put together that fancy new toy  only to discover there are a few parts missing from the box.\n\nMuch of the responsibility for the evening’s only fitful amusement lies with the material itself. “Lend Me a Tenor” was a big hit in its first Broadway run two decades ago, playing for more than a year and winning a Tony for the great Philip Bosco in the role of the impresario. But Frank Rich, writing in The New York Times, noted that Mr. Ludwig’s comedy “is all things farcical except hilarious.” This time around, the unhilarity is almost uninterrupted, and sometimes magnified by miscasting and flaccid pacing.\n\nSet in a tony Cleveland hotel suite in 1934 in the course of a single day, the comedy centers on the anxiously awaited arrival of Tito Merelli, a world-famous tenor who is barnstorming across the country collecting big fees and nightly conquests, despite the slit-eyed supervision of his temperamental wife, Maria (Jan Maxwell). Tonight he performs Verdi’s “Otello”  hardly gala fare in 1934 Ohio, I’d imagine, but necessary for Mr. Ludwig’s mistaken-identity plot.\n\nMr. Shalhoub’s congenitally exasperated Saunders, the impresario, has commissioned his assistant, Max (Justin Bartha of “The Hangover”), to chaperone Merelli, the tenor, making sure that he gets to the theater on time. Max, an aspiring tenor himself who (ludicrously) happens to know the daunting role of Otello by heart, attempts to keep the tempestuous tenor docile by putting him down for a nap, with the help of pharmaceuticals. As curtain time approaches and Merelli remains comatose, it appears there’s no solution but for Max himself to slap on the blackface and slip into the tights, resulting in mayhem when the original recovers and does the same.\n\nThe evening’s skilled actors are more than game for the physical challenges of low comedy. Much of the humor that does land derives from the wordless comic byplay among the characters, as they leap ferociously across the furniture in fits of sexual arousal, rage or stupefied fright. The producers may need to have a physical therapist on call, so relentlessly do the actors fling themselves around the room, and on top of one another. But when you have to display the physical prowess and stamina of a Lance Armstrong to keep the engine of comedy humming at an acceptable level, it’s a sure indication that there is something wrong with the machinery itself.\n\nTrue, a certain amount of inanity is an accepted ingredient in farce, but you could handily herd the entire cast of “Aida,” elephants and all, through the holes in Mr. Ludwig’s labored plot. Nor is there much authentic wit in the dialogue, with most of the jokes centering on the usual lusts and bodily functions.\n\nEven the central comic device  the two Otellos  strikes a sour note in the age of Obama. Is it really so amusing that Max and Merelli, of wildly different body types and voices, would suddenly be perceived as interchangeable simply by putting on blackface and a fright wig?\n\nBoth Mr. Shalhoub and Mr. LaPaglia have been funny in other contexts, and they certainly work hard here. Mr. Shalhoub has won multiple awards for his neurotic detective on the series “Monk,” but he lacks the exuberant temperament of a natural farceur, and his Saunders has a vaguely sinister and funereal aspect, as well as a forced, pseudo-posh accent. Mr. LaPaglia was terrific in a recurring role on “Frasier,” and he dutifully puts on a dopey Italian accent and mugs away, but the role’s outsize silliness is not a smooth fit for his essentially naturalistic style. Mr. Bartha is endearingly addled and nebbishy as Max, but his attempts at singing are dubious at best. (The ending really should have been tweaked to avoid exposing his deficiencies in this regard.)\n\nThe secondary female roles are largely well played, with Ms. Maxwell handling the smoldering tirades of Merelli’s jealous wife with customary stylishness, Mary Catherine Garrison deploying her period-apt kewpie doll charm in the role of the tenor-infatuated ingénue, and Jennifer Laura Thompson slinking up a storm as the predatory soprano. (The gowns, by Martin Pakledinaz, are easy on the eyes.) In the role of the opera gala chairwoman, however, Brooke Adams (Mr. Shalhoub’s wife) is egregiously miscast, utterly lacking the Margaret Dumont-ishness that the part cries out for.\n\nOnce the mechanics of the plot kick in, Mr. Tucci displays a deft hand at the helm, but the sluggish first act could use some juicing. And yet the lack of yeasty comic material is the fundamental problem. Mr. Ludwig’s play draws on many of the classic conventions of farce, which are still workable today, as the writers on “Frasier” handily proved on several occasions, come to think of it.\n\nBut “Lend Me a Tenor” achieves true comic delirium only at the curtain call, when the cast cycles through a mimed version of the lunatic plot in about two minutes. Those two minutes are more charming, and fundamentally funnier, than the two and a half hours of hard labor that have come before.\n\nBy Ken Ludwig; directed by Stanley Tucci; sets by John Lee Beatty; costumes by Martin Pakledinaz; lighting by Kenneth Posner; sound by Peter Hylenski; wig and hair design by Paul Huntley; dialect coach, Stephen Gabis; executive producer, Amanda Watkins.
