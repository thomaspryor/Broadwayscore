  "bwwExcerpt": "Visual in the classic way of traditional farce, Lend Me a Tenor (Music Box) requires no review, only laughter. In this standard door-slamming mixup, about a bush-league opera company stuck with a corpsed-out guest star, the lines and events, unlike those in any other Ken Ludwig play I've ever encountered, all actually function coherently in context. Justin Bartha is fetchingly wistful in the lead, and Tony Shalhoub's bullying eyes, acting epics all over the stage, are a multimedia event in themselves.",
