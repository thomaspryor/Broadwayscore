  "bwwExcerpt": "But what gives this production an unexpected boost is something not usually found in a farce — heart. That quality is supplied by Bartha, making his Broadway debut as the nervous would-be tenor. The actor is a superb farceur, at ease with the verbal complexity of the give-and-take dialogue and the physical demands of the role that have him bouncing around the stage.",
