  "bwwExcerpt": "The premise of the fun is that all white people in blackface look alike. Justin Bartha gets to sing and swagger; the subtle Anthony LaPaglia gets to play dumb; Jan Maxwell gets to behave as outrageously as Lady Gaga; and the charming Tony Shalhoub, the impresario between a rock and a hard place, gets to do everything else, including spit wax fruit at the audience and twice try to strangle the Italian star he thinks has died on him. Unlike the modern masters of the form, Georges Feydeau and Joe Orton, Ludwig never raises the characters’ level of confusion or aggression to the point of breakdown. The shriek of madness, when it finally comes in Ludwig’s fun machine, gets laughs, but it’s unearned by the writing.",
