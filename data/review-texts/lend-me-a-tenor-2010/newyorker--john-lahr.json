  "bwwExcerpt": "The premise of the fun is that all white people in blackface look alike. Justin Bartha gets to sing and swagger; the subtle Anthony LaPaglia gets to play dumb; Jan Maxwell gets to behave as outrageously as Lady Gaga; and the charming Tony Shalhoub, the impresario between a rock and a hard place, gets to do everything else, including spit wax fruit at the audience and twice try to strangle the Italian star he thinks has died on him. Unlike the modern masters of the form, Georges Feydeau and Joe Orton, Ludwig never raises the characters’ level of confusion or aggression to the point of breakdown. The shriek of madness, when it finally comes in Ludwig’s fun machine, gets laughs, but it’s unearned by the writing.",

  "fullText": "“Art to me is an anecdote of the spirit,” Rothko said. If you think this is true, and I do, then what do you call a Broadway farce? An anecdote of the audience and its refusal to think, I guess. In all the harum-scarum high jinks of “Lend Me a Tenor,” Ken Ludwig’s romp about opera (slickly directed by Stanley Tucci, at the Music Box), there is a lot of theatrical panache on display, but not one idea. The mistaken identities raise no issues, and the jokes have no bite, but the customers seem to have a high old time being gummed to death by the folderol. An imported temperamental Italian tenor, who is scheduled to play the Moor in the gala Cleveland opening of Verdi’s “Otello,” is inadvertently drugged into a dead sleep. Cancellation is imminent. Or can his lovelorn buttoned-down designated American minder step in and save the day? You guess.\n\nThe premise of the fun is that all white people in blackface look alike. Justin Bartha gets to sing and swagger; the subtle Anthony LaPaglia gets to play dumb; Jan Maxwell gets to behave as outrageously as Lady Gaga; and the charming Tony Shalhoub, the impresario between a rock and a hard place, gets to do everything else, including spit wax fruit at the audience and twice try to strangle the Italian star he thinks has died on him. Unlike the modern masters of the form, Georges Feydeau and Joe Orton, Ludwig never raises the characters’ level of confusion or aggression to the point of breakdown. The shriek of madness, when it finally comes in Ludwig’s fun machine, gets laughs, but it’s unearned by the writing. Not that those in the audience mind. They’ve paid up to an eye-watering hundred and twenty-one dollars to exist for a couple of hours in a safe, carefree world where everything is “a peachy-pie,” as the play says. Tucci serves it up on a shiny plate with a cherry on top. ♦\n\nLinks to articles and Web-only features, in your inbox every Monday.\n\nA weekly note from the New Yorker's cartoon editor.\n\nMore news, politics, culture, business, and technology:\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (Revised January 7, 2009) and Privacy Policy (Revised January 7, 2009).

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Lahr criticizes the show's intellectual emptiness and lack of substance while acknowledging the performers' skills and audience enjoyment. His condescending tone toward both the material and audience indicates clear disappointment. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the theatrical panache and audience enjoyment but criticizes the lack of substance and depth in the play. The critic does not recommend against seeing it but highlights significant shortcomings. | Gemini: The critic acknowledges theatrical panache but ultimately finds the play lacking in substance and originality, comparing it unfavorably to masters of the form. The review suggests the audience enjoys it despite its flaws, but the critic does not recommend it. | Kimi: While acknowledging the slick direction and professional performances, the critic dismisses the writing as devoid of ideas and the comedy as 'unearned,' ultimately characterizing the show as empty 'folderol' for undiscriminating audiences paying too much for safe, mindless entertainment.",
