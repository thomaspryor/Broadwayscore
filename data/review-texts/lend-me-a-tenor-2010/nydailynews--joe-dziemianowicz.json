  "bwwExcerpt": "Dramatic actor Anthony LaPaglia proves himself a deft comic as skirt-chaser Tito and Jan Maxwell is living laughing gas as his hissing, howling hellcat of a wife, Maria. She outdoes this season's earlier standout female comic turn - also hers, in 'The Royal Family.' The evening's great surprise: Justin Bartha, known for adorable sidekick roles in 'National Treasure' and 'The Hangover.' He's fall-down funny and owns the show as mild-mannered-turned-manly Max.",
