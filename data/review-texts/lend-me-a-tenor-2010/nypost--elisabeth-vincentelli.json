  "bwwExcerpt": "There are bona fide stars in the re vival of Ken Ludwig's 'Lend Me a Tenor,' which opened last night: Tony Shalhoub from 'Monk' and Anthony LaPaglia, a Tony winner for 'A View From the Bridge' in 1998. But it's Justin Bartha -- the missing groom from the hit movie 'The Hangover' -- who takes the final bow. And Bartha deserves it: He's the engine that powers this show. He doesn't just make his Broadway debut, he dynamites the doors open. Happily, the rest of the cast rises to the challenge, and 'Lend Me a Tenor' is exactly what it needs to be: hilarious.",
