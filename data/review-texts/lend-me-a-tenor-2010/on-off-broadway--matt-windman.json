  "bwwExcerpt": "Oh, the joys of light farcical comedy: doors slamming, mistaken identities, frantic pace, frenzied chaos, shameless personalities, double entendres, sexual innuendos. It's all in 'Lend Me a Tenor,' Ken Ludwig's recreation of a 1930s screwball comedy of errors. Stanley Tucci, who is making debut as a stage director, has not reinterpreted the popular comedy so much as meticulously rebuilt it as a crowd pleasing farce. The ensemble cast includes Anthony LaPaglia, Tony Shalhoub, Justin Bartha and Jan Maxwell.",
