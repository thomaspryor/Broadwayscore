  "bwwExcerpt": "Despite a serious case of miscasting, Stanley Tucci's riotous staging of Ken Ludwig's 'Lend Me a Tenor' provides an evening full of belly laughs, slapstick action, and projectiles aimed into the orchestra seats. If you want to laugh yourself silly and you're willing to duck fruit, champagne corks, and flung roses, this is the show for you. But you're going to have to suspend a huge chunk of your disbelief, and I suspect the main audience for this 1989 farce will be more than willing to do so.",
