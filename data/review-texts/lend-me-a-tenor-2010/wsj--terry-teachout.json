  "bwwExcerpt": "Ken Ludwig writes comfy, low-stakes farces in which no one is embarrassed—at least not for long—and all of the characters live happily ever after. 'Lend Me a Tenor,' last seen on Broadway in 1990, is the quintessential example of Mr. Ludwig's easygoing comic approach, a farce about a production of Verdi's 'Otello' whose star (here played by Anthony LaPaglia) fails to show up for opening night. The plot is properly labyrinthine, the jokes reasonably clever, but never once do you thrill with sadistic glee as a pompous twit strolls heedlessly toward his well-deserved rendezvous with humiliation. If that's what you expect from a farce—and I do—you'll find 'Lend Me a Tenor' to be amiable but more then a few teeth short. If not, you'll like it just fine.",
