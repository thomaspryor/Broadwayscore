  "bwwExcerpt": "'Fun Home' is a thoroughly dynamic piece that is just as emotionally piercing, good-humored and enjoyable as it is sharp, focused and culturally conscious. It belongs on the list of the smartest, most innovative musicals written in the Sondheim tradition of the past decade, such as 'Spring Awakening,' 'Next to Normal' and 'The Scottsboro Boys.'",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong unqualified praise comparing it to acclaimed musicals like Spring Awakening and Next to Normal, calling it 'thoroughly dynamic' and placing it among the 'smartest, most innovative' works. However, single excerpt warning requires medium confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises 'Fun Home' as dynamic, emotionally piercing, and culturally conscious, comparing it to other highly regarded musicals, indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"thoroughly dynamic,\" \"emotionally piercing,\" \"good-humored,\" and \"enjoyable,\" indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers high praise comparing the show to acclaimed works like 'Spring Awakening' and 'Next to Normal,' though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about whether the full review maintained this enthusiasm. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
