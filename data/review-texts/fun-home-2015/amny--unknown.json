  "bwwExcerpt": "'Fun Home' is a thoroughly dynamic piece that is just as emotionally piercing, good-humored and enjoyable as it is sharp, focused and culturally conscious. It belongs on the list of the smartest, most innovative musicals written in the Sondheim tradition of the past decade, such as 'Spring Awakening,' 'Next to Normal' and 'The Scottsboro Boys.'",
  "bwwScore": 10
