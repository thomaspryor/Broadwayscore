  "bwwExcerpt": "The show is heady with mood-shifting music by Jeanine Tesori and an ingratiating, unflinching book by lyricist Lisa Kron. Moving back and forth in time, we relive the conflicting family dynamics with Alison -- played here by three terrific actresses of different ages -- who comes out as a lesbian just four months before her increasingly erratic father, a closeted gay man, kills himself.",
