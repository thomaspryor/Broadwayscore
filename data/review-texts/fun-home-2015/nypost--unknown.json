  "bwwExcerpt": "And aside from a couple of upbeat, spot-on pastiches of the Jackson 5 and the Partridge Family, Tesori's score is a comforting blanket of acousti-pop. In this rather daring project, a final anthem about flying seems rather old-fashioned. Still, 'Fun Home' is an important show. That it managed to make it to Broadway at all is a reason to rejoice.",
