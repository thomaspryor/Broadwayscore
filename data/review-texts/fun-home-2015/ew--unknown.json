  "bwwExcerpt": "All three Alisons share the same refreshing kind of naturalism, and each actress makes the part her own without showboating or selling the story's knottier sentiments short to reach the cheap seats. A little bit of nuance inevitably gets lost when subject matter this dark is set to song; death and deep family schisms, after all, aren't always fit for jazz hands. But like the book, Fun Home manages to use an oft-unserious medium to deliver something seriously, singularly moving.",
