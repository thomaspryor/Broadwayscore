  "fullText": "ExpandFrom left, Judy Kuhn, Oscar Williams, Zell Steele Morrow, Sydney Lucas and Michael Cerveris. (©2015, Joan Marcus)\n\nIn its Broadway residence, \"Fun Home\" has a new floor plan, but it still moves you to your foundation.\n\nNo surprise. The musical has great bones.\n\nBased on a graphic memoir by cartoonist Alison Bechdel, the show follows her youth and as she comes out in college in the late 1970s. Around the same time she learns that her father, Bruce, who kills himself, was also gay.\n\nIt's unconventional grist, to be sure, and musical theater is better for it. The material is handled with such delicacy and expertise that it speaks universally about Big Things That Matter: life, love, family, surviving.\n\nThe Bechdel family mortuary — Fun Home is the cheeky nickname — provides a metaphor-rich and all too real setting.\n\nWriter and lyricist Lisa Kron (\"Well\") and composer Jeanine Tesori (\"Caroline, or Change\") turn this into an uplifting musical drama of rare intensity, honesty and beauty through melodically rich songs that summon yearning, heartache and joy. A bright musical flourish that repeatedly sounds is like a fanfare for an uncommon family.\n\nThe Alisons, from left: Sydney Lucas, Beth Malone and Emily Skeggs. (©2015, Joan Marcus)\n\nIn an inspired, \"Boyhood\"-like creative stroke, Alison appears at three ages: a tomboy eager for her dad's attention; an Oberlin College student; and an omnipresent 43-year-old cartoonist watching her selves and searching for clues to understand the past.\n\nIt's as if Alison is putting a puzzle together — and director Sam Gold's in-the-round staging supports that idea. We see characters from different views. Perspectives shift, as in life. Beds, pianos and people rise up from beneath the stage, and then, like memories, disappear in a flash.\n\nAs in the plays's 2013 run at the Public Theater, the cast is excellent. The Alisons all shine in solo moments. Sydney Lucas, the youngest, unlocks what she's feeling when she sings \"Keys.\" Emily Skeggs, the coed, embraces her sexuality with the delightful \"Changing My Major.\" Beth Malone surveys the dimension of her dad's life in the wistful \"Maps.\"\n\nAs the bedeviled Bruce, Michael Cerveris delivers an even greater emotional payoff than before. As his long-suffering wife, Helen, the exquisite Judy Kuhn is indelible as she sings of her life with conditioned dry-eyed composure.\n\nBe prepared to wipe away tears.",
