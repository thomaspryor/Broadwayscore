  "bwwExcerpt": "The hidden strength of the show is Judy Kuhn (of LES MISERABLES and Chess), as the mother Helen. Helen seems almost invisible in this family, her true self having dwindled over the course of the marriage. Late in the show, she is revealed to have been very much aware of the situation all along; but what could she do other than sit at the piano, passively practicing Chopin? 'Chaos never happens if it's never seen,' she repeatedly notes. Finally comes her song, which illuminates the show.",
