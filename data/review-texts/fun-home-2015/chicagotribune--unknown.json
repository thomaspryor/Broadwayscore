  "bwwExcerpt": "Cerveris - no doubt with the help of the director, Sam Gold, whose storytelling has surety and sensitivity - figured out that the way to play Bruce was the opposite of the obvious choice of a repressed, bottled-up man. Cerveris, whose performance is deeply disturbing in all the right ways, shows you a man acting out constantly, a man whose denial of self has meant excessive hunger for stimuli of all kinds.",
