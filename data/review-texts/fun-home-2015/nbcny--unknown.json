  "bwwExcerpt": "Jeanine Tesori's music still resonates (the sharp-as-a-razor book is by Lisa Kron). Crowd-pleasing comic turns have Small Alison and her brothers (Oscar Williams and Zell Steele Morrow, both talented mop-tops) imagining a TV commercial for the 'Fun Home.' In a fantasy sequence, Lucas recasts the people in her orbit as members of The Partridge Family.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises music and book as 'sharp-as-a-razor' and notes 'crowd-pleasing' moments, but limited text prevents assessment of full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the music and book, indicating a positive view. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context mean the confidence is low, and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the music and book, and describes some enjoyable scenes. With only one excerpt, it's difficult to gauge the overall recommendation strength, but it leans positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the show's music ('resonates'), book ('sharp-as-a-razor'), and performances ('crowd-pleasing', 'talented'), indicating a clear recommendation. Per the single-excerpt guidance, the clearly positive tone warrants an upper-range Positive score.",
