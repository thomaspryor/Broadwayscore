  "bwwExcerpt": "Could a musical focusing on a lesbian cartoonist whose closeted father kills himself fly on Broadway? For anyone who saw Fun Home during its run downtown at the Public Theater last season, that's a rhetorical question. From the start, this adaptation ofAlison Bechdel's autobiographical graphic novel had all the earmarks of a contemporary hit: topical subject matter, a wittily irreverent but emotionally compelling book and score (by composer Jeanine Tesori and lyricist/librettist Lisa Kron), and characters who are at once intriguingly idiosyncratic and instantly accessible.",
