    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Excerpt compares show favorably to classic Tennessee Williams and places composer alongside Sondheim and Larson. However, single curated quote limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides high praise, comparing the musical favorably to 'The Glass Menagerie' and highlighting the exceptional quality of the script and music. The comparison to Sondheim and Larson suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt is highly complimentary, comparing the show favorably to The Glass Menagerie and the work of Sondheim and Larson. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
