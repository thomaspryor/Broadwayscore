    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for the lead performance with positive descriptors like 'gentle, disarming sweetness' and 'heartfelt and freshly minted,' but this appears to be a truncated excerpt focusing only on one performer, limiting confidence in the overall assessment. | Gemini: The review focuses on the positive aspects of the lead actor's performance, describing it as sweet, disarming, and growing in assurance and depth. This suggests a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: This excerpt offers warm, unreserved praise for the lead performance, describing it as 'heartfelt and freshly minted' with growing depth, indicating a solid recommendation despite the brevity of the text.",
