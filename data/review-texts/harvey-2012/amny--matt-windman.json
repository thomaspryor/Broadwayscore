  "bwwExcerpt": "In retrospect, it's hard to believe that 'Harvey' won the 1945 Pulitzer Prize over Tennessee Williams' 'The Glass Menagerie.' Even so, 'Harvey' remains a well-crafted, cute play with a terrific leading role, an invisible supporting character and a good deal of psychological dimension. Parsons' Elwood is not unlike a sweet and innocent child who is far more likable and trustworthy compared to the overstressed, often silly adults around him.",
