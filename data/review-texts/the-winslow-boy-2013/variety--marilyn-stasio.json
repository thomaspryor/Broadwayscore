  "bwwExcerpt": "Like some forgotten treasure found in the attic, the Old Vic's radiant revival of 'The Winslow Boy' - now presented on Broadway by the Roundabout Theater - practically glows in the dark. Terence Rattigan based his 1946 drama on the actual experience of an upper-middle-class family whose legal defense of a son's honor became a cause celebre when its brief against the English political establishment was debated in London's High Court. A top-drawer ensemble masterfully helmed by Lindsay Posner and headed by Roger Rees do the honors in this tense legal drama, which Rattigan has shrewdly taken out of the courtroom and into the drawing room.",
