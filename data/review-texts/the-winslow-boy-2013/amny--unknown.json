  "bwwExcerpt": "One wonders if Lindsay Posner's revival, which was originally done at London's Old Vic, fared better with an English cast in front of an English audience. Here, it comes off as stale and stiff drawing-room fare that only springs to life whenever Roger Rees, who plays the father, seizes the stage in a fit of passion. Later this season, Roundabout will produce Sophie Treadwell's 1928 expressionist drama 'Machinal,' a brilliant, daring, female-centered work that is a rarity. That promises to be far more exciting than 'The Winslow Boy.'",
