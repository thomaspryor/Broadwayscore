  "bwwExcerpt": "As anybody who's ever seen a rom-com knows, the real spark is between Catherine and Morton, whose antagonism morphs into grudging admiration. Watching Parry and Nivola stiffly dance around each other's feelings is melanchic and delightful. Where love's concerned, at least - unlike in a courtroom - there is no clear winner or loser.",
