  "bwwExcerpt": "'The Winslow Boy' often uses dialogue to fill us in on what we don't see, committing the supposed sin of telling rather than showing. But the failure to stage the climactic courtroom scene is actually one of Rattigan's finest touches. The play is not about whether Ronnie is guilty; it's about the impact on his family. Focusing on its members' reactions, in their home, as they and we ponder whether their quest for truth and justice was worth it, is exactly right.",
