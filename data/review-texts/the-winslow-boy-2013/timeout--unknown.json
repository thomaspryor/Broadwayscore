  "bwwExcerpt": "The perfectly chosen floral green wallpaper of Peter McKintosh's set forThe Winslow Boy is emblematic of the marvelous attention to detail that distinguishes Lindsay Posner's handsome revival. Terence Rattigan's crisp 1946 drama, inspired by a real incident that polarized Edwardian London, concerns the struggle of middle-class father Arthur Winslow to clear the name of his teenage son, Ronnie (Spencer David Milford)-and stand up for English fairness-after the lad is expelled from a naval academy for stealing a five-shilling postal order.",
