  "bwwExcerpt": "Directed with exquisite nuance by Lindsay Posner, the production -- Broadway's first since 1947 -- runs two and three-quarter talky hours and employs 11 delightfully stylish actors to make something magnificently satisfying from a petty, basically irrelevant very English story...Roger Rees is wonderful as father of the boy (Spencer Davis Milford)...But this is a genuine ensemble that makes incredulity seem real and very human.",
