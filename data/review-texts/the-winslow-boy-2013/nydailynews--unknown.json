  "bwwExcerpt": "In 'The Winslow Boy,' Terence Rattigan's compelling 1946 drama about family and justice, that declaration echoes loudly. How great it is that the Roundabout revival - Broadway's one and only - gets things so right. Credit director Lindsay Posner, who staged the play at London's Old Vic and recast it for New York. Scrupulously acted and handsomely designed, the show vibrates with humor and genuine emotion.",
