  "bwwExcerpt": "Billed as a transfer of the production of the play done by the Old Vic in London, the set and costume design by Peter McKintosh emphasizes how British this play - they are both sumptuous and staid. The play, at two hours and 45 minutes (including intermission), takes its time. But the surprising humor, and the vibrant and detailed performances of the cast, especially Roger Rees, who noticeably deteriorates over the two years that the play takes place, and Charlotte Parry as his equally stubborn daughter, offer so much more juice than the more overtly relevant (and far duller) play of Rattigan's that the Roundabout revived two years ago starring Frank Langella , Man and Boy. 'The Winslow Boy,' the 18th production of a Rattigan play on Broadway, but only the third over the last 40 years, is more likely to make theatergoers wonder whether there is anything else of his as worth reviving.",
