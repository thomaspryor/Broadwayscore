  "bwwExcerpt": "Directed for the screen by Anthony Asquith in 1948, and again by David Mamet in 1999, the play was last seen on Broadway 65 years ago. It's a slow starter, and indeed its unhurried four acts might seem to lack economy for contemporary audiences. But in a production as expertly judged and performed as this one, there's real pleasure in settling into the plush upholstery to savor the nuances of character, the subtle humor and fine shadings of the drama's consideration of justice and honor.",
