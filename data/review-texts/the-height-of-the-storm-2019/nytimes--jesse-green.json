  "bwwExcerpt": "You have to admit that a playwright could do worse than creating a juicy acting exercise for treasurable actors in their 70s (Mr. Pryce) and 80s (Ms. Atkins). Does it matter so much that for all their skill - set off by Mr. Kent's exquisitely decorous Broadway staging - there's no there there? It does. Even if you accept that 'The Height of the Storm' (as I wrote about 'The Father') is more of a vehicle than a destination, you may eventually grow weary of being taken for a ride.",
