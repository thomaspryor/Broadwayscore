  "bwwExcerpt": "'The Height of the Storm' is essentially a fuzzier, opaque reworking of Zeller's 'The Father,' which also depicted an elderly man named André (then played by Frank Langella) suffering from severe dementia in an intense and jarring manner. The principal difference is that 'The Height of the Storm,' in taking on a jumbled structure and always trying to play games with the audience, feels thin, repetitive and too conceptual.",
