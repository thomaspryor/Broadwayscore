    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The word 'nonetheless' suggests reservations, but 'emotionally wrenching' and 'digs fiercely' are strong positive descriptors. Single excerpt warning applies - setting confidence to low and scoring in upper Positive range given the clear praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'emotionally wrenching' and 'digs fiercely into the heart of the play,' indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive emotional impact, but without more context, it's difficult to gauge the overall strength of the recommendation. I'm placing it in the positive range with medium confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production's emotional impact and direction, describing it as 'emotionally wrenching' and effective at capturing the play's essence. However, confidence is low given this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's balance of praise and criticism.",
