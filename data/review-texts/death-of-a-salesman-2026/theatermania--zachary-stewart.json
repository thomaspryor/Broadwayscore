However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise calling the show 'the great tragedy of our time,' indicating strong enthusiasm. Following single-excerpt guidance to use the upper end of the Positive bucket (80-84) for clearly positive curated quotes.",
