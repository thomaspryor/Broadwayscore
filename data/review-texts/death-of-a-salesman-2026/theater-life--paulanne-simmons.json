    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear positive assessment calling it a 'crowd pleaser' that 'makes us feel a lot better.' However, confidence is low due to limited text availability - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as a 'crowd pleaser' with humor that enhances the experience, suggesting a positive reception. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is clearly positive, stating the show is a 'crowd pleaser' and 'makes us feel a lot better.' Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the production as a 'crowd pleaser' with effective humor that delivers a satisfying theatrical experience, indicating a clear positive recommendation despite having only a single curated quote available.",
