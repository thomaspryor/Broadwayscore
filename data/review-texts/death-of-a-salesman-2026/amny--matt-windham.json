    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising performances as 'powerful' and 'superb', but limited text prevents assessment of overall show recommendation. Low confidence due to cherry-picked excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances as 'individualized and powerful' and highlights specific actors' portrayals positively. However, without a full review or a clear overall verdict, the confidence is low, and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the strength of the performances, using words like \"powerful\" and \"superb\", suggesting a positive, albeit limited, recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic, unqualified praise for the entire cast, using superlatives like 'superb' and 'powerful' to describe the performances. However, confidence is low because this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the reviewer's assessment of the production as a whole.",
