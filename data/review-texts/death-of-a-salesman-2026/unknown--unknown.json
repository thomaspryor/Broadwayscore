However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The critic states they would gladly stay longer to watch the story continue, indicating a positive experience, but the length of the show suggests a reservation. Given that this is a single excerpt, the score is placed in the middle of the positive range.",
