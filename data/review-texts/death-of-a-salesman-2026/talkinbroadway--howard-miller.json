    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, this contains extremely strong praise - 'extraordinary performances', 'excellent' cast, and the superlative claim about it being the finest production audiences will ever see. This level of praise indicates a rave review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the performances and the production as a whole, suggesting it is an exceptional rendition of the play. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"extraordinary performances\" and \"finer production\" indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt provides superlative praise for the lead performances and deems this the finest production of the play likely to be staged, though the single-excerpt format warrants caution about the full review context. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
