The backhanded compliment 'too much of a show' indicates mixed feelings rather than clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed sentiment, acknowledging the effort but hinting at excess. With only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a mixed reaction, acknowledging a strong performance but also implying it can be excessive. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, acknowledging the production's entertainment value while criticizing its excess, suggesting a recommendation with reservations typical of the lower Positive range.",
