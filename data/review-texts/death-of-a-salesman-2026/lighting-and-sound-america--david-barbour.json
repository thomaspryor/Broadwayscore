    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Praises performances as 'strong, stunning' but criticizes the production as 'sometimes uncertain.' Single excerpt from larger review limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the lead actors' performances but describes the production as 'sometimes uncertain,' indicating a mixed assessment. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the actors' performances but notes uncertainty in the production, suggesting a positive but not rave recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic criticizes the production as 'uncertain,' the enthusiastic praise for the lead actors ('strong, stunning, highly original') indicates a recommendation based on the performances. The single excerpt limits certainty about the overall verdict. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
