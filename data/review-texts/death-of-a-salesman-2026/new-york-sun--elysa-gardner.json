  "bwwExcerpt": "New shades of friction and menace also emerge between characters played by black and white actors. I have never found the scene in which Howard humiliates a desperate, pleading Willy, or the one where a teenage Biff discovers his father's infidelity, more excruciating than I did here. Even Loman's interaction with Charley, the mensch of a neighbor who repeatedly tries in vain to help him - movingly played by Delaney Williams, a white actor (and another 'Wire' alum) - seems a little more fraught",
