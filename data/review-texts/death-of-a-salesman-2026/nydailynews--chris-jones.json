However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment might not be fully captured, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The single excerpt available focuses on the strength of the lead performance, explicitly stating it is \"the reason to see the show.\" Given the limited information, I am scoring it as a positive review, leaning towards the higher end due to the strong endorsement, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly identifies the performance as 'the reason to see the show,' indicating a clear recommendation, though the limited context requires low confidence.",
