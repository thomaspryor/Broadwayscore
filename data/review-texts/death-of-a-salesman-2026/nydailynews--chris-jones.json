  "bwwExcerpt": "In the present, though, the show is often superb: the scene between Willy and Howard, ruthlessly played by Blake DeLong, is riveting, amplified by unspoken racism as are the scenes with Stanley, played by the same fabulous actor, here taking what's usually a plot functionary and forging a blend of obsequiousness, kindness and racism, all at once. Clarke's monologues are potent, rooted and deeply touching and, as Happy, McKinley Belcher III brings far more to that role than we usually see; in this production, the relationship between Happy and Willy seems more central than between Biff and Willy. And Delaney Williams (also known for 'The Wire') is an honest, earnest Charlie, a decent white guy holding up a Black family in crisis, understanding he's probably next for a cemetery that levels us all.",

However, this is an excerpt only, so confidence is medium due to incomplete text. | GPT-4o: The review excerpts highlight strong performances and impactful scenes, using terms like 'superb', 'riveting', and 'potent'. Without the full text, the confidence is low, but the available quotes suggest a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights several strong performances and scenes, suggesting a positive overall experience despite the limited text. The word \"superb\" indicates a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers enthusiastic praise for the production, describing it as 'often superb' with 'riveting' scenes and 'potent' performances, though the excerpt format limits full context.",
