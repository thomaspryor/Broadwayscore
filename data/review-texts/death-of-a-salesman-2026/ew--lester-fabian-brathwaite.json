  "bwwExcerpt": "Nearly 75 years after it first premiered, Death of a Salesman still says more than we care to admit about America, about how one can work their entire life and end up with nothing, how you're worth more dead than you are alive, how the system is rigged against the little guy. Maybe the enduring message of this production is that these themes are universal, that we all suffer the same under the yolk of The American Dream. And that, in spite of the odds, we all aspire to be great.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows thoughtful engagement with the show's themes and finds 'enduring message' value, suggesting positive reception. However, with only one curated quote available, confidence is low and score stays at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive interpretation of the production's themes, highlighting universality and aspiration. However, without more context, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a cautious, mildly positive score. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive message and aspiration, but the limited text and 'maybe' qualifier indicate a reservation. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates appreciation for the production's universal themes and enduring message, suggesting a thoughtful recommendation, though limited context requires conservative scoring in the lower Positive range.",
