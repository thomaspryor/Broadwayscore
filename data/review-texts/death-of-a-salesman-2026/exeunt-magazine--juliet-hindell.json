    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies - this curated quote is clearly positive with 'electrifying performances and inventive staging,' suggesting strong recommendation. Using upper end of Positive bucket due to enthusiastic language, but low confidence given limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and staging as 'electrifying' and 'inventive,' suggesting a strong positive impression. However, with only a single excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises \"electrifying performances and inventive staging,\" indicating a positive assessment. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong praise ('electrifying', 'inventive') indicating a clear recommendation for this revival, though confidence is reduced due to limited text availability.",
