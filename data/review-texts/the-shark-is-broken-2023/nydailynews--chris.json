  "fullText": "ExpandThis image provided by Matthew Murphy shows Alex Brightman, from left, Ian Shaw and Colin Donnell in a scene from the play \"The Shark is Broken.\" (Matthew Murphy/AP)\n\nRobert Shaw had three wives, 10 kids and globs of talent as both a writer and an actor of Shakespearean prowess and self-regard. He also was a raging alcoholic who once dryly observed, not without foundation: “Can you imagine being a movie star and having to take it seriously without a drink?”\n\nAppearing in “Macbeth” only gets you so much dough and Shaw’s most famous role ended up being that of the shark hunter Quint, a flinty, nautical crazy-dude who could have have been created by Eugene O’Neill, in the blockbuster movie “Jaws.”\n\nThat 1975 Stephen Spielberg film was based on a 1974 Peter Benchley book that Shaw probably could have written better himself. As a kid, I remember memorizing the sex scenes in the pulpy paperback (“Ellen started to giggle again, imagining the sight of Hooper lying next to her ...). They didn’t show up in the film.\n\nThis image provided by Matthew Murphy shows Colin Donnell, left, and Alex Brightman in a scene from the play \"The Shark is Broken.\"  (Matthew Murphy/AP)\n\nBut the larger-than-life Shaw was very much present on the oceanic set off Martha’s Vineyard, as were his floating bottles of booze, co-starring with Roy Scheider, playing the irritating police chief Martin Brody, and Richard Dreyfuss, playing the marine biologist Matt Hooper, shorn of his affair and reduced mostly to scientific neuroses, and several pneumatically controlled sharks.\n\nAnd since the fake sea dogs rarely cooperated with Spielberg, Shaw (drunk), Dreyfuss (nervous) and Scheider (wiry, irritating) all were left to float around on a crappy boat for hours at a time. Boozing it up and getting on each other’s nerves.\n\nThat’s the premise of “The Shark is Broken,” the wacky new Broadway show which opened Thursday night at the John Golden Theatre. It’s penned by Ian Shaw and Joseph Nixon. Ian is Robert Shaw’s kid, and he also stars as his dad, and it features Alex Brightman as Dreyfuss and Colin Donnell as Scheider.\n\n“What psychological insights into Shaw might we be offered?” I wondered on the way into the theater, “What deep-dive revelations await from a creative act that would appear to be both hubristic and profoundly courageous?” The younger Shaw must have had a window into his father that would have eluded most biographers. Or so you’d think.\n\nAlas, the show doesn’t deliver much at all. Not only is the low-stakes script dull and pedestrian, but the characters change not at all, despite the premise of three wild men sitting in a boat, waiting not for Godot but sharks and Spielberg.\n\n“The Shark is Broken” had its origins at the Edinburgh Festival, and in that context, it no doubt was a good campy laugh, especially for an audience that had followed Shaw’s pre-gaming example. But it makes for thin Broadway gruel, alas, with a 90-minute running time, a straight-up POV, and a series of behind-the-camera recreations of a situation that already has been much dissected and discussed.\n\nIan Shaw has decided who these three guys were from the beginning and he then never varies. Even his father’s famous monologue about the sinking of the Indianapolis (the greatest loss of life in the history of the U.S. Navy) doesn’t pop as it does in the film, where you can see a static and stunned Dreyfuss in the corner of the shot, staring in silent admiration at his smashed co-star’s indestructible acting prowess. It’s not easy to play Robert Shaw, even when he is your dad.\n\nFor sure, this was a solid idea for a comedy. Brightman, Donnell and (of course) Shaw all look very much like the men they are portraying and Brightman’s portrait of Dreyfuss is, at times, funny. As directed by Guy Masterson, the show also has some amusing play with 1970s lines that now land very differently, although the price that is paid there for pointing up these pretty cheap gags is a loss of overall veracity.\n\nBut in the end, there’s not a lot here: No crazy shark puppets, little sense of the raging seas nor of tormented, insecure actors — not much for the eye to see and very little happening that you don’t anticipate just five or 10 minutes into the show.\n\nWhat Shaw has is a starting point, perhaps, and maybe even the basis of a potential meta screenplay about the chaotic making of one of the most famous thrillers of all time. Heck, we already had “Jaws 2,” “Jaws 3-D,” “Jaws: The Revenge.” Why not one more about three men in a boat?\n\nBut that would need a major rewrite, a freer spirit and a willingness to travel a whole lot further into the deep.",
