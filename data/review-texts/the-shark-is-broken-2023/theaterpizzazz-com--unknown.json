  "fullText": "Yes, you have to have seen the film Jaws. It’s not, however, necessary to remember the publicized adversity suffered by its production.\n\nHaving paid $175,000 for the rights to Peter Benchley’s Jaws before it was published, producer David Brown said he’d never have done so had he known of the difficulties ahead. The four million dollar budget swelled to nine. Robert Shaw, who hated the script, was talked into taking the job by his wife. The alcoholic hid liquor bottles all over the set. Having been told not to bother reading the book, Richard Dreyfuss, seasick much of the time, had no idea what he was getting into. Afraid his film The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz was a failure, he accepted without question. All the chaos that went into the making of Jaws is portrayed in The Shark is Broken—a new play by Joseph Nixon and Ian Shaw (son of the film’s star, Robert Shaw)—now playing at the Golden Theatre on Broadway.\n\nSteven Spielberg, just 27 years old, was apparently the third choice for director. The relative novice insisted on filming in the ocean, unaware that salt water was destructive to the mechanical shark’s animatronics, causing corrosion. Neoprene foam that was utilized ballooned. Rebuilt several times, the shark came to be called “Bruce,” after Spielberg&#8217;s lawyer. The co-star was ultimately rarely used, inadvertently adding to onscreen tension. Cameras got soaked. Weather wrecked scheduling. Spielberg gave several after-interviews admitting to working through PTSD.\n\nMay 1974. Ominous music (oddly not the Jaws theme): “What a God almighty, fucking waste of time! We’ve been on this boat—what—five days?!” Richard Dreyfuss grouses, knee gyrating like Thumper. “Jews shouldn’t be near water.” “Didn’t Jesus walk on water,” Roy Scheider quietly quips looking over the top of his New York Times (there’s a “Nixon Resigns” headline). “And look what happened to him!” comes the retort. Dreyfuss runs to the rail, sick. Scheider volunteers facts about sharks. The question of why filming didn’t take place in a tank rises. Macho Robert Shaw notes he wouldn’t have done it “in a goddamn tank.”\n\nDreyfuss is dying to do Shakespeare (he never did) in order to be thought of as a “legitimate” actor. Shaw, who’d acted in Shakespeare plays, and readily quotes the Bard, scoffs. The two actors are at one another throughout, even provoking physical attacks. Shaw might’ve been trying to heighten the newcomer’s performance. “It’s the grit in the oyster that creates the pearl,” he tells Scheider when it&#8217;s suggested he ease up. Both Shaw and Dreyfuss have oversized egos and tempers. Shaw is drinking; Dreyfuss indulges in coke. Scheider often acts as mediator.\n\nWe watch the men play tabletop games. Shaw rewrites a five-page speech (Benchley’s script is said to have been awful). Sea shanties are sung. Talk about their fathers and how they got into the business is interesting. Dreyfuss has a meltdown. Insults fly. Shaw passes out.\n\nThe piece manages to incorporate character idiosyncrasies, relationships, and events with clarity and economy. It’s revealing and smart/funny. Not satire, but rather a fisheye view. The Broadway venue and price, however, feels out of proportion.\n\nFor a time, Jaws was the highest-grossing film of all time. Beach traffic changed perceptibly. The movie is arguably the forerunner of what we now refer to as the summer blockbuster. It spawned three lesser sequels, a documentary, and a spate of tell-all books. And it put Steven Spielberg on the map.\n\nAlex Brightman successfully delivers Richard Dreyfuss’s barking, staccato speech, erratic nerves, general misery, and pendulum swing from insecurity to bravado.\n\nColin Donnell’s Roy Scheider is credibly the single element of calm, physical grace and health, as well as believable, curious intellect.\n\nIan Shaw is less consistent than his peers. His drunkenness and the delivery of theatrical quotes (for which Robert Shaw was known) are convincing, but his overall demeanor appears less grounded.\n\nDirector Guy Masterson channels deft mannerisms for each actor portrayed. Using the confined set with imagination and veracity, he makes the boat seem more spacious. Outbursts ebb and flow so that each feels specific and provoked. Humor lands without self-consciousness.\n\nDuncan Henderson’s boat cross-section smartly includes a bit of sunbathing deck and space for actors to climb in from the other side as if boarding.\n\nVideo Design by Nina Dunn looks simple, but adds constant nuance with the ocean’s horizon line bobbing, waves lapping against the audience side of the boat; plus, changes in hour, sky, sea, and storm. Coordination with Lighting Design by John Clark is symbiotic.\n\nThe Shark is Broken. Through November 19 at the John Golden Theatre (252 West 45th Street, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue). www.thesharkisbroken.com\n\nJoanne & Bernie Furshpan\nJane H.
