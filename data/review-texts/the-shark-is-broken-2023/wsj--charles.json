But audiences attending the play are unlikely to pay for tickets without knowing what they are in for. The predator of the title is the most famous shark in history, the fictional creature nicknamed Bruce, who chomped on several unfortunate swimmers in the 1975 blockbuster “Jaws.”\n\nGolden Theatre, 252 W. 45th St., New York, $59-$195, 800-447-7400, closes Nov. 19\n\nThe play, written by Ian Shaw—who also portrays his father, the actor Robert Shaw—and Joseph Nixon, depicts the sometimes fractious, sometimes friendly and often funny interactions of the film’s stars, Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss (Alex Brightman) and Roy Scheider (Colin Donnell), during the copious amounts of downtime they had to kill, often because the biggest star on the set, that recalcitrant Bruce, was malfunctioning.\n\n“The Shark Is Broken” is not a play for the ages, or even for those who have never seen “Jaws,” but it’s a frisky and continuously amusing diversion—perfect late-summer entertainment if you want to stay away from the ocean. (In a bit of ghoulish timeliness, there have been an unusual number of shark sightings on Long Island this summer, including an attack on New York City’s Rockaway Beach this week.)\n\nSlender though it may be, at a crisp 95 minutes it holds one’s attention in no small part because the actors playing their more famous counterparts are so superb, giving performances that perfectly capture the personas, mannerisms and idiosyncrasies of Shaw, Dreyfuss and Scheider, at least as documented in various books and movies about the making of “Jaws.” Yet none of the actors is indulging in mere comic mimicry. All give fully rounded, nuanced performances that give the play a layer of verisimilitude in its more serious moments, as the movie actors—each at a different stage in his career—turn to self-examination and reveal their doubts and demons.\n\nCopyright ©2025 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
