  "fullText": "Anything that has to do with Steven Spielberg's award-winning 1975 film \"Jaws\" should be fun. After all, it's a movie about the sudden appearance of a freakishly large, man-eating shark in a quaint New England vacation spot on a packed Fourth of July weekend, and the trio of men — a weathered shark hunter, an aquaphobic smalltown cop, and a strangely upbeat young scientist from Queens — who set out on the high seas in a dilapidated fishing boat to kill it. It's one part \"Moby Dick,\" three parts campy disaster film.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "“This might have been a fascinating portrait of male ego and insecurity, with real insights into the workings of Hollywood in the 1970s...But written by the son of the late Robert Shaw, the piece feels like artless autobiography or maybe even a son’s revenge.”",
