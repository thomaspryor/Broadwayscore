    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt suggests the show is merely 'unusual' workplace comedy rather than ambitious drama, indicating lukewarm assessment. However, with only one curated quote available, the full verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'unusual' but not 'ambitious,' suggesting it may have some unique elements but lacks depth. The lack of ambition implies it may not fully satisfy, but the unique twist could appeal to some audiences. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the play as an 'unusual workplace dramedy' rather than a strong endorsement or condemnation, suggesting a mixed or neutral assessment. The lack of further context makes it difficult to determine a more precise score.",
