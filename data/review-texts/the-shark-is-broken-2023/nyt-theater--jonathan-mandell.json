  "fullText": "On their last day of shooting “Jaws,” its three stars sit around the table of a cramped fishing boat, shooting the breeze, as they had done for most of the 95 minutes of “The Shark Is Broken.” They argue about who should get top billing in the movie, then talk about what they might do next. Richard Dreyfuss (Alex Brightman) says: &#8220;Steven was telling me about this idea for a new movie he&#8217;s got&#8221; &#8212; about UFOs, where the aliens are the good guys.\n\n“Aliens! Jesus!” Robert Shaw (Ian Shaw) scoffs. “Whatever next? Dinosaurs?”\n\nThis gets a big laugh.  The joke depends, of course, on your knowledge of the career of “Steven” (Spielberg )– that “Jaws” would become a massive hit, that he would follow it two years later with “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” about UFOs (starring Richard Dreyfus) and sixteen years after that with “Jurassic Park” about dinosaurs – also both massive hits.\n\nI suppose if you knew nothing about Steven Spielberg or “Jaws” or the blockbuster’s three stars &#8212; Robert Shaw , Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss –  you might still be able to appreciate “The Shark Is Broken” as a kind of Beckett-light pop play about three characters who spend most of their time waiting for something to happen.\n\nBut it’s the reflected cinematic glory in this modest stage comedy that surely explains why, four years after its month-long run at the Edinburgh Fringe festival, it has opened tonight on Broadway. The production is not an embarrassment. All three actors give uncanny impersonations that sometimes shade into nuanced portraits. The design team does an impressive job with a subtly animated, ever-changing backdrop for the fishing boat of rolling sea and cloud-streaked sky.\n\nThe main question, though, is why: Why do a backstage comedy about “Jaws” almost half a century after its release?\n\nThe only obvious answer is that the show needed to wait until Robert Shaw’s son Ian got to be as old as his father was when he portrayed Quint, the irascible shark hunter in the film. Ian Shaw, one of Robert’s ten children, was six then; he’s now 53, making his Broadway debut as the play’s co-writer and co-star.\n\nRobert Shaw as Quint in Jaws; Ian Shaw as Robert Shaw in The Shark is Broken\n\nSpielberg has said that he didn’t direct the sequel to Jaws (never mind Jaws 3 or Jaws 4)  because he had “such a horrible time at sea on the first film.&#8221;\n\nIt’s those horrible conditions that drive the action – or, more precisely, the inaction – of “The Shark Is Broken.” The three actors are shown waiting to film their scenes while the unseen tech crew fix the mechanical shark, or the weather clears up, or there are no longer any boats on the water getting in the way of the shot. On rare occasion one of them rehearses their role, and there is one scene from the movie (a dramatic one) that’s performed in full. Most of the time, however, the three actors are finding ways to pass the time – drinking (that’s Shaw’s specialty) playing cards or tabletop games (again Shaw); arguing (Shaw and Dreyfus); reading the New York Times (Scheider),  especially about the serious jeopardy facing this nation’s constitutional form of government because of the actions of President Richard  Nixon (an inadvertent relevance that gets another big laugh); complaining (Dreyfuss.)  Richard admires Spielberg, just 28 years at the time, but also complains about him, especially his decision to film on the ocean, rather than using one of the movie studio’s water tanks:\n\nAlex Brightman stands out for his comic histrionics throughout the play, but this particular exchange feels to me like a gentile’s misunderstanding of Jewish humor, and it’s not the only thing about it that gives me pause. It is also one of the scenes in which the personas of the movie actors seem suspiciously close (i.e., identical) to the characters they are playing. Richard (like Hooper) is nebbishy and obnoxious, Robert (like Quint) a tough guy and a teaser, Roy (like Brody) steady, calm and intellectual, a peacemaker who mediates  the tensions between the other two.\n\nAt the same time, we also get tidbits of their actual biographies, some of it fascinating. We learn, for example, that Robert Shaw was an admired Shakespearean, a friend of Harold Pinter, and a playwright in his own right, who rewrote the most famous speech in “Jaws,” about Quint’s experience being attacked by sharks after the USS Indianapolis sank in the Philippine Seaduring World War II, Shaw was also an alcoholic, like his father, who killed himself when Robert was 12.\n\nIt&#8217;s hard to argue that Shaw or Scheider (who both died years ago) or Dreyfuss (now retired) hold the same popular allure as, say, Elvis or Marilyn or several other long-dead, still-worshipped celebrities. But it’s also useless to pretend that much of the appeal of “The Shark Is Broken” is any different from what draws us to a cheesy biopic. I half expected (and – honestly – half wanted) sentences projected onto the stage at the end explaining what happened to each of the three actors, like: Roy Scheider achieved pop cult status for his role in Jaws, and went on to star in Jaws2. He was nominated for his second Oscar (after the French Connection) for his role as Bob Fosse in All That Jazz in 1980. He died in 2008 at the age of 75.\n\nAt one point, the three actors offer differing views of what “Jaws” is about:\n\nI can’t picture anybody debating the meaning of “The Shark Is Broken”\n\nIt should be possible to do a stage play inspired by a movie that isn’t just capitalizing on the movie’s appeal, but forging something new.  It’s been done before. The play “Geniuses,” by Jonathan Reynolds, which ran to great acclaim at Playwrights Horizons, was a thinly disguised take on his experiences on the set of the movie “Apocalypse Now,” which was beset with even more problems than “Jaws.” Reynold’s play is a hilarious take-no-prisoners parody of moviemaking, but it also says something sharp about intelligent people corrupted by their vanity, ambition or greed into making bad choices, or looking the other way when others do.\n\n“Geniuses” ran Off-Broadway in the 1980s. Much has changed since then. I thought of the changes near the end of “The Shark Is Broken,” when shortly after Ian Shaw as Robert Shaw pooh-poohs movies about aliens and dinosaurs, he has a similar reaction to their speculation about whether “Jaws” will spawn a sequel: “Mark my words boys, one day there will only be sequels. Sequels and remakes, and sequels to remakes and remakes of sequels.”\n\nWhat would the elder Shaw have said, I wonder, about all the Broadway shows remade as movies, and Broadway shows made from movies, such as this one by his son?\n\nThe Shark Is BrokenJohn Golden Theater through November 19, 2023Running time: 95 minutes with no intermissionTickets: $59 &#8211; $195.

I wish I could say that this show might bring a small smile to my face, but the thought of it leaves a pain in my chest. Roy and Richard were on top of the work they did on their characters. And Mr.. Shaw muscled through his alcohol to drop us totally into his character&#8217;s world in such an intense performance. All were such accomplished actors, a joy to watch. There is not a bone in my body that supports a Jaws Junior on Broadway. Roy might well agree. Steven&#8217;s direction was the glue of the production. And the shark NOT working created the essence of the drama. The OCEAN gripped us with our deepest fears. Bringing it&#8217;s shark down was our thrill and relief. I say let it ALL rest in peace. Missing you Roy.\n\nBluesky\nMost Popular PostsAll Out Comedy About Ambition Broadway ReviewMasquerade Review: An Immersive Phantom even for non-PhansTwo Strangers (Carry A Cake Across New York) Broadway ReviewMarjorie Prime Broadway ReviewBroadway and the Blizzard 2026: Questions and AnswersData ReviewStereophonic ReviewUnder the Radar: Watch Me WalkBug Broadway ReviewMasquerade Mania\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tRecent Posts\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMasquerade Mania\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 28, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder the Radar: Watch Me Walk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 27, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBroadway at the Oscars, in the Snow, at BroadwayCon.
