Indeed, the on-set difficulties have become so entrenched in cultural lore that the title of this play needs no explanation or elaboration to reel in audiences.\n\nAnd even though the film cast’s personality clashes are nearly as legendary as the mechanical shark’s short circuits, the play’s authors and performers deliver such nicely detailed characterizations that The Shark Is Broken holds our interest throughout its 95 minutes. The play builds to its denouement – a flawless re-creation of the film’s indelible USS Indianapolis scene – with considerable story-telling skill. Shaw, as Shaw, drunkenly muffles the Indianapolis speech in an early-in-the-play rehearsal scene, and though everyone in the audience knows full well that he’ll pull it together in the end, the pacing by the actor and director Masterson manages against the odds to build some tension.\n\nFans of the film – who isn’t? – will be delighted with the attention to detail on this Broadway stage, right down to that famous shooting star accidentally captured by the late, great cinematographer Bill Butler. Much of the enjoyment, of course, comes from watching the play’s first-rate cast capture the film’s first-rate cast both physically and in spirit without ever slipping into caricature or mean-spirited parody.\n\nHelping immensely is Adam Cork's evocative soundscape, all watery and late-night mood. There’s a fleeting hint, but no more, of John Williams’ famous Jaws theme at the start of the play, and whatever rationale, legal or otherwise, that fed into the decision to go easy on the music is to be praised: Even as it is, the slightly rearranged musical notes set up an expectation that ultimately can’t be met.
