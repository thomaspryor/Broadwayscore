  "bwwExcerpt": "Eventually, we get to the last day of filming and the final farewells. Not surprisingly, Scheider proffers his hand to the other two: 'I gotta say, I feel kind of sad. It's been a pleasure, gentlemen.' And true to form, Shaw and Dreyfuss say goodbye by trading sarcastic barbs. I hate to carp, but while Jaws may be the ultimate fish story, The Shark Is Broken flounders to the end, with neither an engaging hook nor a line of compelling dialog to keep it afloat.",
