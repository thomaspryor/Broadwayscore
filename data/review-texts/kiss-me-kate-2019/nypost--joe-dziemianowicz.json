  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Whether she’s hitting high notes or swatting her male co-star, Kelli O’Hara — funny and fierce — is reason enough to see 'Kiss Me, Kate'...All’s well that ends well, thanks to Scott Ellis’ witty staging, which brims with visual gags and cheekiness...Warren Carlyle’s choreography is dynamite...The musical’s book has been tweaked, though not always for the better, to minimize misogyny...Gender-parity achieved, yes? No...But the stars make the most of it.\"\n\nRead more",
  "bwwExcerpt": "Gender-parity achieved, yes? No. As laudable as these efforts are, Lilli still performs against her will, thanks to a subplot about debt-collecting goons. And several songs are steeped in pervy references, including a \"Tom, Dick or Harry\" whose emphasis lies firmly on Dick.",
