  "showScoreExcerpt": "“A slightly-revised version of the iconic musical comedy...Performed with inexhaustible pizzazz by a dazzling cast...Delivering the comedy and heart of the narrative and wowing with their extraordinary talents...Roundabout’s smartly-tweaked presentation of ‘Kiss Me, Kate’ gives new life to an undeniable Broadway classic, while subtly reminding us of the progress women have made, since Shakespeare’s time and the 1940s. Win/win. Don’t miss it.”\n\nRead more",
