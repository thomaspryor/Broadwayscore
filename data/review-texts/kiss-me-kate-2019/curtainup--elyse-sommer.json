  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Terrifically performed and staged as this revival is, the kids are more than likely to now see that there is indeed something quite 'wunderbar' about this show...This two-tiered story is thrillingly fresh and new. Director Ellis downplays their bickering and focus on their musical reminiscences and thus give full rein to O'Hara's gorgeous soprano and ability to effortlessly scale some of Porter's trills...Highly recommended for 9 to 90-year-olds.\"\n\nRead more",
