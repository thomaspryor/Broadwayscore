  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Big, boisterous, brawling 'Kiss Me, Kate' is a revival to fall for...Thanks to some subtle tweaks and re-staging, it's the story that's getting tamed without losing any of its ferocious bite!...Director Ellis staged the classic with great care, respecting its historical roots while shifting the gender dynamic just enough to put the two leads on equal footing...O’Hara deserves...our eternal worship for gracing us with two and a half glorio hours in this altogether wunderbar production.\" \n\nRead more",
