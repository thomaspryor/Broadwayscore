Single excerpt with mixed signals warrants low confidence. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises some aspects like the choreography but also notes significant issues with other numbers and the overall staging. The text suggests a mixed experience, with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review praises the choreography and the authors' take on marriage, but also notes that many other numbers disappoint and the staging runs out of invention. This suggests a mixed overall experience.",
