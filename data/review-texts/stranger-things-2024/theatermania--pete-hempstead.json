And get ready for some stunning Act 2 surprises that'll leave your jaw on the floor.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.
