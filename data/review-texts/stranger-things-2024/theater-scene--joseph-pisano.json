    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt is vague and lacks a clear positive or negative recommendation. It suggests a mix of cultural references but does not provide a strong evaluative statement about the show's quality or appeal. | Gemini: The single excerpt is descriptive and doesn't clearly recommend or discourage seeing the show. It suggests a complex and potentially unsettling experience, placing it in the mixed category. | Kimi: Single excerpt is purely descriptive, characterizing the show as reference-heavy and influenced by dark Gen-X media, but lacks clear evaluative language or recommendation. The term 'stew' suggests a mixture that could be rich or muddled, warranting a middle-of-the-road mixed score with low confidence due to limited context.",
