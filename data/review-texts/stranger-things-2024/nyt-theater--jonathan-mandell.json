    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The phrase 'strictly for fans' indicates a qualified, limited recommendation while 'cacophony, convolution and confusion' suggests significant problems. This points to mixed reception with reservations. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, highlighting visual spectacle but also confusion and convolution. The phrase 'strictly for fans' implies a limited recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses phrases like \"strictly for fans\" and \"confusion,\" indicating a mixed or slightly negative sentiment. Given the limited excerpt, I've placed it in the mixed bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt indicates limited appeal ('strictly for fans') while criticizing the production as chaotic and confusing ('cacophony, convolution, confusion'), suggesting significant reservations. Single curated excerpt with truncated text warrants low confidence.",
