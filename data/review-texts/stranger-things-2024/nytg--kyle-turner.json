  "dtliExcerpt": "Stranger Things: The First Shadow is a lot of show. It is at once possession horror, family melodrama, high school dramedy, Cold War thriller, and haunted house nightmare, lurching from one tone to the next scene by scene. It is astonishing simply for its scale, and never boring, if seldom technically or dramatically satisfying.",
