  "fullText": "Oh, yes, special effects are a huge explanation for the Stranger Things series raison d’etre, and now the production’s Great White Way patrons have renowned stage craftspersons at their disposal. Credits go to lighting designer Jon Clark, sound designer Paul Arditti, illusions and visual effects designers Jamie Harrison and Chris Fisher, and video and visual effects designers 59. Again and sorry to say, these are abundant but not as overwhelming as expected.",
