  "fullText": "Herding all of it into a smashing piece of entertainment is director Daldry (The Inheritance, Billy Elliot: The Musical) and his co-director and frequent collaborator Justin Martin (Prima Facie), who funnel all the moving parts, colors, smoke, mirrors and monsters into a non-stop thrill ride. Sure, it’s more surface than substance, and its depictions of how we humans long for connection of any sort is sincere if not particularly original. But just try not to be tickled by even the simplest of the show’s trickery, like when a book fallen from a school locker flies right back in. At one point in the play, young, brainwashed Henry, under the villainous Brenner’s sway, can only surrender to the dark magic. I know the feeling.",

  "dtliExcerpt": "Louis McCartney in 'Stranger Things: The First Shadow' Manuel Harlan Broadway goes Upside Down with Stranger Things: The First Shadow , opening tonight at the Marquis Theatre and setting a new standard for what&#8217;s possible in high-tech spectacle on the legitimate stage. Director Stephen Daldry, playwright Kate Trefry and young star Louis McCartney , invaluably assisted by a top-rate crew of designers and special effects wizards, bring an exciting, bump-in-the-night creature feature to Broadway. Scary is a rarity for Broadway. There was the creepy Grey House a few seasons ago, and you might remember when King Kong lumbered around a stage a while back, but Stranger Things: The First Shadow easily outdoes them for jump scares and genuine thrills. Some of the magical derring-do is reminiscent of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (written by Jack Thorne, who, along with the Duffer Brothers and Trefry wrote the original story on which First Shadow is based). That massive battleship bow that crashes on stage, seemingly out of thin air, might put you in mind of Miss Saigon &#8216;s helicopter or The Phantom of the Opera &#8216;s crashing chandelier, but the visual enchantment of Stranger Things makes all those earlier productions seem downright cute. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article1-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid-article\",\"300x251\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[2,2],[300,250],[620,350],[300,251],[501,282],[3,3],[2,4],[4,2],[620,366]]) .exemptFromSleep() .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Related Stories Casting &#039;Just In Time&#039;: Jeremy Jordan To Succeed Jonathan Groff As Broadway&#039;s Bobby Darin",
