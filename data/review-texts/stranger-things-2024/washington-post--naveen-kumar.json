  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessReview by  Naveen KumarNEW YORK — If Netflix were in the theme park business, “Stranger Things: The First Shadow” would make a crown-jewel attraction.\n\nThe streamer’s Broadway behemoth, now in residence at the Marquis Theatre, is a chaotic fire hose of fan-service with enough sensory stimulation to make even the most experienced gamer want to puke just a little. Devotees of the byzantine fantasy series may even savor the confusion of trying to figure out, from one flash-bang moment to the next, what exactly is going on. And anyone who’s dreamed of snuggling a Demogorgon can drop by the merch counter for a horrifying plushie.",
  "isFullReview": false,
  "dtliExcerpt": "But the extravagantly staged brand extension is a Broadway play only in the technical sense — in address, price point and duration. To draw audiences through its nearly three hours, the show lurches forward like an episodic binge-watch, banking on and rewarding extensive familiarity with the sci-fi hit.",
