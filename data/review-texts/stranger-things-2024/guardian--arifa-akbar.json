  "fullText": "Phoenix theatre, LondonThis origin story has all the dark mystery of the Duffer Brothers’ Netflix series and delivers one coup de theatre after another It starts with those floating red letters and that electro-ethereal music. The intro creates the surreal effect of Netflix’s sci-fi juggernaut being brought to life as a stage-sized facsimile before our eyes. But the big surprise about this prequel to the TV series, about high-schoolers who tap into the dangerous world of the Upside Down, is that it is neither derivative nor an exercise in imitation. This is breathtaking theatre with its own arresting imagination. With an original story by the Duffer Brothers, Jack Thorne and Kate Trefry, we are still in Hawkins, Indiana, where pets are mysteriously dying, but it kicks off exactly four decades before the 1983 start of the first series. Writer Trefry takes a flashback from the fourth season and turns it into a typically complicated plot, although my 10-year-old companion (the guidance is for 12+) had no problem following it. The production has the same sense of sprawling mystery, beginning with the disappearance of a wartime naval ship and a laboratory experiment that explains the birth of the Upside Down. There is no Eleven yet but Henry Creel (Louis McCartney), the new kid in town, brings dark powers. He has an oddball romance with Patty (Ella Karuna Williams) and a sinister relationship with Dr Brenner (Patrick Vaill). There is speed, action and scale, with one coup de theatre after another and immense craft in Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin’s co-direction. A quotidian reality of high-school hallways and toilets morphs into eye-popping alternate worlds. These switches happen in seconds, the gothic returning to the ordinary on Miriam Buether’s nimble set. Jon Clark’s stunning lighting switches between sinister and sunny, while characters transform with it. There is a dazzling doubling to this, which adults might read as split selves while kids will merely find thrilling. It is truly dark too, with horror film jumps and menacing gurgles (great sound design by Paul Arditti), contrasted with a bright-eyed, retro Americana laid on thick and smatterings of song. Even if you can’t keep up with the plot, it is underpinned by serious inquiries into the psychopathy of war, toxic inheritance, and the search for good parents and release from bad ones. It also touches on othering and adolescent anxieties about being “normal”. The show has fine, fleet acting too. Joyce Maldonado (Isabella Pappas) has not yet made her mistakes with Lonnie (Chase Brown) and is full of fire. The swaggering James Hopper Jr (Oscar Lloyd), who will later become the town’s police chief like his father, gets embroiled in the central investigation with Joyce and Bob Newby (Christopher Buckley). Those familiar with the series will be able to trace storylines back but the production is not just a clever parlour game for fans. If you come at it afresh, it is still irresistible. A spurt of lazy film-to-stage adaptations have recently hit the West End but this parallel world is a winner. At Phoenix theatre, London, until 25 August We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could support the Guardian at this crucial time for journalism in the US. In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year into his second term, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one. From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump returned to office. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced. While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts. While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel. Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less. But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, we’ll show you far fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you for protecting the free press. This has gone from off my radar to essential viewing in just a couple of reviews.
