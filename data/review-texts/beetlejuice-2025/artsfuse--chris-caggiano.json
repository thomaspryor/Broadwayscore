  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Although 'Beetlejuice' the musical may improve some on the movie, it’s not high quality musical theater. There’s way too much business — via Alex Timbers’s by-the-numbers direction and Connor Gallagher’s pedestrian choreography — and not enough heart...A game cast of Broadway stalwarts struggles to make an impression amid the antic busyness. For some, Brightman’s energetic turn may be enough reason to see the show...It is occasionally humorous and rarely dull.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review acknowledges some improvements and occasional humor but clearly states it's 'not high quality musical theater' with 'too much business' and 'not enough heart.' Single excerpt warning applied - avoiding mid-range default. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some positive aspects, such as occasional humor and Brightman's performance, but criticizes the direction and choreography as lacking heart. The overall tone is mixed, with some redeeming qualities but significant reservations. | Gemini: The review is mixed, noting flaws in direction and choreography but also acknowledging some humor and a strong performance by Brightman. The overall impression is neither strongly positive nor negative. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the direction as 'by-the-numbers' and choreography as 'pedestrian,' noting the cast struggles to make an impression amid 'antic busyness.' While acknowledging occasional humor and one energetic performance, the overarching verdict labels it 'not high quality musical theater.'",
