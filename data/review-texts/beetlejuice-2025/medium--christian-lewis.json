  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The production as a whole perfectly captures the essence, comedy, and aesthetic of the original...The largest issues of the musical are its music / lyrics and the plotting of the book, which does not make much sense...The other problem...is the translation of Beetlejuice’s crude humor to 2019 and to a Broadway stage...Overall, the bland score and imperfect lyrics do not justify making ‘Beetlejuice’ into a musical...But ‘Beetlejuice’ is undeniably a fun, spooky time.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows significant structural criticism (bland score, plotting issues, translation problems) but ends with calling it 'undeniably a fun, spooky time.' Mixed signals with no clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges significant issues with the music, lyrics, and book, but also notes that the production captures the original's essence and is fun. This suggests a mixed verdict with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review praises the production's capture of the original's essence but criticizes the music, lyrics, and plot. It concludes that the score doesn't justify the musical adaptation, but acknowledges it's a fun time. | Kimi: The excerpt offers significant criticism of the score, lyrics, and book ('do not justify making it into a musical'), but ultimately concedes the production is 'undeniably a fun, spooky time.' With only one curated excerpt available, this balance of fundamental artistic criticism against entertainment value places it in the Mixed range.",
