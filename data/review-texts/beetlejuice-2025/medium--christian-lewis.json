  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The production as a whole perfectly captures the essence, comedy, and aesthetic of the original...The largest issues of the musical are its music / lyrics and the plotting of the book, which does not make much sense...The other problem...is the translation of Beetlejuice’s crude humor to 2019 and to a Broadway stage...Overall, the bland score and imperfect lyrics do not justify making ‘Beetlejuice’ into a musical...But ‘Beetlejuice’ is undeniably a fun, spooky time.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Mixed signals with significant criticism of the music and book but acknowledges it's 'undeniably a fun, spooky time.' Single excerpt warning applies - limited text availability reduces confidence. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges significant issues with the music, lyrics, and book, but also notes that the production captures the essence of the original and is fun. The mixed elements and lack of a full review lead to a low confidence score in the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review praises the production's capture of the original's essence but criticizes the music, lyrics, and plotting. The final verdict is mixed, acknowledging fun despite flaws. | Kimi: While the critic harshly criticizes the bland score, imperfect lyrics, and plotting issues, the final verdict finds the production undeniably fun, resulting in a qualified, barely-positive recommendation.",
