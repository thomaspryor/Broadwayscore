  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The production as a whole perfectly captures the essence, comedy, and aesthetic of the original...The largest issues of the musical are its music / lyrics and the plotting of the book, which does not make much sense...The other problem...is the translation of Beetlejuice’s crude humor to 2019 and to a Broadway stage...Overall, the bland score and imperfect lyrics do not justify making ‘Beetlejuice’ into a musical...But ‘Beetlejuice’ is undeniably a fun, spooky time.”\n\nRead more",
