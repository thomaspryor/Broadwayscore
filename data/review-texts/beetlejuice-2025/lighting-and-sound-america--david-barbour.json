Calls it crassly unfunny with unmemorable characters, concluding it provides 'scant amusement.' | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for being loud and crass without substance, failing to engage the audience with its characters. The tone suggests a strong negative impression, fitting the Pan bucket. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"crassness for real humor\" and \"grating\" to describe the show, ultimately stating that it provides \"scant amusement.\" | Kimi: The excerpt condemns the production as emotionally hollow, crass, and grating despite its spectacle, comparing it to a fun house with nothing shoring it up and providing only scant amusement.",
