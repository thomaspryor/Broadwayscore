  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"One irreverent, funny roller-coaster ride to hell and back. It has bloodcurdlingly, witty dialogue. And a bunch of over-the-top characters. A man down the aisle from me laughed so hard he nearly lost one of his heads...The hidden star in this show, however, is Scott Brown and Anthony King’s book. It is cleverly written and constantly surprising, and very, very funny. This is one show where some people will bust a gut; others may laugh their asses off.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language throughout: 'irreverent, funny roller-coaster ride,' 'cleverly written and constantly surprising,' and 'very, very funny.' However, this is only one curated excerpt which may not represent the full review verdict, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the show's humor and writing, describing it as an 'irreverent, funny roller-coaster ride' with 'witty dialogue'. Despite the limited text, the enthusiastic tone suggests a highly positive review. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, describing the show as an \"irreverent, funny roller-coaster ride\" with \"bloodcurdlingly, witty dialogue.\" The critic praises the book and anticipates strong audience reactions. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the show's humor, dialogue, and book, describing it as 'very, very funny' and a 'roller-coaster ride,' though as a single curated quote from a truncated review, the full critical context remains uncertain.",
