  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"One irreverent, funny roller-coaster ride to hell and back. It has bloodcurdlingly, witty dialogue. And a bunch of over-the-top characters. A man down the aisle from me laughed so hard he nearly lost one of his heads...The hidden star in this show, however, is Scott Brown and Anthony King’s book. It is cleverly written and constantly surprising, and very, very funny. This is one show where some people will bust a gut; others may laugh their asses off.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language throughout with enthusiastic praise for the book and humor, describing audience members laughing so hard they 'nearly lost one of his heads' and promising some will 'bust a gut' - clear recommendation despite being a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the show's humor and writing, describing it as a 'roller-coaster ride' and 'very, very funny.' The enthusiastic tone suggests a highly positive recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, describing the show as a \"funny roller-coaster ride\" with \"bloodcurdlingly, witty dialogue.\" Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt demonstrates strong enthusiasm with praise for the book as 'cleverly written and constantly surprising' and promises big laughs, but confidence is low due to limited excerpt context.",
