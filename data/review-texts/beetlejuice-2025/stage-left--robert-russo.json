  "showScoreExcerpt": "“’Beetlejuice’ is a ghoulishly good time that pays loving homage to the mythology of the movie while fundamentally reorienting the story and lending it an unexpected punch of pathos amid its crass and crude mania. Gorgeously designed with a Tim Burton aesthetic, and featuring a relentless series of bawdy jokes and entertaining songs, this hyperactive musical comedy might not meet the elevated aesthetic standards of some, but I had a blast.”\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning suggests upper end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'ghoulishly good time' and praises its design and entertainment value, indicating a strong positive recommendation despite acknowledging it may not meet all aesthetic standards. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, calling the show a \"ghoulishly good time\" and praising its design, jokes, and songs. While acknowledging it might not meet everyone's aesthetic standards, the critic clearly states they \"had a blast.\" | Kimi: The critic enthusiastically praises the show's design, humor, and songs with phrases like 'ghoulishly good time' and the direct verdict 'I had a blast,' though the caveat about 'elevated aesthetic standards' keeps it from being an unqualified rave.",
