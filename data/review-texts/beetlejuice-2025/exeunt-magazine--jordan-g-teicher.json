  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Madcap spectacle, a killer set, and some fine performances dominate this movie-to-musical product of the Broadway-industrial complex...The sort of high-octane thrills you might you might find at a high-end amusement park...’Beetlejuice’ isn’t at its best when it’s trying to tug at the heartstrings. The story is most effective when it’s satirizing America’s out-of-touch bourgeois, and this cast is up to the task.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Mixed praise for spectacle and performances but dismissive language like 'product of the Broadway-industrial complex' suggests qualified recommendation. Single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights positive aspects like spectacle, set, and performances, but notes limitations in emotional depth. The overall tone suggests a recommendation with some reservations, fitting the lower end of the Positive range due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights positive aspects like the spectacle, set, and performances, but also notes the show's weaknesses when trying to be sentimental. Given the limited text, a score in the positive range with medium confidence seems appropriate. | Kimi: Single excerpt demonstrates clear enthusiasm for the production's visual elements and cast, praising the show's satirical effectiveness despite acknowledging its commercial nature and minor emotional shortcomings.",
