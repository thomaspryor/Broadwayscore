  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Madcap spectacle, a killer set, and some fine performances dominate this movie-to-musical product of the Broadway-industrial complex...The sort of high-octane thrills you might you might find at a high-end amusement park...’Beetlejuice’ isn’t at its best when it’s trying to tug at the heartstrings. The story is most effective when it’s satirizing America’s out-of-touch bourgeois, and this cast is up to the task.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises spectacle, set design, and performances while acknowledging it's formulaic. Compares to 'high-end amusement park' suggesting quality entertainment despite being derivative. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the spectacle, set, and performances, indicating a positive tone. However, it notes the show is less effective when aiming for emotional depth, suggesting some reservations. Given the single excerpt and potential cherry-picking, a lower positive score is appropriate. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights positive aspects like spectacle, set, and performances, but also implies a formulaic nature ('Broadway-industrial complex') and notes limitations in emotional depth. Given the single excerpt and positive elements, a score in the positive range is appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production values ('killer set,' 'high-octane thrills') and cast while noting the material works better as satire than emotional drama, indicating a solid recommendation despite reservations about the book's sentimental moments.",
