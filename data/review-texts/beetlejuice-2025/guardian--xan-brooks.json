    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt shows qualified praise ('likable exercise') but significant criticism ('underpowered and throwaway', 'craves fresh blood'). However, this is a single curated excerpt that appears cut off mid-sentence, making the full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'underpowered and throwaway' but also 'likable' and a 'joyride'. This suggests a mixed verdict with some positive elements but lacking strong enthusiasm. | Gemini: The review calls it \"underpowered and throwaway\" but also a \"likable exercise in nostalgia.\" This suggests a mixed reaction, leaning slightly positive due to the \"likable\" descriptor, but the lack of a clear recommendation and the truncated text make it difficult to score with high confidence.",
