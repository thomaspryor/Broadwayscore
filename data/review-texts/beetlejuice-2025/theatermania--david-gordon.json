Instead, book writers Scott Brown and Anthony King and composer Eddie Perfect have created a show that's at odds with its own existence...While Timbers and the design team have done a masterful job building the world of this cult classic for a new medium, the writers haven't cracked it even slightly.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning noted but tone is consistently negative about the overall show. | GPT-4o: The review praises the design but criticizes the book and music, describing the show as 'disappointing' and 'at odds with its own existence'. The excerpt suggests a negative overall verdict. | Gemini: The review praises the design but ultimately finds the musical disappointing due to the writing. The overall sentiment leans negative despite the positive aspects of the design. | Kimi: While praising the design as 'most exciting of the season' and the direction as 'masterful,' the critic explicitly calls the show 'disappointing' and says the writers 'haven't cracked it even slightly,' indicating the book and score fail to match the visual creativity.",
