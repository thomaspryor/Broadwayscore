It is a wacky, witty, raunchy, sometimes messy, sometimes complete sensory overflow but is that not also a perfect definition of the titular character audience members recall from the movie?\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear enthusiasm with repeated 'fun' and exclamation points, praise for production values being 'to die for', and frames even the 'messy' aspects as perfectly fitting the character. Single excerpt warning suggests this represents the overall positive sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as an immersive and entertaining experience with standout production elements. The enthusiastic tone and repeated emphasis on 'fun' suggest a strong positive recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, describing the show as fun and praising the sets, lights, and special effects. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it high in the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt expresses enthusiastic praise for the technical elements ('to die for') and frames the show as extremely fun and perfectly matched to the source material's spirit, despite acknowledging some messiness.",
