The puppetry is spectacular...'Beetlejuice' is a LOL ride and must-see, especially if you saw the film a number of times and appreciate its wit and originality.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Explicit 'must-see' recommendation with enthusiastic praise ('glorious iteration', 'spectacular puppetry', 'a lot to be thrilled about'). However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning and conditional phrasing for Burton fans. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'must-see' and praises its wit, originality, and spectacular puppetry, indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review explicitly states \"must-see\" and describes the show as a \"LOL ride,\" indicating a strong positive recommendation. The reference to Tim Burton fans suggests a specific audience, but the overall tone is enthusiastic. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('glorious,' 'spectacular') and explicitly calls the show a 'must-see,' indicating a strong recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is low, but the language warrants the upper end of the Positive range. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
