Unfortunately, the $21 million spectacle suffers an artistic heart attack from over-exertion...Besides its film fans, it’s unclear for whom 'Beetlejuice' is intended...More disconcerting is its dated and offensive stereotyping of same-sex attraction.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative language throughout: 'garishly pandering,' 'suffers an artistic heart attack,' questions the target audience, and criticizes offensive content. Despite some acknowledgment of humor, the overall assessment is dismissive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'garishly pandering' and 'suffers an artistic heart attack,' indicating a negative view. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so a low confidence is assigned. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"garishly pandering,\" \"offensive stereotyping,\" and \"artistic heart attack.\" While the pace is described as befitting a theme park show, the overall tone is critical, suggesting a negative experience. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as 'garishly pandering' suffering an 'artistic heart attack,' criticizing its offensive stereotyping and unclear intended audience, despite acknowledging some laugh-out-loud humor.",
