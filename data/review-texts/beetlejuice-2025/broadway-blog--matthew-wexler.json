  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"This garishly pandering endeavor to the afterlife...The loose plot, executed with varying degrees of humor ranging from laugh-out-loud to offensive, keeps things moving at a pace befitting a Universal Studios theme park show. Unfortunately, the $21 million spectacle suffers an artistic heart attack from over-exertion...Besides its film fans, it’s unclear for whom 'Beetlejuice' is intended...More disconcerting is its dated and offensive stereotyping of same-sex attraction.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic calls it 'garishly pandering,' criticizes the humor as ranging to 'offensive,' and finds the stereotyping 'disconcerting.' Despite acknowledging some laughs and spectacle, the overall assessment is clearly negative with serious concerns about content. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt criticizes the show for being 'garishly pandering' and suffering from 'over-exertion,' with humor that ranges from 'laugh-out-loud to offensive.' The negative tone suggests a recommendation against seeing the show, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"garishly pandering,\" \"offensive stereotyping,\" and \"artistic heart attack,\" indicating a negative overall assessment despite some humor. | Kimi: Single excerpt presents devastating critique calling the show pandering, suffering an 'artistic heart attack,' and featuring offensive stereotyping with only faint praise for some humor.",
