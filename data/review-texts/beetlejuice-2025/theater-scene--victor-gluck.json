And the score by Australian composer/performer Eddie Perfect (whose only other American score has been 'King Kong the Musical') is eminently forgettable. In the title role, Alex Brightman, who was charismatic in a similar role in 'The School of Rock,' is so over-the top that he becomes tiresome very quickly.\"\n\nRead more",

Despite acknowledging visual spectacle, the overall assessment is clearly negative. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for being visually impressive but lacking memorable music and having an over-the-top lead performance. The tone suggests a negative view, though the excerpt may not capture the full review sentiment. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as a \"theme park-type show\" with a forgettable score and a tiresome lead performance, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous criticism: the score is 'eminently forgettable,' the lead performance 'tiresome,' and the visual spectacle dismissed as insufficient compensation ('you can't go home singing the scenery'). Despite the single-excerpt limitation, the consistently negative evaluative language places this firmly in the Negative bucket.",
