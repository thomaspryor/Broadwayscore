  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"This theme park-type show is visually a spectacle with a set that does all sort of tricks and changes, but as the adage goes, you can't go home singing the scenery. And the score by Australian composer/performer Eddie Perfect (whose only other American score has been 'King Kong the Musical') is eminently forgettable. In the title role, Alex Brightman, who was charismatic in a similar role in 'The School of Rock,' is so over-the top that he becomes tiresome very quickly.\"\n\nRead more",

The single excerpt suggests a negative overall impression, but the lack of full context reduces confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt is negative, criticizing the score, set, and lead performance. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the content points to a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the visual spectacle as insufficient, calls the score 'eminently forgettable,' and finds the lead performance 'tiresome very quickly.' Despite acknowledging the production's visual tricks, the overall assessment rejects the show's core elements.",
