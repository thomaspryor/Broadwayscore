It’s still pretty tasteless, lewd and inappropriate too—just acceptably so...Kritzer’s performance is one of the comic cherries-on-top of the Broadway season...Yes, the show is an extremely long two and a half plus hours, yes it feels off-balance in places, but it is also shameless, big, bold, fun and brassy. This is the miss that may well become a hit.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite acknowledging length and balance issues, the critic calls it a 'winning hoot' that's 'shameless, big, bold, fun and brassy' and predicts it will become a hit. The positive language outweighs the caveats. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt describes the show as 'winning', 'fun', and 'brassy', indicating a positive recommendation despite noting some issues with length and balance. The single excerpt warning suggests using the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: Despite some reservations about length and balance, the review uses strong positive language like \"winning hoot\", \"comic cherries-on-top\", and \"shameless, big, bold, fun and brassy.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring at the higher end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers enthusiastic praise ('winning hoot,' 'cherries-on-top,' 'may well become a hit') that outweighs noted flaws about length and tone, indicating a strong positive recommendation despite the single-excerpt limitation.",
