It’s still pretty tasteless, lewd and inappropriate too—just acceptably so...Kritzer’s performance is one of the comic cherries-on-top of the Broadway season...Yes, the show is an extremely long two and a half plus hours, yes it feels off-balance in places, but it is also shameless, big, bold, fun and brassy. This is the miss that may well become a hit.\" \n\nRead more",

Despite noting some flaws, the overall tone is positive and enthusiastic, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: Despite some reservations about length and balance, the review uses positive language like \"winning hoot\", \"fun and brassy\", and highlights a strong performance. The overall tone suggests a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers enthusiastic praise ('winning hoot', 'cherries-on-top', 'fun and brassy') and a clear recommendation ('may well become a hit'), despite noting significant flaws including length and tonal imbalance. Single-excerpt limitation requires reduced confidence.",
