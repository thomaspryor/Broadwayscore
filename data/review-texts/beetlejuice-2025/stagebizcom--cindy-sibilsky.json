Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses extremely positive language such as \"fantastic stage adaptation\", \"crowd-pleasing wonder\", and \"most devilishly delightful and debaucherously entertaining event on Broadway\", indicating a rave review. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains ecstatic superlatives ('fantastic,' 'wonder,' 'superior to the film') and declares it the most entertaining event on Broadway, indicating a rave recommendation. Score reflects the enthusiastic tone while acknowledging the limitation of a single potentially cherry-picked excerpt.",
