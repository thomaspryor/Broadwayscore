    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('wildly entertaining', 'over-joyed', 'surprising and knocking us down with its wit') with praise for lead performance and overall execution. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this may be cherry-picked positivity. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the show, highlighting its entertainment value and the performance of Alex Brightman. The tone is enthusiastic, suggesting a solid recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning lowers confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language such as \"wildly entertaining\", \"surprised, tickled, and over-joyed with ghoulish glee\", and \"darkly fun play\". Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt demonstrates strong enthusiasm with phrases like 'wildly entertaining' and 'over-joyed with ghoulish glee,' praising the lead performance and effective staging. Scored at upper end of Positive bucket per single-excerpt guidance, though confidence is reduced due to potential cherry-picking.",
