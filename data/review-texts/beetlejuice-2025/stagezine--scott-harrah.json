  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The musical is a theme park unto itself and a fun, offbeat roller-coaster ride from start to finish. It stands out as a superior adaptation for so many reasons, but mostly due to Brown and King’s clever book and outrageously effervescent performances by Brightman, Kritzer and Caruso, plus whimsical sets by Korins and over-the-top costumes by William Ivey Long...Director Alex Timbers holds everything together beautifully and gets noteworthy performances from the rest of the cast.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise throughout with words like 'superior adaptation,' 'outrageously effervescent performances,' and 'holds everything together beautifully.' However, single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the adaptation, performances, and production elements, suggesting a highly positive experience. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt contains very positive language such as \"fun, offbeat roller-coaster ride\", \"superior adaptation\", and \"outrageously effervescent performances\". Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the language points to a strong positive review. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the adaptation, performances, and direction, describing the show as a 'superior adaptation' with 'outrageously effervescent performances,' warranting an upper-range Positive score despite the single-excerpt limitation.",
