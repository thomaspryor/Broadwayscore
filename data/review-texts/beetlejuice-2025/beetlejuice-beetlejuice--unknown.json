Single excerpt with qualified praise suggests lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates that while the humor is simplistic, it is effective, suggesting a mild recommendation. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that despite the low-brow humor, the show is effective. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as a lower-end positive review. | Kimi: While the critic describes the humor as simplistic ('kindergarten-style'), the verdict 'the effect works' constitutes a recommendation, albeit a qualified one.",
