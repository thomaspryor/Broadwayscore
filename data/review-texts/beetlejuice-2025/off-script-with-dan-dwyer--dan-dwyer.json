The bloated production with a ludicrously convoluted book and unmemorable score seems inexhaustibly entertaining only to itself...The set design...will hold your attention when story and song fail to do so...Curry has designed a huge puppet snake that breaks the tedium. The inconsequence of it all is so relentless.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative language ('obliterated', 'bloated', 'ludicrously convoluted', 'unmemorable') with only minor praise for set design. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the consistent negativity suggests firm rejection. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt is strongly negative, criticizing the production as 'bloated' with a 'ludicrously convoluted book' and 'unmemorable score'. The positive mention of set design and a puppet snake does not redeem the overall negative tone. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, but the language indicates a pan. | Gemini: The review excerpt is largely negative, describing the production as bloated, convoluted, and unmemorable. While the set design and a puppet snake are mentioned positively, the overall tone suggests a negative experience. | Kimi: The critic finds the stage adaptation 'obliterates' the charm of the source material, with only the set design and puppet offering brief relief from a tedious, convoluted production.",
