    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Pan) - using median score | Claude: The critic dismisses the score as a 'simulacrum' and finds the show repetitive with 'disgust and disdain.' However, this is only one excerpt, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as bombarding and repetitive, with a score that simulates drama rather than delivering it. The tone is strongly negative, focusing on the show's shortcomings. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as a \"repetitive refrain of disgust and disdain,\" and the music as a \"simulacrum.\" This indicates a negative assessment, despite the lack of a full review. | Kimi: The critic condemns the score as a 'simulacrum' of Broadway music and describes the overall experience as a 'repetitive refrain of disgust and disdain,' indicating a strong negative verdict against the production. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Pan",
