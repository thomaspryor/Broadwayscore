Single excerpt warning noted - this sounds clearly positive so scored in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is highly positive, describing the show as 'very enjoyable' and 'constructed-to-please-the-crowds', with a 'showbizzy good time'. The tone is enthusiastic, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"very enjoyable\", \"slick\", \"tuneful\", and \"showbizzy good time\", indicating a positive recommendation. The single excerpt available suggests a strong positive leaning.",
