  "bwwExcerpt": "\"The zippy pacing, buoyant energy and steady stream of laugh-out-loud moments hint at the joy Burton appears to have found in revisiting this world, and for anyone who loved the first movie, it’s contagious. That applies also to the actors, all of whom warm to the dizzying lunacy.\"",

Clearly recommends for target audience despite reservations. | GPT-4o: The review praises the show's design, performances, and fun, indicating a positive reception. However, it notes the writers' struggle with the narrative, suggesting some reservations. The curated excerpts and lack of a full text reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, highlighting the show's design, performances, and fun. However, it also mentions that the writers struggle to control the narrative, suggesting some reservations. Given the excerpted nature and focus on fan experience, a score in the positive range is appropriate. | Kimi: While noting narrative weaknesses, the critic praises the visual design, lead performance, and fun factor, recommending the show as a unique experience for lovers of the movie.",
