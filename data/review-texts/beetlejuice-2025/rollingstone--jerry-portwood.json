    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the lyrics as 'wild and witty' and identifies strong moments in Act 2, but acknowledges the show as an 'odd mixture.' Single excerpt warning applied - this appears mildly positive but incomplete. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the musical as 'joyful' and highlights 'wild and witty lyrics', suggesting a positive tone. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low and the score is set at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive experience with witty lyrics and black humor, but it's difficult to gauge the overall recommendation strength due to the limited text. I'm placing it in the positive bucket with a score of 75 due to the limited context. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the musical's joyful tone, Perfect's 'wild and witty' lyrics, and second-act highlights, indicating a solid recommendation despite the limited text available.",
