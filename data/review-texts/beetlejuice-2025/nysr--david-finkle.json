    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed signals: praises lead performer and acknowledges smart script adjustments, but describes show as 'hodge-podge' with uneven quality. Director comment is backhanded ('sometimes overrated'). Low confidence due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'hodge-podge' with mixed elements, suggesting an uneven experience. The praise for Brightman is countered by the mixed assessment of the production overall. | Gemini: The review notes both amusing and not so amusing moments, suggesting a mixed experience. The truncated nature and single excerpt reduce confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises Brightman's performance and the adjusted script but criticizes the show as a structurally messy 'hodge-podge' with inconsistent amusement levels, indicating a mixed assessment rather than a clear recommendation.",
