  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The story goes a bit flat, and is harder to follow than the film, Brown and King have fun with the dialog...Aside from Brightman and Kritzer, none of the performances really jump, mostly because the otherwise talented actors bring very little life or dimension to their characters. But the show succeeds...’Beetlejuice’ is a Broadway crowd pleaser that does what it sets out to do: provide a visually pleasing reminder of an old favorite. To look any deeper would be a mistake.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite noting story and performance issues, the critic concludes 'the show succeeds' and calls it a 'crowd pleaser.' The positive verdict overrides the setup criticisms. Single excerpt warning and mixed elements justify lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some shortcomings in the story and performances but ultimately describes the show as a 'crowd pleaser' that succeeds in its goal, indicating a mild recommendation. | Gemini: The review states the show \"succeeds\" and is a \"crowd pleaser,\" but also mentions a flat story and lackluster performances (besides two leads). Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Despite substantial criticism of the flat story and lackluster performances, the critic concludes the show succeeds as entertainment. Given this is a single curated excerpt with significant negative caveats, it represents a mildly positive, qualified recommendation.",
