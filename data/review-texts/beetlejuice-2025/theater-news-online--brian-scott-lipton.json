Those objectives give the show whatever heart it possesses, and it might beat more steadily if Timbers and company let the show come to a simmer now and then, rather than keep it at a constant boil.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise (show has 'heart') but significant criticism of pacing issues ('constant boil' rather than letting it 'simmer'). The conditional phrasing and structural criticism suggests mixed feelings rather than clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests some positive elements ('whatever heart it possesses') but criticizes the pacing ('constant boil'). The lack of a clear recommendation and the single excerpt warning lead to a mixed score with low confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the show has some redeeming qualities ('whatever heart it possesses') but also points out a flaw in its pacing ('constant boil'). This indicates a mixed opinion. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges the show has emotional objectives but criticizes the director's frenetic 'constant boil' pacing for preventing the heart from beating steadily. Single excerpt limits confidence.",
