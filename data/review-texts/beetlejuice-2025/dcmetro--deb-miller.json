Director Alex Timbers sets a lively pace, and a killer cast embraces the quirky characters, offbeat jokes, madcap songs, and zany choreography with full-blown vibrancy.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning requires caution, but tone is clearly enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive assessment of the show's energy, direction, and cast performance. The use of terms like 'ebullient edgy theatrical re-imagining' and 'full-blown vibrancy' suggests strong enthusiasm. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt limitation. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language such as \"ebullient edgy theatrical re-imagining\", \"lively pace\", and \"killer cast\", suggesting a strong positive review. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic employs enthusiastic descriptors like 'ebullient,' 'killer cast,' and 'full-blown vibrancy' to praise the direction, performances, and musical re-imagining, indicating a strong recommendation despite the single-excerpt limitation.",
