  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Whatever else it may or may not be, 'Beetlejuice' is spectacularly weird...there are magic tricks and giant worms and a starkly linear idea of the afterlife that contrasts well with the chaotic world of the living. If only so much of the rest of 'Beetlejuice' were not a busy mess...It looks great, and there are strong performances and some outré laughs, but none of it quite fits together; the tone varies wildly, and skids around on Eddie Perfect’s slipshod score.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic praises specific elements (performances, visuals, laughs) but finds the overall show a 'busy mess' that 'doesn't quite fit together.' This is classic mixed territory - acknowledging positives while noting significant structural problems. | GPT-4o: The review highlights both positive aspects (visuals, performances) and significant issues (disjointed tone, slipshod score). The lack of coherence and mixed tone suggest a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like visuals, performances, and humor, but criticizes the overall coherence and the score, resulting in a mixed assessment. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic praises the visual design, performances, and humor but finds the show structurally messy with a slipshod score and wildly varying tone, resulting in a balanced but unenthusiastic assessment.",
