Those moments are relatively few and when they occur, the eclectic musical score, the visual humor, and the cast's hijinks soon reassert themselves, distracting us once again from our disbelief.\"\n\nRead more",

Acknowledges flaws (monotonous moments, story issues) but indicates they are 'relatively few' and quickly overcome by the production's strengths. Single excerpt warning suggests caution, but the balance clearly favors recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review praises the direction and ensemble, noting the show's exuberance and entertainment value. While it mentions some monotony and story issues, these are described as relatively few and overshadowed by the show's strengths. | Gemini: The review praises the direction and ensemble, but notes moments of monotony and plot issues. The overall tone suggests a positive recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The critic praises the resourceful direction and sublime ensemble, acknowledging occasional monotony but emphasizing that these moments are few and the production's exuberance and humor quickly reassert themselves.",
