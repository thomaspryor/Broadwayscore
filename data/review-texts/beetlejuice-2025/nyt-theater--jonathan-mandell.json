They can also be puerile and profane...Yet, one aspect of 'Beetlejuice' does stand out — its design.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt presents qualified praise with significant caveats - 'if you can tolerate' suggests reservation, songs are 'serviceable' at best, but acknowledges 'pleasures' and standout design. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some pleasures in the show, particularly in performances and visuals, but also notes issues with the songs and overall tone. The excerpt suggests a mixed reception with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges both positive and negative aspects, such as standout performances and vivid visuals alongside sappy scenes and serviceable songs. The overall tone suggests a mixed experience. | Kimi: The critic offers a qualified recommendation, praising the standout design and performances while criticizing the songs as merely 'serviceable' and the tone as uneven. The 'low' confidence reflects the limitation of scoring from a single excerpt.",
