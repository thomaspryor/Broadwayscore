The 'but' construction suggests the production limitations outweigh the performance strengths. Low confidence due to very brief excerpt. | GPT-4o: The review praises the performances of the lead actors but suggests that the production itself falls short of expectations for a full-scale tragedy, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review praises the actors but criticizes the production, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic offers genuine praise for the lead performances ('psychological depth') but criticizes the production's scale and approach, resulting in a balanced assessment that neither clearly recommends nor discourages attendance.",
