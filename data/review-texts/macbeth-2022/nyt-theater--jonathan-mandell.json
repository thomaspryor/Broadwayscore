  "bwwExcerpt": "I wish I didn't have the nagging feeling that the director was less interested in these actors than in his special touches. These include a particular attention to gore (an amputated leg chopped up as part of the witches' brew elicited an audible blecchh from the audience.) This seems ironic, because this 'Macbeth' struck me as a bit bloodless.",
