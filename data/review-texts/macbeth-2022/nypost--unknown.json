  "bwwExcerpt": "Craig, a fine actor in the past, is a victim of all the directing detritus. Gold seems to have told 007 and company to act detached and indifferent in this oh-so-violent and propulsive of works. Kings and murderers sound like Iowans discussing soybeans. When the witches tell Mackers that he'll be promoted to Thane of Cawdor and then King of Scotland? Meh. 'Is this a dagger which I see before me?' Yawn. During 'Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow,' Craig channels Hank Hill and cracks open a Bud Lite.",
