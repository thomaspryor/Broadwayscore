  "bwwExcerpt": "Almost tenderly, then, the production drifting around Craig touches him only lightly. It's an unusually bare staging for Broadway, stuffed with ideas but stripped clean of folderol. For the majority of the company, director Sam Gold has settled on a kind of still-in-rehearsal vibe, with big events whirling up out of an empty theater lit dimly by ghost light. Who is a witch and who is a laird in any single moment seems fluid - appropriately for a cast hamstrung repeatedly by COVID setbacks, anyone might play anyone. In contrast, Craig and Ruth Negga, as Lady Macbeth, are incontrovertibly stars, gliding across the space like slow, gleaming peacocks.",

While the actors are praised individually, the overall impression is negative due to this disparity. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the actors' individual strengths but points out a fundamental disconnect in their performances, suggesting an unevenness in the overall production. This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic offers genuine praise for the individual performances ('compelling') but levels a significant criticism about the production's lack of cohesion. The brief excerpt suggests a fundamental tonal mismatch undermines the show, though the overall recommendation is unclear given the limited text.",
