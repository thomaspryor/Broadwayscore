    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The review highlights a fundamental disconnect in the performances, suggesting a lack of cohesion in the production. While the actors are praised individually, the overall impression is negative due to this disparity. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the actors' individual strengths but points out a fundamental disconnect in their performances, suggesting an unevenness in the overall production. This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic offers genuine praise for the individual performances ('compelling') but levels a significant criticism about the production's lack of cohesion. The brief excerpt suggests a fundamental tonal mismatch undermines the show, though the overall recommendation is unclear given the limited text.",
