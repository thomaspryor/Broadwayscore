  "bwwExcerpt": "Broadway's 2021-22 comeback season goes out with a shrug in Sam Gold's production of Macbeth, the kind of passive-aggressive theater party that invites two big stars to attend-Daniel Craig and Ruth Negga as the regicidal title couple-and then makes a point of ignoring them. Short, eloquent, violent and packed with sensational business (murder! witches! madness! ghosts! a decapitated head!), Macbeth is usually one of Shakespeare's most exciting plays. Not so here: Deliberately murky, this anemic modern-dress production creeps at a petty pace from scene to scene, to the last syllable of the tragedy's verse and beyond into a wistful folk-song coda.",

Praises individual performers but notes a significant flaw in their chemistry that affects the production's impact. Confidence is low due to this being only a fragment of the full review. | GPT-4o: The review highlights strong performances but notes a lack of chemistry that affects the show's impact. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed assessment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges strong performances but notes a lack of chemistry, suggesting a mixed experience. The original rating of 60 aligns with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The provided rating of 60 falls within the Mixed bucket, and the single available sentence offers qualified praise: while the performers are praised as 'magnetic,' the criticism that their chemistry 'dulls the edge' indicates an uneven assessment. Confidence is low due to the severely truncated text.",
