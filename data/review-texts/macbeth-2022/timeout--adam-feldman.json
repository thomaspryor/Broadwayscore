    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating aligns with Mixed bucket. Praises individual performers but notes a significant flaw in their chemistry that affects the production's impact. Confidence is low due to this being only a fragment of the full review. | GPT-4o: The review highlights strong performances but notes a lack of chemistry that affects the show's impact. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed assessment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges strong performances but notes a lack of chemistry, suggesting a mixed experience. The original rating of 60 aligns with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The provided rating of 60 falls within the Mixed bucket, and the single available sentence offers qualified praise: while the performers are praised as 'magnetic,' the criticism that their chemistry 'dulls the edge' indicates an uneven assessment. Confidence is low due to the severely truncated text.",
