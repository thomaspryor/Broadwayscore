  "bwwExcerpt": "Still, at the end of an often brutal Broadway season that was rightly concerned with harm and heartlessness - in which many shows, including this one, were bedeviled by illness and delays - I liked Gold's showing us that in times of distress and violence people should remember to care for one another. If it has nothing to do with \"Macbeth,\" it has plenty to do with us.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic describes the production as 'overthought' and 'unsure of its welcome' despite praising the star power. This suggests significant reservations about the production's execution, placing it in mixed territory. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears to be criticism of the production approach. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view of the production, describing it as 'overthought' and 'unsure of its welcome'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the production is \"overthought\" and \"unsure of its welcome\", suggesting a negative assessment. Given the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly criticizes the production as 'overthought' and 'unsure of its welcome,' suggesting it alienates audiences despite its star power and classic source material. The single-excerpt limitation requires low confidence.",
