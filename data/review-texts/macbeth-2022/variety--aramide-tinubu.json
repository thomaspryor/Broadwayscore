    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Praises the lead performers as 'magnetic' but identifies a crucial flaw in their lack of chemistry and shared dramatic drive. This appears to be a fragment with the verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The review highlights a significant flaw in the production — the lack of believable chemistry between the leads, which is crucial for the show's premise. Despite praising the performers individually, the overall recommendation is negative. | Gemini: The review highlights the lack of chemistry between the leads as a major flaw, suggesting the production is not successful despite the actors' individual talents. | Kimi: The review offers strong praise for the individual performances but criticizes the central romantic chemistry and shared ambition as unconvincing, creating a balanced but conflicted assessment. The brevity suggests this may be an excerpt, warranting low confidence. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",
