    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Single excerpt shows harsh criticism calling characters meaningless and their actions insignificant. However, confidence is low as this may be cherry-picked from a larger review with different overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the characters and their actions as insignificant and meaningless, indicating a strongly negative view of the play. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the characters and their actions as meaningless, suggesting a negative view of the play's content and impact. Given that it is only a single excerpt, I am scoring it with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt characterizes the play's conflicts as meaningless ('nothing... matters a jot') and the characters as trivial 'masters of a universe of nothing,' indicating a dismissive, negative assessment of the material's significance. With only one excerpt available, confidence is reduced.",
