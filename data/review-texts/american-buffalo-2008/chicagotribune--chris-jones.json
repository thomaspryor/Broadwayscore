    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt shows clear dismissal of the characters and story as meaningless ('nothing they are saying matters a jot', 'universe of nothing'), but as a single curated quote, it may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the characters and their actions as inconsequential and unimportant, suggesting a negative view of the play's impact. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the characters and their actions as meaningless, suggesting a negative assessment of the play's substance and impact. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt emphasizes the emptiness and meaninglessness of the characters' conflicts ('universe of nothing,' 'matters a jot'), suggesting the play lacks substance or stakes. However, with only one curated quote available, the overall verdict and whether this constitutes criticism of the production or mere description remains unclear.",
