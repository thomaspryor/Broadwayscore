    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Jesse Green describes this as an 'electric revival' with praise for both lead performances - Rockwell's 'terrifyingly uncoiled ferocity' and Fishburne's 'beautifully considered performance.' The phrase 'great occasion of a great role' signals strong enthusiasm, though the excerpt is cut off mid-sentence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'electric' and highlights standout performances by Sam Rockwell and Laurence Fishburne. The language suggests a highly positive reception, indicating a rave review. | Gemini: The excerpt is highly positive, praising Rockwell's performance and Fishburne's. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong praise for the lead performances and production quality, describing the revival as 'electric' and the acting as 'beautifully considered' and 'great,' indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited text available.",
