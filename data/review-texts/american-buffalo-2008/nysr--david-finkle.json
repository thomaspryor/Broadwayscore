  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Because Rockwell has the showiest role, he rivets attention as he charges around like a bull in a junk shop. He’s an actor unleashed after Marlon Brando broke molds to establish a new one. Rockwell is grand at the volatile tradition. Fishburne and Criss more than hold their own, Fishburne authoritative as a shop owner unable to maintain authority, Criss as a little-boy-lost in a big, ugly city.\"\n\nRead more",

The use of 'must-see' suggests a high level of enthusiasm. | Gemini: The review states the show \"qualifies as a must-see\", which is a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the revival lacks the impact of previous productions but explicitly deems it a 'must-see' due to its 'deliberately grubby thrills.'",
