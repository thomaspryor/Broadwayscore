  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Because Rockwell has the showiest role, he rivets attention as he charges around like a bull in a junk shop. He’s an actor unleashed after Marlon Brando broke molds to establish a new one. Rockwell is grand at the volatile tradition. Fishburne and Criss more than hold their own, Fishburne authoritative as a shop owner unable to maintain authority, Criss as a little-boy-lost in a big, ugly city.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Despite acknowledging the production doesn't match past impact, the critic explicitly calls it a 'must-see,' which is strong recommendation language that places it firmly in positive territory. | GPT-4o: The critic describes the production as a 'must-see' despite noting it doesn't pack the same wallop as before. The use of 'must-see' indicates a strong recommendation, placing it in the Rave bucket. However, the confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Gemini: The review concludes that the revival contains sufficient thrills to qualify as a \"must-see,\" indicating a rave recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic notes this revival lacks the impact of previous productions, the explicit 'must-see' verdict constitutes a strong recommendation, though the qualification 'sufficient' and comparison to superior earlier versions keep it from unqualified Rave territory. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Rave, kimi=Positive",
