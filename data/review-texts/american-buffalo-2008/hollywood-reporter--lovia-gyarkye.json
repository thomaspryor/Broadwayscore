  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"David Mamet’s 'American Buffalo' is now on Broadway, buttressed by a starry cast. Laurence Fishburne, Sam Rockwell and Darren Criss are sharp and lithe in this revival of the caustic 1975 play about three hustlers planning a heist. They stalk across Scott Pask’s ornate set as they hurl Mamet’s signature terse prose at one another. Their speech moves rhythmically — a sonorous medley. They maneuver their bodies with precision and intention. This critic stared, entranced by their dance.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong praise for the performances ('sharp and lithe', 'entranced') and production design ('ornate set'). However, low confidence due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of positive moments. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast's performance and the production's set design, describing it as entrancing. The positive tone and strong language suggest a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the cast, set, and Mamet's writing. The critic states they were \"entranced by their dance.\" | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the cast's physicality and rhythmic delivery, with the critic describing themselves as 'entranced.' Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this scores at the upper end of Positive, though confidence is low given the potential for cherry-picking.",
