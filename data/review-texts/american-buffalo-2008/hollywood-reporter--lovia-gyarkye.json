  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"David Mamet’s 'American Buffalo' is now on Broadway, buttressed by a starry cast. Laurence Fishburne, Sam Rockwell and Darren Criss are sharp and lithe in this revival of the caustic 1975 play about three hustlers planning a heist. They stalk across Scott Pask’s ornate set as they hurl Mamet’s signature terse prose at one another. Their speech moves rhythmically — a sonorous medley. They maneuver their bodies with precision and intention. This critic stared, entranced by their dance.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the cast performances with vivid, appreciative language ('sharp and lithe', 'entranced by their dance'), but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and the set, describing the actors as 'sharp and lithe' and the dialogue as a 'sonorous medley'. The positive language suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the cast and their performance, as well as the set design. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive with high end of the range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the cast's physical and vocal performances ('sharp and lithe,' 'sonorous medley'), indicating a strong recommendation despite limited available text.",
