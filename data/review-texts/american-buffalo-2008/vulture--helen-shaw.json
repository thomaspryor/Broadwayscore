  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Judged as a showcase, 'American Buffalo' works beautifully. Rockwell has exactly the right tools to crack the Mamet safe. His half-whine, half-growl voice sings in what Todd London evocatively called the writer’s “fricative riffs” — unsurprisingly, given how well he’s suited to other writers of masculine lyric like Martin McDonagh. Fishburne, judging his rhythms to the nanosecond, grips the play and captains it, and it’s lucky that the close quarters of Circle in the Square allow you to see the details of his casual command. Criss, too, does fine work as the play’s slow-minded straight man, though he finds fewer details in his character than the other two men.\"\n\nRead more",

However, confidence is low due to truncated text that may not include the full critical verdict. | GPT-4o: The review praises the performances of Rockwell, Fishburne, and Criss, noting their command and suitability for the roles. The phrase 'works beautifully' suggests a positive recommendation, though the lack of a full review text and potential reservations about Criss's character detail make the confidence low. | Gemini: The review praises the performances of the actors, particularly Rockwell and Fishburne, and states that the play \"works beautifully\" as a showcase. However, it's an excerpt, so confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the performances, particularly Rockwell and Fishburne, and finds the production works 'beautifully' as a showcase for the actors' talents.",
