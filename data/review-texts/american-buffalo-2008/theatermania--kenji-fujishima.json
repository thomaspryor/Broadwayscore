  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The most noteworthy aspect of this revival is that it reminds us of what makes 'American Buffalo' a formidable work in the first place. This is a down-in-the-dumps working-class vision of the American dream, and Mamet invites us to observe these oblivious, hypocritical dreamers with equal parts amusement, empathy, and skepticism. Whether this play has any fresh revelations to offer the more 'woke' world of 2022, however, is a question that this production never really bothers to ask. For better or worse, this new production mostly offers the not-inconsiderable spectacle of a job well done.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - acknowledges the play's merits and calls it 'a job well done,' but questions its contemporary relevance and seems somewhat lukewarm overall. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the production as a 'job well done' but questions its relevance to contemporary audiences, suggesting a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the play's strengths and calls the production a \"job well done,\" but also questions its relevance in 2022. Given the single excerpt and the reservations, a score in the lower-middle of the positive range seems appropriate. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the play's formidable qualities and calls the production a 'job well done,' the review emphasizes significant reservations about the revival's failure to engage with contemporary relevance or offer fresh revelations for 2022 audiences. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Mixed",
