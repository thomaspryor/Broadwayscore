    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. The excerpt only praises individual performances without indicating overall recommendation, and single excerpts are often cherry-picked positive moments from mixed reviews. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances by the actors, but the original rating of 60 suggests a mixed review overall. The single excerpt may not fully capture the review's sentiment, leading to a low confidence classification. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the performances of Cedric the Entertainer and John Leguizamo, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation. Given the critic's rating of 60, I've classified it as mixed. | Kimi: The critic's original rating of 60 places this squarely in the Mixed bucket (55-69). While the excerpt praises the lead actors' performances, the single-quote warning and moderate numerical score suggest an overall uneven or qualified reception.",
