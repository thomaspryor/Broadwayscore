  "showScoreExcerpt": "Nevertheless, Mr. Rockwell, his mismatched outfit perfectly chosen by costumer Dede Ayite, his greasy, unkempt hair crying out for scissors, makes memorable his seedy punk, wandering the junkshop aisles, keeping his anxious hands restlessly handling prop after prop. Mr. Fishburne uses his husky presence gracefully, every now and then rolling a burly shoulder as if to loosen its kinks before his next sparring match. And Mr. Criss, although not quite on the level of his veteran costars, maintains an appropriate semblance of blessed ignorance that earns him sympathy when, late in the play, a bit of well-timed savagery—created by the great fight director J. David Brimmer—puts him out of commission.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt focuses on praising individual performances (Rockwell 'memorable', Fishburne 'graceful', Criss earning 'sympathy'), suggesting positive assessment of acting. However, with only one curated excerpt available and text cut off mid-sentence, confidence is low and score reflects cautious positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances and memorable character portrayals, suggesting a positive view of the actors' contributions. However, the lack of a full review and potential cherry-picking of quotes necessitates a cautious, lower-end positive score. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances of the actors, indicating a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, review. Given that it is only an excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the principal performances (Rockwell is 'memorable,' Fishburne 'graceful,' Criss 'earns sympathy'), indicating a clear recommendation based on acting quality, though the limited excerpt prevents a higher confidence assessment.",
