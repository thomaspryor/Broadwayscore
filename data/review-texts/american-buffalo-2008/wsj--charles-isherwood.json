  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Mr. Mamet does not write tragedy—his characters are poor pipsqueaks compared to the doomed but majestic figures of the Greeks. 'American Buffalo' ends with a whimpering note of surprising, and touching, grace. For all their fecklessness and desperation, these men intuitively know that their only respite from a world they cannot compete in is the small comfort they can take in each other’s unspoken affection.\"\n\nRead more",
  "bwwExcerpt": "Now might seem an inopportune time to be reviving a play by David Mamet, who could be called America's bard of toxic masculinity, although the term was hardly current-in fact it hadn't entered the popular lexicon, let alone swamped it-when Mr. Mamet was in his prime.

It's true that the play depicts men-mostly the foul-mouthed Teach, played by Sam Rockwell -display",
