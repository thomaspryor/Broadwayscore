  "showScoreExcerpt": "The 1975 play American Buffalo, now onstage in a crackling revival, remains the quintessential Mamet experience, the one that should be seen to fully appreciate what has been lost. Essentially a two-hander masquerading as a three-hander, it's a character study short on plot and long on self-delusion as a couple of small-time crooks imagine themselves as much more than they are while planning an ambitious heist. To say they're all talk gets to the satirical heart of Mamet's play. \n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning applied with upper-end scoring due to clearly positive tone. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the revival as 'crackling' and 'quintessential', suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the revival as a \"quintessential Mamet experience\" and a \"crackling revival\", indicating a positive assessment. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt employs enthusiastic descriptors ('crackling,' 'quintessential') and explicitly states the production 'should be seen,' indicating a clear recommendation in the upper Positive range, though confidence is reduced due to limited available text.",
