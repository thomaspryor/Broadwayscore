Scored conservatively in lower Positive range due to excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances by Rockwell and Fishburne, suggesting a positive view of the show. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the performances of Rockwell and Fishburne, suggesting a positive experience, but the truncated text and single excerpt lower the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers enthusiastic praise for the lead actors' chemistry and Fishburne's commanding portrayal, though it qualifies that one role is less rewarding. As a single truncated excerpt, the sentiment appears clearly positive but confidence is reduced due to missing context.",
