    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it a 'splendid production' and finds meaningful new insights, with 'heart and humanity that ultimately triumphs.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking of positive quotes. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'splendid' and highlights its insight and emotional depth, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses positive language like \"splendid production\" and suggests the play has heart and humanity, indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise ('splendid production,' 'triumphs') indicating a clear recommendation, though confidence is limited by the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
