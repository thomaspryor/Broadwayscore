However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked positive content. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'splendid' and highlights a new insight, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the production as \"splendid\" and suggests it provides new insight into the play, highlighting the triumph of heart and humanity. This indicates a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the production as 'splendid' with 'heart and humanity that ultimately triumph,' indicating a clear positive recommendation. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the upper Positive range.",
