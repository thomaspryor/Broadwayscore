  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"There is genuine desperation in these characters that is relatable for anyone who has struggled against odds. And each cares what the other two think of him. There are attempts at deception laced heavily with guilt and the ache of having to believe in something just enough to not die without hope or at least some entertainment. We are entertained as every nugget of humor is squeezed out of the writing.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear appreciation for the writing, character development, and entertainment value. However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of positive moments. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as entertaining with relatable characters and humor, indicating a positive impression. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights relatable characters and entertaining humor, suggesting a positive, though possibly qualified, recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers solid praise for the character work and writing, explicitly stating the production entertains, though the single curated quote limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
