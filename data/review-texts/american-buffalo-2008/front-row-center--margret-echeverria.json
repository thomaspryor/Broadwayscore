There are attempts at deception laced heavily with guilt and the ache of having to believe in something just enough to not die without hope or at least some entertainment. We are entertained as every nugget of humor is squeezed out of the writing.\"\n\nRead more",

However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context necessitate a low confidence rating. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the show is entertaining and relatable, but the limited text and the warning about cherry-picked quotes reduce confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt explicitly states the audience is 'entertained' and praises the character work and writing as 'genuine' and effective, indicating a clear positive recommendation.",
