    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises Jackson's specificity creating universal truth and describes the protagonist as 'a voice in all our heads,' suggesting strong artistic merit. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the specificity and universality of the show's themes, suggesting a positive view. However, with only one excerpt, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The quote suggests a positive view of the specificity and universality of the character, implying a positive assessment of the show. However, due to the limited excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the writing's specificity and universal thematic appeal, calling the protagonist 'a voice in all our heads.' However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
