  "bwwExcerpt": "In crafting a work so joyously and painfully honest, playwright, composer and lyricist Michael R. Jackson walks a fine line. A Strange Loop is a carefully structured piece, lean and quick-paced. Yet it is also a manic mess, a frenzied collage that stays true to its central premise of hurtling through the chaotic depths of one man's rage, trauma, and self-hatred. That is Jackson's most awe-inspiring accomplishment with A Strange Loop, which is certainly the best new musical on Broadway this season: he has created a finely honed piece of theater while always remaining true to his own distinct voice.",

Despite noting its chaotic nature, the overall tone is strongly positive, indicating a rave review. | Gemini: The review excerpt contains strong praise, calling it the \"best new musical on Broadway this season\" and highlighting Jackson's \"awe-inspiring accomplishment.\" While it acknowledges the show's chaotic nature, the overall tone is positive and enthusiastic, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers unqualified praise, explicitly calling the show the season's best new musical and an 'awe-inspiring accomplishment,' though the single-excerpt format necessitates caution about potential cherry-picking.",
