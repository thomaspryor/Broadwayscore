    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language like 'jubilantly planted' and 'dazzlingly original' suggests enthusiasm, but excerpt is truncated with only setup provided. Setting confidence low due to single excerpt warning and incomplete text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('dazzlingly original', 'jubilantly planted') suggesting a highly favorable view. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"jubilantly planted\" and \"dazzlingly original.\" Given the single excerpt, I am placing the score at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs highly positive descriptors including 'dazzlingly original' and 'jubilantly planted,' indicating strong enthusiasm for the production. However, confidence is limited due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
