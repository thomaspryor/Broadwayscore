    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Extremely strong praise calling the show 'shattering' and 'electrifying' with the critic explicitly stating that calling it unprecedented would be an 'understatement.' However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked opening praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong superlatives like 'shattering' and 'electrifying', indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. The phrase 'would be an understatement' suggests the critic believes the show exceeds even high expectations. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"shattering\" and \"electrifying,\" indicating a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt contains superlative praise ('shattering, electrifying') and suggests the work is unprecedented and essential, indicating a strong recommendation. Following the single-excerpt guidelines for clearly positive quotes, this scores at the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
