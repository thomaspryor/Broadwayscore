  "bwwExcerpt": "At breathtaking speed, for an hour and 45 minutes, Loop continues whirling on like this: the Big Ideas and the petty ones waltzing around in Jackson's profane, hilarious, metamusical carousel. It's less vicariously exhausting than it was Off Broadway, perhaps because the company no longer wrecks itself physically with every performance - but it's still furious, both with the world and itself. The shock of that sharp emotion strikes like a lance. Especially in the Lyceum Theater: It's a red-velvet-and-gilt balloon, and Jackson makes it go pop.",

The critic praises the show for its daring and achieving something significant. | Kimi: The critic employs the superlative 'transcendence'—one of the highest possible accolades—to praise the show's artistic achievement, framing its complexity as a deliberate virtue rather than a flaw. No reservations are present in this excerpt.",
