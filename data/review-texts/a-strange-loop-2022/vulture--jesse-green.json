The critic praises the show for its daring and achieving something significant. | Kimi: The critic employs the superlative 'transcendence'—one of the highest possible accolades—to praise the show's artistic achievement, framing its complexity as a deliberate virtue rather than a flaw. No reservations are present in this excerpt.",
