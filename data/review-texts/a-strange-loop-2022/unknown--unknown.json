    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: The critic states no praise could be too much and calls it 'radical theater,' indicating very strong recommendation despite being a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is highly positive, emphasizing the show's radical and respectful portrayal of its subject. The language suggests strong praise, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language (\"no measure of praise that could be too much\", \"radical theater\") and describes the show's positive representation. Given it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise ('no measure of praise that could be too much') indicating an enthusiastic, must-see recommendation. However, confidence is reduced to 'low' per instructions due to availability of only a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's balance.",
