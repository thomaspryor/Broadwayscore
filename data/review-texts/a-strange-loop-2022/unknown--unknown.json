    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The phrase 'no measure of praise that could be too much' indicates the highest level of critical enthusiasm, calling it 'radical theater' - clear rave territory despite being a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('no measure of praise that could be too much') indicating a highly favorable view. The context suggests a groundbreaking and impactful production, aligning with a rave review. | Gemini: The excerpt is extremely positive, praising the show's radical and sensitive portrayal of a Black gay man. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt uses superlative language ('no measure of praise that could be too much') and calls the production 'radical theater,' indicating strong enthusiasm, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
