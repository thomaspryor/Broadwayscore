    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Acknowledges flaws ('navel-gazy') but praises the craft and rigor. Single excerpt makes confidence low, but the overall tone suggests qualified recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges some criticism ('Navel-gazy? Sure.') but ultimately highlights the show's craft and rigor, suggesting a positive view. Due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive assessment, highlighting the craft and rigor of the piece, but the \"navel-gazy? Sure.\" indicates some reservations. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The reviewer acknowledges the work is 'navel-gazy' (self-indulgent) but pivots to praise its 'craft and rigor' and affirms the creator's artistic significance, indicating a solid recommendation with reservations. Score reflects middle-to-upper Positive range based on substantive artistic praise, though single-excerpt format limits confidence.",
