The original rating of 100 confirms this as a rave review. | Gemini: The review uses superlative language like \"brilliant\" and \"uncompromising\" and states that the show pushes the boundaries of musical theater, indicating a rave review. | Kimi: Unqualified superlatives ('brilliant,' 'work of art') combined with a perfect original rating of 100 indicate an enthusiastic, must-see recommendation without reservations.",
