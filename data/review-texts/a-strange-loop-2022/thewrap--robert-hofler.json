This email ritual not only makes it unnecessary for critics to transcribe what the actors are saying on stage while we’re supposed to be watching the play, it gives us a look into the playwright’s mind.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "This review, minus a few obvious updates, is basically what I wrote about 'A Strange Loop' in 2019. Despite going on to win the Pulitzer Prize, the show has invoked some chat-room gossip that it 'doesn't belong on Broadway.' Yes, that's what they once said about 'Caroline, or Change,' 'Avenue Q,' 'Fun Home' and 'Hamilton' before they hit the big time. Not only does 'Loop' belong on Broadway, it is by far the best new musical to open during this very strange theater season.",
