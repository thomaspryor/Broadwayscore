    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Calls the show a 'complete game-changer' and compares it to 'Rent' as generationally significant. Despite being only one excerpt, the language is unqualified superlative praise suggesting a rave review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('complete game-changer') and compares the show to 'Rent,' suggesting a significant impact and broad appeal. However, the single excerpt warning reduces confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"complete game-changer\" and compares it favorably to \"Rent\", suggesting a strong recommendation. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers effusive praise calling the show a 'complete game-changer' comparable to Rent, indicating strong enthusiasm for the production's cultural impact and representation, though the single-excerpt format warrants reduced confidence. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
