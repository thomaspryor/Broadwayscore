  "showScoreExcerpt": "A Strange Loop was startling enough when it premiered in 2019 at Playwrights Horizons. At the Lyceum, it feels like a seismic event. When was the last time Broadway saw a musical as brazenly original and brutally candid as this? Never, probably; shows this iconoclastic and accomplished usually remain hidden away, far from the tourist trade -- if they exist at all\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Escalating praise from 'startling' to 'seismic event', calls it 'brazenly original' and 'iconoclastic and accomplished'. However, single excerpt warning requires caution - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'seismic event' and 'brazenly original,' indicating a strong, enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"seismic event\", \"brazenly original\", and \"brutally candid\", indicating a positive recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise for the Broadway transfer, calling it a 'seismic event' and unprecedented in its 'brazenly original' quality, though the single-excerpt format necessitates caution about the full review's tone. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
