  "bwwExcerpt": "But as I am writing this, it occurs to me that what Jackson does with 'A Strange Loop' isn't just write a musical with catchy tunes and clever lyrics. He's also successfully testing the conceit of how the universal is rooted in the specific. In making the lead character a fat, Black gay man, within an industry (and larger society) that prioritizes and idolizes skinny, white bodies, Jackson is making a Black gay man an embodiment of the universal. And he's also written one of the best, and the most groundbreaking, new musicals of the Broadway season.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Despite single excerpt warning, the critic explicitly calls this 'one of the best' and 'most groundbreaking' musicals of the season - clear rave language that demands upper Rave scoring. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the musical as one of the best and most groundbreaking of the season, indicating a strong recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The critic states that the show is one of the best and most groundbreaking of the season, which is strong positive praise. Given the single excerpt warning, I am placing the score at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise calling the show 'one of the best' and 'most groundbreaking' of the season, though as a single curated quote, confidence must remain low. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Musical theater tends to paint a portrait of a world that is more beautiful than the one we actually live in — where life is beautiful, the girls are beautiful, even the orchestra is beautiful. With “A Strange Loop,” Jackson is showing the unvarnished truth of what it is to be surrounded by self-doubt and then to finally overcome them. Yes, it’s still a musical, but here, the songs are the sugar that makes the medicine go down.\"\n\nRead more"
