  "bwwExcerpt": "Even if it all plays out like a dramatic therapy session, there is a powerful, raw emotionality to 'A Strange Loop,' directed by Stephen Brackett, and a boppin' score with a couple memorable tunes - if not much polish or, ultimately, much satisfaction. I missed it at the much smaller Playwrights Horizons in 2019, but would've liked to have felt its effects in a more intimate room. For instance, the sound balance on Broadway is off, and it's hard to hear the lyrics over the band. Prepare your ears: The musical is also absolutely filthy. If 'Spring Awakening' or 'The Book of Mormon' had you reaching for your rosary, best bring along some holy water and frankincense for this one. On the language front, Jackson goes overboard.",
