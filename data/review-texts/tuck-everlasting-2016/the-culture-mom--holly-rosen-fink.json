  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A beautiful set, expert choreography, a memorable score and brilliant acting aid the storytelling, and it all adds to the play’s fantasy theme…Lewis and Mann are excellent, as are the rest of the cast…The play ends with a ballet, depicting the future of Winnie...It wasn’t my favorite way to end the show, but I appreciate the interpretation, and I am sure any child over the age of 12 would appreciate the optimistic ending of this hopeful play.\"\n\nRead more",
