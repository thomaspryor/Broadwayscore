  "bwwExcerpt": "Family-friendly musicals on Broadway generally come in just one flavor: flashy. Enter 'Tuck Everlasting,' a warm-spirited and piercingly touching musical that has nothing flashy or splashy about it...Mr. Nicholaw does let loose in a couple of rousing numbers led by the show's mysterious villain, a carnival worker, with high-kicking dancers swirling and strutting across the stage...But he also evinces a natural feel for the tender emotional core of the material and even its layers of mildly dark philosophical inquiry...'Tuck Everlasting' rings a variation on the fountain of youth myth, ultimately asking what life would mean if it never ended, and whether a never-ending life would be worth living. It also provides an answer in the enthralling, wordless climax, a ballet that depicts, with moving clarity, what another, much-celebrated musical would call the circle of life.",
