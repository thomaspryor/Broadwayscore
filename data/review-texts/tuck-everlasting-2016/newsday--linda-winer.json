  "bwwExcerpt": "From the small world of unexpected pleasures comes 'Tuck Everlasting,' a gentle but hardly lightweight fantasy musical about an 11-year-old girl and the prospect of eternal life. Perhaps the least-expected part of this unpretentious sweetheart is director-choreographer Casey Nicholaw...This touching low-tech show is for an underserved niche audience -- families who want to be thoughtfully charmed for a few hours after being hyper-entertained by 'Wicked' and 'Matilda'...The functional music by Chris Miller and lyrics by Nathan Tysen don't shy far from the Scottish-tinged folksiness of the former while, alas, some jaunty patter songs sound a bit too much like the latter.",
