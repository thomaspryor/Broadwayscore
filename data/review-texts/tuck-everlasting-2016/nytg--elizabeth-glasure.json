  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Chris Miller’s composition in combination with lyrics by Nathan Tysen echoes the enchanted nature of the story, yet could have used more variety throughout the score...Overall, the musical is full of family-friendly magic, but the chief appeal is directed towards a younger audience.
