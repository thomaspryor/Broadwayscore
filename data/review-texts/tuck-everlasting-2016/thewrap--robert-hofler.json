  "bwwExcerpt": "If immortality is so awful here on earth, why do people pray for it before they die? Neither the musical nor its source material...asks that question. The show's first act...finds it necessary to ask all sorts of other less interesting questions...Shear and Federle answer most (but not all) of the above questions about the Tuck family, but it takes them forever. More than anything else in 'Tuck Everlasting,' their lax narrative gives us a real glimpse of just how long forever can be. The songs by Chris Miller and Nathan Tysen also give a nod to eternity. No tune seems to have a beginning, a middle and an end...'Tuck Everlasting'...is more whimsical than it is broad slapstick, and Nicholaw is better with the latter. As a result, the performances in 'Tuck' come off as merely Broadway generic.",
