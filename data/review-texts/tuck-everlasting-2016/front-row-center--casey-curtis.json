  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"This musical has much to recommend it, but overall it is inconsistent as a work of art. It has charm and poignancy in places, but a corny, dated feel elsewhere...Most notable though is the marvelous comic timing of two secondary characters…But overall, 'Tuck Everlasting' is not a comedy, so while the comedy songs were delightful, they made me wish for more comedy that wasn’t there...It’s a shame that the whole show isn’t as good as the second half.\"\n\nRead more",
