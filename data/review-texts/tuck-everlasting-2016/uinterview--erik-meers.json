  "showScoreExcerpt": "“‘Tuck’, based on 1975 children’s book by Natalie Babbitt, was made into a poorly received 2002 Disney film.

While some might find the humor hokey, the big themes of love and immortality provide a framework of ideas upon which this winning production builds smartly.”\n\nRead more",
