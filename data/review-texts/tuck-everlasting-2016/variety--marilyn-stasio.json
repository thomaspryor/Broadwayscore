    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review describes the show as 'gentle' and 'old-fashioned' which could be positive, but 'heavy on sentiment and light on surprises' suggests predictability and lack of theatrical excitement. No clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The review describes the musical as 'gentle' and 'old-fashioned' but also 'heavy on sentiment and light on surprises,' indicating a lack of enthusiasm or strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses neutral language, suggesting a middling experience. It doesn't explicitly recommend or discourage seeing the show. | Kimi: The review offers a balanced but unenthusiastic assessment, acknowledging the show's gentle, old-fashioned charm while criticizing it for being overly sentimental and predictable ('light on surprises'). With only one sentence provided, the verdict lacks clear recommendation language.",
