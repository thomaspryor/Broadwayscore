  "bwwExcerpt": "Authors Claudia Shear ('Dirty Blonde') and Tim Federle ('Better Nate Than Ever') make some smart changes. Winnie's dad has passed away, which underscores that death is part of life. The book's elaborate ending has been simplified. Composer Chris Miller and lyricist Nathan Tysen...wrap the story up in a warm and folksy score. It fits the 19th-century time period...Characters are pretty sketchy, but the cast makes the most of what they've got...In the end, 'Tuck Everlasting' is allowed to breathe. Like people, musicals need that to live.",
