  "bwwExcerpt": "Lewis is all the things you'd want in a young protagonist, and her Winnie has got an edge...Keenan-Bolger, the energetic performer with his hands in any multitude of entertainment projects...is charismatic as a figure with the impulses of a 17-year-old, who is nonetheless over 100 years old. 'Tuck Everlasting' is a real showcase for his whiz-bang dancing skills. Carolee Carmello and Michael Park are welcome as the TV sitcom-like Tuck parents...Robert Lenzi stands out as Jesse's older brother...A tone of melancholy underscores 'Tuck Everlasting'...Among the more memorable songs...is 'Top of the World,' which has [Winnie and Jesse] scampering up that surreal tree, briefly abandoning their cares before making fateful decisions...This interpretation of 'Tuck Everlasting' is neither tragic nor cynical. It's good entertainment.",
