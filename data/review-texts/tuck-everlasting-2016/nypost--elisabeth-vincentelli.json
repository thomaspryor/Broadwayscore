  "bwwExcerpt": "If you like your family fare with a good heap of sweetener, welcome to 'Tuck Everlasting'...What sucks is that we missed an opportunity for an all-ages musical with bite, a la 'Matilda,' since the 1975 children's book that 'Tuck' is based on isn't afraid of the dark. It's pretty crazy that this story about regret, mortality and big life choices -- make that 'eternal life or death' choices -- could end up so toothless...the actors are largely engaging, especially seasoned pros like Carolee Carmello, Terrence Mann and Fred Applegate. As Winnie, Sarah Charles Lewis is 11 going on Laura Benanti -- the downside is that she projects such unflagging confidence that you never doubt that Winnie will be all right no matter what she decides. So much for pathos.",
