  "bwwExcerpt": "Tuck Everlasting is a beautifully drawn, evocative tale about an eternal-life-giving spring, the trapped-in-time family who drank from it, and a curious young girl who stumbles upon both...Yet on stage, this fantasy-driven story remains stubbornly earthbound. Not that Tuck isn't trying its darndest: The actors are appealing -- particularly Andrew Keenan-Bolger, impishly charming as the '17-year-old' Jesse Tuck, and the extraordinary Sarah Charles Lewis as our intrepid 11-year-old heroine, Winnie Foster...But they're practically drowning in a flood of banalities and a deluge of clichés.
