  "bwwExcerpt": "The trim, nicely executed show, which opened Tuesday night at the Broadhurst Theatre, is taken from Natalie Babbitt's widely read 1975 children's novel about the involvement of an 11-year-old girl, Winnie (Sarah Charles Lewis), with the Tucks, an ordinary-seeming family who've discovered the secret of eternal life.",
