    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The description of the revival as 'timeless and perfectly timed' is clearly positive evaluation language. However, confidence is low due to this being only a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive assessment, describing the revival as 'timeless and perfectly timed.' Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed on the higher end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the revival, describing it as \"timeless and perfectly timed.\" Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, and the score is placed at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise ('timeless,' 'perfectly timed') indicating a successful production, though the single curated quote warrants reduced confidence in the overall verdict.",
