    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising lead performance suggests positive assessment, but limited text prevents confident scoring. Using lower end of Positive range due to single excerpt warning and uncertainty about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a strong performance by Janeane Garofalo, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, with only one curated excerpt available, the overall sentiment of the review is unclear, warranting a low confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Garofalo's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the production. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall verdict is uncertain, leading to a 'low' confidence score and a score on the lower end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt provides strong praise for the lead performance ('benefits enormously,' 'beautifully restrained'), indicating a clear positive recommendation, though limited context prevents Rave classification or higher confidence.",
