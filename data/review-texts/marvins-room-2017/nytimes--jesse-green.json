He did so even while noting that this “healing” comedy, then opening Off Broadway, featured three major characters dying or disintegrating — and a bunch of others arguably worse off.\n\nI ask because the Roundabout Theater Company revival that opened on Thursday, giving the play its Broadway debut, barely seems to be any of the things Mr. Rich listed. Thoughtfully directed by Anne Kauffman; keenly performed by Lili Taylor, Janeane Garofalo and especially Celia Weston; a pleasure to watch throughout — it is all of these. But it is somehow, also, fatally mild.\n\nHow can this be when nothing has been altered? The 40-ish Bessie (Ms. Taylor) is still a saint, having devoted the past 20 years of her life to caring for Marvin, her always-dying father. “He’s doing it real slow so I don’t miss anything,” she says, only partly in jest. Bessie also tends to her dotty Aunt Ruth (Ms. Weston), a sitcom character in exile. The electrical implants that relieve the pain of her three collapsed vertebrae somehow operate the garage door, too.\n\nBut the warm and self-sufficient life these three kinfolk lead in a Florida house can continue only as long as Bessie remains healthy. So when she receives a diagnosis of leukemia from the wacky Dr. Wally (Triney Sandoval), the whole ménage is threatened. Ruth breaks down, terrified not only for herself but also for Marvin. And Marvin, whom we never see and who barely talks, agitates noticeably from behind the glass-block wall of his bedroom.\n\nAt this point the play, having had its comic face slapped, means to turn the other cheek. In truth, it’s about time; with no conflict to propel it, it has been fueling itself for too long on whimsy. (Dr. Wally, a bumbler who mixes up his patients’ names, seems like a character straight out of vaudeville.) Now Bessie must call her sister, Lee, whom she has not seen since their father’s first stroke two decades earlier. Perhaps Lee (Ms. Garofalo) or one of her two sons (Jack DiFalco and Luca Padovan) will be a bone-marrow match.\n\nFrom then on “Marvin’s Room” concerns itself with the deeper questions of caretaking: Is it selfless or — as Hank, Lee’s troubled 17-year-old, maintains — just another kind of selfishness to devote oneself to others? (“People don’t just do things,” he says. “They get something for it.”) Piling on, Lee, who is tough and wayward and casually abusive, points out that if Bessie is glad to have stayed with their father and aunt, why should Lee feel guilty about having left her to do so?\n\nLili Taylor and Celia Weston in a revival of Scott McPherson’s comedy-drama, on Broadway at the American Airlines Theater.\n\nAs the play pauses to consider these thorny questions, offering variations on the theme of guardianship and neglect, the plot gets a case of the doldrums. Bessie especially becomes becalmed; her illness only burnishes her halo as she adds her sister and nephews to the roster of relatives she can help. It is a relief, and the story’s most touching moment, when Lee finally does something for Bessie instead: A budding cosmetologist, she offers to restyle her wig.\n\nIf in 2017 the play seems to be stacking the deck, offering so many kinds of sickness needing so much care, there is a perfectly good 1991 reason for it: AIDS. Mr. McPherson did not have the disease when he wrote “Marvin’s Room”; it was based more on memories of Florida relatives in fact named Marvin, Bessie and Ruth. Still, AIDS was all around him. His companion, Daniel Sotomayor, died of it in early 1992, during the play’s original New York run; Mr. McPherson himself died nine months later. Both men were 33.\n\nThese losses, and the auguries of them haunting the play, could not have been separable from the reception it received. The New York theater world was likewise surrounded and beleaguered by AIDS at the time. Challenged, too: While some people and institutions were running, like Lee, from their duty to care for those in need, many others stepped up. “Marvin’s Room,” with its all-too-familiar procedures and pills and bedside hoverings, reflected that reality, leavening it with what lightweight humor it dared. And its lesson — for there is one — in some ways thanked the survivors who kept the faith.\n\nEvery week, stay on top of the latest news, interviews and reviews from Broadway and beyond.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\n\nInvalid email address.

They seem to have been evident to Mr. McPherson even then. The 1996 movie version, for which he wrote the screenplay just before his death, excises a lot of the whimsy and more carefully delineates the process by which Lee (Meryl Streep) comes to understand the value of the sacrifice that Bessie (Diane Keaton) has made. In the play, this change seems to come out of nowhere, at least partly because Ms. Garofalo is such a brilliant underplayer that I could hardly tell the difference between Lee’s awfulness and her kindness.\n\nIt’s unfair, of course, to hold anyone up to Ms. Streep, but if the movie’s cast (which also includes Leonardo DiCaprio as Hank and Robert De Niro as Dr. Wally) acts up a storm, the play’s cast acts up a calm. Ms. Taylor is lovely as Bessie but is almost too honest, abjuring any theatrics that might spark a fire in the 726-seat American Airlines Theater. (The old Playwrights Horizons space, where the New York production originated, seated 146.) Only Ms. Weston, in a part that could not survive too much naturalism, achieves the right balance of silly and moving; she’s divine.\n\nEven so, this production of “Marvin’s Room” languishes in the gap between the powerful, absurdist comedy Mr. Rich saw and the histrionic (but effective) excess of the three-hanky film. Perhaps Ms. Kauffman, the terrific director of new plays like “Marjorie Prime” and “A Life,” felt there was no avoiding that pitfall with this material and so determined to make the best of it. Her production is smart and refined, with an elegant set design by Laura Jellinek that is dominated by a cloverleaf breeze-block wall suggesting both separation and permeability. (And Florida!) Everything, really, is perfect.\n\nBut unlike some other dramas arising from the same milieu — “Angels in America,” “The Baltimore Waltz,” “The Normal Heart,” to name three — “Marvin’s Room” may suffer from such perfection. Its wound, shockingly deep though it was, seems to have healed over itself. It would take a great deal more guts, in the production and in us, to risk reopening it now.\n\nWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.",
