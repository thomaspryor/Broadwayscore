    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows strong praise for lead performance with emotional impact ('luminous integrity', 'makes you believe'). However, confidence is low due to limited text - this could be cherry-picked praise from a mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Ms. Taylor's performance with strong positive language ('luminous integrity'). Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performance of Ms. Taylor, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. However, with only one excerpt available, the overall recommendation is uncertain, leading to a lower confidence and a score on the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance using superlatives ('luminous integrity'), indicating a clearly positive recommendation for this aspect of the production. Following the single-excerpt guidance for strongly positive quotes, this falls in the upper Positive range.",
