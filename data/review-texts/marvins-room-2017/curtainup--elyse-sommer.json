  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"As helmed by Anne Kauffman and as performed by an able ensemble, 'Marvin's Room' remains a moving, well-constructed portrait of a woman who has spent her adult life as the loving caretaker of a terminally ill father...The rather too-slow pacing is picked up by the heart-tugging emotional interactions...Even if all the comic business still landed throughout instead of rather sporadically, it's not as a comedy that 'Marvin's Room' survives but as a very human look at life, love and death.\" \n\nRead more",
