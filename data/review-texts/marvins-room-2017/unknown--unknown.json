  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Thoughtfully directed by Kauffman; keenly performed by Taylor, Garofalo and especially Weston; a pleasure to watch throughout...But it is somehow, also, fatally mild. How can this be when nothing has been altered?...Without that heightened and emotional context some of the play’s flaws are more evident now...This production of 'Marvin’s Room' languishes in the gap between the powerful, absurdist comedy Mr. Rich saw and the histrionic excess of the three-hanky film.\" \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Despite praising direction and performances ('thoughtfully directed', 'keenly performed', 'pleasure to watch'), the critic finds the production 'fatally mild' and says it 'languishes' between extremes. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges strong direction and performances, but ultimately finds the production lacking in emotional impact, describing it as 'fatally mild'. The mixed signals and single excerpt lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like direction and performances, but ultimately finds the production \"fatally mild\" and notes that flaws are more evident. This suggests a mixed or lukewarm reception. | Kimi: While the excerpt praises the direction and performances as thoughtful and a pleasure to watch, the critic ultimately finds the production fatally mild and languishing between the original play and film, with flaws more evident in this staging.",
