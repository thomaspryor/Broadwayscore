  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The story is straightforward, told simply, about real people with real problems. We empathize with the characters and sympathize with their plight.

Though I prefer my drama with a bit more spice. 'Marvin's Room' never transcends its everyday realism and never really puts any of its characters to the fire.\"\n\nRead more",
