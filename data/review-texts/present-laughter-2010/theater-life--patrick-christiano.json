  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Kline doesn’t disappoint delivering a sublime performance…Every member of the skilled cast holds stage for their fleeting time in the spotlight.

Von Stuelpnagel allows several of the actors to be manically one-noted caricatures. The result although amusing is uneven with Kline standing out as the glorious spirit of the evening.”\n\nRead more",
