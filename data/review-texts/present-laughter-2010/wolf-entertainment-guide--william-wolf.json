  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Through it all Kline is a master of comic and dramatic sophistication that exactly fits the tone of Coward’s best writing. That tone is achieved—with one exception—by the direction of Moritz von Stuelpnagel and the contributions of other starring cast members...A wonderfully entertaining production, with impeccable casting and resulting fine acting, led by the triumph of Kevin Kline...One of the most enjoyable plays, revival or original, of the season.\"\n\nRead more",
