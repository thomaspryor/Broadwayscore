  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Thank heaven for Kevin Kline! His performance in the revival of Noel Coward’s 'Present Laughter' is worth studying over and over again...Kline, Kate Burton as Liz, Kristine Nielsen as Monica and the rest of the cast excel in carrying it off. It’s high comedy, it’s farce, but it must seem natural. Timing is everything, but it must not seem forced...Kevin Kline is the best Essendine that I’ve seen. I would gladly see this production again and again.\"\n\nRead more",
