  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Kline is hilarious with incisive timing and, at the same time, poignant and on target portraying Essendine's uneasiness as a fading public star in constant battle with his private reality...As the cherry on the top, Kline has an engrossing cast, all confidently kept in line by director Moritz von Stuelpnagel...Kline's skill, style, and sophistication does justice to Noel Coward's 1939 English comedy of warmth and desperation...'Present Laughter' is the pièce de résistance this theater season.\"\n\nRead more",
