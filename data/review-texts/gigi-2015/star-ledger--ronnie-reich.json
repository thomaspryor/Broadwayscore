  "bwwExcerpt": "The musical, based on a 1944 novel by Colette, is not Lerner and Loewe's best. But it's lovingly updated in a new Broadway incarnation directed by Eric Schaeffer, with magnificent visuals of Belle Époque Paris, arresting choreography and, yes, a charming performance by leading lady Vanessa Hudgens. Hudgens...makes a commendable Broadway debut as a young woman in the throes of adolescent gawkiness, long limbs flailing as she imitates poses of womanhood...Victoria Clark is in lovely voice and emanates warmth and kindness in the role...Hudgens...deserves credit for pulling off a role that must nearly carry the show...Hudgens gives a generous, if not always naturalistic, performance as she transitions from an irrepressible tomboy to an elegant woman in love. Although her acting occasionally suffers from over-enunciation, she sings well and impressively keeps pace with the show's dancers...She has a fitting match in Cott, who has a lovely light tenor and willingness to go all-out goofy in the song 'Gigi,' where his blinders finally come off.",
