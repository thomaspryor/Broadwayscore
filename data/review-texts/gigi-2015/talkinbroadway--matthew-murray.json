The 'but' structure indicates the negatives outweigh the positives, placing it in lower mixed range. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges visual appeal and a strong lead performance but criticizes the show as 'dramatically inert and musically disappointing,' indicating a negative overall assessment. | Gemini: The review praises the visuals and Hudgens' performance, but criticizes the drama and music, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The review balances significant praise for production values and Hudgens' performance against fundamental criticisms of the drama and music, offering no clear recommendation either way.",
