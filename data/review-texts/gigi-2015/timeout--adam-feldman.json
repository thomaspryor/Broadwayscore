The review states that the show feels more like a concert than a musical, indicating a mixed opinion. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges improvements from the tryout but delivers a fundamental criticism that the production lacks the narrative and dramatic structure of a fully realized musical, instead feeling like a concert. The provided rating of 60 aligns with a mixed assessment indicating significant reservations.",
