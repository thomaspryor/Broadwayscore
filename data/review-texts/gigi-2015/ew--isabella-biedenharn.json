  "bwwExcerpt": "Thanks to a revised book by Call The Midwife's Heidi Thomas, this modernized Gigi comes bearing extra sass. Instead of feeling distressed when Gaston insults her new gown ('That collar is ridiculous! It makes you look like a giraffe with a goiter'), this Gigi snaps back at his every insult ('The door's over there. And don't forget your chocolates. I won't be able to swallow them because of this terrible goiter', she quips), and then bids him adieu with all but a kick in the head. Every moment Hudgens isn't onstage, you long for her return-not only for her dramatic talents, but also because she wears Catherine Zuber's beautiful costumes so breathtakingly well.",
