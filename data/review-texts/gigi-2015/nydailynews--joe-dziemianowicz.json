  "bwwExcerpt": "The Eiffel Tower looms in the distance in 'Gigi,' a reminder that we're in Paris. It's easy to forget that because Vanessa Hudgens plays the title role of a 1900 French could-be courtesan like an all-American Gidget. The perky but ooh-la-la-less Broadway debut by Hudgens, a sufficient singer and actress known for 'High School Musical,' is par for the course in a shrill revival directed by Eric Schaeffer...Under Schaeffer's guidance, performances are all over the place. As the rich 'sugar prince' Gaston, who falls for Gigi, Corey Cott makes the most of the title song. But he's boyish and saccharine when he should be debonair and sexy. Howard McGillin's take on Honore is broader than the Champs-Elysees. Tony winner Victoria Clark adds grace notes as Gigi's compassionate Mamita. Dee Hoty is saucy and steely Aunt Alicia, who instructs Gigi to accept only the most special and sparkly jewels from men...As musical gems go, 'Gigi' is not Tiffany -- it's Jared.",
