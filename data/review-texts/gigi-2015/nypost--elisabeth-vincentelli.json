  "bwwExcerpt": "Happily, the Broadway 'revisal' that just opened -- headlined by 'High School Musical' star Vanessa Hudgens -- does a fine job retooling the plot so it's more in line with modern ideas about women and romance...Heidi Thomas' retooled book isn't quite a feminist call to girl power, but at least her Gigi's making deliberate choices considering the limited options available to women back then. And while her trebly voice has limited range, Hudgens is comfortable onstage and gives the character a playful assurance...she has a warm rapport with Clark and Hoty, and you want to see Gigi with them rather with puppyish Gaston and his suave uncle, Honoré (Howard McGillin). Director Eric Schaeffer ('Follies') has given the story an elegant casing...This honorable 'Gigi' may be a good pick if you can't get into 'Wicked' on Take Your Daughter to the Theater Day.",

This falls into the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The critic gives equal weight to positive ('gorgeous') and negative ('mess') assessments, explicitly emphasizing both aspects, indicating a balanced, mixed reception rather than a clear recommendation or rejection.",
