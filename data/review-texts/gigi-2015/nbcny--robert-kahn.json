  "bwwExcerpt": "Vanessa Hudgens brings verve and vivacity to a reimagined version of the classic musical 'Gigi'...There is, as you might anticipate, an element of Eliza Doolittle in Hudgens's endearing performance -- she makes these grand, oversized gestures while gamely learning how to pour coffee or even settle into a chair the proper way...Cott has a stunning voice, on display noticeably in solos and ensembles pieces such as the first act closer 'The Night They Invented Champagne.' He and Hudgens are sweet together, and seem to share a genuine rapport. Hudgens may have the drawing power, but Clark is crafting a performance that will linger after the curtain falls...Clark...hits every note perfectly...Clark imbues Mamita with a sweet sadness that keeps you rooting for her...As Honore Lachaille, McGillin does a fine job of being both good-natured and rakish...'Gigi' boasts classic orchestrations, Catherine Zuber's gorgeous costumes and appealing dance numbers. It's a delightful production.",
