  "bwwExcerpt": "There is one performer who creates a small center of warmth and feeling, the wonderful Victoria Clark, as Gigi's loving grandmother. When she and Hoty join for a duet on 'Little Girls,' the two theater veterans give us a glimpse of the pleasure musical theater can provide. (The song belonged in the film to Honore, but having an elderly man sing a paean to pre-adolescent females obviously no longer seemed advisable.) Clark, who has a lovely voice, also created a special moment with her solo on 'Say A Prayer.' Otherwise, 'Gigi' is the night the Champagne went flat.",
