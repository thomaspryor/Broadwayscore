However, the text is very brief and lacks further context or evaluation, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review praises the direction and design, indicating a positive experience. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the director and design using words like 'ravishing' and 'sumptuous,' indicating a clear recommendation, though the brevity of the text limits confidence and prevents a Rave classification.",
