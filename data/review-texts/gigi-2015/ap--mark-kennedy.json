  "bwwExcerpt": "...in order to save the score, the creators of a new 'Gigi'...have done a gut renovation on the book by Colette. They've taken out the creepy factor, but they've taken out the zing, too. 'High School Musical' star Vanessa Hudgens does pretty well in her Broadway debut, handling her singing duties admirably...She's game for a cartwheel or sprinting across the stage, but she might want to lose the strange accent since no one else is doing it. She's surrounded by good actors, too, including a head-turning performance by Corey Cott, who proves a terrific actor and singer in a frothy show, as well as the always-wonderful Victoria Clark and a gloriously catty Dee Hoty. Direction by Eric Schaeffer is crisp...and choreography by Joshua Bergasse is excellent...Derek McLane's set of sweeping, iron-lattice stairs and lots of parasols is beautiful, and Catherine Zuber's gowns and foppish suits are very becoming. All the parts are good. They just, maddeningly, don't add for a stunning show.",
