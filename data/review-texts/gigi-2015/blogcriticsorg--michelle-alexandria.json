  "bwwExcerpt": "I'll admit it, I love the Disney Channel and recently discovered the High School Musical franchise (I never claimed to be a trendsetter). I was curious to see what VHud would do with this classic part. I came away both impressed and a bit underwhelmed at the same time. In many ways she's almost too perfect a choice to play the bubbly Gigi.

Praises VHud's first-half performance but notes issues with the adult transition. Text appears cut off mid-sentence, limiting confidence. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses mixed feelings, being impressed by Vanessa Hudgens' performance in the first half but underwhelmed by the transition to adult Gigi. The excerpt suggests a balanced view without a clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses mixed feelings, praising the actress's performance in the first half but noting a less successful transition. Due to the truncated nature of the text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic explicitly describes mixed feelings, praising the first half as 'fabulous' but expressing disappointment in the transition to the second half (text cuts off mid-criticism). The balanced praise and criticism place this in the Mixed bucket, with low confidence due to single-excerpt truncation.",
