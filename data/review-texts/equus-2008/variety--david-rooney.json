    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise for Radcliffe's performance but identifies a significant shortcoming in lacking the essential 'primal ferocity' the role requires. This suggests mixed feelings about a key element of the production. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a balanced view, praising Radcliffe's vulnerability but noting a lack of 'primal ferocity'. The single excerpt and lack of full context suggest a mixed review with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges Radcliffe's vulnerability but notes a lack of primal ferocity, suggesting a mixed assessment of his performance and, potentially, the production as a whole. Given the single excerpt and lack of overall verdict, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise for Radcliffe's vulnerability but emphasizes a significant deficiency in intensity, representing a lukewarm but still favorable assessment typical of a lower-end positive review.",
