    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises Radcliffe's performance as 'compelling' but provides no broader assessment of the production. Given the excerpt warning and limited scope, scoring conservatively in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Radcliffe's performance as 'compelling', suggesting a positive view of his role in the production. However, the single excerpt and lack of broader context limit confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Daniel Radcliffe's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the show, but it's a single excerpt, so confidence is low. I am assuming the review is generally positive based on this quote. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clearly positive praise ('compelling') for the lead performance in this Broadway revival. As a single curated excerpt, per instructions it warrants the upper end of the Positive bucket (80-84) with low confidence due to limited context.",
