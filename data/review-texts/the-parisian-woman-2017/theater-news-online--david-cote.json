  "showScoreExcerpt": "“A thudding disappointment...Wooden, plodding and insular...Some dialogue comes across as stagy and canned...Thurman’s bland, stilted delivery does not help...The more time you spend with the characters, the less you feel you know them or care about what they want...MacKinnon’s tight production offers lots of eye candy to relieve the boredom of the dialogue...One of the best-looking and -sounding straight plays on Broadway this fall. It’s just not that clever or insightful.”\n\nRead more",
