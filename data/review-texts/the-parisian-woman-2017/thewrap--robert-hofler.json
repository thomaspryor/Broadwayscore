  "bwwExcerpt": "It's not that Thurman doesn't know what to do with her hands, in the awkward manner of some film actors who ill-advisedly act on stage. It's that her gestures seem to be completely programmed. She's a little less calculated with her head tilts and line readings, but the effort shows. And that's the last thing a play about political manipulation needs.",
