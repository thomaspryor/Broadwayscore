  "bwwExcerpt": "An uber-modern update to Henry Becque's 1885 play La Parisienne, The Parisian Woman was originally written in 2013; after the 2016 election, Willimon felt the need to rejigger the script to make it better reflect the times. He made what he's called 'substantial revisions.' But since this is a play that centralizes character and milieu more than it does story, its themes might have been better emphasized were they not suffused with Trump and his aura. After all, DC has always been a minefield of questionable morals and ulterior motives.",
