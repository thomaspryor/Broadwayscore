  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The play and its production patronizes its audience...The humor in the show occurs whenever there is a reference to Trump. But these are not richly satirical lines...Not the sort of rich humor or insightful observations that make a political drama worth attention...We expect a Broadway political drama to provide some insight, some viewpoint...There is none of that in the 'The Parisian Woman's 90 minutes – full of very broad strokes of plot and stereotypical characterizations.”\n\nRead more",
