Call it 'Dangerless Liaisons'...Things we need to know are posted baldly in dialogue like a weird Tinder profile. But then nothing in this play — not one line or ginned-up plot turn — feels real. That some of the cast members nevertheless do feel real is a tribute to the great mystery of stage performance.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Harsh criticism of the writing ('cozy cliché', 'banal', 'Dangerless Liaisons') and plot construction, with only qualified praise for some cast members. The truncated nature and single excerpt warning prevent a lower score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the play for being clichéd and lacking realism, with setups and payoffs described as banal. While some cast members are praised, the overall tone is negative. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of the Negative range. | Gemini: The review excerpt is largely negative, describing the play as full of clichés, unlikely setups, and banal payoffs. While it acknowledges the cast's performance, the overall assessment is unfavorable. | Kimi: The critic condemns the writing as clichéd and unrealistic ('Dangerless Liaisons'), criticizing the plot as 'banal' and dialogue as artificial, with only faint praise for the cast's ability to rise above the material.",
