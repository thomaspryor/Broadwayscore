Call it 'Dangerless Liaisons'...Things we need to know are posted baldly in dialogue like a weird Tinder profile. But then nothing in this play — not one line or ginned-up plot turn — feels real. That some of the cast members nevertheless do feel real is a tribute to the great mystery of stage performance.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic systematically dismantles the play calling it clichéd, banal, and completely inauthentic. While praising some cast members, the overall assessment is clearly negative with phrases like 'Dangerless Liaisons' and fundamental criticism of the writing. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the play for being cliché and lacking realism, with only some cast members feeling genuine. The tone is negative overall, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"unlikely\", \"banal\", and \"nothing feels real\". The reviewer also criticizes the dialogue and plot. The positive comment about the cast is not enough to outweigh the negative assessment of the play itself. | Kimi: The critic comprehensively criticizes the plotting as clichéd and banal, declaring that nothing feels real, while offering only faint praise for the cast's performances. With only a single excerpt available, the full context is unclear.",
