  "bwwExcerpt": "That's as much a fault of the too-pat writing as it is the rather actorly performances. Marton Csokas, as Chloe's lover Peter, is saddled with a fake British accent that makes him sound like he's speaking with a mouth full of marbles. But his character also has the neatest observation on the political expediencies of the day, as a Trump-supporting operative who has the ear of the president but still says: 'Presidents are assets. They exist to be bought, sold, and managed.'",
