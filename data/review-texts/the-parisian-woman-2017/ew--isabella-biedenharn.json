  "bwwExcerpt": "Between the president's incessant, exclamatory tweets and a never-ending news cycle covering the White House's hirings and firings, it's nearly impossible not to be plugged into what's happening in Washington these days. It's a time ripe for analysis, not simple observation. So you'd think The Parisian Woman, a new play from House of Cards creator Beau Willimon (who also penned the 2008 drama Farragut North) would provide a sharp, fresh perspective on these strange, unprecedented times. Unfortunately, Willimon brings none of his shrewd insight into the political machine to the stage here.",
