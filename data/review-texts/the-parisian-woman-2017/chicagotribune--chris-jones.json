  "bwwExcerpt": "Thurman flails around the stage, as if she does not know what to do. Soo mostly retreats within herself, connecting with no one. Lucas and Csokas have some spark, and Csokas even has a note of vulnerability, but these characters, as they play them, are absurd. Only Brown is any good, and her character is not central enough to allow anything to build. Even the jittery set from Derek McLane is a mishmash of tradition and technology; it looks as lost and as desexualized as the actors.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A stunningly smug, utterly incredible and wholly inept political satire...All of the nuance, sophistication and intellectual complexity of a presidential tweet...One of the fundamental problems of this terrible show is that you never for a moment believe that anyone involved here really knows how the people they are lampooning actually function...But you can’t blame Trump (or Willimon) for some of the incomprehensibly terrible acting on view.\"\n\nRead more"
