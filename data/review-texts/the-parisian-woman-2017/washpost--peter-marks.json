  "bwwExcerpt": "Thurman makes her Broadway debut at the Hudson Theatre, and so does Willimon, the playwright who hit it big with 'House of Cards,' his juicy and now - thanks to the allegations against Kevin Spacey - canceled Netflix remake of the diabolical British series of the same title. Neither 'Parisian's' star nor writer experience their finest hour with 'The Parisian Woman,' which had its official opening Thursday night and which, despite its plot of multiple infidelities and embittering betrayals, feels as if it has had the life sucked out of it. Not only is the Washington of Willimon's imagination here a place of tawdry political prostitution, but it's also a pretty dull den of iniquity to boot",
