    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Brief excerpt acknowledges Thurman's star power but criticizes the production as lacking theatrical urgency. Too short to confidently assess full critical verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges Uma Thurman's presence but criticizes the production for lacking urgency, suggesting it is more style than substance. This indicates a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges Thurman's presence but ultimately finds the production lacking urgency, suggesting a mixed or lukewarm reception. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges Thurman's star power as a positive element, but the 'but' pivot emphasizes that the production itself lacks theatrical substance, comparing it unfavorably to an 'elegant costume party' rather than 'urgent theater.' Without a clear recommendation and with the brief length suggesting this may be an excerpt, the assessment falls in the mixed range.",
