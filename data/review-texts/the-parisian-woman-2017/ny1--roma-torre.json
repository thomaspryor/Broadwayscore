  "bwwExcerpt": "The entire production has an under-developed quality, even Thurman's Chloe seems half-baked. It's almost as if this is a show pilot that needs subsequent episodes to flesh it all out. It's easy to be cynical about Washington politics. The hard part is making it compelling. 'House of Cards' did it in spades with a stable of irresistible villains. Unfortunately, 'The Parisian Woman' is neither villainous nor irresistible enough to make us care one way or the other.",
