However, the tone is not extremely harsh, placing it in the Negative range. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the production feels like a 'museum piece' rather than a 'living work of theater,' indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging the production's elegance, the critic finds it static and failing to achieve the vitality of living theater, offering a measured but clear negative assessment.",
