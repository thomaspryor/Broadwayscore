  "bwwExcerpt": "So, to answer the question of why this show seems so small: Kong isn't the only mechanical creature on the Broadway Theatre stage. The entire enterprise reeks of condescension, underestimating an audience's intelligence. King Kong is destined to join Cirque du Soleil's Paramour and Sony Pictures Entertainment's Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark on the scrap-heap of recent Broadway megaflops in which OMG effects were given priority over people. Bad idea.",
