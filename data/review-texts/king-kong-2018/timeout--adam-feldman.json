    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic explicitly states the show 'doesn't quite work' despite acknowledging its ambitions and achievements. This is classic mixed review language - praising elements while expressing overall reservations. The 60 rating confirms this mixed assessment. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the ambition and achievement of the show, particularly the puppet, but ultimately concludes that the show 'doesn't quite work'. The original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's ambition and achievements, but ultimately states that it 'doesn't quite work,' placing it in the Mixed bucket. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with this assessment. | Kimi: The review praises the magnificent puppet and ambition but concludes the musical doesn't work overall, consistent with the critic's 60/100 rating.",
