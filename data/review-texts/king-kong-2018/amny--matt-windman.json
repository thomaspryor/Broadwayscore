  "bwwExcerpt": "Following many twists and turns and creative team changes since it premiered in Melbourne in 2013, a $35 million stage musical adaptation of 'King Kong' (showcasing a 2,000-pound, 20-foot animatronic puppet of a silverback gorilla, which is operated by onstage puppeteers and computer technicians) is finally roaring on Broadway - and it is just as technically innovative and absolutely ridiculous as you would expect a stage musical adaptation of 'King Kong' to be.",
