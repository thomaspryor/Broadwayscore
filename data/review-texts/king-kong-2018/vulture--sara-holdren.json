  "bwwExcerpt": "Not that the show is willfully shallow. In fact, in a brochure handed to me outside the theater by the show's press representatives, one of Kong's lead producers, Carmen Pavlovic, writes about the resonances she found in the story while developing the production over the last ten years. She talks about the global recession, Harvey Weinstein, the environmental crisis, and xenophobia in both Australia and America. Brett Kavanaugh gets a mention. So do the immigrant children forcibly separated from their families. King Kong, it would seem, is about everything. But what stands out from Pavlovic's essay are its title - 'Why King Kong?' - and the sole pull quote. 'Could he achieve a chest-beat without punching a hole through his own sternum?' it reads. 'Could he pick up a girl and run with her?'",
