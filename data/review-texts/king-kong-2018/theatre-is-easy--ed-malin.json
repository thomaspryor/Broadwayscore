  "showScoreExcerpt": "“An engrossing story about authentic relationships and a Broadway spectacle with impressive special effects...This ‘King Kong’ adds some interesting tweaks, ones that are empowering to Ann. And the special effects are breathtaking...This version has less cultural baggage...There are no ‘savage’ tribes nor is there the implicit racism in the Kong-Ann dynamic...A big step forward for empathy, for women’s empowerment, and for technical accomplishments in puppetry.”\n\nRead more",
