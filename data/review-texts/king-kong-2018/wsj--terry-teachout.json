  "bwwExcerpt": "It's hard to know where to start pitching the tomatoes. The score and songs, jointly concocted by Marius de Vries and Eddie Perfect, are loud and vapid ('And years from now / The world will know / Your grace showed me the way to go'). Jack Thorne's book is stupefyingly banal ('Strong as I am, strong as you've made me, I can't hold you'). Together they add up to a show that made me feel as though I were fighting off an overwhelmingly powerful anesthetic. A true professional, Ms. Pitts manages to speak and sing her fatuous lines with a straight face. Lucky gorilla: All he has to do is growl.",
