  "bwwExcerpt": "The big ape deserves a Tony. He's not only the star of 'King Kong,' which opened Thursday at the Broadway Theatre. He's also a damned good actor, too - one who shows a wide range of emotion while running through the jungle, fighting off a giant serpent, being gassed by crass capitalists or climbing up the Empire State Building. That he's a puppet only makes his performance all the more riveting. But he/it has an advantage over the human actors on stage. Kong doesn't sing one song composed by Eddie Perfect or utter one word written by Jack Thorne.",
