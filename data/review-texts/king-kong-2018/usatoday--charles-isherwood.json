This is a positive but qualified endorsement. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the impressive puppet as a reason to see the show, indicating a positive recommendation based on this element, but lacks broader context about the entire production. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the show is \"worth seeing\" due to the puppet, placing it in the positive bucket. The recommendation is based on a single element, suggesting reservations. | Kimi: The critic explicitly recommends seeing the show based on the spectacular puppet, calling it a 'marvel,' though the qualification 'alone makes' suggests the recommendation is specific to this element rather than unqualified enthusiasm.",
