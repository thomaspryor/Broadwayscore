  "showScoreExcerpt": "“While the gorilla himself is fantastic, the musical is hardly razzle-dazzle. A giant of stagecraft and puppetry, ‘King Kong’ is the star in this spectacle...As a largely sung-through musical, ‘King Kong’ disappoints with colorless songs and repetitive dashes of hip-hop and athletic jitterbug...Pitts and Morris are capable, if not memorable in their sketchy roles...both fine singers.
