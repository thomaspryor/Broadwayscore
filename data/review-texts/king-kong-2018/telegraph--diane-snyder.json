  "bwwExcerpt": "Although his furrowed brow and expressive eyes register surprise and emotion, he's largely stationary during lengthy scenes when Ann is speaking or singing to him. It's only when designer Peter England's black-and-white projections roll by to simulate Kong scaling the Empire State Building or galloping with Ann in tow that the beast lives up to his promise. All said, he might feel more at home, and make a bigger fortune, in a Las Vegas spectacular.",
