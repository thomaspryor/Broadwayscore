    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Clear mixed verdict - acknowledges spectacle but criticizes it as theme park entertainment rather than proper theater. Neither recommends nor discourages. | GPT-4o: The review highlights spectacle but criticizes the show for lacking cohesion, likening it to a theme park ride, which indicates a negative assessment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges spectacular elements but ultimately compares the show to a theme park ride, suggesting a lack of theatrical cohesion. This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the spectacular production values but fundamentally criticizes the show for lacking theatrical cohesion, comparing it unfavorably to a theme park ride. The text is very brief, suggesting this may be an excerpt or capsule review.",
