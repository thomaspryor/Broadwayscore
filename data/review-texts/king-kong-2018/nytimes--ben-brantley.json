The contrast between technical achievement and emotional emptiness indicates disappointment rather than a complete pan. | GPT-4o: The review praises the technical aspects but criticizes the emotional impact, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges technical achievements but criticizes the lack of emotional depth, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic offers genuine praise for the technical achievement ('spectacular') but ultimately criticizes the show's lack of emotional core and imagination, resulting in a conflicted assessment that neither clearly recommends nor rejects the production.",
