  "bwwExcerpt": "Acting is basically beside the point, but, as guided, both leads give shrill, one-note performances. The creators are so intent on making Ann the opposite of Fay Wray's portrayal of a damsel in distress that she lacks the vulnerability that made the Ann-and-Kong love story click. Early on, as the ship departs New York Harbor, the scenery, stagecraft and video projections merge so beautifully, you think this show may lead to someplace special. Nope. 'King Kong' is less fun than a barrel of monkeys.",
