The overall tone is negative, indicating a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the puppet but ultimately states the musical never finds its footing, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: While praising the puppet as a 'marvel,' the critic describes the musical itself as a 'lumbering beast' that fails to find its footing, constituting a clear recommendation against seeing the show.",
