The 'but' construction emphasizes that technical prowess cannot save an otherwise weak show. | GPT-4o: The review praises the engineering of Kong but finds the rest of the production ordinary, leading to a negative overall assessment. | Gemini: The review praises the Kong puppet but criticizes everything else, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The reviewer praises the Kong puppet as a technical marvel but explicitly states that everything surrounding it is disappointingly ordinary, indicating the show is not worth seeing despite its spectacle.",
