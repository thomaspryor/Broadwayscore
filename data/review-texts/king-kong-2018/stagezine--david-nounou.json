  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Can’t act, can’t sing, and can’t dance...Not because they don’t have the capabilities; they just don’t have the material...Anyone who has seen the original...would have the intelligence to know there is no way to adapt this genre into a musical format for the stage...I give the show one star not because anything in it merited that high a score but for those soulful eyes of Kong himself. He is amazingly constructed and the best thing about the show...This show is his ultimate humiliation.”\n\nRead more",
