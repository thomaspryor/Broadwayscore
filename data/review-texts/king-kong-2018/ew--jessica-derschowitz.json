  "bwwExcerpt": "The new King Kong musical, which opens Thursday at the Broadway Theatre, has taken a long journey to get to New York - not unlike the creature at the center of its story. The show's lengthy development process spanned years and two different continents (its first stage run opened in Australia in 2013) and stretched into the 11th hour - a matinee was canceled last week so the production could make 'final adjustments.' (This incarnation has a book by Harry Potter and the Cursed Child author Jack Thorne and songs from composer Eddie Perfect.) Would it be too on-the-nose to call it a gargantuan gamble? When your title star is a massive marionette, maybe not.",
