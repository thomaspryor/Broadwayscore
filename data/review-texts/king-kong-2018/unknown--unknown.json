This represents consensus critical rejection. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt is strongly negative, describing the show as a 'car wreck of clichés' with a 'bad score' and 'sluggish' elements. The tone suggests a deep pan, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly negative, calling the show a \"car wreck of clichés\" and comparing it unfavorably to \"Margaritaville.\" The critic expresses disappointment and finds the story, music, and dancing to be filler. | Kimi: The single available excerpt contains strongly negative assessments from multiple critics ('car wreck of clichés,' 'bad score,' 'sluggish marionette,' 'filler'), indicating a pan, though confidence is low due to limited excerpt availability.",
