  "bwwExcerpt": "This revival of Tennessee Williams' \"The Glass Menagerie\" arrives on Broadway from Cambridge, Mass., with the excitement usually reserved for \"Breaking Bad\" and cronuts: It's genius! You need it! Well, not quite. This is a fine evening at the theater, not a divine revelation. The show is a good take on Williams' memory play, and Zachary Quinto and Cherry Jones offer interesting spins on familiar characters - even if Jones' execution doesn't match her concept of the role.",
