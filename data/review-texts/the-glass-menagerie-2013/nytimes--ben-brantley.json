That question radiates from John Tiffany’s stunning production of Tennessee Williams’s “Glass Menagerie,” which opened on Thursday night at the Booth Theater and promises to be the most revealing revival of a cornerstone classic for many a year to come.\n\nLewis Nichols’s 1945 review of the Tennessee Williams drama on Broadway.\n\nFollow @NYTimestheater for theater news and reviews from Broadway and beyond.\n\nCherry Jones, left, as a onetime Southern belle, and Zachary Quinto as her son, Tom, whose memory drives the play.\n\nMore than any interpretation I’ve seen of the 1944 drama that made Williams’s name, this “Menagerie” — which stars Cherry Jones and Zachary Quinto in career-defining performances — finds the brute force in a play often described, a bit condescendingly, as lyrical, wispy, elegiac. Yes, the tapered fingers of poetry shape “The Glass Menagerie.” But when these fingers curl into a fist — and they do so again and again in this production, before you quite realize it — be prepared to have the breath knocked out of you.\n\nYou’re already familiar with the feeling of that blow. It’s what everyone experiences when a sound or an image from the past suddenly looms larger than the present, and, whether happy or sad, is almost too hurtful to be borne. As Tom (Mr. Quinto), the work’s narrator, looking back on a shattering chapter in his family’s life, states simply, “This play is memory.”\n\nWilliams always insisted that memory was not only the subject of “Menagerie” but also its form. But I have never before seen a production that captures so completely or originally the idea of memory as this play’s driving dynamic, of recollection as a tyrannical, exorcism-proof ghost waiting to grab you by the ankle.\n\nYou could even call memory the protagonist here: It’s what causes Tom to stumble into the past and back into the story that he always hates to tell but has to. That stumble has been given physical reality, as a seemingly involuntary lurch. It — along with the heart-stoppingly staged moment in which a girl from long ago stakes her claim on Tom’s thoughts — occurs in the opening minutes of the production, one of many resonant choreographic details by Steven Hoggett, the show’s movement director. (Mr. Tiffany and Mr. Hoggett, collaborators on the Tony-winning “Once,” proved themselves masters of recapturing time in the Scottish drama “Black Watch.”)\n\nFrom that moment, no one is on terra firma — not Tom, not the family he summons in a vision of its last weeks together in the cramped St. Louis digs they share at the height of the Great Depression, and certainly not we, the theatergoers. The designer Bob Crowley, artfully aided by Natasha Katz (lighting), Clive Goodwin (sound) and Nico Muhly (music), has summoned into being a world that seems to float amid shadowy seas.\n\nPools of dark, viscous liquid separate the stage from the audience. The shabby St. Louis apartment inhabited by the Wingfields — Tom; his mother, Amanda (Ms. Jones); and his sister, Laura (Celia Keenan-Bolger) — is rendered in ways both skeletal and oddly specific. It’s a style that suggests how memory seldom paints a complete portrait of the places you have known, but focuses instead on objects of totemic significance, or if you will (Tom will), symbols. Memory turns us all into poets.\n\nDon’t think, though, that this is a world seen through softening, forgiving gauze. As Tom recalls his encounters with the mother and sister he loathes and loves with all his confused heart, they acquire a heightened brightness that scalds.\n\nWhen I first saw this production in February, at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., the play’s startling atmospherics were all in place, and the acting already so fine, that I presumed that revisiting “Menagerie” would be like calling on an old acquaintance. I hadn’t accounted for the ways in which deeply gifted stage artists can enrich their performances over time.\n\nThe conceptual core of their interpretations remains the same. But they have been honed to an emotional sharpness that kept me in tears through much of the first act. (By the devastating second act, I was beyond tears.) Ms. Jones, a two-time Tony winner, gave a wonderful performance in Cambridge. What she’s doing now, though, is one for the ages, an Amanda that may someday be spoken of with the awe that surrounds Laurette Taylor’s creation of the part nearly 70 years ago.\n\nBooth Theatre\n \n 222 W. 45th St.\n New York , NY 10036 Map &raquo;\n\nClosing\n February 23, 2014\n\nTicket Information\n $77-$137\n Telecharge: 1-800-432-7250 or 212-239-6200; http://www.telecharge.com\n Buy Tickets\n\nRarely was so much compressed into such simple elements.\n\nRoom for Debate asks, what should patients do when the latest medical recommendations divide the medical community?",
