  "bwwExcerpt": "If the pattern holds, and we get one Menagerie a decade, this will be a high point. I'm not sure what the two-thousand-teens did to earn this beautiful oubliette of a production (the aughts got Christian Slater in a leather jacket), but let's just say the next decade has its work cut out: This is a grand and true illusion, not just to be lauded and gawked at-though you will, and that's appropriate-but studied. Watch the hands. Be led and misled by them. Remember it differently this time.",
