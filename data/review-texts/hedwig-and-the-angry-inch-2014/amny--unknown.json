  "bwwExcerpt": "Whereas the original production was set around a dingy ballroom and used little scenery, the Broadway revival, directed by Michael Mayer ('Spring Awakening'), acknowledges that it is taking place in a Broadway theater in the present day...While no one can doubt Harris' fierce theatricality, strong voice and expert handling of the comedy aspects, his Hedwig has yet to come together as a fully-developed, vulnerable character. But given the role's extreme complexity and grueling physical demands, that's more than understandable. Chances are that his performance will improve as the run continues...But as it is, this remains a wildly enjoyable production of one of the most exciting and inventive rock musicals of all time.",
