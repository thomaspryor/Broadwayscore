  "bwwExcerpt": "Sometimes you wonder if there's anything Neil Patrick Harris can't do: He switches from 'How I Met Your Mother' to singing Sondheim on Broadway, directing a magic show to hosting any award ceremony you throw at him. And he makes it all look easy. Except, that is, Broadway's 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch,' in which he's working very hard -- and not just because he's onstage the entire show performing all of the songs. The strain we see is that of a show-tune guy trying on rock 'n' roll for size. That music's fury and danger don't come naturally to Harris, who fares a lot better in the show's more emotional scenes...Only when he finally clicks with the material -- as on the heartbreaking 'Wig in a Box,' about the process of becoming someone else -- is the show suddenly worth the effort he's poured into it.",
