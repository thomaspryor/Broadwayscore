Photograph: Joan Marcus This article is more than 11 years oldReviewHedwig and the Angry Inch review – Neil Patrick Harris wigs outThis article is more than 11 years oldBelasco theatre, New York\n\nThe Doogie Howser star dons kinky boots for a revival of the libidinous musical about an East German 'girly boy' rocker\n\n In pictures: Hedwig's journey from fringe hit to Broadway smashPlays based on philosophical symposia don't come louder, lewder or more gorgeously original than Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Inspired by a Socratic dialogue on the nature of love, this concert-style musical, with book by John Cameron Mitchell and music and lyrics by Stephen Trask, concerns Hedwig, a \"slip of a girly boy\" from East Germany who is brought to America as an army bride. Hedwig discovers a talent for songwriting and launches the career of a teen idol, who then rebuffs her. The Angry Inch is her surly Croatian band – as well as her sobriquet for the results of a botched sex-change operation.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother, Doogie Howser, MD) plays the title role in platform shoes, angry slashes of blush and a blonde wig so bewinged that it threatens to take flight. His boots and the show are much kinkier than anything else on Broadway. Alternating rock ballads and reminiscences, Hedwig searches for completion and a fully realised sense of self, exploring the path to becoming \"the internationally ignored song stylist barely standing before you\".\n\nWhen the play debuted downtown in 1998, with Mitchell in the starring role, it seemed a wholly singular creation. If you squinted, you could almost convince yourself that he really was that androgynous songstress. You won't make that mistake here. It's a bigger production, bathed in stadium lighting, somewhat lacking in intimacy.\n\nMitchell and Trask have slightly expanded the show to fit the Belasco theatre's larger stage. There are a series of jokes about a Hurt Locker musical, a flop whose set lurks in the background. Harris is probably a better singer than Mitchell, particularly in the upper range, but his performance, while technically strong, occasionally seems studied. Still, he clearly enjoys the mischief it all entails.\n\nIf deliberately provocative and libidinous, Hedwig packs a stronger emotional wallop than most Broadway musicals. Despite the blaring sound mix, a few songs, such as The Origin of Love, based on a speech of Aristophanes, Midnight Radio and Wicked Little Town, give you chills, aided by the harmonies of Lena Hall as Hedwig's husband, Yitzhak. What aural pleasure.\n\nSuch poignancy doesn't prevent Harris from gleefully thrusting his crotch into the faces of several delighted audience members. He also performs a spit-take that turns the first row into a splash zone and demonstrates a particular talent for fellating electric guitars. As mimed sex acts go, it's the Platonic ideal.\n\nUntil 17 August. Box office: 001 212 239 6200. Venue: Belasco theatre, New York.\n\nDid you catch this show – or any other recently?
