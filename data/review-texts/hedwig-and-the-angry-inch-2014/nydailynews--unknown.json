  "fullText": "ExpandNeil Patrick Harris as the title character in “Hedwig and the Angry Inch”\n\nTransformation is tricky, sometimes even painful. But Broadway's sensational \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" starring a kick-ass Neil Patrick Harris is a reminder that change doesn't have to hurt.\n\nJohn Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask's raucous pop-rock musical — a show with proudly ratty downtown roots and rabid fans — survives and thrives uptown.\n\nAllegories are elastic, after all. And, yes, this frisky, unapologetically raunchy fable of love, loss, fury and freedom is flashier on the Great White Way thanks to director Michael Mayer's gleaming production.\n\nIt's also less self-defeating. At the Jane Street Theatre in 1998, the smart lyrics and beautiful melodies were casualties of an eardrum-punishing volume. That soured me on \"Hedwig.\"\n\nAt the Belasco, the show throbs, and everything comes through loud but clear. The show fits its bigger and posher home like a glove — no, like snug black rubberized short-shorts Harris wears late in the show.\n\nLena Hall and Neil Patrick Harris in “Hedwig and the Angry Inch”\n\nFor the other hour and a half, the star best known for \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\" and \"How I Met Your Mother\" gets his androgyny on in bedazzled minis, gold platform boots and a Farrah Fawcett-on-steroids coif. Those get-ups are the uniform of his East German transgender title character, a sad-sack singer-songwriter forever searching for a soul mate and reeling from a botched sex-change, which gives the show its vividly anatomical and transgressive title.\n\nSo Hedwig tells us in an extended monologue written and updated for this run by Mitchell, who originated the role on stage and starred in the 2001 film. Hedwig's wild and woolly chatter snakes throughout the concert he's giving at the storied Belasco.\n\n\"Look at me! On Broadway! Or Broadway Adjacent. East of Broadway. E-Bra.\"\n\nWhatever it's called, it's a far cry from the crummy joints Hedwig usually plays — but he's only there because the actual tenant, \"Hurt Locker: The Musical,\" opened and closed on the same night (see sidebar).\n\nHarris is famous for TV work, but he's a true stage animal with \"Proof\" and \"Assassins\" on his resume. He also has a vibrant rapport with the audience from all that Tony-hosting duty.\n\nLean and mean NPH throws himself into the role and against the walls with reckless flip-your-wig and in-your-face abandonment. And he summons the wounded spirit and sense of yearning to which everyone can relate. That carries us along and makes us care for this odd character.\n\nPlaying backup are four fab musicians, plus Yitzhak (Lena Hall, a dazzling vocalist), a gender-bender with complicated ties to Hedwig. Highlights in Trask's touching and terrific score include the wistful \"Wicked Little Town\" and blistering \"Angry Inch.\"\n\nThe lovely gender-scrambling song \"The Origin of Love\" is accompanied by whimsical illustrations projected onto a sheer screen. Says Hedwig, \"I love a good scrim job.\"\n\nYou can take that throwaway joke a couple of ways, of course. And that's what \"Hedwig\" is all about — everything, and everyone, goes.",
