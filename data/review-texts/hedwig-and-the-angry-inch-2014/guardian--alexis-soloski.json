  "bwwExcerpt": "Plays based on philosophical symposia don't come louder, lewder or more gorgeously original than Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Inspired by a Socratic dialogue on the nature of love, this concert-style musical, with book by John Cameron Mitchell and music and lyrics by Stephen Trask, concerns Hedwig, a 'slip of a girly boy' from East Germany who is brought to America as an army bride. Hedwig discovers a talent for songwriting and launches the career of a teen idol, who then rebuffs her. The Angry Inch is her surly Croatian band - as well as her sobriquet for the results of a botched sex-change operation.",
