  "fullText": "A funny thing happened in the two decades since John Cameron Mitchell began developing the character of Hedwig, the ''internationally ignored'' East German transgender punk rocker. Trans went mainstream, and so did Hedwig and the Angry Inch. The surest sign: Mitchell and Stephen Trask's downtown-and-dirty musical is now squatting at Broadway's Belasco Theatre, with America's favorite gay next door Neil Patrick Harris donning a Farrah Fawcett wig, a denim miniskirt, fishnets, and five-inch heels seven shows a week.\n\nJust how edgy can Hedwig remain on the Great White Way? There is, after all, a bit of cognitive dissonance in a supposed outcast selling out a giant theater filled with fans screaming, ''I love you, Neil!'' While director Michael Mayer's tricked-out production abandons the show's seedy origins, there's still a satirical edge that reflects the more upscale venue. In an elaborate running joke, Hedwig performs on the leftover set of a six-hour musical version of The Hurt Locker that closed after a single preview. (Audiences are even handed Playbills for the faux show, which boasts a score by Metallica, a book by Tony Kushner, and Adele Dazeem's sister in the female lead.)\n\nPurists may balk at Harris' punk-lite vocals on Trask's infectiously rockin' score  he's less Iggy, more pop  and his threats to ''cut you, bitch'' come off with more of a wink than actual menace. But in a bravura performance, the actor proves the perfect instrument for Hedwig's transition into world-class superstardom. He's honed his showmanship on four Tony Awards gigs, of course. But he's looser here, and lewder, more spontaneous and quick on his pumps. A-",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite the D rating and some criticisms about losing edginess, the review praises Harris's 'bravura performance' and calls him 'the perfect instrument' for the role. The truncation warning suggests the positive verdict at the end may be incomplete, but the available text shows clear praise for the lead performance and production values. | GPT-4o: The review praises Neil Patrick Harris's performance and acknowledges the show's satirical edge, despite some reservations about the production's departure from its origins. The original rating of A- suggests a strong positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review is truncated, but the critic's grade of 'D' and the reservations about Harris' performance suggest a negative leaning. The praise for Harris' showmanship is not enough to outweigh the concerns about the show's edginess being lost on Broadway. | Kimi: While the review notes the production abandons the original's seedy origins and Harris's vocals are 'punk-lite,' the final verdict strongly praises his 'bravura' performance as the 'perfect instrument' for the role, culminating in an A- grade.",
