This suggests a positive recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review states \"the show works\" and describes the finale as \"rousing and healing,\" indicating a positive experience. However, the statement \"As musical theater, Tommy is limited\" suggests reservations, placing it in the Positive bucket rather than Rave.",
