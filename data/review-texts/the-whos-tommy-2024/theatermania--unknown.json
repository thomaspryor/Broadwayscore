However, scoring conservatively due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses strong enthusiasm for the production, describing it as an 'amazing journey' and indicating a desire to experience it again, which suggests a highly positive impression. | Gemini: The critic states they enjoyed the show from beginning to end and would see it again, indicating a positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt and lack of original rating make it difficult to assess the strength of the recommendation.",
