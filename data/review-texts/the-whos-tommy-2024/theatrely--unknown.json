    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic was 'bowled over' by the revival and describes it as 'electric,' indicating strong enthusiasm despite initial low expectations. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses surprise at being 'bowled over' by the production, highlighting the talent involved and describing it as an 'electric paean to rock immortality.' This suggests a strong, enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The reviewer states they were \"bowled over\" by the revival and calls it an \"electric paean,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring towards the middle of the positive range.",
