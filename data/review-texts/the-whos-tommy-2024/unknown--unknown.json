    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt with metaphorical language that could indicate either creative ambition or confusing execution. Insufficient context to determine if 'multiverse' is praise or criticism. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is vague and does not provide a clear positive or negative recommendation. The phrase suggests a unique or unconventional approach, which could be intriguing or confusing. Given the lack of clear evaluative content and the warning about the single excerpt, a middle-range mixed score is appropriate. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a lack of cohesion or focus, implying an uneven production. Without more context, it's difficult to determine a stronger positive or negative sentiment.",
