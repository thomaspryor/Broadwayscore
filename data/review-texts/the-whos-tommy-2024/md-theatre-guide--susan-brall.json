  "bwwExcerpt": ": This production of \"The Who's Tommy\" is loaded with talent. Christian Borle and Mandy Gonzalez who play Captain and Mrs. Walker-Tommy's parents-are award-winning Broadway performers. They deliver seamless performances. Both renown actors capture the famous hard rock sound of The Who. Borle's and Gonzalez's duet, \"I Believe My Own Eyes\" is quite compelling as they convincingly play the parent of a child, now a man, they cannot make well.",
