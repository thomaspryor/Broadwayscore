  "bwwExcerpt": "The term “rock opera” is amorphous, but perhaps no other show comes as near to defining it precisely as this one. Mr. Townshend’s songs are authentic rock dating from the heyday of one of the genre’s revered bands, not the watery pap that often passes for rock in contemporary musicals. And even the most outlandish plots of Verdi are no more sensationally dramatic than the story of “Tommy,” with its beleaguered but triumphant hero, its rogue’s gallery of foes and its frankly bizarre story.",
