Despite the single excerpt warning, the language used indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"thoroughly intoxicating\" and \"seismic jolt,\" indicating a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, the score is placed in the middle of the positive range.",
