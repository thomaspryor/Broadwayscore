  "fullText": "A new revival of the Pete Townshend musical based on his rock opera feels like it takes place in the multiverse NEW YORK — “The Who’s Tommy” is one weird show. In terms of head-spinning “whaaaaa?” moments, I would venture that, among mainstream musicals, it’s bested only by “Cats.” After all, it’s about a little boy who shuts out the world around him after a traumatic experience, somehow grows up into a pinball god and acquires legions of adoring followers in the process. Tragedy and catharsis expressed through often surreal tableaux and great rock songs — it’s a wild ride.",
  "bwwExcerpt": "Still, the songs, which are often bite-size, remain as distinctive as they’ve ever been (which is why “The Who’s Tommy” can also be effective in a semi-staged format, as evidenced by Josh Rhodes’s production at the Kennedy Center five years ago). The score was very theatrical for a chart-topping rock band in the late ’60s, but it’s also very rock by Broadway standards, even now.

The 'multiverse' comment could be positive (creative, imaginative) or negative (confusing, scattered), and the aggregator suggests positive but the text alone is insufficient. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a vague and potentially neutral statement about the production. Without more context, it's hard to determine the overall tone. The aggregator's 'Up' verdict suggests a positive lean, but the lack of a clear recommendation in the text results in a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The provided text is too short to determine a clear recommendation. The 'multiverse' comment could be positive or negative, so I'm placing it in the 'Mixed' bucket with low confidence.",
