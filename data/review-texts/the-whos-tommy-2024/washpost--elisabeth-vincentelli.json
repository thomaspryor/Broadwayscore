In terms of head-spinning “whaaaaa?” moments, I would venture that, among mainstream musicals, it’s bested only by “Cats.”\n\nAfter all, it’s about a little boy who shuts out the world around him after a traumatic experience, somehow grows up into a pinball god and acquires legions of adoring followers in the process. Tragedy and catharsis expressed through often surreal tableaux and great rock songs — it’s a wild ride.\n\n125 CommentsMost ReadOpinionMichael ShermerI’ve reported on UFO sightings for decades — and come to this conclusionJanuary 29, 2026Salvador RizzoDOJ misconduct complaint against D.C. federal judge dismissedEarlier todayOpinionEditorial BoardTrump’s tariffs can’t cover a bill this staggeringJanuary 26, 2026NewsletterFridaysBook ClubOur weekly selection of book reviews and recommendations from Book World editor Ron Charles.Sign up",

The 'multiverse' comment could be positive (creative, imaginative) or negative (confusing, scattered), and the aggregator suggests positive but the text alone is insufficient. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a vague and potentially neutral statement about the production. Without more context, it's hard to determine the overall tone. The aggregator's 'Up' verdict suggests a positive lean, but the lack of a clear recommendation in the text results in a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The provided text is too short to determine a clear recommendation. The 'multiverse' comment could be positive or negative, so I'm placing it in the 'Mixed' bucket with low confidence.",
