  "bwwExcerpt": "The Who’s hardcore fans may like these hard-charging spectacles the most in “Tommy.”  There are certainly some terrific stage effects. But  I appreciate the few quieter moments – maybe these reflect the spirituality that Townshend was aiming for — when Quinten Kusheba (who portrayed the ten-year-old Tommy on the night I attended) sings a piercingly clear rendition of “See me, hear me” without any of the rock noise.",
