  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessReview by  Elisabeth Vincentelli NEW YORK — “The Who’s Tommy” is one weird show. In terms of head-spinning “whaaaaa?” moments, I would venture that, among mainstream musicals, it’s bested only by “Cats.”\n\nAfter all, it’s about a little boy who shuts out the world around him after a traumatic experience, somehow grows up into a pinball god and acquires legions of adoring followers in the process. Tragedy and catharsis expressed through often surreal tableaux and great rock songs — it’s a wild ride.",
