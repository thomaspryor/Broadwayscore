  "fullText": "There are two kinds of people in this world: Those that love bone-shaking, ear-splitting spectacles, like fireworks and arena-sized heavy metal concerts, and those who want nothing more than to miss such events for a night on the couch with a good book and a cup of hot chocolate.\n\nOne such person had a seat in the orchestra during a Broadway performance of \"The Who's Tommy\" and said as much at the top of his lungs. \"I don't like this!\" the small child screamed during a rare lull in the overwhelming action. \"Get me out of here!\"",

  "bwwExcerpt": "There are standout performances. Mop-headed Ali Louis Bourzgui, who plays Tommy as a young adult, has stage presence and good pipes, and Alison Luff, playing Tommy’s mother, Mrs. Walker, brings real grit to her one solo, “Smash the Mirror.” Maybe if you’d missed the ’70s, when The Who’s exceptional album stirred the hearts of kids making enough noise to change the world, you wouldn’t care that this production of “Tommy” is basically for old people, and not for a new generation.",
