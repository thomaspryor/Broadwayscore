The phrase 'quaking revival' implies a powerful and impactful production, indicative of a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses a positive metaphor (\"espresso martini\") to describe the show, suggesting it's a refreshing and energetic experience compared to other musicals. Given the single excerpt and lack of further context, a score in the lower end of the positive range seems appropriate.",
