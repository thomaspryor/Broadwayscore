    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The 'espresso martini' metaphor clearly positions this as an energizing, exciting show compared to a boring season, indicating positive recommendation. However, with only one excerpt available, scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The critic uses vivid and enthusiastic language to describe the show as a standout experience, likening it to an 'espresso martini' in a 'chamomile-tea season', suggesting it is invigorating and exciting. Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone is strongly positive. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive reception, contrasting the show with less exciting musicals. The \"espresso martini\" metaphor implies an energetic and stimulating experience, indicating a recommendation, albeit with limited context.",
