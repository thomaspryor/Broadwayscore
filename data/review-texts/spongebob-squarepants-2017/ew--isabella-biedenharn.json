  "bwwExcerpt": "f that sounds like a lot... it is. A head-spinningly packed Act I spends far too long setting up these various threads, and keeping track of everything while taking in the wildly detailed and immersive set is quite a feat. Act II is much smoother, and features some of the show's highlights, like Squidward's gorgeous tap number (backed by a chorus line of anemones), and Sandy and SpongeBob's impressively gymnastic climb to the top of that volcano.",
