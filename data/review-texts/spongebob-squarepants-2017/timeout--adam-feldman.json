  "bwwExcerpt": "Are you ready? The splashy new Broadway musical SpongeBob SquarePants, whose arrival was greeted in some circles with sneers of anticipatory derision, turns out to be a joy. Like its irrepressible yellow hero, played by the peppy and limber-limbed Ethan Slater, the show is unabashedly committed to imagination and dorky enthusiasm. As SpongeBob and his squirrel friend, Sandy (Lilli Cooper), labor to save their undersea town-the cheekily named Bikini Bottom-from a local volcano, the wonders of Tina Landau's production pour from the stage in a ravishing stream of color and invention that sucks you into its merry, silly currents.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Clear enthusiastic language with 'triumph' and 'spectacular', praising both imagination and emotional impact. The 80/100 critic rating supports high positive scoring. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language like 'triumph' and 'genuinely moving and spectacular,' indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. The original rating of 80 aligns with a strong positive or rave classification. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"triumph\" and \"spectacular,\" indicating a very positive recommendation. Given the critic's rating of 80, this falls into the upper range of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The critic's provided rating of 80/100 places this review in the Positive bucket (70-84), while the excerpt's use of 'triumph' and 'spectacular' indicates strong praise for the production. Confidence is low due to the brevity of the provided text. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
