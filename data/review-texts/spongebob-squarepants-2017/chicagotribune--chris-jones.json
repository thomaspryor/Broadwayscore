  "bwwExcerpt": "It's a lot. You may have a headache. You may be encouraged in the view that kids cable franchises are best done in arenas with actors being forced to stick their heads inside animated costumes, if they are to be done at all. I think 'SpongeBob' deserved and got more, and this is a sincere endeavor to elevate his gestalt. Not every attempt at singularity works - familiar tropes in the storytelling sometimes rear up and squelch the freshness - but, in its best moments, it is very much its own thing. Proudly so.",
