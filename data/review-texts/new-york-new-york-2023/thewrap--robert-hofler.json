  "fullText": "The stage musical “New York, New York” is part travelogue of that city and part recreation of great scenes from “On the Town,” “Wonderful Town” and a slew of MGM movies from the early 1950s. It is also, at times, something far more significant.\n\n“New York, New York” indicts the musical entertainment business of the city for its discrimination against minorities and immigrants, the very artists who had already transformed the American sound even before World War II.",
