  "bwwExcerpt": "Even if Stroman’s never-ending choreography can occasionally feel exhausting, it’s almost impossible not to be delighted by much of her work, most notably, the inventive, tap-filled number “Wine and Peaches,” led by the wonderful Clyde Alves (as Jimmy’s boyhood friend Tommy Caggiano) and featuring some very nimble “construction workers.” Like the city it’s named after, “New York, New York” is full of promise and potential – neither of which is completely fulfilled.",
