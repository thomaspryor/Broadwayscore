    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Critic frames the show positively as 'gorgeously appointed' and validates its purpose on Broadway, though acknowledges it lacks depth. This is a qualified recommendation for what it is. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as a 'gorgeously appointed vacation,' suggesting it is visually appealing and enjoyable, though not deeply profound. This indicates a positive recommendation with some reservations about its depth. | Gemini: The review recommends the show as a pleasant escape, suggesting it's enjoyable despite lacking depth. This indicates a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: While acknowledging the show lacks depth ('vacation from profundity'), the critic frames this as a virtue rather than a flaw, praising the production values ('gorgeously appointed') and validating the show's place on Broadway.",
