    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Review acknowledges strong production values and musical moments but delivers a clear negative verdict comparing it to a tourist attraction rather than legitimate theater. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some positive aspects like production values and stirring numbers, but the overall verdict is negative, comparing the show to a tourist attraction rather than a complete theatrical experience. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like production values and musical numbers but ultimately concludes that the show feels more like a tourist attraction than a fully realized piece of theater, indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the critic praises the production values and some musical numbers, the final verdict dismisses the show as superficial tourist entertainment rather than substantive theater, constituting a recommendation against seeing it. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
