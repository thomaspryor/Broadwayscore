However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict is uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates disappointment with the show, suggesting it doesn't live up to its potential and is forgettable. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, but the available text leans negative. | Gemini: The quote indicates a negative sentiment, stating that the show is not memorable despite its potential. Given the single excerpt and negative tone, a negative score is appropriate. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the show as unmemorable despite its lengthy runtime and wasted potential, clearly indicating it does not merit the time investment, though the single excerpt limits confidence in the full verdict.",
