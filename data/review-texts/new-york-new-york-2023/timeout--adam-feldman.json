  "bwwExcerpt": "New York, New York is an affection project: a loving group tribute, with 40 producers above the title, to the 96-year-old Kander, one of Broadway’s most beloved creators. It’s an excuse for a big, old-fashioned dance on not-quite-finished materials.

The text acknowledges positive elements like energy and spectacle but highlights a significant issue with the show's distinctiveness. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like energy and spectacle, but also points out a significant flaw: the show's lack of a distinct voice. This places it firmly in the mixed category. | Kimi: The critic's own 60/100 rating places this firmly in the Mixed range, reflecting the balanced assessment that praises the production's spectacle while criticizing its lack of distinctiveness.",
