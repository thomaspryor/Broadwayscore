    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating directly places this in Mixed territory, acknowledging positives (energy, spectacle) but identifying a significant flaw (lacks distinct voice). | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review. The text acknowledges positive elements like energy and spectacle but highlights a significant issue with the show's distinctiveness. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like energy and spectacle, but also points out a significant flaw: the show's lack of a distinct voice. This places it firmly in the mixed category. | Kimi: The critic's own 60/100 rating places this firmly in the Mixed range, reflecting the balanced assessment that praises the production's spectacle while criticizing its lack of distinctiveness.",
