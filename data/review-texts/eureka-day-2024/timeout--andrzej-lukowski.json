  "nycTheatreExcerpt": ": \"Eureka Day was already timely when it made its local debut Off Broadway in 2019. It is even more so in this Manhattan Theatre Club revival, now that vaccine denier Robert F. Kennedy has been chosen to lead the Department of Health and Human Services in the next administration. It seems more important than ever to engage with this issue and to understand the views of those who disagree. Eureka Day is often very funny, but it also contributes valuably to that discourse. Even as it needles the left, it offers an invigorating shot in the arm.\"",

However, only one curated quote available makes full verdict uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's humor and its valuable contribution to discourse, indicating a positive recommendation. The single excerpt suggests a strong positive tone, warranting a score in the upper range of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review states the play is \"even more so\" timely and \"contributes valuably to that discourse,\" ending with \"it offers an invigorating shot in the arm.\" | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise, describing the show as 'very funny,' contributing 'valuably to discourse,' and delivering an 'invigorating shot in the arm,' though confidence is reduced due to the single excerpt limitation.",
