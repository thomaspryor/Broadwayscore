    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising performances as 'exceptional' suggests positive recommendation, but extremely limited text and 'Read more' truncation requires low confidence and conservative scoring within Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the acting ensemble and highlights Hecht's performance as impressive. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low, and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the acting ensemble, especially Hecht. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I placed it in the positive bucket and scored it towards the higher end. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strong positive evaluative language ('exceptional', 'particularly impressive') regarding the acting ensemble, indicating a clear recommendation, though the truncated nature and single-excerpt limitation prevent a higher confidence assessment.",
