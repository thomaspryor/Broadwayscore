    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls the play 'effective' which is positive, but 'blunt' suggests a qualified approach. Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds mildly positive so using lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as 'blunt yet effective,' indicating a positive view of its portrayal of power dynamics. However, the single excerpt and lack of a clear overall verdict lower confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the play as a \"blunt yet effective portrait,\" indicating a positive assessment. Given that it is a single excerpt, the confidence is low, and the score is placed at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic praises the production as an effective portrait that transcends standard issue-play conventions, offering clear endorsement despite the limited excerpt available.",
