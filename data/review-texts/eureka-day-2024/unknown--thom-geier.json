    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as 'well-crafted' with a 'satisfying' ending, indicating positive assessment, but limited text requires caution about overall verdict strength. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'well-crafted' with a 'satisfying' ending, indicating a positive assessment. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the upper range of Positive. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is positive, calling the show \"well-crafted\" and the ending \"satisfying.\" Given that it's the only evidence, the confidence is low, but the positive language warrants a score in the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise calling the show 'well-crafted' with a 'satisfying' conclusion, indicating a solid recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, it suggests clear positivity but warrants reduced confidence due to potential cherry-picking.",
