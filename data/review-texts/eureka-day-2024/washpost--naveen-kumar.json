    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a colorful description but lacks clear evaluative language indicating a strong recommendation or disapproval. The lack of context and single excerpt warning suggest a mixed or ambiguous sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt is short and somewhat ambiguous, but the phrase \"well-played emoji\" suggests a positive, albeit potentially ironic, assessment. Given the limited information, I'm placing it at the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The single excerpt provides limited but positive evaluation, praising the show as 'well-played' despite (or because of) its chaotic, profane irreverence. Scored at the lower end of Positive due to the brevity and ambiguity of the curated quote.",
