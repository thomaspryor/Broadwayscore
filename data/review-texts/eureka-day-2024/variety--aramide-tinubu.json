    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear praise with 'expertly captures' and 'delivering genuine laughs,' indicating a positive recommendation. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked positive language from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play for its timeliness, humor, and ability to capture human connection, indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"expertly captures\", \"genuine laughs\", and \"moments of human connection\", suggesting a positive review. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range but with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains clearly positive evaluative language ('expertly captures', 'genuine laughs'), warranting upper Positive range, though limited context necessitates low confidence.",
