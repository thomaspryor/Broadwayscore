    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive impression by describing the show as encapsulating recent years into an 'explosive joke', which implies a powerful and engaging experience. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single quote is positive, but it's difficult to gauge the overall sentiment of the review with only one sentence. I'm placing it in the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strong positive language ('explosive') to praise the show's timeliness and impact, suggesting an enthusiastic recommendation, though the single-quote limitation warrants caution.",
