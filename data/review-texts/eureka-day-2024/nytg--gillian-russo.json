    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt suggests positive character development and improving quality, but extremely limited text makes confidence low. Positioned at lower end of Positive range due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view on character development, indicating some depth and complexity. However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning necessitate a low confidence and a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The quote suggests a positive development in the characters, moving beyond simple caricatures, which indicates a positive aspect of the show. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Kimi: Single curated excerpt offers qualified praise for character depth, but limited context necessitates lower-end Positive score and low confidence.",
