    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clearly positive language ('hilarious', 'thought-provoking') suggests strong recommendation, but low confidence due to limited text and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as both 'hilarious' and 'thought-provoking,' indicating a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"hilarious\" and \"thought-provoking\" which indicates the critic enjoyed the show and found it to be a worthwhile experience. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the show's humor and timely relevance without any negative qualifiers, warranting a score in the upper Positive range despite the limited text available.",
