    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with positive language ('perfect reflection') but limited context. Given single excerpt warning and mild positive tone, scored at lower end of Positive range with low confidence due to insufficient text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as a 'perfect reflection' of contemporary issues, indicating a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low and the score is set at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, calling the play a 'perfect reflection.' Given that it's the only excerpt and could be cherry-picked, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence and a score on the lower end. | Kimi: The excerpt employs the superlative 'perfect' to praise the show's thematic execution, indicating strong approval, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full review's verdict.",
