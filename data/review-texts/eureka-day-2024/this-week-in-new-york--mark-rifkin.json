    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong superlative praise ('funniest play of the season') and positive metaphor ('striking gold') indicate enthusiastic recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as 'the funniest of the season' and 'striking gold again,' indicating strong praise. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt calls the play the 'funniest of the season' and states it is 'striking gold again,' indicating a strong positive recommendation. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous superlative praise, naming it the funniest play of the season and suggesting a major success. However, given this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's nuances, confidence is low.",
