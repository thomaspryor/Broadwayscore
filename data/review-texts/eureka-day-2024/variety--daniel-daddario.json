    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with qualified praise ('cleverly staged', 'earns enough goodwill') suggests positive but reserved recommendation. Low confidence due to incomplete text and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'cleverly staged' and 'earns enough goodwill', indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Due to the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, calling the show \"cleverly staged\" and saying it \"earns enough goodwill.\" Due to the limited text, confidence is low, and the score is in the lower half of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as 'cleverly staged' but offers qualified praise ('earns enough goodwill'), suggesting mild approval rather than enthusiasm. With only a single curated excerpt available, the full verdict may differ.",
