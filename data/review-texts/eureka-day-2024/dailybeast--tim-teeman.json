  "bwwExcerpt": "Eureka Day is extremely funny for sure, but in choosing to ridicule liberals’ overzealousness it also feels antiquated—its 2018 target a comparatively unthreatening sheep when viewed in light of what may soon come to the fore in the public arena in January. Will dramatists find a way to write just as waspishly and unsparingly about those new overlords?",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows critic finds the show funny but criticizes it as feeling outdated and politically irrelevant. Mixed signals with positive (funny) and negative (antiquated) elements, but no clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the humor of the show but criticizes its outdated target, suggesting a mixed reception. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the humor but also finds the target of the satire to be dated, resulting in a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
