    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance ('one of this year's most riveting performances') and acknowledgment of the show's intellectual impact. Single excerpt limits confidence, but positive language suggests solid recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Hecht's performance as 'riveting,' suggesting a positive view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a strong performance and its impact, suggesting a positive experience despite the limited context. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead actor's performance, calling it 'riveting' and essential to the production's impact, though it implies the script relied heavily on the performance.",
