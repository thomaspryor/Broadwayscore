  "nycTheatreExcerpt": ": \"Spector smartly avoids easy dunks as Eureka Day's fault lines become canyons, though nobody on the board wants to admit as much. No one is a villain here; if anything comes off poorly, it's reverence for conflict avoidance in the name of community. Every character gets to land a fair punch, or make a good point, as well as appear both risible and ridiculous. At Eureka Day, as in most places, most people are well-meaning, often deeply misguided, trying to make sense of what limited knowledge and life experience they have. Trauma scalds and morphs. And humor, at least in this remarkable new play, somehow transcends the third rail of parent debates.\""
