    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising cast performance suggests positive assessment, but extremely limited text makes overall verdict uncertain. Positioned at lower end of Positive range due to single-excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast's performance, indicating a positive view. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context suggest a cautious, low-confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt praises the cast's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. Given the limited information, a score on the lower end of the positive range is appropriate. | Kimi: Single available excerpt offers clear praise for the cast's performances using positive evaluative language ('authenticity,' 'honesty'), indicating a recommendation, though the limited context prevents a more definitive assessment.",
