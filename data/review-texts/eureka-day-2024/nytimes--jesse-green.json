  "bwwExcerpt": "*CRITIC'S PICK* That the intimate downtown version, directed by Adrienne Campbell-Holt, instead ended softly did not make the play less incisive. But Shapiro’s production has been majorly and satisfyingly scaled up for Broadway. The library is much bigger and brighter (sets by Todd Rosenthal, lights by Jen Schriever); the costumes (by Clint Ramos) telegraphic in their sociology and the bassoon-heavy interstitial music (by Rob Milburn and Michael Bodeen) almost cartoonishly apt. The cast, too, hits the sweet spot between broad and deep, with Irwin, a clown by training, especially good at fatuousness, and Hecht at steely ditziness. In a slightly underwritten role, Gray beautifully counters the others with sly wit.",

I couldn't quite get there, not when they are painted so broadly to ensure the laughs. To avoid its \"extremely problematic portrayal of Native Peoples\" and a \"host of Colonialist Issues,\" the school's production of \"Peter Pan,\" was reset in outer space. Reasonable ideas, ridiculous outcomes.",
