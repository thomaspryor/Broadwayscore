    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The metaphor suggests a show that is overly cautious and treacherous to navigate, implying significant problems. However, with only one curated excerpt available, the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a cautious and potentially unstable experience, indicating a mixed review. The lack of a clear positive or negative recommendation and the single excerpt warning lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt uses negative imagery (tiptoeing on eggshells, landmines) to describe the show, indicating a negative assessment. Given that this is the only excerpt, confidence is medium. | Kimi: The metaphorical excerpt describes the production as navigating dangerous, fragile territory with a 'polite tiptoe,' suggesting a tense but potentially overly cautious approach. Without the full review context, it's unclear whether this precariousness is praised as thrilling or criticized as timid, placing it in the mixed range.",
