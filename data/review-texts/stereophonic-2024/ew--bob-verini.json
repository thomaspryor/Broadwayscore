  "bwwExcerpt": "Playwright David Adjmi’s extensive resume has included an intimate portrait of Syrian Jews in Brooklyn (Stunning), a fanciful contempo take on Marie Antoinette, and 3C, a controversial sexed-up parody of the sitcom Three’s Company. Interesting work all around, but none of it prepares us for the hyperrealistic triumph that is Stereophonic, now at the Golden Theatre for a limited run after a similarly limited run at Playwrights Horizons.",

The use of 'triumph' suggests the show is a standout success, warranting a high score in the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The review uses the phrase \"hyperrealistic triumph\" which indicates a very positive assessment and a strong recommendation.",
