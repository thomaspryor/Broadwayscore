    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear praise for the playwright's authentic portrayal, but with only one cherry-picked quote available, the full review verdict remains uncertain. Scoring conservatively within positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's depiction of the Seventies' Rock & Roll scene, suggesting some positive elements. However, due to the lack of comprehensive context and the warning about the single excerpt, the overall sentiment remains unclear, leading to a conservative mixed classification. | Gemini: The single quote is positive, indicating a recommendation, but without more context, it's difficult to gauge the strength of the recommendation. I'm scoring it in the middle of the positive range due to the limited information.",
