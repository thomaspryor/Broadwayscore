  "fullText": "David Adjmi's drama about a band recording an album goes even deeper at the Golden.\n\nWho'd have thought the most musically satisfying production of the season would be a three-hour-and-15-minute play? That's David Adjmi's miraculous\n\nSet within the confines of a recording studio in the mid-’70s,\n\nHyper-realistic in its fly-on-the-wall examination of the art of making art, Adjmi is tracking the downfall of the group's two romantic couples at the same time. Vocalist and keyboard player Holly (Juliana Canfield) is at the end of her rope when it comes to her bassist husband, Reg (Will Brill), whose proclivities include chugging Jack Daniels and snorting enormous amounts of cocaine. Singer Diana (Sarah Pidgeon) is quickly becoming the breakout star, and her snide boyfriend — the band’s guitarist and album producer, Peter (Tom Pecinka) — seizes upon her insecurity to berate her in the name of love and success. Observing are stoic drummer Simon (Chris Stack), desperate to return to his wife and kids in the UK, and engineers Grover (Eli Gelb) and Charlie (Andrew R. Butler), who are facing their own pressure to not screw things up on the other side of the studio's soundproof partition.\n\nOut of nowhere, the unnamed band's year-old record becomes a chart-topper. Diana is thrust into the spotlight when her song explodes. Reg and Holly break up and get back together and break up again. Songs and riffs and licks are invented out of thin air. Columbia Records triples their budget. Nothing happens and everything happens, and it's riveting from start to finish, one of those shows that unassumingly lures you in and then socks you with a punch of emotion that leaves you on the edge of her seat.\n\nYes, it's still long (and a little ironic that one plot thread is about Diana refusing to cut some of her new song for timing), but the Broadway mounting — with the same company and creative team — feels tighter and faster than it did last fall. The transitions are quicker, the silences less demanding. The performances are so exquisitely rendered, so beautifully lived-in, that every moment is full, whether they're bickering, snorting coke, or simply knitting. Holly and Grover's discussion of Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland's explicit sex scene in the occult thriller\n\nEach actor has their own arc and showy bits. Butler's quirky diffusion of the tension in the room is made even wittier when he realizes that nobody remembers his name. Gelb's quiet intimidation quickly becomes a short-fused irritation that leads to a first-rate explosion. Stack is more present as the erstwhile voice of reason, and Brill is even zanier as he swings from the doorframe or collapses with exhaustion in the fetal position. Pecinka's Peter is such an extraordinarily awful person that you just hate him and his lavender pants (Enver Chakartash's perfect costumes are period without being Halloweeny). And Pidgeon, the heart of the group and the play, infuses Diana with palpable and genuine heartbreak as terror overtakes what should be the most thrilling time of her life.\n\nEven with their individual strengths, the seven actors still coalesce into a true ensemble, a testament to Aukin's sharp eye for detail. That level of realism extends to Ryan Rumery's sensationally convincing sound design, Jiyoun Chang's subtly shifting lighting, and, particularly David Zinn's set. With its wood-paneled walls, central mixing table, and analog tape decks, it looks like it could function as an actual recording studio. Their work is just remarkable.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.
