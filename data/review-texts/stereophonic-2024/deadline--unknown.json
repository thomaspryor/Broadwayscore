    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear enthusiasm with 'unerring direction', 'miraculous cast', and the unique positive metaphor about answering an unasked question. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning and potential for cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction and cast, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning suggest a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review praises the direction and cast, suggesting a positive experience. The single excerpt makes it difficult to gauge the overall enthusiasm, so a mid-range positive score is appropriate.",
