  "dtliExcerpt": "For three glorious hours, Stereophonic drops its audience into a unique agony: the pursuit of artistic perfection. David Adjimi’s astounding new work, itself near-perfect, captures the wondrous highs and excruciating lows of the creative process with a hilarious, painstaking precision. You’ll want to live in this play forever.",
