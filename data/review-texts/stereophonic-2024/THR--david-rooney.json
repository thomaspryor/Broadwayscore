But the similarities end there. Chronicling a turbulent year in California recording studios during which a fictional 1970s rock band labors over the follow-up to their breakthrough album, this is an immersive plunge into the fraught process of artistic collaboration as pressures mount and interpersonal harmony dissolves into acrimony. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-article-mid-article-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\",\"mid-article\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[300,250],[2,2],[300,251],[620,350],[2,4],[4,2],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Funny, raw and poignant in equal measure, this expertly sculpted play has the feel of both a behind-the- music docudrama and a lost Robert Altman film, with its astute microcosmic focus, its frequent wash of overlapping dialogue and its sly nudges toward satire. In fact, while the music — fabulous original songs written by Will Butler , formerly of Arcade Fire — is pop-rock rather than country, Stereophonic could almost be an expanded vignette lifted right out of Nashville .

Adjmi, whose previous plays include Stunning and 3C , shows an ear for great dialogue that's never been sharper. Directed by Daniel Aukin with a granular attention to nuance, the production comes to Broadway after drawing ecstatic reviews in a sold-out extended run late last year at Playwrights Horizons, the same Off Broadway mainstay that birthed The Flick . Rather than going the expected route and recasting with name talent for box office clout, the producers have made the shrewd decision to stick with the original actors, all but one of whom are making their Broadway debuts. There's not a weak link in the seven-member ensemble, five of whom also sing and play instruments. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article2-uid1' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid\",\"mid-article2\",\"mid-articleX\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article2\") .addSize([[300,250],[300,251],[620,350],[2,4],[4,2],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Adjmi has said that the idea came to him while on a flight listening to the Led Zeppelin cover of \"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\" and marveling at the tangle of jagged emotions Robert Plant pours into his vocals. From there, the playwright's imagination led him to the studio in which the track was being recorded, which hatched the idea of an entire play set in just such a space. Ingeniously designed by David Zinn — with the engineers at a massive mixing console in the downstage control room, bordered by hippie-chic d&eacute;cor, and the band fitfully laying down tracks in the glass-walled, soundproofed live room at the rear — the setting becomes a cauldron of clashing egos. The first three acts take place in a Sausalito studio, while the fourth and final act shifts to Los Angeles, after most of the central relationships have frayed perhaps beyond repair. Inevitably, the makeup of the band, whose name we never learn, will invite associations with Fleetwood Mac . The three British charter members, married couple Reg (Will Brill) and Holly (Juliana Canfield) on bass and keyboard/vocals, respectively, and big daddy Simon (Chris Stack) on drums, correspond to John and Christine McVie and Mick Fleetwood. Likewise, the American couple who joined some years later and helped push the group to mainstream success, vocalist Diana (Sarah Pidgeon) and lead guitarist/vocalist Peter (Tom Pecinka), are ringers for Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. Stereophonic also echoes the trajectory of Fleetwood Mac coming off their chart-topping self-titled 1975 album and tumbling into the messy experience of recording Rumours , as the relationships of both couples were breaking down and Fleetwood's wife, back in England, was divorcing him. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-thr-article-mid-articleX-uid2' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"btf\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\"] ) .setT...",
