    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single curated excerpt describes the show as 'truly a treat' which is positive language, but extremely limited text prevents full assessment of the critic's overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation of the show's auditory experience, suggesting it is enjoyable. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low, and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is clearly positive, praising the aural experience. Given the limited information, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers unambiguous praise ('truly a treat') for the production's audio design. While clearly positive, the limited excerpt warrants 'low' confidence and placement in the upper end of the Positive bucket per scoring guidelines for isolated quotes.",
