  "fullText": "OLE MISSMississippi Rebels FootballAdd TopicPros and cons of Baltimore Ravens signing Ole Miss football’s Dayton Wade as UDFA David EckertMississippi Clarion LedgerApril 27, 2024, 9:11 p.m. ETDayton Wade from Ole Miss football didn't hear his name called in the 2024 NFL Draft, but he'll get his shot in the pros after the Baltimore Ravens picked him up as an undrafted free agent (UDFA).\n\nHere's what Wade brings to the Ravens, based on our own observations from his tenure at Ole Miss:\n\nWade began his collegiate career at Western Kentucky, where he made just 22 receptions over three years while hampered by injury. He transferred to Ole Miss, originally as a walk-on, and immediately contributed to Lane Kiffin's offense. A starter, and on scholarship, in 2023, Wade finished seventh in the SEC in receiving yards with 830.\n\nHe has experience playing the slot with the Hilltoppers, but spent most of his time with the Rebels as an outside receiver, despite his 5-foot-10 frame. An electric personality, Wade makes the flashy plays to match. Most of the top highlights for Ole Miss last season belonged to him.\n\nThere are plenty of highlight-reel catches to choose from when it comes to Wade. The best of the bunch, though, came at Georgia in November. Fighting through what probably should have been called pass interference, Wade creates space for himself, leaps parallel to the ground and reaches out with one hand to reel in a pass from Spencer Sanders.\n\nThat's the kind of player Wade is. He makes space where there is none and avoids tackles that seem like sure things. A classic jitterbug of a receiver, Wade also has experience on special teams that could make him useful to an NFL organization.\n\nWade is a classic production-versus-profile conundrum. He produced in the SEC, the country's best conference. But he's undersized at 175 pounds. He didn't get a combine invite, and the numbers he produced at Ole Miss' Pro Day didn't compare well with his peers who did get a chance in Indianapolis.\n\nTwo years ago, nobody at Ole Miss would have thought they had a potential key contributor in Dayton Wade. So count him out at your own risk. That said, the size and the athletic profile don't lend themselves to being a starter in the NFL. If he can contribute on special teams and stick on the roster as a backup, that's a good outcome.\n\nDavid Eckert covers Ole Miss for the Clarion Ledger.
