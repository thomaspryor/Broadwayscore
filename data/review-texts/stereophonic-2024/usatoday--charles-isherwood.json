You should never flush unused medications down the toilet or drain.\n\nDrug collection sites do not accept herbal remedies, vitamins, supplements, medical devices, batteries, mercury-containing thermometers, sharps or illicit drugs.\n\nThese are the options for safe medication disposal prescription medications in Lane County:\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) holds a National Prescription Drug Take Back Day in April and October.\n\nDuring the 25th Drug Take Back Day in October, 2,995 pounds of unused medications were collected at 17 sites across Oregon, according to the DEA.\n\nThe first national event in 2024 will be held April 27. Pharmacy and police department staff will be on-site to assist in safe disposal of unused prescription medications at the following locations\n\nThese are year-round collection sites in Lane County. Some allow drop-off of unused medication. Others offer free mail-back services.\n\nVisit medtakebackoregon.org and enter your ZIP code for a full list of prescription drug collection sites, their location and hours. For more information or to order mail-back supples, call (844) 482-5322.\n\nThis is a partial list of collection sites in Lane County:\n\nSydney Wyatt covers healthcare inequities in the Mid-Willamette Valley.
