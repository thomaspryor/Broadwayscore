  "showScoreExcerpt": "âFocusing on an Anglo-American band whose sharp-elbowed members include two troubled couples, Stereophonic is unlikely to see Mick Fleetwood or Stevie Nicks in the audience, but, even for non-fans of the classic album Rumours, this account of internecine personal and creative struggles is hard to beatâ¦Across a luxurious three hours -- to be sure, the action never drags -- relationships crumble, friendships are betrayed, and nerve endings are given a thorough flaying...Stereophonic compels as a poignant character study and needle-sharp comedy.â",
