  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Sometimes, a song is so good you want to live in it. You want to nestle into its melodies, unravel the chords holding it up and more than anything, wander in the mind fields of the people who created it. David Adjmi's \"Stereophonic\" is the play that sparks this very desire.",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt expresses a strong desire to immerse oneself in the play, suggesting a positive experience. However, without the full review, it's difficult to gauge the extent of the recommendation, so I'm placing it in the lower end of the positive range.",
