However, the single excerpt and lack of full context lower confidence in the assessment. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the play has potential but ultimately falls short of being compelling or original. Given the limited text, a mixed score seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production as unoriginal and derivative ('been there, done that'), indicating it fails to achieve a compelling breakthrough, which aligns with a negative recommendation.",
