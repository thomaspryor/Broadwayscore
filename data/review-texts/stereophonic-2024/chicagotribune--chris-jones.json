NEW YORK — Just before the end of playwright David Adjmi’s masterful “Stereophonic,” a three-hour dissection of ego, insecurity and the messy, messed-up gorgeousness of the creative process, I decided I’d had enough of these beautiful people in the recording studio with their complaints, their cocaine, their obsessive-compulsive neuroses, their phenomenal talents. A Zen-like “Let it be” had twisted in my skull to “Let me out.” And then I realized that was precisely what Adjmi wanted everyone at the Golden Theatre to be feeling at the final curtain. He’d just explained why great bands break up; why famous geniuses who seemingly have all the gifts, money, autonomy, adulation and sex that anyone could possibly want just can’t hold it together; why having a Billboard hit does not stop the childhood-driven imposter syndrome ringing inside your brain but actually makes it louder. Heck, I’ll go even further: He’d just explained why things end. Period. What a brilliant piece of must-see Broadway.

Relentlessly so. “Stereophonic,” first seen at Playwrights Horizons, is about a famous British band making a studio album in California between the summers of 1976 and 1977. You never see their lives outside of the recording studio laid out before you on the stage, but you do hear them sing. The show clearly was influenced by Peter Jackson’s restored “The Beatles: Get Back,” a killer marathon documentary about the making of the album “Let it Be” in 1970 even as the band was battling for control and well outside the edenic strawberry fields.
