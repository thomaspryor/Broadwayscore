The use of 'electrifying' indicates a high level of excitement and engagement with the production. | Gemini: The review excerpt compares the play favorably to \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", indicating a positive assessment. However, with only one excerpt available, a more conservative score is appropriate.",
