    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong superlatives like 'remarkable achievement' and 'completely absorbing' indicate enthusiastic praise typical of Rave bucket. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong praise ('remarkable achievement', 'completely absorbing') suggesting a highly positive verdict. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, calling the show a \"remarkable achievement\" and \"completely absorbing.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains superlative praise ('remarkable achievement', 'completely absorbing'), but per guidelines for lone curated quotes, scores in upper Positive range rather than Rave due to cherry-picking risk. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
