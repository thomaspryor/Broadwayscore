  "fullText": "There's a moment in David Adjmi's play \"Stereophonic\" when a discordant, mid-'70s band-on-the rise hears one of its songs played back to them in the recording studio for the first time, with all its multiple tracks layered together into an artful whole.\n\nIt leaves the ever-bickering band suddenly speechless, emotionally stunned and still with the realization that they have just heard something truly great.",
