However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is medium. | Gemini: The excerpt compares the play favorably to a highly regarded work, suggesting a positive assessment. However, the 'arguably' and the mention of a long running time indicate potential reservations, placing it in the lower end of the Positive bucket.",
