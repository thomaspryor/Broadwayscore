Photo: Julieta Cervantes This review was originally published on April 19, 2024. At the 77th Tony Awards, Stereophonic won five awards, including Best Play.\n\nThe Act One climax of David Adjmi’s Stereophonic is one of the most exhilarating moments I’ve experienced in a theater in recent memory. We’re in a recording studio in Sausalito, California, evoked in gorgeous detail, down to the smallest dial, the scuzziest beanbag chair and crocheted throw. The year is 1976, and an unnamed band, hovering on the verge of serious fame, is recording an album. They’ve been at it for months. The air is clogged with cigarette smoke and marijuana smoke and tension as viscous as Marmite. The drummer, Simon (Chris Stack), does not want to use a click track, but it’s been 36 takes and he’s still dragging. Diana (Sarah Pidgeon) sings beautifully and has songwriting chops that get stronger by the day, but she’s fragile and defensive and feels constantly under attack from her lead-guitarist boyfriend, Peter (Tom Pecinka), who’s brilliant, creatively domineering … and also fragile and defensive and convinced that he’s constantly under attack from, well, everyone. The wry, aloof vocalist-keyboardist, Holly (Juliana Canfield), has, for the moment, reached a détente with her philosophizing, self-pitying, cocaine-and–Jack Daniels–fueled husband, the bassist, Reg (Will Brill), but hostilities could resume at any moment. The engineers, Grover (Eli Gelb) and Charlie (Andrew R. Butler), just want Simon to use the fucking click track so that they can get the fucking take and everyone can go the fuck to sleep.\n\nShow \n 13 Comments / 13 New\n \n Comment\n \n\n Stereophonic Moves to Broadway, and Thunder Happens\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n Your product is saved!
