  "dtliExcerpt": "“Just in Time” travels the familiar narrative road of an artist’s rise and fall, but immersive swank and charming personality set this bio-musical apart from even its most successful predecessors. (“Jersey Boys,” watch your tail.) Staged nightclub-style by director Alex Timbers — with seating on three sides plus cabaret two-tops down front — the production fizzes with class and delight like a coupe of champagne. That warm and heady feeling? It’s secondhand intoxication from the joy Groff radiates in his element.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Itâs another magnificent performance â kind-eyed, honey-voiced and all but irresistible.\"",
