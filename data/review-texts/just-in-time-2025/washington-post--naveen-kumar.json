  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessReview by  Naveen KumarNEW YORK — As star vehicles go, Jonathan Groff is currently seizing the wheel of a top-down Aston Martin. Following his Tony-winning turn in “Merrily We Roll Along,” a chronicle of songwriting success told in reverse, the actor is stepping back into the glamour and hustle of mid-century show business, cruising forward this time, as the chameleon crooner Bobby Darin. It’s another magnificent performance — kind-eyed, honey-voiced and all but irresistible.",

  "dtliExcerpt": "“Just in Time” travels the familiar narrative road of an artist’s rise and fall, but immersive swank and charming personality set this bio-musical apart from even its most successful predecessors. (“Jersey Boys,” watch your tail.) Staged nightclub-style by director Alex Timbers — with seating on three sides plus cabaret two-tops down front — the production fizzes with class and delight like a coupe of champagne. That warm and heady feeling? It’s secondhand intoxication from the joy Groff radiates in his element.",
