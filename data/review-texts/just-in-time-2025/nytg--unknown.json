  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "With an exuberant band, Just in Time rides easy on Groff's waves of showman charisma while paying tribute to the era-specific music and other singers, especially the women in Darin's life who inspired his performance, starting with Michele Pawk as a parental figure with a vaudevillian past. The book seamlessly weaves in how other stars like Connie Francis (a blazing, must-see Gracie Lawrence) and Sandra Dee (a commanding Erika Henningsen), the latter of whom witnessed his fallible humanity, were integral to his life.",

The phrase \"must-see Gracie Lawrence\" suggests a strong positive element, but the limited text makes it difficult to assess the overall recommendation definitively.",
