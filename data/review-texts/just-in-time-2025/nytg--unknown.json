  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "With an exuberant band, Just in Time rides easy on Groff's waves of showman charisma while paying tribute to the era-specific music and other singers, especially the women in Darin's life who inspired his performance, starting with Michele Pawk as a parental figure with a vaudevillian past. The book seamlessly weaves in how other stars like Connie Francis (a blazing, must-see Gracie Lawrence) and Sandra Dee (a commanding Erika Henningsen), the latter of whom witnessed his fallible humanity, were integral to his life.",

However, the single excerpt and lack of a definitive rating suggest a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review highlights positive aspects like Groff's charisma and the music, but the limited excerpt makes it difficult to gauge the overall recommendation strength. The phrase \"must-see Gracie Lawrence\" is about a specific performance, not the whole show.",
