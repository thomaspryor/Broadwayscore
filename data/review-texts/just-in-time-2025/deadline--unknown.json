  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Groff, assisted by a terrific trio of singer-dancers (Christine Cornish, Julia Grondin, Valeria Yamin) who back him up through the years and many, many fashions and dance styles, is tireless and captivating throughout the show. Long known for the copious amounts of spit and sweat he releases during a performance he jokingly acknowledges his \"wetness\" early in the show Groff embodies the give-it-all stage style embodied by Minnelli in her prime, and with Just In Time we watch as, song by song and dance by dance, a stage performer of the highest order blossoms.",

However, with only one curated excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range as this may not represent the full review's verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises Groff's performance as 'tireless and captivating' and compares him to Minnelli in her prime, suggesting a highly positive view of the production. The language used indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the positive aspects of the performance, particularly Groff's. While it doesn't explicitly recommend seeing the show, the praise suggests a positive overall experience, meriting a 'Positive' classification. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring conservatively.",
