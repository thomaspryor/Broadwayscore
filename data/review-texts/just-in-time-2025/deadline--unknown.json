  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Groff, assisted by a terrific trio of singer-dancers (Christine Cornish, Julia Grondin, Valeria Yamin) who back him up through the years and many, many fashions and dance styles, is tireless and captivating throughout the show. Long known for the copious amounts of spit and sweat he releases during a performance he jokingly acknowledges his \"wetness\" early in the show Groff embodies the give-it-all stage style embodied by Minnelli in her prime, and with Just In Time we watch as, song by song and dance by dance, a stage performer of the highest order blossoms.",
