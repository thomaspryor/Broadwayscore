Long known for the copious amounts of spit and sweat he releases during a performance  he jokingly acknowledges his \"wetness\" early in the show  Groff embodies the give-it-all stage style embodied by Minnelli in her prime, and with Just In Time we watch as, song by song and dance by dance, a stage performer of the highest order blossoms.",
