  "dtliExcerpt": "The audience is situated in a sumptuously imagined, sparkling silver nightclub with multiple stages and a brilliant band in back. Groff spiritedly darts around the room, jumping on tables and dancing with ticket-buyers like the consummate host. The actor, bursting with charisma, sweeps away the old radio static from Darin’s classics like “Mack the Knife,” “Dream Lover” and “Beyond the Sea” with his silky tenor.",
  "bwwExcerpt": "For a little over two hours, there’s nowhere you’d rather be than at this dazzling dream of a New York that truly never slept, presided over by a Harlem-born singer whose output was so rich and rapid-fire that the man must have been fueled by the dire prognosis he received as a child:  Darin wasn’t supposed to live past 16.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "â 'Just in Time' is a wallop of joy, though. And while it doesnât shy away from Darinâs heart struggles, anatomically and romantically, the musical is never gloomy.\"",
