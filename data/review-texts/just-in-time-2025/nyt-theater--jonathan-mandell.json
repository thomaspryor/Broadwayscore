  "bwwExcerpt": "Much of what we’re told in “Just in Time” about Darin is a fairly standard show biz story. It’s a measure of how little in his biography there is to work with that the show holds off until nearly the end to reveal a big family secret, one that’s easily available in the most cursory bio of Darin online.  But there is some drama in the relationship with Dee. For all his charm as a performer, Darin doesn’t seem like a very nice man. He insists she go on the road with him, and show his fans and hers",
