  "garbageFullText": "Just In Time, the Bobby Darin jukebox musical starring Jonathan Groff opening tonight at a wonderfully dressed Circle in the Square on Broadway, does some serious and genuine starmaking, twice over in fact. Darin, the once hugely popular but now barely remembered nightclub singer and Top 40 hitmaker is returned to a spot in our cultural memory, and Groff, the Tony-winning star of last season&#8217;s Merrily We Roll Along and for years now one of the stage&#8217;s more popular young actors, newly emerges to the top ranks of the best, most natural all-around entertainers working today.\n\nSome performances &#8211; think Liza Minnelli in the film Cabaret, or Hugh Jackman in Broadway&#8217;s The Boy From Oz &#8211; send their stars into new stratospheres, something outside the labels &#8220;actor&#8221; and &#8220;singer&#8221; and into that exclusive circle of stars who can hold a stage both as a character and as themselves, instantly recognizable and unique.\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\tBelow The Line\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2025-26 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Grammys, Guilds & More\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\tCasting\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJonathan Groff Sets Exit Date For Broadway Musical &#039;Just In Time&#039;\n\nJust in Time, directed by Alex Timbers from an original concept by Ted Chapin, is an ideal showcase for Groff, in no small part due to the rather ingenious premise of the bio-musical: In a very effective framing device, Groff is introduced to the stage as Groff, setting up the show&#8217;s ground rules: Groff isn&#8217;t playing Darin, he&#8217;s playing Groff playing Darin, a conceit that allows the star not only to break the fourth wall but that sets him free to speak directly about why he is so taken by a singer who died in 1973, making us care too.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWatch on Deadline\n\nAnd perhaps most significantly, the Groff-as-Darin premise means the actor doesn&#8217;t have to imitate Darin. Groff sings Darin&#8217;s song as Groff &#8211; and all the better &#8211;  and that simple approach lifts the restraints that strangle most jukebox musicals. Just In Time doesn&#8217;t always avoid the contrivances of the genre, but it renders them insignificant.\n\nBut no mistake: Just in Time is a jukebox musical, not a Jonathan Groff Sings The Songs Of Bobby Darin concert (though I&#8217;d buy a ticket for that). In between songs &#8211; performed on Derek McLane&#8217;s magnificently designed Circle in the Square made over as an immersive, gloriously art deco Copa-style nightclub that just might be the best use of that venue&#8217;s troublesome in-the-round design in memory &#8211; Just in Time tells Darin&#8217;s story in standard jukebox manner. A cast of characters including family members, colleagues and famous loves Connie Francis and Sandra Dee recreate, with Groff, snippets that tell the tale of his life in fairly broad strokes.\n\nBorn in East Harlem in 1936, Darin had the odds stacked against him from the get-go. Frequent bouts of rheumatic fever left the kid&#8217;s heart so weakened that one childhood doctor predicted a lifespan of 16 years. Darin, encouraged by his supportive, hardboiled ex-vaudeville singer mother Polly (the great Michele Pawk), determines to live life fast, cramming in as much success as his limited time will allow. He starts as a songwriter, earning some success copying the styles of whoever happens to have a hit at the moment.\n\nBut when the emerging recording star Connie Francis takes notice, Darin&#8217;s luck changes. The two East Coast kids not only embark on a secret affair (her overprotective dad has a gun, and vows to use it), but quickly find fame. For Darin, that means by recording his own music, starting with the novelty rock and roll number &#8220;Splish Splash&#8221; and then the catchy if mopey &#8220;Dream Lover.&#8221;\n\nHis legacy would be set, though, when he decided, against the advice of his management, to adapt the Brecht-Weill Threepenny Opera dirge &#8220;Die Moritat von Mackie Messer&#8221; into something with a finger-snapping beat and a &#8217;50s lounge vibe. Mack The Knife was a huge hit in 1959 and and has long since become a standard.\n\nAs Just In Time suggests, though, Darin was never satisfied, and his near-pathological drive had him constantly chasing new styles of music (including a brief, ill-advised turn as a Dylan-like folkie). He also went through women &#8211; Connie Francis (a powerhouse Gracie Lawrence) broke his heart, but he more or less sabotaged his marriage to Sandra Dee (a clear-voiced Erika Henningsen), at least as depicted in Just In Time. Dragging the equally popular Dee (and their infant son) on tour with him, Darin mostly ignores her. She drinks, makes public scenes and soon enough Darin has his brother-in-law/toady deliver his request for a divorce.\n\nOther biographical scenarios focus mostly on his family, and only the solid performances of Pawk and Emily Bergl as, respectively, Darin&#8217;s morphine-addicted mother and put-upon sister &#8211; the family relationships shift in the late reveal of a long-kept secret &#8211; keep the non-musical book sections from slipping into the usual Wikipedia-sounding exposition so typical of the jukebox genre. (Director Timbers and book writers Warren Leight and Isaac Oliver also devise some brief, funny cameo appearances by, among others, Elvis Presley and a gloomy Lotte Lenya, performers who spark Darin&#8217;s imagination.)\n\nJust in Time is front-loaded with the best, or at least most recognizable, songs in the first act, leaving the second half less hummable and stacked with the more melodramatic, treacly and standard-jukebox book bits, but all that matters little. Groff, assisted by a terrific trio of singer-dancers (Christine Cornish, Julia Grondin, Valeria Yamin) who back him up through the years and many, many fashions and dance styles, is tireless and captivating throughout the show. Long known for the copious amounts of spit and sweat he releases during a performance &#8211; he jokingly acknowledges his &#8220;wetness&#8221; early in the show &#8211; Groff embodies the give-it-all stage style embodied by Minnelli in her prime, and with Just In Time we watch as, song by song and dance by dance, a stage performer of the highest order blossoms.\n\nJust In Time leaves nothing to chance. McLane&#8217;s art deco nightclub bandstand is glorious, beautifully lit in washes of variously colored lights (designed by Justin Townsend), and Catherine Zuber&#8217;s costume design perfectly captures the various eras &#8211; she especially has fun with the oh-so-mod &#8217;60s &#8211; without turning the whole thing into a Halloween costume party. Groff dons one specially-designed tux jacket after another, with pinks and yellows marking the dinner jackets to specific eras and the eventual sparkly black numbers paying loving homage to the gaudy and joyous excesses of the nightclub and casino eras.\n\nLikewise, Shannon Lewis&#8217; choreography barrels through the eras with uncanny accuracy &#8211; Groff and his trio of &#8220;Sirens&#8221; are especially delightful doing the &#8217;60s dance-craze moves &#8211; the Twist, the Swim &#8211; as if they&#8217;re on the soundstage of Hullabaloo or Shindig!\n\nWith Andrew Resnick&#8217;s crisp musical arrangements and a faultless sound design by Peter Hylenski, Groff and his costars knock one song after another out of the park. To name just a couple: Lawrence, as Connie Francis, adds just enough Jersey grit to her musical theater chops to deliver a belt-down-the-house &#8220;Who&#8217;s Sorry Now,&#8221; and Pawk, as Darin&#8217;s maybe-mother turns chanteuse to serenade a young Bobby with the chanson &#8220;La Mer,&#8221; instilling in Darin a lifelong love for the song that would become one of his signature hits &#8220;Beyond The Sea.&#8221;\n\nOther musical highlights &#8211; some performed outside the nightclub setting with some scenery changes that indicate seaside Italy or Hollywood slumming &#8211; include Tim Hardin&#8217;s &#8220;If I Were A Carpenter&#8221; (the sole hit from Darin&#8217;s folkie era), a jazzed up &#8220;Lazy River&#8221; and the gently swinging &#8220;Just In Time,&#8221; the Styne-Comden-Green standard that gives the show a name that serves as a metaphor for the rush-rush-rush nature of Darin&#8217;s short life (he was just 37 when his heart quit).\n\nDuring his frequent interactions with the audience &#8211; he dances on tables, dances with delighted audience members &#8211; Groff is blunt about why he finds Darin&#8217;s story so compelling: The story of the &#8220;nightclub animal&#8221; who lived only for the stage, the audience and the spotlight is Groff&#8217;s story too.\n\nEarly in the show, as the band vamps on &#8220;Beyond The Sea,&#8221; Groff, working the audience, says slyly, &#8220;I first heard this next song the way we all first heard this next song &#8211; twirling in our mother's heels in Pennsylvania Amish country, listening to our father's records&#8230;I never would've guessed I'd have anything in common with him, the playboy crooner and me in Mom's pumps, but turns out I do. He loved &#8211; [gestures back and forth between himself and the audience] &#8211; this. It was the only relationship he was any good at. Honestly? Same.&#8221;\n\nTitle: Just In TimeVenue: Broadway's Circle In The SquareDirector: Alex TimbersMusic: The hits of Bobby DarrinBook: Warren Leight and Isaac OliverCast: Jonathan Groff, Gracie Lawrence, Erika Henningsen, Michele Pawk, Joe Barbara, Emily Bergl, Lance Roberts, Caesar Samayoa, Christine Cornish, Julia Grondin, Valeria Yamin, John Treacy Egan, Tari Kelly, Matt Magnusson, Khori Michelle Petinaud and Larkin Reilly.Running time: 2 hr 20 min (including intermission)\n\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\n\nI’m not a theater lover but I wish I could see this.

  "fullText": "Circle in the Square Theatre, New York Jonathan Groff uses his considerable charisma to embody the late singer with pizzazz in a rousing yet incomplete Broadway show It is more than likely that Jonathan Groff, the star of the new Broadway show Just in Time, has more name recognition in today’s New York than Bobby Darin, the midcentury singer whom he plays in this jukebox bio-musical, of sorts. Darin’s relative lack of contemporary reputation compared with, say, the Temptations, is why Just in Time, written by Warren Leight and Isaac Oliver from a concept by Ted Chapin, situates its narrative of a life lived in the fast lane behind a very porous fourth wall, the easier to explain who Sandra Dee is. It’s why Groff, smartly dressed and toting a retro microphone, greets the audience at Manhattan’s Circle in the Square Theatre not as Darin, the baby-faced playboy crooner, but as Groff, Broadway king fresh off his Tony win, poised to deliver a night of rousing, enthusiastic theater befitting a consummate showman. The Tony win goes unmentioned, though Groff’s intro mirrors his moving acceptance speech: as a kid growing up in Pennsylvania, all he wanted to do was entertain. Sing and dance and bring joy. Groff explicitly compares himself to Darin (and, in one of the show’s many winking bits, acknowledges that yes, he will spit and sweat a lot while recounting the life story of the man whose first hit was Splish Splash). The melding of personas successfully transmutes Groff’s exceptional charisma and earned goodwill into the tale of a past celebrity most of the audience could not identify via photo. But it also makes suspension of disbelief an impossible hurdle; it is difficult with such an emphasis on the performer’s magnetism, to invest in the details of the subject’s actual life, which are occasionally tossed off like Wikipedia entries. That Darin, born Walden Robert Cassotto in East Harlem, was a talent of trailblazing versatility who took on pop, rock’n’roll, swing, country and folk – a precursor to the modern pop star demands of reinvention – is not so much celebrated as sublimated into a show that leans heavily on knowingly dated pop-rock sounds and Darin’s most consistent form as a nightclub act. The sultry Copacabana-themed set, designed by Derek McLane, channels Darin’s greatest joy in life: connecting with audiences in a nightclub, riffing and rizzing on the specific chemistry with a specific audience, including certain lucky people pulled up by Groff to dance amid tables in the round. Director Alex Timbers and choreographer Shannon Lewis make the most of the Circle in the Square’s opportunities for audience immersion. Groff, as himself and as Darin, and his three nightclub “sirens” (Valeria Yamin, Christine Cornish and Julia Grondin) saunter into aisles allowing some to feel the white-hot charge of the spotlight. A delightfully perky swing band plays on stage throughout and joins in on some bits; various characters from Darin’s short life – Groff tells you early that he died at 37, owing to a weak heart from childhood bouts with rheumatic fever – pop up on and around stages at opposite ends of the space. Those characters are accoutrements to a show predicated on pizzazz, not friction or substance, though each woman gets her time to shine. This includes Darin’s mother, Polly (Michele Pawk), a former vaudeville singer reverent of the classics who pushed her son to pursue a showbiz career; much-older, too-doting sister Nina (Emily Bergl); first flame Connie Francis (Gracie Lawrence), a fellow 50s chart-chaser possessing a truly showstopping belt; and in the second act, the actor Sandra Dee (a mellifluously voiced Erika Henningsen), with whom Darin briefly became a Hollywood it-couple in the early 60s, before the marriage fell apart. That Groff and Henningsen sell the rise and fall of this doomed pairing as well as they do within three songs is a testament to the sheer force of their performances; at one point I thought Groff had to have a double, so fast did he move between stages. But while the second act evinces some thornier parts of a character the first act kept mostly eager, ambitious and prodigiously imitative – Darin was a classically bad husband – it still zooms awkwardly through heavy material. At one point, Dee breezes through Darin’s pivot to politics, witnessing the assassination of RFK, mental breakdown, loss of his fortune, folk rebrand and decampment to Big Sur all in about 30 seconds. Likewise, the death he always knew was coming early passes too swiftly to fully land; much more emotional, if a touch too earnest for my liking, is Groff’s conclusion, as himself, celebrating the cliched yet still somehow underappreciated, unrepeatable magic of live performance. Which is, ultimately, Just in Time’s selling point. The show puts an interesting twist on the cliche of a past-his-prime singer becoming a nightclub nostalgia act – typically a sad, pitiable fate for a pop star instead presented as a victory, a return to form and homecoming worthy of one of the show’s most vivacious numbers. Both Darin and Groff understood the implicit contract of a performer: lend one’s time in exchange for entertainment. The retro style of show will appeal to some Broadway-heads more than others, but on that promise, at least, Groff more than delivers. We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could support the Guardian at this crucial time for journalism in the US. In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one. From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced. While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts. While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel. Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less. But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.",
