  "fullText": "Groff, assisted by a terrific trio of singer-dancers (Christine Cornish, Julia Grondin, Valeria Yamin) who back him up through the years and many, many fashions and dance styles, is tireless and captivating throughout the show. Long known for the copious amounts of spit and sweat he releases during a performance – he jokingly acknowledges his “wetness” early in the show – Groff embodies the give-it-all stage style embodied by Minnelli in her prime, and with Just In Time we watch as, song by song and dance by dance, a stage performer of the highest order blossoms.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Early in the show, as the band vamps on “Beyond The Sea,” Gross, working the audience, says slyly, “I first heard this next song the way we all first heard this next song – twirling in our mother’s heels in Pennsylvania Amish country, listening to our father’s records…I never would’ve guessed I’d have anything in common with him, the playboy crooner and me in Mom’s pumps, but turns out I do. He loved – [gestures back and forth between himself and the audience] – this. It was the only relationship he was any good at. Honestly? Same.”",
