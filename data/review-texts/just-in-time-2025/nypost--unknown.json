  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "The audience is situated in a sumptuously imagined, sparkling silver nightclub with multiple stages and a brilliant band in back. Groff spiritedly darts around the room, jumping on tables and dancing with ticket-buyers like the consummate host. The actor, bursting with charisma, sweeps away the old radio static from Darin's classics like \"Mack the Knife,\" \"Dream Lover\" and \"Beyond the Sea\" with his silky tenor.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses consistently positive language about Groff's performance and the production design, but as a single curated quote from an unknown critic, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights the engaging and charismatic performance of Groff and the immersive setting, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of a full review, the confidence is medium, and the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the positive aspects of the performance and atmosphere, suggesting an enjoyable experience. However, without the full review, it's difficult to gauge the overall recommendation strength, so I've placed it in the lower end of the 'Positive' bucket.",
