  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "The audience is situated in a sumptuously imagined, sparkling silver nightclub with multiple stages and a brilliant band in back. Groff spiritedly darts around the room, jumping on tables and dancing with ticket-buyers like the consummate host. The actor, bursting with charisma, sweeps away the old radio static from Darin's classics like \"Mack the Knife,\" \"Dream Lover\" and \"Beyond the Sea\" with his silky tenor.",
