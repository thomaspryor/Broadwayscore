  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "It's Groff's energy and charisma that anchor Just in Time. The brilliance of the show's opening is that, by creating a staged-concert atmosphere from the start, it frees us from the need to compare him to Darin and instead foregrounds Groff's own passion for telling his story. Groff even concludes the evening with an unexpectedly eloquent tribute to the evanescent yet transcendent power of theater. How rare it is for a jukebox bio-musical to feel like it comes genuinely from the heart.",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review highlights Groff's performance and the show's genuine feel, suggesting a positive experience despite being a jukebox bio-musical, which often receives mixed reviews.",
