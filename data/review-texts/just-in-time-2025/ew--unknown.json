However, with only one curated quote available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt ends with a strong positive sentiment, suggesting the show is memorable and worth revisiting. The phrase 'When can I see it again?' indicates a high level of enthusiasm and recommendation. | Gemini: The review ends with a strong indication that the reviewer enjoyed the show and would see it again, placing it firmly in the positive bucket.
