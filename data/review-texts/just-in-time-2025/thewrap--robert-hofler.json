  "fullText": "When Groff is singing and dancing (stunning choreography by Shannon Lewis), “Just in Time” absolutely dazzles. It doesn’t matter if what’s happening on stage ever makes you think of Bobby Darin. But Groff doesn’t always sing and dance, and when he or anybody else stops to recite dialogue from Leight and Oliver’s book, “Just in Time” simply deadens. Since Timbers also receives a “developed by” credit here, he should have developed a completely different book.",
