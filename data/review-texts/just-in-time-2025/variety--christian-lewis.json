  "fullText": "It might be time to call it quits on biographical jukebox musicals. \"Jersey Boys\" ignited a trend, but its many spawn have been mostly ill-conceived. Recently we've had \"Summer: The Donna Summer Musical,\" \"Ain't Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations,\" \"The Cher Show,\" \"MJ,\" \"Tina,\" \"A Beautiful Noise: The Neil Diamond Musical,\" and this season's short-lived \"A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical.\" To this less-than-honorable list we can now add \"Just in Time,\" based on the life and music of Bobby Darin, starring Jonathan Groff (\"Hamilton,\" \"Looking\").",
  "dtliExcerpt": "Director Alex Timbers and the book writers fail to go beyond the concert conceit, and never give us a real portrait of Darin or leave us with a clear idea of what we are supposed to think of him. The musical offers us brief glimpses into how poorly he treated many of the people in life, particularly women. Groff and the team obviously love him and his work, but are we meant to?",
  "bwwExcerpt": "Contrary to its title, “Just in Time” is anything but timely, since the window of Darin’s relevancy has long gone. Even Darin himself admits in the show that by 1968 he was “yesterday’s news.” Just in time for what, we might ask? Do we really need a whole musical about a straight white man with a few hit songs in the 60s? For that matter, do we need multiple? This is in fact the second Bobby Darin musical (the other, “Dream Lover,” premiered in Australia in 2016), not to mention the Kevin Spacey-led biopic, “Beyond the Sea” from 2004. Does Bobby Darrin really merit this much attention?",
