  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Groff is undeniably great at bending a crowd around his little finger, and he's working with an audience that's delighted to be pandered to. He spends much of the show weaving through that crowd and traipsing up the aisles and back to find people to flirt and dance with, like a Labrador licking his way through a maze in search of treats. How could you deny this guy the adulation he craves?",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt acknowledges Groff's talent and crowd appeal, but the Labrador comparison and 'pandering' suggestion carry subtle criticism. Given this is a single curated excerpt, scoring conservatively within positive range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights Groff's engaging performance and the audience's positive reception, suggesting a generally favorable view. However, the lack of a full review and the single excerpt caution suggest a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on Groff's performance and the audience's positive reaction. While the Labrador analogy could be interpreted negatively, the concluding question suggests a positive overall sentiment, though the single excerpt makes it difficult to be certain.",
