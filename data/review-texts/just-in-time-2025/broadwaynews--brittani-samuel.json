  "fullText": "The Broadway Review: ‘Just in Time’ is safe, swoonful concert-style theater\n\n To no one’s surprise, star Jonathan Groff’s got the magic, vintage touch.",
  "dtliExcerpt": "But the manner in which “Just in Time” unfolds is mercilessly predictable, so the beats rarely surprise; we feel every snap coming. For what it’s worth, Groff, Lawrence and Henningsen don’t seem to mind — they’re having a howling good time slipping into these characters’ shoes.",

The only critical content describes the show as 'safe' and 'swoonful' while praising Jonathan Groff, suggesting a mixed assessment but insufficient text for confident scoring. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'safe' and 'swoonful', suggesting it is enjoyable but not groundbreaking. The mention of Jonathan Groff's 'magic, vintage touch' adds a positive note, indicating a solid recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review calls the show \"swoonful\" and says Groff has \"the magic, vintage touch.\" The word \"safe\" suggests a reservation, but overall the tone is positive.",
