The language is enthusiastic, indicating a strong recommendation, though the single excerpt warning suggests a conservative score within the 'Rave' bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt is positive, praising Jonathan Groff and the show. The phrase 'slickest attraction' suggests a positive experience, but without the full review, I'm scoring it conservatively within the positive range.",
