  "fullText": "Democracy Dies in DarknessFrom left, Christine Cornish, Jonathan Groff and Julia Grondin in “Just in Time.” (Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman)Review by  Naveen KumarNEW YORK — As star vehicles go, Jonathan Groff is currently seizing the wheel of a top-down Aston Martin. Following his Tony-winning turn in “Merrily We Roll Along,” a chronicle of songwriting success told in reverse, the actor is stepping back into the glamour and hustle of mid-century show business, cruising forward this time, as the chameleon crooner Bobby Darin. It’s another magnificent performance — kind-eyed, honey-voiced and all but irresistible.\n\n“Just in Time” travels the familiar narrative road of an artist’s rise and fall, but immersive swank and charming personality set this bio-musical apart from even its most successful predecessors. (“Jersey Boys,” watch your tail.) Staged nightclub-style by director Alex Timbers — with seating on three sides plus cabaret two-tops down front — the production fizzes with class and delight like a coupe of champagne. That warm and heady feeling? It’s secondhand intoxication from the joy Groff radiates in his element.\n\nYou can take the actor’s word for it: He begins out of character, setting up the first-person candor that drives the story. He traces his own connection to Bobby’s music — as a kid, Groff listened to his father’s records while dancing in his mother’s pumps — and to the singer’s unyielding affection for an audience. (“It was the only relationship he was any good at,” Groff explains, adding with a smile: “Honestly? Same.”) What follows is the merging of two eager-to-please showmen.\n\nIf you’re hazy on Darin’s signature sound, that’s fine because so was he. Here, Bobby is an ace musician hunting for an identity, cycling through and excelling at popular styles of the day. Darin spent the better part of his career running away from his first big hit, the corny bath-time jingle “Splish Splash,” released a few days after he turned 22, in 1958. He dabbled in swoony pop-rock with “Dream Lover”; broke the mold with a suave and swingy take on “Mack the Knife” from “The Threepenny Opera”; and eventually experimented, on songs like “If I Were a Carpenter,” with melancholy folk.\n\nThe and-then-he-wrote-this-song monotony of a conventional pop star tell-all is tough to escape, but “Just in Time” benefits from the broad range of Darin’s compositions, played with bustling verve by the onstage band. (Music supervision and arrangements are by Andrew Resnick; the brassy orchestrations are by Resnick and Michael Thurber.) Groff has no need to try to re-create Darin’s voice, which was less distinct than those of his contemporaries (including Elvis), so the catalogue serves as a wonderfully versatile canvas for the actor’s own. Anyone who appreciates Groff’s sterling emotional clarity should consider “Just in Time” required viewing.\n\nEven as it rounds the usual bases — hit records, hot-then-cold romances, fame’s dreaded fade — the musical is cheeky and fleet. The book by Warren Leight (“Side Man”) and Isaac Oliver (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) has the self-awareness of a clever best friend: Frequent asides, cued by the snap of a finger, keep the audience as Bobby’s confidants. (The show is based on an original concept by Ted Chapin.) Trying to fit the mold and make it big, in Bobby’s estimation, is a minefield of excitement, frustration and ambivalence. Confessional ease makes “Just in Time” feel less like fawning hagiography than a Very Special Night at the Copa, where everyone’s invited to discover Darin’s legacy onstage and then trail him into the dressing room.\n\nThe production design looks as though the Chrysler Building swallowed the Boom Boom Room and jetted off for a weekend to Atlantic City: angular inlays and sumptuous textures, glowing with the giddiness of putting on a show. (The set is by Derek McLane, and lights are by Justin Townsend.) Timbers, who also directed “Moulin Rouge!” and “Here Lies Love,” delivers compact grandeur that dazzles at close range, with clever tricks that allow for the swift rotation of elegant costumes (by Catherine Zuber). Hips swivel and limbs pop with ecstatic vigor in choreography by Shannon Lewis. The tone, which might easily have careened into golly-gee territory, is just wry enough not to ring overly sincere.\n\nBobby’s sense of un-rootedness is ultimately reflected in a shocking family secret (which I won’t spoil here but is easily googleable) that Darin discovered late in his short life. He was born with a weakened heart — a metaphor the writers are smart not to overplay when it comes to matters of love — and died at age 37. The constellation of people who adored him are all excellently portrayed by the supporting cast, including Michele Pawk, as the onetime vaudeville dame who raised and inspired him, plus Emily Bergl, who plays both his protective sibling and the skeptical mother of his wife, the movie star Sandra Dee, played by Erika Henningsen. The folk singer and actor Gracie Lawrence is especially captivating as Bobby’s first sweetheart Connie Francis, whose more assured ascent to stardom outpaced his own.\n\nThrough it all are crowd-pleasers performed by Groff (plus several knockouts by Lawrence) that make a resounding case for Darin’s skill as a composer and for the enduring magnetism of live performance. “This can only happen in this room, right now, with you,” Groff insists, sealing this love letter to the theater with one last seduction. “It’ll never happen quite the same way again.” It would sound too schmaltzy by half if it weren’t true.\n\nJust in Time, ongoing at Circle in the Square Theatre in New York. 2 hours and 30 minutes with an intermission. justintimebroadway.com.",
