Despite the single excerpt warning, the language indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('sensational,' 'charming,' 'astonishing') to describe the performance, indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the 'Positive' bucket.",
