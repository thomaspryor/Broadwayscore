    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic describes the revival as 'high-voltage' and calls a key moment 'exhilarating' and 'magic.' However, this is only one curated excerpt, so confidence is low and the score reflects strong positive language while acknowledging incomplete information. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes a moment in the show as 'magic,' indicating a strong positive impression. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is at the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"exhilarating\" and says the scene is \"magic,\" indicating a positive review. Given that it is a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly positive language ('exhilarating,' 'magic,' 'high-voltage') to praise the production, indicating an enthusiastic recommendation, though the single excerpt limits certainty.",
