No clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The review praises the professionalism and polish of the production, indicating a positive recommendation despite noting it doesn't fully recapture the original's magic. | Gemini: The review is positive, noting professionalism and polish, but acknowledges it doesn't reach the original's magic. This places it in the positive bucket with reservations. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the production's professionalism and polish as 'welcome,' indicating a qualified recommendation, though the failure to recapture the original's 'legendary magic' tempers the enthusiasm significantly.",
