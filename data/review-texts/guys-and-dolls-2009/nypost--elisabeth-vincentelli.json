  "bwwExcerpt": "\"At the Nederlander Theatre, where Des McAnuff's glitzy revival of the 1950 classic opened last night, they dazzle us with their handsome costumes and their clever projections (by Paul Tazewell and Dustin O'Neill).

But whereas Adelaide eventually gets her ring, we're left at the altar once again, wondering how things went wrong.\"",
