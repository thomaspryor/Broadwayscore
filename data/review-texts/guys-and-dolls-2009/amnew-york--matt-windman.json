  "bwwExcerpt": "\"You know that a production of \"Guys and Dolls\" has gone terribly wrong when a minor character like General Cartwright makes a bigger impression than Sky Masterson, Sarah Brown, Nathan Detroit and Miss Adelaide put together. And if anyone is to blame, it is director Des McAnuff (\"Jersey Boys\"), whose new Broadway revival is a misconceived fiasco.\"",
