However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as 'comprehensive and convincing,' suggesting a positive, immersive experience. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the show's character work with superlatives like 'comprehensive and convincing,' suggesting deep appreciation for the emotional authenticity. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced despite the clearly positive tone.",
