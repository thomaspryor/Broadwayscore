  "bwwExcerpt": "Lloyd’s vision takes place within a massive vortex (designed by Soutra Gilmour) that suggests an internet-age existence both futuristic and, by dint of its looking like a submarine cable, perilously tactile. It’s not the country road Beckett calls for, but the information superhighway. As in the best opera sets, it’s simple, gorgeous, effective and relentlessly watchable. Its brutalism creates some fantastic tableaux and allows for great moments of physical comedy, as the men run up its walls and slide back down, Sisyphus style, or stand on its curve with their feet comically slanted. At one point, while Thornton shines in his speech, Dirden peeks from outside of it, clinging to its edges like a Grand Guignol villain, bowler hat and all, with mustache-twirling delight. (Gilmour also did the costumes, which include a rather kinky muzzle for Lucky; all leather and straps.)",
