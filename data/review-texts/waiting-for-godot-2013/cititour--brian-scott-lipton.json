  "bwwExcerpt": "Unquestionably, Reeves and Winter have the necessary chemistry to play these men who have spent countless years together, barely separated for more than a few hours at a time. We believe they are unable to leave each other, more out of familiar comfort than actual fear. In fact, they won’t even commit suicide unless they’re sure both can succeed at the task. The duo brilliantly captures the pair’s codependence, if little else. That said, “Godot” Is essentially a vaudevillian exercise that requires two actors who can transform Beckett’s verbal exercises, such as when they take turns calling each other horrible names (including “critic”), into laugh-inducing comedy routines. Sadly, you’re more likely to hear chuckles (if not silence) during these exchanges.",
