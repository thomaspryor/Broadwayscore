  "bwwExcerpt": "Lloyd's Godot makes plenty of fascinating choices, some more effective than others. The characters often stare back at the audience; the tree is nowhere to be seen; the props are pantomimed; and there is a throwaway reference to Bill & Ted, equally likely to elicit chuckles as it is to yank you from the play's subject matter back into a world where you're staring at Reeves and Winter's reunion rather than Vladimir and Estragon's despair.",
