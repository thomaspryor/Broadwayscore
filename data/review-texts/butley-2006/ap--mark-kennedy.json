However, confidence is low due to truncated single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Stroman's vision and suggests the show will have a lasting presence on Broadway. The mention of a 'deliciously vulgar scene' adds to the positive tone. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language indicates strong enthusiasm. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Stroman's vision and suggests the show will have a long run on Broadway, indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low but the tone is clearly positive. | Kimi: The excerpt praises Stroman's direction and predicts a long Broadway run, indicating a clear recommendation, though descriptors like 'cute' and 'brashy' suggest populist entertainment rather than artistic transcendence. Confidence is low due to the single, truncated excerpt format.",
