However, confidence is low due to limited text that may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the talent, explosive dance routines, gifted cast, and sparkling design, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, with only one curated excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the talent, dance routines, cast, design, and direction, indicating a positive, though potentially qualified, recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers enthusiastic praise for the production's talent, choreography, and design elements using words like 'explosive,' 'sparkling,' and 'razzle-dazzle,' indicating a clear recommendation. As a single curated excerpt, it falls in the upper range of the Positive bucket per scoring guidelines.",
