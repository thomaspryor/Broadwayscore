Single excerpt suggests mixed reception. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt suggests a mixed reception, noting the show as 'a bit of a miss' but praising the dance numbers and production design. The single excerpt and lack of a full verdict reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review states the comedy is \"a bit of a miss\" but praises the dance numbers and production design, indicating a mixed assessment. The truncated text and single excerpt lower the confidence. | Kimi: The critic opens with a clear negative verdict ('a bit of a miss'), but balances this with strong praise for Susan Stroman's choreography and the production design. Given this is a single excerpt, the overall sentiment appears mixed rather than fully negative.",
