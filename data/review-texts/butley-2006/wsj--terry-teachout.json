However, text is clearly truncated mid-sentence, so confidence is low despite positive tone. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for multiple aspects of the production, including the book, staging, cast, and design. The tone suggests a highly positive view, consistent with a Rave classification. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language about multiple aspects of the show (book, staging, cast, sets, costumes), suggesting a favorable review. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive tone warrants a score in the upper range of 'Positive'. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for all production elements using words like 'outstanding' and 'inventive,' indicating a strong recommendation, though the truncated conclusion and single-excerpt format limit certainty about the full verdict.",
