    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Pan/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Harsh criticism calling it a 'cardinal sin' and 'sledgehammering act of desperation,' but single excerpt warning requires caution about full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a strongly negative view, describing the musical as 'sledgehammering' and 'desperation.' However, with only one excerpt, the full context is missing, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses negative language like \"sledgehammering act of period-tune-driven desperation\" and \"a whole lot to answer for,\" indicating a negative assessment. Given the truncated text, I'm scoring it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as a 'sledgehammering act of period-tune-driven desperation' that commits the 'cardinal sin' of forcing comedy, with the creators having 'a whole lot to answer for,' indicating a clear negative verdict. | Buckets: claude=Pan, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Negative",
