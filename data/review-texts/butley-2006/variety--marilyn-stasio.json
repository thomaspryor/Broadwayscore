    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Opening line positions this as the show Broadway needed, with specific praise for choreography, design, and ensemble. Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds clearly positive, so scoring upper end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong positive elements like choreography, design, and performances, suggesting an enthusiastic recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Stroman's choreography and the design elements, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
