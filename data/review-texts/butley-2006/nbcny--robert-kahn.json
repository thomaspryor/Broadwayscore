The truncated ending prevents seeing the full verdict, requiring low confidence and lower-end positive scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'zany, old-fashioned spectacle' and highlights a 'marvelous turn' by Marin Mazzie, indicating a positive view. However, the mention of 'not without some curious choices' suggests some reservations. Given the single excerpt and the warning about potential cherry-picking, the score is set at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review calls the show \"a zany, old-fashioned spectacle\" and praises Marin Mazzie's performance, but the truncated text and the phrase \"not without some curious choices\" suggest a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise ('zany, old-fashioned spectacle', 'marvelous turn') with only minor caveats ('curious choices'), indicating a solid recommendation despite the truncated text.",
