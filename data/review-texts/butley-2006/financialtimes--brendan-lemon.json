However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and truncated text - the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation of Marin Mazzie's performance, suggesting it as a reason to see the show. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review text limit confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive aspect of the show (Marin Mazzie's performance) as a reason to see it. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the lower end of the positive bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly recommends seeing the show ('reasons to see') and offers strong praise for the lead performance ('wonderfully self-assured'), indicating a clearly positive assessment despite the limited available text.",
