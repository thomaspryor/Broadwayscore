    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Critic explicitly states this is a 'perfect match' for the director's style, contrasting with a previous show that 'wasn't the right show.' However, confidence is low due to truncated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a strong positive alignment between Stroman's style and the show, indicating a favorable review. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates that the critic believes the show is a good fit for the director's style, suggesting a positive assessment. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic enthusiastically praises the pairing of director Susan Stroman with this material, calling it a 'perfect match' in contrast to her previous work this season, indicating strong approval of the production.",
