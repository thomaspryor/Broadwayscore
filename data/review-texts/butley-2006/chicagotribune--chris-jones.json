    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clear praise for multiple performers ('exceedingly funny', 'delicious', 'fearlessly'). However, text cuts off mid-sentence and may not capture full verdict. Low confidence due to incomplete information. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances with positive language ('exceedingly funny', 'deliciously and fearlessly'), suggesting a positive review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances of several actors, suggesting a positive experience overall, but the truncated nature and lack of a clear concluding statement lowers the confidence. | Kimi: The curated excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for multiple cast performances ('exceedingly funny', 'deliciously', 'fearlessly'), indicating a positive recommendation, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full verdict.",
