    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic uses strong superlatives ('force of nature,' 'brilliant,' 'as funny as anything on Broadway') with no caveats or reservations. The 80/100 original rating confirms this is in the Rave bucket range. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language ('force of nature', 'brilliant', 'as funny as anything on Broadway') indicating an enthusiastic recommendation. The original rating of 80 suggests a high positive, but the language supports a Rave classification. | Gemini: The review is short but effusive, calling the show \"brilliant\" and \"as funny as anything on Broadway.\" The critic's rating of 80 aligns with a positive assessment. | Kimi: The review delivers unqualified praise, calling the production 'brilliant' and the star a 'force of nature,' supported by the critic's 80/100 rating which falls squarely in the strong recommendation range. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
