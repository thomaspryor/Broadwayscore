However, confidence is low due to the extremely brief excerpt providing limited evaluative content. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 80 aligns with a positive review. The key quote highlights the energetic performance of James Corden, suggesting a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises James Corden's performance and describes the show as a \"knockabout British farce,\" indicating a positive, though possibly not rave, recommendation. The original rating of 80 aligns with this assessment. | Kimi: The critic delivers enthusiastic praise for Corden's performance ('whirling dervish of comic energy') and notes the successful transfer of the production to Broadway. The explicit rating of 80 confirms a solid positive recommendation.",
