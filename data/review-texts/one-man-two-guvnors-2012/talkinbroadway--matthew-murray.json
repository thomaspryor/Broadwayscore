    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Strong praise calling Corden 'a marvel' and the show 'theatrical magic', elevating it above mere farce. However, confidence is medium due to very brief excerpt - fuller review might provide more context. | GPT-4o: The review offers high praise for James Corden's performance, describing it as 'theatrical magic,' which suggests a strong recommendation. The lack of additional context or reservations leads to a medium confidence level. | Gemini: The review praises James Corden's performance, stating it elevates the show to \"theatrical magic,\" indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives ('marvel', 'theatrical magic') to praise the lead performance and the show's transformation of its material, indicating strong enthusiasm and a must-see recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
