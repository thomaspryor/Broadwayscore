    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Praises cast and design but criticizes lack of theatrical vitality, describing it as 'dutifully revived' which suggests competent but uninspired. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges positive aspects such as the cast and design but ultimately indicates a lack of excitement or freshness, suggesting a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like the cast and design but ultimately finds the production lacking the necessary theatrical impact. This suggests a mixed or lukewarm reception. | Kimi: The excerpt offers genuine praise for the cast and design but ultimately criticizes the production for lacking energy and feeling mechanical, suggesting a mixed verdict that acknowledges competence without enthusiasm.",
