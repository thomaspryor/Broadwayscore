  "wrongFullText": "By Kimberly Nordyke, The Associated Press \n\n \n\n December 28, 2008 12:46pm\n\nThe Season 4 finale of “The Hills” wasn’t able to match the numbers of the show’s third-season closer.\n\nThe latest finale, which aired at 10 p.m. Monday, averaged 2.6 million total viewers, down from 3.8 million for the Season 3 closer. But the Season 4 closer aired during a holiday week — during Hanukkah and three days before Christmas — while the third-season finale aired in May.\n\nOverall, the show’s Season 4 total-viewers average (3 million) was off 25% from its Season 3 average (3.9 million).\n\nMTV premieres “Hills” spinoff “The City,” starring Whitney Port, at 10 p.m. Monday. “Bromance,” a competition series starring “Hills” staple Brody Jenner, debuts at 9 p.m. Monday. New episodes of “Hills” are set to air in the spring.\n\nAlso airing last week was the second-season finale of TBS’ “Frank TV,” which averaged 948,000 viewers at 11 p.m. Tuesday. That’s off 25% from the year-ago time-period average (1.3 million).",
