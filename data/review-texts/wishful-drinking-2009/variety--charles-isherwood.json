The 'but' structure and therapy comparison indicate disappointment despite performer strengths. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some positive aspects such as the humor and delivery, but overall suggests the show lacks polish and feels more like therapy than theater, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (funny material, appealing delivery) but ultimately finds the show lacking polish and more akin to therapy than theater, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic offers faint praise ('funny enough,' 'appealingly loose') for Fisher's material and delivery, but the dominant 'But' clause criticizes the show as self-indulgent therapy rather than crafted theater, creating an overall mixed assessment.",
