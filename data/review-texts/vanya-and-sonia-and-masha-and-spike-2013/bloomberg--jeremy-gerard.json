  "bwwExcerpt": "When Christopher Durang's 'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' opened off-Broadway in November, I called this seriously silly play the funniest show in town, yet one with an emotional kick that lifted it to a more rarefied plane. Happily, the show has re-opened on Broadway with its cast (the headliners are Sigourney Weaver and David Hyde Pierce), its bucolic Pocono Mountains setting (David Korins) and its laughs intact. It's even better on second viewing, a rare thing for a comedy.",
