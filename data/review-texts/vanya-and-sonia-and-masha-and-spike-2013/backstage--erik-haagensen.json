  "bwwExcerpt": "It has taken 30 producers to bring Christopher Durang's six-character, one-set comedy 'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' to the Great White Way, and all I can say is God bless them, every one. A sold-out hit Off-Broadway for Lincoln Center Theater this past fall, it is easily the best new play of the Main Stem season to date and a top contender for the Tony Award. Both breathtakingly funny and quietly poignant, this Chekhov-inspired work-for which knowledge of the Russian master's plays is not a requirement-is pure joy from start to finish.",
