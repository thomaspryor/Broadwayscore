  "bwwExcerpt": "Christopher Durang's Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike is a comic tour de force about a bunch of Chekhovian characters full of yearning...Hyde Pierce is just plain perfect, and his monologue about the joys of the past is pulled off with a virtuosic mastery of eccentricity and stagecraft.... Nielsen gives her best performance to date, getting big laughs with her Maggie Smith impression...Weaver seems to be stretching in her performance as such a superficial lady, but her emphatic delivery won me over....Nicholas Martin has directed the whole thing with equal parts wit and feeling. I haven't wanted to simultaneously laugh and cry this much since...Chekhov.",
