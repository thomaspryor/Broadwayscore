The performances are looser and bigger; they’re Broadway-size now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong praise with superlatives like 'wonderful,' 'exciting,' and 'great musical.' Describes performances as having 'infectious exuberance' and notes the production 'just keeps getting better.' Clear rave language despite being a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is filled with superlatives ('wonderful', 'exciting', 'infectious exuberance') and praises the production's depth and complexity. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using words like \"wonderful\", \"exciting\", and \"infectious exuberance\". Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains unambiguous enthusiasm ('altogether wonderful', 'great musical', 'just keeps getting better'), but per instructions for cherry-picked excerpts, score is capped at the upper end of Positive. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
