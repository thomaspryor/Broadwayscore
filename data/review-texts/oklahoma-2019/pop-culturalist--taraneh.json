  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It is electrifying. This retelling is full of unexpected delights...The text has not changed...and this stripped-down music allows for the dialogue to really shine and be noticed...While almost the entire fresh production feels spot-on, there was one moment that felt like a small misstep.
