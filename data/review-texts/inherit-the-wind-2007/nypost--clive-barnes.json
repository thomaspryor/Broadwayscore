Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges some positive aspects but ultimately notes that the production does not fully succeed. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach. | Gemini: The review states that the production \"has its moments\" but \"never quite catches fire,\" indicating a mixed assessment. The limited excerpt lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges effective courtroom scenes but ultimately finds the production underwhelming and unable to fully deliver on the material's potential, suggesting a lukewarm, non-committal assessment.",
