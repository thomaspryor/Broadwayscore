    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Calling a show 'strangely lifeless' is clearly negative criticism. However, this is only one excerpt from a larger review, so confidence is low as the full verdict may contain more context or nuance. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the musical as 'deeply earnest' but also 'strangely lifeless,' suggesting a mix of positive intent and negative execution. With only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a mixed assessment, describing the musical as \"deeply earnest and strangely lifeless,\" indicating neither a strong recommendation nor discouragement. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows balanced assessment acknowledging sincere treatment of serious subject matter ('deeply earnest') while criticizing lack of energy or emotional impact ('strangely lifeless'). Limited confidence due to cherry-picking risk.",
