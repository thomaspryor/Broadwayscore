Director Scott Ellis' boisterous romp is not groundbreaking in the way the Joseph Papp-produced 1980 revival was, but it has the same irreverent spirit and perpetually ridiculous tale.\"",

This suggests positive but measured enthusiasm. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the energetic and colorful production, suggesting a positive experience. However, it notes that the production is not groundbreaking, indicating some reservations. The overall tone suggests a recommendation with some caveats. | Gemini: The review notes the show is not groundbreaking but has an \"irreverent spirit,\" suggesting a positive but not rave recommendation.
