And just when things might start to lag, Pierce arrives, nailing every pun, every aside to the audience, every double-take and every droll observation. He's a treasure.\"",

The single excerpt warning requires conservative scoring within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some flaws in the production, such as overzealous performances and a lengthy second act, but ultimately emphasizes a 'joyous vibe' and highlights a standout performance by Pierce. This suggests a positive recommendation despite some reservations. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws (broad acting, length) but ultimately concludes that the positive aspects, particularly Pierce's performance, outweigh them, creating a \"joyous vibe.\"",
