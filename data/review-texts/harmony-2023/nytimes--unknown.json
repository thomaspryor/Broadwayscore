However, limited text prevents full confidence in the verdict. | GPT-4o: The review highlights a strong performance by David Hyde Pierce but criticizes the overall production for being at odds with the original's wit. This suggests a mixed reception with notable positive elements. | Gemini: The review highlights a significant flaw in the production that overshadows a positive performance.
