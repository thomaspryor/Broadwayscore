  "fullText": "Whatever the structural flaws of “Harmony,” the new Broadway musical about the Comedian Harmonists, a German singing group destroyed by the Nazis in the 1930s, two facts are indisputable.\n\nThe first is that world events now have changed what felt, in an earlier off-Broadway production at the Museum of Jewish Heritage, like a sweet, small-bore musical with a familiar message into a far more emotionally charged experience with enhanced gravitas and infinitely more emotional weight. The Comedian Harmonists were made up of three Gentiles and three Jews, and “Harmony” is structured as a cautionary tale: the group could have remained abroad, had they not been blind to the clearly visible signs of their own imminent destruction. Many lines therein note the danger of not speaking out against atrocities; they now get sustained applause. As well as they should.\n\nThe second is that for Barry Manilow to deliver to Broadway an accessible but nonetheless varied and harmonically sophisticated score for a new musical at the age of 80 is a remarkable capper on an extraordinary songwriting and performance career, filled with songs driven by melodic hooks and lyrical simplicity.\n\n“Harmony,” which features lyrics and book by Manilow’s longtime collaborator Bruce Sussman and is both directed and choreographed by Warren Carlyle, has been around for some time, but it deserved its long-delayed berth on Broadway at what has turned out to be both the perfect and a truly awful moment.\n\nThe Broadway transfer also is greatly enhanced by the addition of Sierra Borgess as Mary and, especially, Julie Benko in the role of Ruth, the Jewish girlfriend of one of the Gentile Comedian Harmonists. Benko dives uncommonly deep into an underwritten character without a lot of back story, powering this section of the narrative and pulling every conceivable emotion out of the show’s signature Manilow power ballad, “Every Single Day.” At one point at the performance I saw, Benko’s face was so consumed in pain and longing as for the sight to be startling, frankly; it’s a necessary counter in a show filled with so many numbers based on the notion of just packing your feelings away.\n\n“Harmony” is structured as a memory musical. One member of the group, now older, Rabbi (Chip Zien), watches his younger self (Danny Kornfeld) as he interacts with the other disparate members of the singing group: Bobby (Sean Bell), Harry (Zal Owen), Erich (Eric Peters), Chopin (Blake Roman) and Lesh (Steven Telsey). The older Rabbi tells the story as the fellows sing and debate their growing, mutually connected careers and complicated young lives, sadly oblivious to the dissonance that lies ahead for all of them.\n\nThis is not a deeply sophisticated book and the interaction between narration and dramatization is often choppy, despite Carlyle’s attempts to smooth it over with a greatly expanded staging that makes much creative use of a mirrored setting, sometimes deeply affecting and occasionally distracting. There are nods to “Cabaret” and “The Sound of Music” here although Carlyle also explores some exceptionally interesting visual ideas, all deftly keyed, emotionally, and the show is at its best when his intense directorial and choreographic point of view achieves parity with the show’s book.\n\nZien’s narration sucks up a lot of stage time and falls into repetitive vocal traits: he tends to hit every line as if it were the most important moment of the show, and both fluidity and structural tension suffer. That said, the 76-year-old actor is indisputably authentic in the role, a crucial quality for this show’s target audience, and lovable to boot. It just might have been helpful to throw more of the storytelling in the way of the guys in the group, all of whom sing and act quite beautifully and whom you believe have their fates tied together.\n\nTheater sophisticates often take harmonizing for granted as a fundamental part of the craft, akin to learning lines. But to many Broadway audience members, it’s a rare pleasure and the vocal arrangements here (by Manilow and John O’Neill), come with an uncommon amount of theatricality — well, uncommon unless you are a longtime Manilow fan, given his decadeslong mastery of the kind of arrangements that bring anthems to a climax and people to their feet. The score will have its detractors, perhaps, as did much of what Manilow created, early on. But those will be snobby views, oblivious of his incomparable skills in musical communication.\n\nIn the end, what “Harmony” is trying to say is that here was a band that could have represented Germany at its best, a combination of Jews and Gentiles having fun and singing in perfect harmony. The first Nazi we see in the show (played by Andrew O’Shanick) is even a fan who at first protects the group. But as hate takes over, nothing is funny about the Comedian Harmonists any longer and their harmonizing dies forever.\n\nThe show intends you to think about what might have been, what could still be, and all I can say is that is exactly what I was pondering as I hit my pillow.\n\nAt the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, 243 W. 47th St., New York; harmonyanewmusical.com\n\nChris Jones is a Tribune critic.",
