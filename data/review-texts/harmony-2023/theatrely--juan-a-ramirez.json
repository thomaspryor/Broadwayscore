    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clearly positive language ('deeply moving', 'timely and timeless') but low confidence due to limited text that could be cherry-picked from a longer review with more nuanced verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation, highlighting the show's emotional impact and thematic depth. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"deeply moving exploration\" and \"timely and timeless,\" suggesting a positive recommendation. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strongly positive descriptors ('deeply moving,' 'timely and timeless') indicating clear enthusiasm for the production, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full review's tone.",
