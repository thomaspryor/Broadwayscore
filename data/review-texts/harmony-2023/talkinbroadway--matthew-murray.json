Given single excerpt warning and mixed qualifier, scoring at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses a strong positive sentiment, indicating that the show is lovable despite some flaws. The tone suggests an enthusiastic recommendation, aligning with the upper range of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a generally positive sentiment, but acknowledges flaws. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic expresses genuine affection ('hard not to love it back') while acknowledging the show has flaws ('stumbles'), indicating a solid but qualified recommendation.",
