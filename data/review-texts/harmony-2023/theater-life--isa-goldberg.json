    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Mixed signals with positive opening ('beautifully stumbles into our hearts') but mentions production 'implodes' and pacing issues. Single excerpt creates uncertainty about full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view with some reservations. The musical 'stumbles into our hearts' indicates a positive impact, but 'implodes with the rush of history' suggests some issues. The direction and choreography are praised, supporting a positive classification. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review states the musical \"stumbles into our hearts\" and praises the direction and choreography, although it notes the production \"implodes with the rush of history.\" This suggests a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt presents sharply contradictory sentiments: while the show 'beautifully... stumbles into our hearts' with earnest direction and occasional sparkle, it simultaneously 'implodes with the rush of history' and maintains a pace that is 'not necessarily an urgent one,' suggesting significant structural flaws alongside emotional resonance.",
