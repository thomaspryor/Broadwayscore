  "fullText": "The show — basically a fable — doesn’t meet the moment as much as the moment crashes over it. It’s hard to see the thing itself amid the currents of extra-theatrical context, but there’s no use in ignoring that context, which happens to be the point of Harmony. You may want to perform your little ditties and step to the side, but history will find you.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "What’s the use of frivolity in an unstable time? That’s the question asked, in form and content, by Harmony, a light curio of a musical that comes with a riptide of political anxiety. The songs are by Barry Manilow; the setting is Germany in the years before World War II; the tonal incongruity you might deduce from that juxtaposition is, mostly, the point. Harmony takes for its subject the Comedian Harmonists, a sextet of singers formed in Berlin at the end of the 1920s, who toured the world unt",
