  "fullText": "The show — basically a fable — doesn’t meet the moment as much as the moment crashes over it. It’s hard to see the thing itself amid the currents of extra-theatrical context, but there’s no use in ignoring that context, which happens to be the point of Harmony. You may want to perform your little ditties and step to the side, but history will find you.",
