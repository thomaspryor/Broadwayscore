    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges improvements and 'admirable, hard-working professionalism' but explicitly states it's not a triumph. The mixed language suggests it's competent but uninspiring. Low confidence due to limited excerpt text. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges improvements but ultimately concludes that the show 'rarely rises above a level of admirable, hard-working professionalism,' indicating a lack of strong recommendation. The verdict from the aggregator also supports a negative impression. | Gemini: The review states that the show is not a triumph, but also acknowledges improvements. The phrase \"admirable, hard-working professionalism\" suggests a mixed, rather than negative, assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging improvements from previous productions, the critic finds the show merely competent ('admirable, hard-working professionalism') rather than exceptional, explicitly denying it 'triumph' status. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
