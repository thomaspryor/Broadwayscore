  "bwwExcerpt": "It took a quarter century for Manilow and Sussman to bring “Harmony” to New York, presented  by the National Yiddish Theater Folksbiene, which seemed fitting, and was one reason it was exciting. So much has changed since then in the world; so much has changed in the last month! The show feels now like an occasionally enjoyable entertainment more than something we need to see.",
