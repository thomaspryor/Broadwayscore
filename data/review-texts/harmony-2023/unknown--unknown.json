    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the timeliness of the musical's message, suggesting a positive view of its relevance. However, without more context, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score in the lower range of Positive. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the show is timely and relevant, which implies a positive, albeit potentially qualified, recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt emphasizes the show's fortuitous timing and relevant message regarding antisemitism, suggesting the production has social value, but lacks specific praise for execution or a strong recommendation. As only one curated excerpt is available, the overall verdict remains unclear.",
