  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It is unfortunate that, while his choreography is energetic and enjoyable, Warren Carlyle’s direction fails to find much subtext for the actors. Everyone seems to be saying and singing exactly what they feel. It makes for a flat theatrical experience. And when there is dramatic movement, it feels artificial.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic acknowledges energetic choreography but finds the direction fundamentally flawed, creating a 'flat theatrical experience' with 'artificial' dramatic movement. This is a clear negative assessment despite some positives. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the direction and overall theatrical experience as flat, despite some praise for choreography. The negative tone suggests a lack of recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the choreography as energetic and enjoyable, but criticizes the direction for lacking subtext and creating a flat theatrical experience. This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the excerpt acknowledges energetic choreography, it heavily criticizes the direction for lacking subtext and creating an artificial, flat theatrical experience that fails to engage dramatically.",
