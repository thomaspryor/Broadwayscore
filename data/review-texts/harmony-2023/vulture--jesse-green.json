    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic uses 'but dramatically inert' as a clear negative judgment that outweighs any mild positives like 'earnest and well-meaning', indicating the show fails theatrically. | GPT-4o: The review describes the musical as 'dramatically inert', suggesting a lack of engagement or excitement, which indicates a negative recommendation. | Gemini: The review describes the musical as 'earnest and well-meaning' which suggests some positive aspects, but ultimately concludes it is 'dramatically inert,' indicating a lack of compelling drama. This positions it in the 'Mixed' category.",
