  "bwwExcerpt": "This has not been a great season for Broadway musicals based on movies. 'Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown' was a total bust, and 'Catch Me If You Can' was a disappointment, too. So it's a pleasure to find that 'Sister Act,' a new adaptation of the 1992 Whoopi Goldberg film comedy, is energetic, hilarious and thoroughly enjoyable. In spite of a few issues, it has all the makings of a feel-good hit.",
