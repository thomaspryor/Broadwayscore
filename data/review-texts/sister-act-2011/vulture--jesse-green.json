It acknowledges its ability to entertain but suggests it lacks lasting impact. | Kimi: The review acknowledges the show is competent and entertaining ('cheerful,' 'efficient') but dismisses it as artistically unmemorable ('forgettable') and commercially motivated rather than creatively substantial. This balanced but unenthusiastic assessment lands squarely in Mixed territory.",
