  "bwwExcerpt": "I wish I could report that the singing nuns from the Church of Philly Soul are giving those perky Mormons in Africa a run for their money in the unholy hilarity department. But when the jubilant choral numbers subside, as inevitably they must, 'Sister Act' slumps back into bland musical-theater grooves and mostly lacks the light of invigorating inspiration.",
