  "bwwExcerpt": "Big, glitzy numbers are the toast of Broadway musicals. The only thing better? Big, glitzy numbers . . . with nuns! 'Sister Act' has plenty of both - and it's one of the season's happiest surprises. Menken evokes the lush, funky sound of Philly soul without falling into mere pastiche: 'When I Find My Baby' starts off like bedroom R&B before the lyrics take a hilarious turn. 'Take Me to Heaven' and 'Spread the Love Around' bloom into full-throttle disco epics, the latter building up to an ecstatic finale.",
