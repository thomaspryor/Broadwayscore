  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Jerry Zaks told The New York Times that he and script reviser Douglas Carter Beane were brought in to retool the West End version of 'Sister Act' for Broadway by making the show more believable and less cartoonish. If they've actually done their job, then London must have seen a real doozy. A ramshackle yet agreeable film comedy with plausibility issues has here become an even more ramshackle and outlandish musical comedy that consistently diminishes its source.",
