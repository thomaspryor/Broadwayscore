  "bwwExcerpt": "But while the film's nun numbers (like 'I Will Follow Him') were giddy and infectious in a more subtle way, this show opts for glitz, line dancing, and absurdity, as the nuns rap, sing about their 'booties,' and practically engage in Busby Berkeley configurations. Less would have been more. The score is uneven (there's a lyric that goes 'If you got stigmata/Show me yours, I'll show you mine'), but Alan Menken has cooked up some pleasing sounds derived from Philadelphia soul and other nostalgic genres, in between homages to Sondheim and to his own 'Beauty and the Beast.' And you watch a lot of the show smiling despite yourself. A work of art? No, it isn't even Priscilla. But you could have way less fun with religious people.",
