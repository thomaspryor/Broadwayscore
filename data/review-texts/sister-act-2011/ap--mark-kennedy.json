  "bwwExcerpt": "Calibrated to be frothy, giggly and yet often poignant, the Jerry Zaks-directed musical is based on the 1992 movie of the same name starring Whoopi Goldberg, who is now producing. This is a musical that hits all the right spots, achieving something close to Broadway grace. It helps that the musical has great original tunes by songwriter Alan Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater that skitters from Motown, to soul and funk, to disco and even a little jokey Barry White. Menken and Slater, who also teamed up for 'The Little Mermaid,' know perfectly how to switch up the mood and tempo. (See how their 'Take Me to Heaven' transforms from a Donna Summer-like number at the beginning to a religious hymn by the end.)",
