  "bwwExcerpt": "Here we go again. Another film to stage adaptation, but this one's switched it up a bit. 'Sister Act,' the 1992 movie starring Whoopi Goldberg featured a jukebox songbook of disco era tunes. On Broadway, the music is all original and Whoopi is now the producer. How does it rate? Let's just say it's hard to resist when the sisters and a few brothers make such a joyful noise.",
