  "bwwExcerpt": "It's all good fun and, in the end, not bad theology either. In the show, after a choral performance that rakes in the crowds, The Inquirer critic is supposed to have written: \"If you see only one Roman Catholic Mass this season, let this be it.\" Far be it from me to suggest only one Mass per season among the faithful, and particularly a Broadway Mass-style experience. But OK, let this be it.",
