    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise calling the show 'gentle, touching' and 'both funny and poignant' with no negatives mentioned. However, confidence is low due to limited text from a single curated quote that may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'funny and poignant' and avoids being 'maudlin', indicating a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as \"gentle, touching, funny, and poignant,\" indicating a positive assessment. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the show's emotional balance, describing it as successfully funny and poignant without being overly sentimental. As a single clearly positive excerpt, it warrants the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
