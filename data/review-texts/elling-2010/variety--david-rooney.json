The lack of full context and single excerpt warning suggest a lower confidence in the score. | Gemini: The review states that the play feels \"airless and inconsequential\", indicating a negative assessment despite praising the actors. | Kimi: While the critic praises the two lead performers as 'terrific,' the overall verdict dismisses the production as 'airless and inconsequential,' suggesting it lacks the necessary substance and vitality for a satisfying Broadway experience.",
