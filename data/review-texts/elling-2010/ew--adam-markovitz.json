    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: B- grade indicates positive but qualified recommendation. Acknowledges funny and poignant moments but expresses significant reservations about readiness for Broadway. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges both humorous and poignant moments but ultimately suggests the play isn't fully ready for Broadway. The B- grade aligns with a mixed assessment, indicating some positive elements but overall reservations. | Gemini: The review excerpt mentions funny and poignant moments, but also states that the play doesn't feel quite ready for Broadway, suggesting a mixed assessment. The B- grade further supports this classification. | Kimi: While the critic notes funny and poignant moments, the concluding assessment that the show 'doesn't feel quite ready for the Broadway stage' represents a significant reservation that tempers the mild positivity of the B- grade.",
