  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Elling,\" a delicate parable about male outcasts that combines elements of \"The Odd Couple\" and \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" might have been well served in an intimate Off-Broadway theater. Instead, it has been poorly chosen as a star vehicle for Brendan Fraser, who is making a horrifically bad Broadway debut.",
