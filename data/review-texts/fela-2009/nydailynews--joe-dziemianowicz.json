    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic uses unqualified praise with 'brilliant' and 'rousing life', highlighting multiple strong elements (music, dancing, lead performance) with no reservations. The 80/100 original rating confirms this is in the Rave bucket range. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language such as 'brilliant', 'rousing', 'infectious', and 'spectacular', indicating an enthusiastic recommendation. The original rating of 80 supports a high score in the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as 'brilliant,' 'rousing,' 'infectious,' 'spectacular,' and 'magnetic.' Given the critic's rating of 80, this falls into the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The review offers unqualified praise using superlatives like 'brilliant,' 'spectacular,' and 'magnetic' to describe the production, and the critic's original rating of 80 supports a strong positive classification. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
