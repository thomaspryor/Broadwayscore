  "bwwExcerpt": "It's not an epic political tale that Hnath outlines in 'Hillary and Clinton,' which had its official opening Thursday at Broadway's Golden Theatre. Rather, in 80 muscular minutes, Hnath, author of the trenchant 'A Doll's House, Part 2' - another marriage play - is providing a mere snapshot. But in that fleeting picture, he embeds a persuasive case for the codependency that rules them both, one that allows their partnership to survive, even in the aftermath of embarrassing, even humiliating, disclosures.",

This suggests a positive recommendation with some reservations about the play itself. | Gemini: The review states that the play is flawed but the actors make it work, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: While acknowledging the play is flawed, the critic states it works due to the extraordinary performances, constituting a qualified but clear recommendation to see the show.",
