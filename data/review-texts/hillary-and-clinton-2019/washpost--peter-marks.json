This suggests a positive recommendation with some reservations about the play itself. | Gemini: The review states that the play is flawed but the actors make it work, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: While acknowledging the play is flawed, the critic states it works due to the extraordinary performances, constituting a qualified but clear recommendation to see the show.",
