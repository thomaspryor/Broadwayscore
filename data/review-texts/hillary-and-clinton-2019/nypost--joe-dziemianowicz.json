  "bwwExcerpt": "Not even two of the brightest stage stars - Laurie Metcalf and John Lithgow - can make 'Hillary and Clinton' more than a wispy exercise. The barbed comedy that opened Thursday night on Broadway doesn't lack for laughs. But as it rehashes old wounds, it offers no fresh insights into either political or personal realms.",
