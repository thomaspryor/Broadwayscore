  "bwwExcerpt": "Lithgow and Metcalf, both Emmy-winning veterans of network sitcoms, know every comedic beat to hit. (The set designed by Chloe Lamford and lighting by Hugh Vanstone reminded me of watching politics unfold on TV, something we've all become all-too-accustomed to in the last several years.) But it is Metcalf, who seems to have become the exceptional director Joe Mantello's muse of late (she earned a Tony for their previous collaboration in Three Tall Women and they've announced their next collaboration will be Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?) who elevates this production with devastating take-downs of her her husband like, 'You know given the chance I will eclipse you.' Regardless of where you fall on the political spectrum, the repercussions of that line, 11 years later, will knock the wind out of you.",
