    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory. The review suggests the play has effective moments but implies limitations in other areas. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a Mixed review. The text highlights moments of genuine intimacy but implies the play is uneven, focusing on specific strengths rather than overall praise. | Gemini: The critic's rating is 60, which falls into the mixed bucket. The review highlights some positive aspects but doesn't offer a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic's own 60 rating places this firmly in Mixed territory. While praising the lead performances and marriage scenes, the qualified phrasing ('works best when,' 'finding moments') implies unevenness elsewhere in the production.",
