  "bwwExcerpt": "There's no shortage of scintillating elements in Hillary and Clinton. First and foremost are two giants of the American stage, Laurie Metcalf and John Lithgow, giving wryly amusing - and occasionally poignant - performances that tantalize with private glimpses into very public figures. Then there's playwright Lucas Hnath, who seems ideally equipped to explore a modern political power union, having mined subversive humor and stimulating insights on marriage and gender dynamics in A Doll's House, Part 2, which won Metcalf her first Tony Award. And not to forget Joe Mantello, one of the most reliably incisive directors working on Broadway.",

This indicates a mixed reaction. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges 'intermittent rewards' but the comparison to an SNL sketch suggests superficiality rather than the intended dramatic depth. The concession keeps it from being fully negative, but the overall assessment is disappointing.",
