    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises lead performance enthusiastically and finds the play offers something distinctive beyond typical political drama. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be cherry-picked positive content. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Laurie Metcalf's performance and suggests the play offers a unique perspective. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review praises Laurie Metcalf's performance and suggests the play is more than just recycled observations. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I've scored it as positive with medium confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for Metcalf's performance and frames the play's unconventional approach as a strength, distinguishing it from superficial biographical treatments, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full verdict.",
