  "bwwExcerpt": "Metcalf is alternately steely, frantic, no-nonsense, desperate and steadfast - and she makes every one of those transitions while looking simultaneously backward and forward. She's cautious. She's deliberate. She's beyond smart. She will never be president. Lithgow keeps it extremely light playing a Bill Clinton that would delight a Trump voter. He's not the bumpkin John Travolta gives us in 'Primary Colors,' but he does eat pizza, wears obscenely short jogging trunks and has no shame when it comes to seducing voters.",
