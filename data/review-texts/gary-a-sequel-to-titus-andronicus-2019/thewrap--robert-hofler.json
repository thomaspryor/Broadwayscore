Finally.\n\nWay back in the late 20th century, one of the great disappointments was that Ludlam, head of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, passed away before he could stage Shakespeare’s first, bloodiest and worst-written tragedy, “Titus Andronicus,” in Central Park for Joe Papp.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Mac borrows lightly from \"Waiting for Godot,\" but unlike Samuel Beckett, Mac doesn't indulge in repetition to the point of tedium. Lane has played this kind of absurdist character before. Here, he even uses Harpo Marx's horn to goose a laugh; yet, despite all the gags, this clown-turned-worker-turned-Fool is ultimately very poignant in his quest to save the world. Meanwhile, the usually flighty Nielsen has never been more comically stolid. Watching Lane's gnat of a character pick away at her fil",
