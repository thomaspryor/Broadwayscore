  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Mac’s ‘Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus’ is utter crap. They are tortured on stage by a playwright who’s given them some of the worst material I’ve ever seen on a stage, Broadway or otherwise...If there had been an intermission for this 90 minute play, no one would have returned...There is no play...There is just nowhere to go except in the abyss. If only they could remain on that stage and do something else. Anything else.”\n\nRead more",
