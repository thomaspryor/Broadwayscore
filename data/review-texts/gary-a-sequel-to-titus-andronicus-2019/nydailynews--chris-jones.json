  "fullText": "ExpandNathan Lane in “Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus” on Broadway starring Nathan Lane. (Julieta Cervantes)\n\nWhat’s the difference between a clown and a fool?\n\nYou might think the question moot, given the ample prevalence of both types in and around the White House. But it’s the central issue in “Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus,” the weird new Broadway play from Taylor Mac that, depending on your tolerance for the comedically scatological, circuitous and nihilistic, will either transfix you or drive you screaming from the theater hoping never again to encounter so many corpses with flatulence.\n\nThere's no middle aisle at this one, folks. Consider yourself warned.\n\nThe title character in this whacked-out play, a self-declared sequel to William Shakespeare’s whacked-out “Titus Andronicus” and as subversive a comedy as Broadway has ever seen, is what you might call a clown with ambition — which is a pretty good description of the real-life actor who happens to be playing that role with formidable ferocity, Nathan Lane.\n\nLane — often described as the greatest comic actor of his generation, at least on stage — has long let it be known that he finds such a descriptor as limiting as it is flattering. He doesn’t want his obituary to read, “here lies a master farceur” (although I, for one, would settle fine for that); he wants to be an artiste who made a difference. And that also happens to be true of Mac, an iconic downtown performance artist who, in middle age, has come to realize the limitations of merely waking up the already woke, like 200 overeducated hipsters at a time.\n\nNathan Lane and Kristine Nielsen in “Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus” on Broadway. (Julieta Cervantes)\n\nMac wants to be a player, too. You know, beyond being the subject of Ivy League dissertations. As they say in business school, Mac wants to scale up his subversion, which he clearly has decided means amping everything up and finding producing and director collaborators who know better how to reach the people. Donald J. Trump probably helped him realize that.\n\nSo this pair of guys, Mac and Lane, far more similar than you might think, have thrown the dual complexity of their collective ambition into the main character. Gary is a clown who has cheated death and, in return for being allowed by his masters to stay among the living, has been tasked with cleaning up all the corpses at the end of “Titus Andronicus.” And on Santo Loquasto’s set, an eye-bulging Mount Trashmore of bodies, that’s a pretty big job.\n\nEven by the standards of Elizabethan revenge tragedy, “Titus Andronicus” really piles up the dead, many of whom were decapitated, mutilated or otherwise abused in the course of the tragedy, a monument to how the powerful and the piqued can spurt rivers of blood.\n\nIn this 90-minute show, directed by George C. Wolfe, the corpses are rendered as giant rag dolls, flexible dummies that the three characters in the show can poke, prod and pick up on their backs. Aside from Gary, you’ve got two other caustic, Thenardier-like trolls, Carol (Julie White) and a maid named Janice (Kristine Nielsen). They all have the crap jobs in life — cleaning up other people’s mess.\n\nMuch of that cleanup — and thus much of the action of the play — involves the removal of the internal fluids inside the cavities of these bodies through aspiration or good old-fashioned sucking. I kid not; this may be too much for you. But it’s rendered humorously. Lane’s Gary has one of those wa-wa horns attached to his body to punctuate the unpredictable trajectories of all these bodily fluids. Death never has been so mocked on the Great White Way.\n\nLane is quite spectacularly good here — he’s in deeper than I’ve ever seen him, and I’ve been watching him for years. He’s more vulnerable, too. His ambition — to be the fool, the kind of Stephen Colbert-like figure who speaks truth to power, rather than the clown guy who only offers nonideological escape — is what drives this performance, remarkable in all kinds of ways.\n\nHe’s often very funny — as, to cite just one moment, when he comes to realize the magnitude of the task in hand, a little comic clown having to mop up what the patriarchy has piled up right in front of his face. It’s all a metaphor for the pain, and the necessity, of resistance. Lane is always at his best when he shows you the world-weariness of his allotted role in life, a realization that only grows as we age. Never has that been clearer than in “Gary,” as important and risky a role that he ever has assumed. Even if some of his normal public will smell a bait and switch.\n\nThey should sniff harder. \"Gary\" sometimes gets lost in digressions and Mac sometimes lets repetitive, undisciplined detail overshadow his thrilling verbosity and reach for ideas. There is no escape from the cockney comics into quiet, even though that would have been helpful for a beat or two. And on the great track of self-awareness, Lane is further along with Mac, whose best work will require a reckoning with complacency and self that still lies ahead. I can’t wait for that pending humility.\n\nBut Gary\" is unlike anything you’ve ever seen and, through its very presence on Broadway, an act of clear desperation and an important meditation on the role of the comic in a geopolitical hellhole. “We’re going to put an end to all this tragedy,” someone says, well knowing that is entirely impossible. The world ain’t capable.\n\nExpandAutoplayImage 1 of 19Based on the celebrated life of musical legend Tina Turner, Tina: The Tina Turner Musical follows the life of the hitmaker, played by Adrienne Warren, from her early days in Nutbush, Tennessee, to her both famous and infamous collaboration with former husband Ike Turner, to her booming solo career in the 1980s that solidified her as a force to be reckoned with in rock n’ roll. Previews for “Tina: The Tina Turner Musical” begin on Oct. 12, 2019 and the show opens on Nov. 7, 2019. (Manuel Harlan)",

However, the single excerpt warning suggests this may not represent the full review, so the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on Nathan Lane's performance, describing it as \"spectacularly good\" and \"remarkable in all kinds of ways.\" Given the single excerpt, I am placing it in the positive bucket and using the upper end of the range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Nathan Lane's performance using superlatives like 'spectacularly good' and 'remarkable,' indicating a strong recommendation driven by the lead actor's work. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this scores at the upper end of the Positive bucket, though confidence remains low without the full review context.",
