  "bwwExcerpt": "Playwright Taylor Mac's Gary has likewise cannibalized Titus with savage relish. What Mac excretes from the feast is a pungent, runny substance that won't be to everyone's taste. Still, give this prodigious artist credit for trying to transmute the Bard's crassest, bloodiest play into an ethical work of theater.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic uses visceral, unflattering imagery ('excretes,' 'pungent, runny substance') while acknowledging artistic ambition. Single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked from a more positive overall review. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the ambitious attempt but suggests that the result may not appeal to all audiences, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review uses negative imagery (\"excretes\", \"pungent, runny substance\") but also acknowledges the artist's attempt to create an ethical work. The phrase \"won't be to everyone's taste\" suggests a mixed reaction. | Kimi: The excerpt admires the 'prodigious artist' and their bold ambition to adapt Shakespeare's bloodiest play, but describes the result as a 'pungent, runny substance' using excretory imagery that suggests the work is difficult to stomach and not broadly recommendable.",
