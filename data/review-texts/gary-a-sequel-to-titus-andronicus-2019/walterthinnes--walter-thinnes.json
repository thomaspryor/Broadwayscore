  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The 'source material' - Shakespeare's bloodiest play 'Titus Andronicus.' This isn't really a sequel…In reality it gives the playwright a chance to ruminate…as the 'maids' set everything right…[they] are some of the most talented stage performers of our day…[the] script whirls and eddies on whimsical wings and then settles in for prescriptive changes…It is a riveting if uneven route…Run to see this as you will never see something this creative and crazy on Broadway again.\"\n\nRead more",
