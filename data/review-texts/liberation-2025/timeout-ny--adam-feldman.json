  "dtliExcerpt": "Whitney White’s direction elicits a triumph of ensemble acting whose equipoise is a perfect realization of the play’s own themes. The actors work so well together, and so unselfishly, that it seems absurd to single any of them out.",
  "bwwExcerpt": "Five stars. Bess Wohl's feminist drama keeps the conversation going.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A searching and revealing drama about the achievements and limits of 1970s feminism, Liberation weaves different kinds of conversation into a multilayered narrativeâand, in doing so, serendipitously restores the very word conversation to its roots.\"",
