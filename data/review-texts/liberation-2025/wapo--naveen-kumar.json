  "bwwExcerpt": "But “Liberation” does more than appeal to resistance-frazzled nerves, an ameliorative quality it shares with last season’s “Good Night, and Good Luck,” the hit George Clooney vehicle about a free press holding the government to account. Wohl’s ensemble drama is a memory play about a social movement, full of arguments that will ring familiar to many. But it’s rooted in vibrant, complex characters who embody the individual stakes entangled behind efforts at solidarity.        Average Rating: 89.3%"
