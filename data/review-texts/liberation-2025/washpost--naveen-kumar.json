  "fullText": "“Liberation” is timely, but it does more than just appeal to resistance-frazzled audiences. NEW YORK — If you’ve watched with growing alarm as art that preserves thorny histories and agitates for social progress has come under attack, bookmark this page and go buy tickets for “Liberation.” The superb and galvanizing new play by Bess Wohl would undoubtedly earn the derisive label “woke” in the most technical sense: It’s about a consciousness-raising group in 1970s Ohio awakening women to everyday oppression. When I first saw the show in April, off-Broadway at Roundabout Theatre Company before this Broadway transfer, I had the peculiar feeling of wishing its subject felt as nostalgic as its impeccably vintage design. There have been periods over the past 50 years when the primary concerns of second-wave feminism have seemed to be long-settled — and now certainly isn’t one. But “Liberation” does more than appeal to resistance-frazzled nerves, an ameliorative quality it shares with last season’s “Good Night, and Good Luck,” the hit George Clooney vehicle about a free press holding the government to account. Wohl’s ensemble drama is a memory play about a social movement, full of arguments that will ring familiar to many. But it’s rooted in vibrant, complex characters who embody the individual stakes entangled behind efforts at solidarity. Yes, “Liberation” flips back to a timely chapter in women’s history. (Mothers, take your friends and daughters, and vice versa.) It’s also an enthralling, emotional knockout and the first must-see play of the season. The audience is greeted by a surrogate for the playwright, played by Susannah Flood, who brings a sunny-sharp ease to the animating question: What went wrong back then, when her mom convened this group, that led us to where we are now? (Wohl’s mother worked at Ms. Magazine, but the playwright notes the story is fictional.) Boundaries blur between now and then as Flood plays both the inquiring narrator and a young version of her mother in the past. The women Wohl assembles in a suburban gymnasium might seem like a formulaic bunch were it not for the uniformly dynamite cast, directed with elegant precision by Whitney White. (Following her work on “Jaja’s African Hair Braiding,” White is becoming Broadway’s preeminent interpreter of women-driven ensembles.) They occupy social positions and express various points of view relevant to the movement: There’s a radical Italian immigrant (Irene Sofia Lucio) in need of a green card. An aspiring professional (Audrey Corsa) resisting a mother-approved marriage while facing gender discrimination at work. A longtime housewife (Betsy Aidem) resentful of her ungrateful husband. A broke lesbian (Adina Verson) living out of her car with a pet bird. Each one is tremendously detailed — the earthy, ’70s-chic costumes by Qween Jean and hair and wig design by Nikiya Mathis are indispensable in this regard. Still, as issue plays go, “Liberation” wears no disguises: It’s an effort to engage with social history through messy but representative characters. The women, who attend the group over several years, illustrate the aims of second-wave feminism — the right to self-determination via reproductive freedoms, financial independence and more — on a personal scale. (There’s a man, too, played by Charlie Thurston, whose entrance late in the first act nearly comes as a shock.) Wohl also includes Black characters who indicate the movement’s limitations around accounting for race and other measures of difference. Kristolyn Lloyd plays a budding scholar from New York, in town to care for her ailing mother, while Kayla Davion plays a mom of four boys who comes in searching for a lost backpack. (No wonder the group doesn’t include any young mothers like her, she notes — it meets at 6 p.m. on a school night.) Both actors are exceptional and are given an opportunity to step back from the story and comment on their place in it, a self-conscious nod to Wohl’s position as a White writer. “Stick to what you know,” Lloyd tells the narrator, after a standout scene that finds the two Black women toying with kinship before starkly disagreeing on a central question: Can a movement focused on and led by White women ever square with the struggle for Black civil rights? The play is full of discursive moments like these — impasses, tangents and pivots when its investigation of the past isn’t sure where to go next. The championship flags and scoreboard mounted on the back wall, indications of victories achieved in linear fashion, are a clever bit of visual irony (the set is by David Zinn and the time-warpy lighting is by Cha See). The reality that progress isn’t straightforward or guaranteed is a lesson every generation has to learn through experience. In that way, the narrator isn’t a stand-in just for the playwright, but for anyone trying to figure out how we got here. By framing “Liberation” as a personal quest for one daughter to understand her mom, Wohl also makes a powerful point about the legacy of social movements. For as many books are pulled from libraries or paintings put into storage, there are exponentially more people with firsthand stories to share about their own pursuit of freedom. We can always choose to turn to each other and listen. Liberation, through Jan. 11 at the James Earl Jones Theatre in New York. 2 hours and 30 minutes with an intermission. liberationbway.com.",
