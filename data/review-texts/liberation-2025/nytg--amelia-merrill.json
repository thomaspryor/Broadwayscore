  "dtliExcerpt": "There is something different about Liberation’s Broadway production. Bess Wohl’s play still features the same tight ensemble as in its Off-Broadway premiere earlier this year, and it is still directed by the unstoppable Whitney White. It still sings and soars in Act 1 and then punches you in the gut in Act 2. And it is still essential theatregoing this Broadway season.",
