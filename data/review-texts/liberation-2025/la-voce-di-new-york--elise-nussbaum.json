    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('sharply imagined', 'heartbreaking', 'unexpectedly funny') with clear praise for the production's quality and relevance. Given single excerpt warning and clearly positive tone, scoring in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, describing the show as 'sharply imagined' and 'unexpectedly funny,' indicating a positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses positive language such as \"sharply imagined\", \"heartbreaking\", and \"unexpectedly funny\", suggesting a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt provides unqualified praise for the production's imagination, emotional impact, and contemporary relevance, with strong commendations for its tone and social urgency. Following the single-excerpt guideline for clearly positive quotes, this scores at the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
