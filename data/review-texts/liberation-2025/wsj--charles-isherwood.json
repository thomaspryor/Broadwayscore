However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights the terrific performances and lively humor, suggesting a positive experience, but the lack of a full review and the single excerpt warrant a score in the middle of the positive range.",
