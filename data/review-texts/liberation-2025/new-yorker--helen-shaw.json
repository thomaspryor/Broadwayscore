  "dtliExcerpt": "In Bess Wohl’s galvanizing show of the hour “Liberation,” directed by Whitney White, the women in a nineteen-seventies consciousness-raising group wrestle with questions political (should they join a general strike?) and personal (can they celebrate their own naked bodies?) while building solidarity and coalition. Susannah Flood, in the role of a lifetime, addresses us directly, playing both Wohl’s avatar and Lizzie, a fictionalized version of Wohl’s own mother.",
