  "bwwExcerpt": "By no means do I want to give the impression that “Liberation” is the kind of good-for-you didactic show that feels like an assignment. Not only does its sustained pace make the story downright suspenseful — we quickly become invested in these women and wonder what will become of them — but spending time in their company is also an unadulterated pleasure. Directed with sensitivity by Whitney White and performed by a cast preternaturally in sync, the production looks at community and individuality, determination and self-determination, in an elegiac and impassioned manner.",

  "fullText": "For the past 45 years, Margie has had the same full-time job: looking after her family. She’s compiled a three-page list of all the tasks she does around the house and around the clock, while her husband doesn’t lift a finger. Divorce is not an option, though. “I’ve never paid a bill,” Margie says with dry despair. “I don’t have a bank account. I can’t drive.” So she daydreams about stabbing him.\n\nWe are in 1970, when such indentured labor was common. Yet the women listening to Margie (Betsy Aidem) in an Ohio feminist consciousness-raising circle are still shocked. So is the audience watching Bess Wohl’s “Liberation,” which opened Tuesday night at the James Earl Jones Theater on Broadway after an Off Broadway run last winter. The miracle of this play is that the circle feels as if it is extending to embrace us all.\n\nBy no means do I want to give the impression that “Liberation” is the kind of good-for-you didactic show that feels like an assignment. Not only does its sustained pace make the story downright suspenseful — we quickly become invested in these women and wonder what will become of them — but spending time in their company is also an unadulterated pleasure. Directed with sensitivity by Whitney White and performed by a cast preternaturally in sync, the production looks at community and individuality, determination and self-determination, in an elegiac and impassioned manner.\n\nAnd it’s consistently funny, too. Wohl (“Small Mouth Sounds,” “Camp Siegfried”) blesses her characters with a humor that blends precisely calibrated degrees of weary sarcasm, biting wit and droll resignation, along with the kind of pent-up fury that comes from being told repeatedly to suck it up and stay in your lane. Take, for example, the irrepressible Isidora (Irene Sofia Lucio): Reminiscing about a rough childhood in which she was pretty much raised by nuns, she calls them “monsters” and then quickly adds, “but at least they were women in leadership positions.”\n\nThe action mostly takes place in 1970 and 1973, with the dates unobtrusively appearing on the clock of the rec-center basketball court (lovingly recreated by the scenic designer David Zinn) where the meetings are held, and some of it is set decades later. Connecting it all is a narrator, the daughter of the group’s initiator, Lizzie (the superb Susannah Flood in both parts).",
