    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic calls this a 'rare production' where performances are so definitive that future versions will be 'pale imitations' - extremely high praise suggesting this is the benchmark production. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the performances, suggesting a unique and definitive production. Due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low, but the language indicates a rave review. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses strong praise for the performances, suggesting a highly positive experience. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it at the higher end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers effusive praise for the performances, suggesting this production is definitive and unmatched by future iterations. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence remains low regarding the full review's overall verdict. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
