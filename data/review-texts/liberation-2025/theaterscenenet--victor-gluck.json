    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes show as 'ambitious' and 'engrossing' which are positive terms, but 'attempt' suggests it may not fully succeed. With only one curated quote available, confidence is low and score is in lower positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'ambitious' and 'engrossing,' suggesting a positive view. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, calling the show \"ambitious\" and \"engrossing.\" Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it as positive with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt uses clearly positive evaluative language ('engrossing,' 'ambitious') indicating a solid recommendation, though confidence is low due to the single curated excerpt format which may not represent the full review.",
