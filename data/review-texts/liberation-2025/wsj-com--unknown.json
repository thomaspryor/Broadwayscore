The principal cast and creative team remain the same. Below is the Journal’s review of the off-Broadway production.\n\n“Why does it feel somehow like it’s all slipping away? And how do we get it back?” That lament is spoken by the narrator of “Liberation,” a funny if meandering new play by Bess Wohl presented by the Roundabout Theatre Company that explores the idealistic aims and frequent frustrations of women in the feminist movement in the early 1970s.\n\nCopyright ©2026 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
