  "fullText": "When Bess Wohl's Liberation began performances off-Broadway at the Roundabout's Laura Pels Theatre earlier this year, it was just after Trump's second inauguration. The time-hopping memory play—which looks at a multigenerational group of second-wave feminists through a world-weary modern-day lens—registered as capital-I Important. Though not in a didactic, dullsville way. In a Heidi Chronicles kind of way.\n\nNow, as it opens on Broadway—while women are losing their rights not to mention their voices—Liberation, directed by Whitney White (Jaja's African Hair Braiding), feels eerily prescient, as if Wohl possessed some sort of crystal ball.\n\nLizzie (Susannah Flood), the play's present-day narrator and stand-in for Wohl, is as flummoxed as the rest of us. Her search for answers takes us back to the 1970s, where, in the basement of an Ohio rec center, her mother and a few strangers-turned-fast friends started their own revolution.\n\nIn addition to Lizzie's mom—a journalist who covered obituaries and weddings—the CR group includes housewife Margie (Betsy Aidem, drily hilarious and wonderfully moving), whose kids are grown and husband is retired. Straight-talking Sicilian immigrant Isidora (Irene Sofia Lucio) is also married \"but really only for the green card.\" A second Dora (Audrey Corsa) \"didn't read the flyer carefully enough\" and thought she was going to a knitting circle. There's Susan (Adina Verson), aka Susie Hurricane, who lives in her car with a bird. Editor Celeste (Kristolyn Lloyd) is writing her own book about Black women's liberation; she believes that \"a woman speaking uninterrupted is a radical act.\"\n\nSo much of Liberation—Wohl's best play, and she's had some excellent ones, including Small Mouth Sounds and Make Believe—feels like a radical act. This sensational cast, all in top form. The Act 2 nude scene, where the women say what they love and what they hate about their bodies. The brutal honesty: \"You want a revolution,\" Margie says to Lizzie, \"but you want it on your terms and you don't want to have to give up anything to get it.\"\n\nAnd the closing minutes, where Lizzie's mom tells her inquisitive daughter that she's totally off track: \"I think it's so interesting that you're asking what we did wrong, instead of asking what's wrong with the world.\" We really have been asking the wrong questions all along, haven't we?",
