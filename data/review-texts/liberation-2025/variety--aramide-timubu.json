However, in writer Bess Wohl&#8216;s new Broadway show, \"Liberation,\" she manages to do just that.\n\n\tDirected by Whitney White, \"Liberation\" is set in the 1970s and in the present. In the years following the Civil Rights Movement, shepherded by Black Americans, women were fighting to find an equal place in society. Now, a half-century later, the American government is clawing back several hard-earned wins. Bridging the time periods, \"Liberation\" addresses what was and who we've become as a society. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDisney Sees Brisk Ad Sales for Oscars While Spotlighting Live Shows (EXCLUSIVE)",
