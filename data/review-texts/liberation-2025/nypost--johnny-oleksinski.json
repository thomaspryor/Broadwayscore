  "dtliExcerpt": "All of the performances are terrific, perfectly pitched by director Whitney White, and the actresses click formidably as a unit. However, as individuals, Susan, Isadora, Celeste and Dora are there, in large part, to deliver punchlines and illustrate points. Two characters are miles more involving than the rest. The soul of “Liberation” belongs to Margie and Lizzie.",
