  "fullText": "ExpandSierra Boggess and David Burka tie the knot in \"It Shoulda Been You.\"\n\nThat's all you need to know about \"It Shoulda Been You,\" a slight musical comedy about a wacky wedding that's small in size but big in cliches.\n\nParents of the bride and groom: Chip Zien and Tyne Daly don't see eye-to-eye with Harriet Harris and Michael X. Martin. (©2015, Joan Marcus)\n\nFortunately, David Hyde Pierce, in his Broadway debut as a director, cast the show with a couple of one-of-a-kind stars who help make up for their run-of-the-mill characters.\n\nMost invaluably, Daly is a nasty hoot as the hard-driving Jewish mother of the bride. Harriet Harris is another source of laughing gas as the hard-driving country-club mother of the groom.\n\nThe script by Brian Hargrove, a sitcom writer married to Pierce, serves some tart zingers. But his lyrics, written with no fewer than five others, are ho-hum. Music by Barbara Anselmi, who conceived the show, is pleasant lite pop. Most songs just express passing thoughts and are vaporous.\n\nStructurally the show is a switcheroosical — one reverse after another. It begins as the veil-wearing Jenny (an appealing Lisa Howard) sings \"I Never Wanted This.\" Her mother (Daly) barges in and reminds her that her younger, slimmer sister Rebecca (Sierra Boggess, mostly wasted) is the one tying the knot.\n\nLisa Howard and Tyne Daly in \"It Shoulda Been You.\" (©2015, Joan Marcus)\n\nAnother reversal comes during a duet with her groom, Brian (David Burtka), and his dad, George (Michael X. Martin). Their soft-shoe number goes from happy bonding to ulterior motive. The big curveball comes post-wedding and turns a show about nutty nuptials into a message musical about acceptance. It all feels a bit forced.\n\nPierce, who won an Emmy on \"Frasier,\" knows from funny, so he moves things briskly on the two-tiered hotel set. And everyone in the cast gets a moment in the spotlight.\n\nIn the end, the show is a harmless diversion. But this is Broadway. \"It Shoulda Been You\" shoulda been better.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review acknowledges some positive elements (cast performances, direction) but concludes it's merely a 'harmless diversion' that 'shoulda been better' for Broadway standards. The final verdict is neither recommendation nor strong discouragement. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as a 'harmless diversion' with some enjoyable performances but ultimately suggests it falls short of Broadway standards. The overall tone is mixed, acknowledging some positives but with notable reservations. | Gemini: The review acknowledges some positives (performances, brisk pacing) but ultimately finds the show slight and cliché-ridden. The final line, \"It Shoulda Been You shoulda been better,\" suggests a mixed to slightly negative overall impression. | Kimi: While the critic praises individual performances (particularly Tyne Daly and Harriet Harris) and finds the direction brisk, the review emphasizes that the material is slight, clichéd, and forced, ultimately concluding that the show disappoints despite its entertainment value.",
