    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt shows clear negative sentiment with visceral metaphors of physical discomfort and criticism of unoriginality. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked negativity from a more balanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses negative metaphors ('hiccups', 'acid reflux') and criticizes the show for lacking originality. The single excerpt and lack of full context suggest a negative tone, but confidence is low due to limited text. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses negative language such as \"not easy to swallow\" and \"wrung dry\", suggesting a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers consistent criticism, comparing the show to physical discomfort ('acid reflux', 'not easy to swallow') and attacking its complete lack of originality ('wrung dry'). While harsh, it lacks the 'disaster' language of a full pan, fitting the Negative bucket.",
