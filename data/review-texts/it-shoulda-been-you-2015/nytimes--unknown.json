  "fullText": "As the father of the bride might put it, “Oy.”\n\n“It Shoulda Been You,” which opened on Tuesday night at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, confirms the sad truth that weddings — those supposed celebrations of everlasting love — bring out the worst in some people. That includes cynics, show-offs, heavy drinkers, envious have-nots and, it would seem, the creators of American musicals.\n\nThe last big wedding-themed show I remember on Broadway was “A Catered Affair” (2008), a singing adaptation of Paddy Chayefsky’s 1956 movie that turned the sentimental tale of a blue-collar bride into a dishwater-gray dirge. “It Shoulda Been You” takes the opposite tack. It’s so aggressively bubbly it gives you the hiccups. Or do I mean acid reflux? In any case, it’s not easy to swallow.\n\nFeaturing a book and lyrics by Brian Hargrove, with music by Barbara Anselmi, this crumbly meringue of a production would seem to be hoping to capitalize on the success of reality television shows about brides behaving badly, as well as cinematic laugh-fests like “Bridesmaids.” But this show, directed by the actor David Hyde Pierce and starring Tyne Daly and Harriet Harris as battling future mothers-in-law, also looks further back for inspiration.\n\nI mean way back, as in the 1920s, when a sappy little comedy called “Abie’s Irish Rose,” by Anne Nichols, became a runaway hit over the strenuous objections of the New York critics. (“Just about as low as good clean fun can get,” wrote Robert Benchley.) That play portrayed the familial furor caused by the altar-bound romance between a Jewish boy and a Catholic girl.\n\nIn “Shoulda,” it’s the bride (Sierra Boggess) who’s Jewish, and the groom (David Burtka) the gentile. But there’s plenty of the same old interdenominational kvetching, except that now it’s set to music, with lyrics such as these, from the title song:\n\nI don’t have a thing against gentiles.\n\nBut everyone knows you never marry\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked negativity from a more balanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses negative metaphors ('hiccups', 'acid reflux') and criticizes the show for lacking originality. The single excerpt and lack of full context suggest a negative tone, but confidence is low due to limited text. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses negative language such as \"not easy to swallow\" and \"wrung dry\", suggesting a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers consistent criticism, comparing the show to physical discomfort ('acid reflux', 'not easy to swallow') and attacking its complete lack of originality ('wrung dry'). While harsh, it lacks the 'disaster' language of a full pan, fitting the Negative bucket.",
