  "bwwExcerpt": "Broadway's so-far stuffy spring season needed to loosen up, and relief arrives with the campy ensemble comedy 'It Shoulda Been You'...Jenny is the emotional heart of the comedy, a hodgepodge of capers and confessions that would probably fall flat in the hands of less experienced performers. As it is, this cast is probably as close to a dream team for a wedding comedy as you can get...A big twist at roughly the halfway point sends 'Shoulda' off in a more serious direction. It feels dated, and it certainly caught me by surprise. 'Shoulda' has a book and lyrics by Brian Hargrove (he's Pierce's husband), and pleasant, if run-of-the-mill, music by Barbara Anselmi. Overall, this is fair-to-middling material that's elevated by a superior cast. It's a good show, but you can't help thinking it shoulda been better.",
