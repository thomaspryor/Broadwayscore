  "fullText": "Chip Zien (from left), Tyne Daly, Harriet Harris and Michael X. Martin in \"It Shoulda Been You.\" \n Joan Marcus \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As far as comedy goes, the most rewarding wedding is the one that goes off the rails. And so Broadway’s new musical “It Shoulda Been You” piles on the mishaps — only the show itself ends up quite the blunder.\n\nAt least it sports a terrific ensemble, led by Tyne Daly and Harriet Harris as warring mothers. These talented, hard-working actors are a joy to watch, and almost make up for the drecky writing.\n\nThe action takes place on a happy day for Rebecca (Sierra Boggess) and Brian (a bland David Burtka, a k a Neil Patrick Harris’ husband): They’re getting married in a fancy hotel, and there might even be a panini station.\n\nToo bad the kids’ mothers, Judy Steinberg (Daly) and Georgette Howard (Harris), can’t stand each other. All the characters are drawn in broad strokes, but those two are the worst — Judy’s an abrasive Jewish loudmouth; Georgette’s a stuck-up, anti-Semitic lush.\n\nStill, it’s amazing what nimble comediennes like Daly and Harris can wring out of the lamest jokes. Book writer/lyricist Brian Hargrove owes a big favor to David Hyde Pierce, his director — and husband — for signing up those two magicians.\n\nThe biggest twist in a show overly full of them is that the lead character isn’t any of those four, but Rebecca’s older sister, Jenny (Lisa Howard). Poor Jenny’s curse isn’t that she’s single and zaftig — it’s that her mother won’t let her forget it.\n\n“You have such a pretty face,” Judy tells her, “if you’d listened to me all these years, skipped a few meals, it’d be you getting married today.” Thanks, Mom!\n\nBusily circling the core group are a demented uncle, hapless help and overly close friends. All are played by people hitting way above the material they’re given, like Edward Hibbert as a cheerily efficient wedding planner, Josh Grisetti as Rebecca’s childhood pal, and Montego Glover (“Memphis”) and “Amazing Race” winner Nick Spangler as, respectively, the bridesmaid and best man.\n\nThe last two lucked out with the funny “Love You Till the Day.” The song boasts a clever twist — “I’ll love you till the day YOU die” — and their slapstick-y performance suggests what might have happened had the entire show been that zany.\n\nBut there’s little anyone can do with Barbara Anselmi’s disposable melodies, lyrics that rhyme “sarong” and “so wrong,” “verklempt” and “dreamt,” or a hugely improbable plot twist that makes “Tony n’ Tina’s Wedding” look like a docu-drama.\n\nAt that show, at least, the audience gets cake.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic calls the show 'quite the blunder' with 'drecky writing' and 'disposable melodies,' while extensively praising the cast. This is a classic pattern where performer praise doesn't redeem an overall negative verdict. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for its 'drecky writing' and 'disposable melodies,' despite praising the performances of the cast. The overall tone suggests the production is not worth seeing, aligning with a negative verdict. | Gemini: The review praises the cast but ultimately finds the writing and plot lacking, calling the show a \"blunder\" and the melodies \"disposable.\" | Kimi: While the critic praises the terrific ensemble cast as a joy to watch, they ultimately judge the show a failure due to drecky writing, disposable melodies, and an implausible plot, explicitly calling it a blunder that wastes its talented performers.",
