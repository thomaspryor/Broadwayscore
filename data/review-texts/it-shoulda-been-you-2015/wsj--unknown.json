Brian Hargrove’s been-there-done-that plot (Tyne Daly’s Jewish mom is a monster of tactlessness, Harriet Harris’s Catholic mom a boozehound) was already a cliché a half-century ago, and today its whiskery stereotypes are a millimeter away from being actively offensive. As for Barbara Anselmi’s music, it sounds like a medley of discarded theme songs from the pilots of failed ’70s sitcoms. The cast, fortunately, is excellent, with Lisa Howard giving a star-is-born performance as Jenny Steinberg, the plus-size 30-something good-egg sister who has spent a lifetime resenting her slender, soon-to-be-married sibling (Sierra Boggess). Not only is Ms. Howard warm and engaging, but she’s a first-class singer to boot.\n\nDavid Hyde Pierce’s staging is sufficiently adroit to make you long to see what he’d do with a real musical. This isn’t it.\n\nMr. Teachout, the Journal’s drama critic, is the author of “Satchmo at the Waldorf,” which runs May 26 through June 7 at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills, Calif.
