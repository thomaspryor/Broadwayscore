  "fullText": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/it-shoulda-been-you-review-you-were-expecting-maybe-quality-1429048939\n\nLisa Howard and Sierra Boggess in ‘It Shoulda Been You.’ Joan MarcusIt Shoulda Been You\n\nBrooks Atkinson Theatre, 256 W. 47th St. \n \n \n \n ($90-$139), 800-745-3000/877-250-2929\n\n“It Shoulda Been You” is a plastic statuette for the tourist trade, a nice-Jewish-girl-marries-nice-Catholic-boy musical farce that is by turns desperately unfunny and relentlessly preachy. Brian Hargrove’s been-there-done-that plot (Tyne Daly’s Jewish mom is a monster of tactlessness, Harriet Harris’s Catholic mom a boozehound) was already a cliché a half-century ago, and today its whiskery stereotypes are a millimeter away from being actively offensive. As for Barbara Anselmi’s music, it sounds like a medley of discarded theme songs from the pilots of failed ’70s sitcoms. The cast, fortunately, is excellent, with Lisa Howard giving a star-is-born performance as Jenny Steinberg, the plus-size 30-something good-egg sister who has spent a lifetime resenting her slender, soon-to-be-married sibling (Sierra Boggess). Not only is Ms. Howard warm and engaging, but she’s a first-class singer to boot.\n\nDavid Hyde Pierce’s staging is sufficiently adroit to make you long to see what he’d do with a real musical. This isn’t it.\n\nMr. Teachout, the Journal’s drama critic, is the author of “Satchmo at the Waldorf,” which runs May 26 through June 7 at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills, Calif.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite praising Lisa Howard's 'star-is-born performance' and the 'excellent cast,' the critic devastates the material itself as 'desperately unfunny,' 'relentlessly preachy,' with 'whiskery stereotypes' and music like 'discarded theme songs.' The final verdict 'This isn't it [a real musical]' clearly does not recommend. | GPT-4o: The review is overwhelmingly negative, criticizing the plot as clichéd and the music as subpar. Despite some praise for the cast, the overall verdict is clearly against seeing the show. | Gemini: The review is largely negative, describing the plot as cliche and the music as sounding like discarded sitcom themes. While the cast is praised, the overall assessment is that the musical is not good. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
