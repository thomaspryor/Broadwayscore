  "fullText": "As the father of the bride might put it, “Oy.”\n\n“It Shoulda Been You,” which opened on Tuesday night at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, confirms the sad truth that weddings — those supposed celebrations of everlasting love — bring out the worst in some people. That includes cynics, show-offs, heavy drinkers, envious have-nots and, it would seem, the creators of American musicals.\n\nThe last big wedding-themed show I remember on Broadway was “A Catered Affair” (2008), a singing adaptation of Paddy Chayefsky’s 1956 movie that turned the sentimental tale of a blue-collar bride into a dishwater-gray dirge. “It Shoulda Been You” takes the opposite tack. It’s so aggressively bubbly it gives you the hiccups. Or do I mean acid reflux? In any case, it’s not easy to swallow.\n\nFeaturing a book and lyrics by Brian Hargrove, with music by Barbara Anselmi, this crumbly meringue of a production would seem to be hoping to capitalize on the success of reality television shows about brides behaving badly, as well as cinematic laugh-fests like “Bridesmaids.” But this show, directed by the actor David Hyde Pierce and starring Tyne Daly and Harriet Harris as battling future mothers-in-law, also looks further back for inspiration.\n\nI mean way back, as in the 1920s, when a sappy little comedy called “Abie’s Irish Rose,” by Anne Nichols, became a runaway hit over the strenuous objections of the New York critics. (“Just about as low as good clean fun can get,” wrote Robert Benchley.) That play portrayed the familial furor caused by the altar-bound romance between a Jewish boy and a Catholic girl.\n\nIn “Shoulda,” it’s the bride (Sierra Boggess) who’s Jewish, and the groom (David Burtka) the gentile. But there’s plenty of the same old interdenominational kvetching, except that now it’s set to music, with lyrics such as these, from the title song:\n\nI don’t have a thing against gentiles.\n\nBut everyone knows you never marry\n\nWhen you’re in your goyim phase.\n\nIn other ways, “Shoulda” feels more like a product of the mid-20th century, when middle-class sex comedies had both a wholesome twinkle and a dirty leer. Think of plays like “The Tunnel of Love” and “Any Wednesday,” or television series like “Love American Style.”\n\n“Shoulda” — set in a fancy hotel where the wedding is to take place (shades of Neil Simon’s “Plaza Suite”) — occupies that treacherous comic ground between smirky and perky. Mining an illusion of charm from such terrain is hard, if not impossible, work for any contemporary performer.\n\nNot that the eminently talented ensemble members here don’t do their best to fill out the paper-doll stereotypes they have been asked to embody. In addition to Ms. Daly (as Judy Steinberg, the Jewish bulldozer mother of the bride) and Ms. Harris (as Georgette Howard, the wasp-tongued mother of the groom), the cast includes such Broadway stalwarts as Chip Zien (as Judy’s henpecked husband) and Edward Hibbert (as a fey wedding planner).\n\nThere are some ways in which the plot diverges from the template of decades ago. Our bride and groom — and their maid of honor (Montego Glover) and best man (Nick Spangler) — turn out to have a secret or two to spring on their combined families, which is surprising only in the sense that nobody here ever seems to behave in character from beginning to end. Longstanding grievances and tensions are dissipated with the wave of a feel-good wand.\n\nThe cast also notably features the Ray Bolger-like Josh Grisetti, as a seemingly spurned suitor, and Lisa Howard as Jenny. She’s the plus-size sister of the bride who has always been a dutiful doormat of a daughter, but is ready to cut loose. She does, inevitably, in a loud and soulful torch number called “Jenny’s Blues” that inspires both huzzahs from the audience and the evening’s single best line of dialogue, delivered as an irascible aside by Ms. Daly: “Why is she talking like a big black woman?”\n\nFor the most part, the score sticks so relentlessly to the same up-tempo jauntiness that you expect a bouncing ball to materialize. What dancing there is, choreographed by Josh Rhodes, is usually of the soft-shoe variety. The gold-trimmed hotel set (Anna Louizos) and tastefully tasteless costumes (by William Ivey Long) are pretty much what you’d expect them to be.\n\nThere are lots of classic domineering mother and mother-in-law jokes, and for a while it looks like the show is setting up an all-out catfight between Ms. Daly’s and Ms. Harris’s characters. But before they can build up a head of steam, these stylish actresses are smothered by a fuzzy blanket of cheery political correctness.\n\nThe show’s happy ending — and surprise! it does have one — may be purely 21st century. But even this conclusion has the feeling of something borrowed. There’s not an element in “It Shoulda Been You” that hasn’t been used, and wrung dry, before. Adding latter-day twists to this cocktail of clichés somehow makes it taste all the flatter.",

While he acknowledges the talented cast doing their best, he finds the material fundamentally flawed and derivative. | GPT-4o: The review is largely negative, critiquing the show for being clichéd and lacking originality. Despite some praise for the cast, the overall tone suggests the show is not worth seeing. | Gemini: The review is largely negative, describing the show as aggressively bubbly and full of clichés. While acknowledging the talented cast, the overall assessment is that the show falls flat and lacks originality, leading to a negative recommendation. | Kimi: While acknowledging the talented cast gives their best effort, the critic delivers a harsh verdict on the clichéd, unoriginal material with metaphors like 'crumbly meringue' and 'acid reflux,' concluding the show falls flat.",
