  "bwwExcerpt": "Pay no attention to the title. School of Rock, the perfectly pleasant, perfectly innocuous new musical from Andrew Lloyd Webber, Glenn Slater, and Julian Fellowes, is strictly adult contemporary. An adaptation of the 2003 Jack Black flick, it centres on a schlubby manchild who transforms a gaggle of overprivileged preteens into a wickedly awesome ensemble.",
