  "bwwExcerpt": "Andrew Lloyd Webber's first new work for Broadway in a decade is an otherwise workaday screen-to-stage adaptation, with a generous (and, I'm guessing, hoarse after every show) lead actor and faithful, if prosaic book by an unlikely writer-'Downton Abbey' creator Julian Fellowes. Webber's rock musicals ('Jesus Christ Superstar,' 'Joseph ...') are a polarizing bunch. I don't imagine most of the big numbers here will enjoy an afterlife; they're inferior to his earlier confections. Or, perhaps I need to hear them a few more times-orchestrations frequently drowned out actors, and I wasn't always sure what was being said.",
