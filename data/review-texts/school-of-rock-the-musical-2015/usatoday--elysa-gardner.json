  "bwwExcerpt": "How could you possibly resist them, these fresh, sunny faces and sweet pre-pubescent voices that dominate the cast of School of Rock -- The Musical(*** out of four stars)? Did I mention that some of the kids also play musical instruments, live? For the uninitiated, the show, which opened Sunday at Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre, is an adaptation of the beloved 2003 Jack Black movie. The film casts Black as Dewey Finn, a would-be rocker who, after getting fired from his band, borrows his house mate's identity to land a gig as substitute teacher at an elite private school.",
