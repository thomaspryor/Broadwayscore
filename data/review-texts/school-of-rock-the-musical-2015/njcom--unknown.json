  "bwwExcerpt": "Andrew Lloyd Webber's latest effort 'School of Rock: The Musical' will win no prizes for originality. A faithful-bordering-on-slavish adaptation of the 2003 Richard Linklater comedy, this big, noisy musical transposes virtually every scene from the film onto the stage... Lloyd Webber's music and Glenn Slater's lyrics are a forgettable pastiche of contemporary Top 40 pop-rock, as if Creed, One Republic and Train all turned up to perform at a junior high school mixer.",
