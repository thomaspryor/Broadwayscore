  "bwwExcerpt": "In terms of imaginative energy, director Laurence Connor's production, with a book by 'Downtown Abbey's' Julian Fellowes and lyrics by Glenn Slater, doesn't measure up to another Broadway offering focused on hyper talented schoolchildren, Matilda... As with so many shows in this genre, 'School of Rock' suffers from an overload of brand devotedness: it doesn't cover much territory that the movie on which it is piggy-backing already did. And in important ways, it proves to be less than the sum of its filmic parts.",
