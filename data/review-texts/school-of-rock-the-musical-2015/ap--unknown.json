  "bwwExcerpt": "Webber blasted the theatrical doors down to let rock in with such shows as 'Jesus Christ Superstar' and 'Cats' but how could he handle this assignment? Not too badly, it turns out. While leaning a little bit too much on his new song 'Stick It to the Man,' Webber, with lyricist Glenn Slater, turns in some perfectly solid mainstream rock-ish anthems in 'Mount Rock' and 'If Only You Would Listen.' He even mocks the genre with 'I'm Too Hot for You.'",
