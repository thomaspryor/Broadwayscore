  "bwwExcerpt": "Alex Brightman takes over for Black in the new musical version of 'School of Rock,' which opened Sunday at Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre...When he wipes his sweaty torso with a towel and then throws it into a girl's face or spews a mouthful of soda on another teacher (again, a female), he's just a big boorish thug. Missing completely is that anarchic edge of comedy...'School of Rock' is no movie classic, but worth watching because of Black. What the musical most needs is a complete overhaul for the stage; instead it gets Julian Fellowes' faithful-to-a-fault adaptation.",
