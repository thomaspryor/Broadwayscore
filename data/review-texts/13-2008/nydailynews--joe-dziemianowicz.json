    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative verdict despite acknowledging positive elements like ambition, production values, and cast commitment. The 'but unfortunately' signals the overall assessment is negative. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges ambition and commitment but concludes with a negative verdict, stating the play does not provide a satisfying experience. The lack of full review text and single excerpt warning reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges ambition and commitment but ultimately finds the play unsatisfying. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the negative conclusion is clear. | Kimi: The critic explicitly acknowledges the production's ambition, visual spectacle, and committed cast of 33, but the decisive 'unfortunately' clause delivers a clear negative verdict that these elements fail to cohere into a satisfying theatrical experience.",
