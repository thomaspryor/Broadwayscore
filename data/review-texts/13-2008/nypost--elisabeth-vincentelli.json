    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt describes the show as both 'spectacular' and a 'folly' that 'crash-landed,' combining praise for ambition with clear criticism. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears genuinely mixed in tone. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'ambitious, awkward, fascinating, lumbering,' which indicates a mix of positive and negative elements. The term 'spectacular folly' suggests both grandeur and failure, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the play as \"ambitious, awkward, fascinating, lumbering,\" which suggests a mixed reaction. The lack of a clear recommendation and the contradictory adjectives point to a score in the mixed range. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as a 'spectacular folly' that 'crash-landed,' using negative descriptors like 'awkward' and 'lumbering,' though it acknowledges the work is 'ambitious' and 'fascinating.' Given the truncation and single-excerpt limitations, confidence is low.",
