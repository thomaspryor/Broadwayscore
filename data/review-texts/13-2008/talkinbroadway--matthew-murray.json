    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - acknowledges the show succeeds at its goals but explicitly notes it's not groundbreaking or sophisticated. This suggests competent but unremarkable execution, placing it in mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the show's self-awareness and execution, though it notes a lack of groundbreaking or sophisticated elements. With only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the show is well-executed but not particularly innovative. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the lower end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show succeeds on its own terms with clear vision and execution, but the caveat that it 'isn't necessarily groundbreaking or sophisticated' tempers the praise, indicating a modest rather than enthusiastic recommendation.",
