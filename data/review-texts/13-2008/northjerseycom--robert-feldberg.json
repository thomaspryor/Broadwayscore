The lack of enthusiasm implies a recommendation against seeing it. | Gemini: The single excerpt expresses a negative sentiment about the experience of watching the play, suggesting it is not enjoyable. | Kimi: The critic suggests the play is self-indulgent and tedious for audiences, implying a clear recommendation against seeing the show despite any literary ambitions.",
