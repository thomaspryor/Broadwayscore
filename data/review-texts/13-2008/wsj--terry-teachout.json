Insufficient text to determine final verdict with confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests disappointment due to lack of 'neatness,' indicating a mixed review. However, without more context, it's unclear if the ambition and other elements redeem it. Confidence is low due to limited text. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the play is not neat, which implies it may be somewhat disorganized or chaotic. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is a positive or negative aspect, leading to a mixed classification. | Kimi: The excerpt warns of disappointment regarding the play's structure while acknowledging its ambition and large scope, suggesting a mixed assessment. With only one curated excerpt available, the full verdict remains unclear.",
