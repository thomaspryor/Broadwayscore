    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt praising the playwright's skill but appearing to set up contrast with 'But here' - suggests qualified praise. Low confidence due to truncated text and single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the eclectic nature of Mr. Guare's writing but lacks a clear recommendation or overall assessment of the current production. The absence of a full review and the single excerpt warning suggest a mixed evaluation. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the writer's past work but the sentence is cut off, so it's hard to determine the overall recommendation. I am placing it in the mixed bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt establishes high regard for John Guare's past writing ('daring and dizzying skill') but cuts off at a contrasting 'But here,' leaving the specific assessment of this production unresolved. Given truncation warnings against low scores, this registers as mildly positive pending the unseen verdict. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
