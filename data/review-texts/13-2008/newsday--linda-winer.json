    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Despite acknowledging the play eventually becomes 'important' in its final moments, the critic describes 2.5 hours of 'brain-blurring' content and 'incoherence.' However, confidence is low due to truncated text that cuts off mid-sentence when discussing the play's ultimate point. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt indicates that the play only becomes important in the final 15 minutes, suggesting a mixed experience with some redeeming qualities. The mention of 'brain-blurring historical asides' and 'luxuriously overpopulated incoherence' implies significant issues, but the eventual importance suggests it's not entirely negative. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the play as incoherent and brain-blurring for most of its duration, only becoming important in the final 15 minutes. This suggests a negative overall experience. | Kimi: The excerpt heavily criticizes the first 2.5 hours as 'brain-blurring' and 'incoherent' while acknowledging the final 15 minutes achieve importance and resonance, indicating a mixed verdict where the payoff doesn't justify the journey for general audiences. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Mixed",
