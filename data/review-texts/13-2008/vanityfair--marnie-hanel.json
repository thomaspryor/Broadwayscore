    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges multiple strong production elements but uses 'toughy' which suggests difficulty recommending it. With only a truncated excerpt available, the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises several elements of the production but ultimately describes it as 'a toughy,' suggesting mixed feelings. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence in the verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like direction, costumes, sets, and cast, but also indicates that the show is difficult and has been significantly trimmed. Given the limited excerpt, it's hard to determine the overall recommendation, but it leans towards mixed. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the direction, design, and performances but calls the show 'a toughy' and criticizes the three-hour runtime, suggesting the strong production values don't fully overcome the difficult pacing.",
