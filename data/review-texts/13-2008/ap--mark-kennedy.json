With only one curated quote available, confidence must be low as this may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the ambition of the play but also describes it as 'frantic,' suggesting a chaotic execution. Without more context, it leans towards a mixed review. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges ambition but uses potentially critical descriptors ('sprawling,' 'frantic') without offering a clear recommendation, suggesting a mixed assessment. Single curated excerpt limits confidence.",
