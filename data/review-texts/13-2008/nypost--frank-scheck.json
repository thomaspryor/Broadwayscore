The phrasing suggests disappointment rather than a complete pan. | GPT-4o: The review is strongly negative, stating that the musical is bad without any redeeming qualities. The critic's tone is dismissive and critical. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that it is a 'bad musical' and therefore it is a negative review. | Kimi: The critic explicitly labels the show as 'bad' with no positive qualifiers or mitigating praise, indicating a clear negative recommendation. The confidence is low due to the extreme brevity of the excerpt.",
