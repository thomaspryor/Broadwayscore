  "bwwExcerpt": "Michael Cera is not a transformational actor. Whether in film or on Broadway in his 2014 debut, 'This Is Our Youth,' he repeatedly embodies the beta male. Nothing wrong with that. Several comic geniuses, from Charlie Chaplin to Woody Allen, present a defined persona over and over again and yet dazzle with their delivery and timing. Kenneth Lonergan's 'Lobby Hero' opened Monday at Second Stage's newly renovated Hayes Theater, and the role of the insecure security guard Jeff fits Cera as tightly as the blue collar and black tie the character wears every night manning the front desk of a large New York apartment building.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The role of the insecure security guard Jeff fits Cera as tightly as the blue collar and black tie the character wears...He is very funny, at least, as played by Cera, and in true beta male fashion, he never cracks a joke or delivers a one-liner.

Unlike her co-stars, she’s broadly comic with her saucer eyes and baby-doll delivery.\"\n\nRead more"
