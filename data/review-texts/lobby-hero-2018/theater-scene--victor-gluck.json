  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Kenneth Lonergan's 'Lobby Hero' has stood the test of time, seeming more pertinent today that when it was first seen 17 years ago. Trip Cullman's top-notch cast dig deep into their juicy roles bringing insight and perception. While the early part of the play will seem languid and insubstantial, it is only building towards a plot that ultimately packs quite a punch. The play's moral compass leaves it up to each viewer to decide who the 'lobby hero' is.\"\n\nRead more",
