  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Lonergan's gift for honest character depiction, colorfully realistic dialogue, suspenseful situations, dramatic conflict, and carefully honed ethical dilemmas gives 'Lobby Hero' the feel of an old-fashioned, well-crafted drama, with few self-consciously artsy or intellectual devices.
