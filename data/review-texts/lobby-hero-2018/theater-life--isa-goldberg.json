  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"As humorous and unpretentious as 'Lobby Hero' is...it’s a delving piece of theater, about the stories we tell ourselves, and others...The complexities of urban life, issues of civic responsibility, the law, crime, romance, and morality ricochet throughout the play...Cullman deftly mines the humor and absurdity of these situations.
