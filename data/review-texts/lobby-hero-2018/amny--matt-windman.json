  "bwwExcerpt": "Despite a slow start and an abrupt ending, the play takes on an absorbing quality with the news that William's brother has been accused of participating in a brutal murder, which brings out the complexities in the four uniformed characters. It also contains many funny moments and themes (harassment, crisis management, social mobility) that are relevant to working professionals.",
