  "bwwExcerpt": "And as Lonergan's web of dilemmas grows more interesting, Henry's performance blossoms, riding an arc of injustice that seems to bend permanently away from a security guard with big plans and the wrong color of skin. It's powerful to watch him simmer and boil and wither, while Cera plays his downtrodden but still privileged foil. The rest of the show: It's got a lot of potential.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A substantial and mostly satisfying revival...The soul of this production belongs to Jeff’s self-help-peddling African-American 'captain' and would-be mentor, William, infused by Brian Tyree Henry with a rawness and flow that completely re-centers the morality play...The play seems to have spent the last seventeen years waiting for the right cast, and this time it gets halfway there...Lonergan writes with warmth, wit and spontaneity, but 'Lobby Hero' is one of his more schematic pieces.\"\n\nRead more",
