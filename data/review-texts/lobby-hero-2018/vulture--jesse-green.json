However, the review is brief and lacks a comprehensive evaluation, leading to a medium confidence level. | Gemini: The review highlights the strength of the cast, particularly Michael Cera's performance, suggesting a positive experience overall. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states the revival 'benefits enormously' from its cast, specifically praising Michael Cera's performance as 'expertly calibrated,' indicating a clear recommendation based on the strength of the acting. Confidence is low due to the brevity of the excerpt provided.",
