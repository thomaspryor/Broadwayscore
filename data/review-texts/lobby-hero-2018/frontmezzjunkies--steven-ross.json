  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Four intriguing characters make up the square edges in Lonergan's 'Lobby Hero'...Cullman keeps the action of these four pulsing forward...No moments of boredom or lethargy...Lust, power, and attraction are played out impulsively and organically by the brilliant dialogue...as all four bounce off each other in ways that is both surprising and thrilling...Strangely dynamic, hilarious, and crisply fascinating with a strong moral conflict at its center.\"\n\nRead more",
