This indicates the show doesn't work as intended. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the production for lacking the expected intensity and impact, suggesting it fails to meet the play's potential. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the production feels like a \"polite drawing-room exercise\" when it should be more impactful, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic faults the production for being too tame and polite, failing to deliver the moral fervor and social indignation the material demands, indicating a clear disappointment with the show's impact.",
