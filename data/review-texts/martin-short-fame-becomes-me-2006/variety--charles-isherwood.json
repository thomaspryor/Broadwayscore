    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - acknowledges Short's strong performance but notes material quality is inconsistent ('inspired to merely serviceable'). The word 'compensate' suggests weaknesses that need overcoming. Low confidence due to single curated quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, highlighting both strengths (Short's performance) and weaknesses (inconsistent material). The lack of full context and single excerpt warning necessitate a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review acknowledges Short's strengths but also points out that the material is inconsistent, ranging from \"inspired to merely serviceable.\" This suggests a mixed experience. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise, highlighting Short's engaging performance as the primary draw while noting the material itself is inconsistent and only 'merely serviceable.' This represents a recommendation based on star power rather than overall quality. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
