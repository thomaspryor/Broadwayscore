  "bwwExcerpt": "Structurally, the show doesn't strain to draw parallels between life and art. But Lapine does find connections in songs and vignettes from the shows, however diverse their source material. Sondheim's words and music are, for all their intelligence and sophistication, most striking for their emotional fidelity to his characters and the universal struggles and joys informing their disparate journeys. Thus the frustrations driving Sweeney Todd's demon barber and the gunslingers in Assassins are as eerily accessible as the romantic obsession captured in the songs Losing My Mind and Not a Day Goes By. We're reminded, too, of Sondheim's capacity for tenderness and hope: Norm Lewis' soaring Being Alive is a highlight, as is the more fragile Beautiful, a duet for Cook and Euan Morton.",
