  "bwwExcerpt": "One sometimes wonders what the notoriously exacting Sondheim privately thinks of the many revues and revivals of his work that come along. No worry here; 'Sondheim on Sondheim' is engrossingly entertaining and thoroughly captivating. An enchanting, warm and provocative opportunity to hear not only Sondheim's songs but -- literally -- the master's voice.",
