  "bwwExcerpt": "There are many fine performances of these incomparable theatrical compositions. Williams is mercifully irreverent, there is only one Cook, and, while Wopat only goes so deep, Lewis' take on “Being Alive” is formatively and emotionally magnificent. But they are not what stays with you. It is not easy for the performers to cohere as a throbbing ensemble, because the star of the show is not in the building.",
