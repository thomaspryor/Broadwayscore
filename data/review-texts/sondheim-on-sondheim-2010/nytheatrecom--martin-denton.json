  "bwwExcerpt": "The revue, conceived and directed by Sondheim's frequent collaborator James Lapine, feels haphazard and uneven. For every choice moment like the ones mentioned so far there are jarringly disappointing ones, notably Tom Wopat's attempts at 'Epiphany' from Sweeney Todd and 'Finishing the Hat' from Sunday in the Park with George, and Vanessa Williams's lackluster 'Ah, But Underneath' from Follies. The material is presented in no particular order, skipping around chronologically and thematically; some important themes of Sondheim's work are virtually unrepresented here, especially his wit. Where are the funny songs like 'Impossible' or 'Barcelona' or 'I Never Do Anything Twice'? The Sondheim shown here is resolutely serious and melancholy; the only real laugh in the show comes from a naughty anecdote about Ethel Merman.",
