  "bwwExcerpt": "The orchestra is too small and David Loud's horrid arrangements sap the life out of most of the songs. Doing 'Something's Coming' from 'West Side Story' and 'The Gun Song' from 'Assassins' in a lite jazz, Manhattan Transfer style is wrong, wrong, wrong. Unbelievably, a medley of 'Company' and 'Old Friends' is borderline barbershop.",
