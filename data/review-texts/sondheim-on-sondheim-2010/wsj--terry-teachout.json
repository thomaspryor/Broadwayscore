  "bwwExcerpt": "Any show in which Ms. Cook sings 'Loving You,' 'Take Me to the World' and 'Send in the Clowns' is by definition worth seeing, and some of the other performances, especially Mr. Wopat's 'Epiphany' and Leslie Kritzer's 'Now You Know,' are powerfully moving. Mr. Sondheim's recorded commentary, alas, is genial but less than illuminating—he never says anything that will surprise anyone who has followed his career at all closely—and I can't help but think that a show whose running time is well over 2½ hours might have profited had it been trimmed by someone not associated with the Sondheim cult.",
