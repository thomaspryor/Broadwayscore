  "bwwExcerpt": "Among other things, 'Sondheim on Sondheim' celebrates craft and collaboration. And just how much hard work goes into writing a musical. Consider Sondheim's reworking of the opening number for 'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,' the first Broadway show for which he wrote both music and lyrics. It took three tries to get that opening right, and the inspiration came from Jerome Robbins who pointed the composer in the correct direction. And then there is the private Sondheim — much of the new video was shot in his East Side town house and we get a peek at where the creative process starts. Plus some rather extraordinary comments about his parents — particularly his mother — with whom he had, at best, a precarious, turbulent relationship.",
