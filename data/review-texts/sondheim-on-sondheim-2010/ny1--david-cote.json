  "bwwExcerpt": "For Sondheim fanatics, the video bits are musical-theater catnip. You see the master himself reclining in his office, sharpening pencils, explaining how he lets the libretto inspire the songs and, in a painfully honest moment, what a poisonous relationship he had with his mother. What emerges is a portrait of a tightly-controlled artist who approaches human emotion with a mix of mathematical coldness and deep empathy. But hey, this is more than a TV show, right? Unfortunately it is, and this is where the show becomes hit or miss. No question, there are talented actor-singers in the eight-member ensemble, such as the comedy belter Leslie Kritzer and the charming and funny Euan Morton, not to mention the lovely Vanessa Williams. Norm Lewis and Tom Wopat add manly pipes, and Barbara Cook is a national treasure. But unfortunately, Lapine’s overly-perky staging comes across like a Sondheim Glee Club or a corporate function.",
