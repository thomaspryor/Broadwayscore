  "bwwExcerpt": "The unavoidable irony of any Sondheim revue is that his songs lose power and punch when performed out of context. 'Sondheim on Sondheim' is polished and well-intentioned, but it leaves you hungry for something more substantial and involving. Watching 'Follies' in its entirety is a lot better than sampling two or three of its ballads. But it's worth noting that 'Sondheim on Sondheim' is far, far better than 'Putting It Together,' which awkwardly imagined rich people singing Sondheim songs in a Manhattan penthouse. After all, isn't that what all rich people do?",
