  "bwwExcerpt": "Some blue-pencil editing would streamline the 2?1/2-hour show: Inferior material could go, like 'Ah, But Underneath' from a London version of 'Follies,' even if Williams sings it in her undies. Re-enactments from musicals are off-target, too. Led by Wopat, the in-your-face number 'The Gun Song' from 'Assassins' backfires. Even the venerable Cook, draped in a black shawl, can't make the odd vocal swoops of 'I Read,' from 'Passion,' click out of context. 'Opening Doors,' from 'Merrily We Roll Along,' is long-winded, and doing 'Franklin Shepard, Inc.,' from the same show, is just overkill. Among the best moments are Williams' glossy pop voice fusing with Cook's warm soprano on the hits 'Losing My Mind' and 'Not a Day Goes By.' Of the supporting players, Euan Morton makes 'Beautiful,' from 'Sunday in the Park With George,' just that, while Norm Lewis delivers a rousing 'Being Alive,' from 'Company.'",
