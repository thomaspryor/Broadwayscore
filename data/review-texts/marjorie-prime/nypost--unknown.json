  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"From the moment June Squibb takes the stage at the Hayes Theater in \"Marjorie Prime,\" you feel lucky to be in her presence. The stage and screen legend is back home on Broadway, where she got her start in \"Gypsy\" opposite Ethel Merman in 1960, for the first time in eight years. In between being on the boards, she's been hard at work making films, giving wonderful lead performances in \"Thelma\" and \"Eleanor the Great\". At a spry 96 years old, Squibb is, at long last, in her title-character era.\"",
