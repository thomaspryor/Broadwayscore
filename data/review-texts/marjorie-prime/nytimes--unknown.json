  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Harrison has a dream collaborator in Kauffman, who is a master at creating emotion without hitting an audience over the head. Her approach looks as if it is detached, almost clinical, but that only means she does not overplay her hand when navigating emotional stakes. This was obvious in her last Broadway outing, the quietly devastating \"Mary Jane\" (2024), and so it is here, with all four actors marvelously economical  an approach that does not necessarily win awards but that lingers in audience members' hearts and minds.\"",
