  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Freshly 96, June Squibb is giving one of the sharpest and most emotionally precise performances currently onstage in the Broadway premiere of Marjorie Prime, Jordan Harrison's one-act about an elderly widow and the lifelike robot modeled after her late husband. Exquisitely directed by Anne Kauffman, and rounded out by Cynthia Nixon, Danny Burstein and Christopher Lowell, it's an intelligent prayer for raw humanity in the face of catastrophic tech complacency.\"",
