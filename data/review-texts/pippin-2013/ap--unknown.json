  "bwwExcerpt": "Paulus has transformed the players into a troupe of circus performers, and it's a stroke of genius. It allows for a Big Top theme - think fire jugglers, teeterboards, knife throwing and contortionists - but also teases out the wandering nature of the mysterious players and zooms up the physicality of the story...She's also managed to tease out the connection between the intricate dance style of the late Fosse - Chet Walker choreographs this in the master's style - with the equally meticulous needs of acrobatics...Miller has got a manic grin on her face, sings with power and has a menacing air. She proves perfectly suited to Fosse's complicated footwork...Matthew James Thomas...announces himself as a new Broadway leading man. He's got the looks, the lungs and the abs, all of which the audience gets to enjoy multiple times.",
