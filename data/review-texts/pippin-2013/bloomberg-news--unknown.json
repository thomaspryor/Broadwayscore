  "bwwExcerpt": "The opening moments of 'Pippin' are the most thrilling since the humans and beasts of 'TheLion King' spilled down the aisles to the onstage savannah more than 15 years ago... Paulus's 'Pippin' is G-rated, frisky rather than sexy, the slick sweat of lust replaced by dazzling but vague innocence. That makes it a visual treat, but eye candy takes you only so far...Thomas has boyish charm, but Pippin hasn't changed by the time he chooses to settle down at the closing...Gorgeous Patina Miller...seems robotic here, another victim of the leeching of sex from the show. There's little here of what we need to feel in the gut from a musical. Only Andrea Martin's open-hearted turn resonates long enough to transport us, however briefly, way beyond the razzle-dazzle.",
