  "bwwExcerpt": "With its lively pop score by Stephen Schwartz, 'Pippin' was one of the big Broadway musicals of the 1970s, running for nearly five years. It's hard to believe, though, that the production could have been better than the dynamic revival that opened Thursday night at the Music Box Theatre. With the addition of beautifully integrated circus acts, the show is an eye-catchingly physical, as well as song-and-dance, treat.",
