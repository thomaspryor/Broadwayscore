  "bwwExcerpt": "There are shows that revive aging material through revisionism. And there are productions that prefer to celebrate the pull of nostalgia, especially when the songs are great. 'Pippin,' the brilliant Diane Paulus revival of the fantastically playful musical by Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson, with a special place in the theater-loving hearts of many, somehow combines the best of those two approaches, at once re-energizing this 40-year-old musical with freshness, vitality and eye-popping exuberance without ever making it feel like the crucial sweetness and naivete of the piece has been undermined or exploited.",

The 75 rating suggests positive elements, but the 'but' construction and emphasis on prioritizing spectacle over substance indicates a mixed recommendation. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 75 suggests a positive review. The review praises the visual spectacle but notes a lack of emotional connection, indicating a recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's visual appeal but also notes a lack of emotional connection, aligning with a 'Positive' bucket and a score of 75. | Kimi: The critic offers enthusiastic praise for the visual spectacle and staging while noting a significant reservation about the lack of emotional connection, resulting in a qualified but clear recommendation.",
