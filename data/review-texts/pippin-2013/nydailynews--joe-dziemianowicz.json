    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong praise with superlatives ('marvel', 'thrilling', 'blazingly new') and the critic's own 80 rating confirms high positive territory. Language suggests enthusiastic recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language such as 'marvel' and 'thrilling reinvention', indicating an enthusiastic recommendation. The original rating of 80 supports a high score within the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"marvel\" and \"thrilling reinvention,\" indicating a strong recommendation. The critic's rating of 80 aligns with the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The critic provides an explicit 80 rating and describes the show as a 'marvel' and 'thrilling reinvention,' indicating strong enthusiasm while falling within the Positive range (70-84) rather than the highest Rave tier. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
