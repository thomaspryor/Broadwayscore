  "bwwExcerpt": "This is a 'Pippin' for the 21st century, when it takes more than style to hold the attention of a restless, sensation-hungry audience...Fosse's original dancing is evoked, largely stripped of its sensuality, by the choreographer Chet Walker...And the connection between storytelling and style, between performer and self-expression, is only occasionally in evidence...Ms. Paulus's 'Pippin' is often fun (with an exclamation point), but it's almost never stirring in the way her Tony-winning revival of 'Hair' was. Only one moment, centered on Andrea Martin as the title character's grandmother, achieves that kind of transcendence. And I would argue that in courting its audience, this 'Pippin' is ultimately more cynical than Fosse's.",
