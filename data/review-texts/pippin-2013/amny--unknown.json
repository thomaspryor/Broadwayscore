  "bwwExcerpt": "Diane Paulus...offers a stunning, circus-themed production that seamlessly combines dance choreography in the trademark Fosse style with countless acrobatic feats...Patina Miller ('Sister Act') delivers an absolutely sensational, thoroughly sexy and authoritative performance...But there is a weak link to this staging, namely Matthew James Thomas' lifeless performance as Pippin. He mars the production with his hollow acting and weak singing. Nevertheless, this production has an incredible amount of 'Magic to Do.' 3.5 stars",
