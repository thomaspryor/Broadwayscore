  "bwwExcerpt": "The tone is set by Patina Miller (Sister Act), who brings a feline slinkiness to the Leading Player that can turn outright catty when the troupe seems to stray too far from the supposed script. Matthew James Thomas (Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark) displays a bashful, aw-shucks charm in the title role, and Charlotte D'Amboise vamps playfully as his scheming stepmom. But the unlikely showstopper is 66-year-old SCTV alum Andrea Martin...Dangling high above the stage, she embodies this utterly delightful revival's big-top message: No matter our age, we need never outgrow the capacity for wonder. Jazz hands, though, are strictly optional. A",

The description of the production as 'spectacular,' 'dazzling,' and 'surprisingly moving' supports a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"spectacular\", \"dazzling\", and \"surprisingly moving\", indicating a positive recommendation. Given the critic's rating of 87, the score should be in the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 87 falls within the Rave range (85-100), supported by enthusiastic praise calling the production 'spectacular,' 'dazzling,' and 'surprisingly moving.' Confidence is low due to the brevity of the single-sentence excerpt.",
