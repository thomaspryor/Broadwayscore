Sure, the narrative becomes a bit of a cluster-muck in the second act - but mostly it's just screamingly good fun.",

The 'but mostly' construction shows the positive outweighs the negative. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights improvements and praises the show for being 'screamingly good fun' despite some narrative issues. The positive tone and emphasis on entertainment value suggest a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review indicates that the show is \"screamingly good fun\" despite some issues in the second act, suggesting a positive but not rave recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the show's retooling for adding 'fresh snap' and 'heart,' and while noting second-act narrative issues, enthusiastically recommends it as 'screamingly good fun.' As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
