    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic finds improvements in this version and predicts audience success, but with clear personal reservations. The qualified positive recommendation places this at the lower end of the Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges improvements and a more enjoyable experience but still notes significant reservations about the production's faithfulness to its original issues. The critic does not express a strong recommendation, indicating a mixed sentiment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges improvements but ultimately expresses reservations, suggesting a mixed experience. The truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt shows qualified appreciation— noting improvements ('breathes slightly more enjoyably', cuts to 'inferior songs') but maintaining significant personal reservations ('never be among my favorite musicals'). As a single curated excerpt, the overall verdict remains unclear, suggesting a lukewarm middle-ground assessment.",
