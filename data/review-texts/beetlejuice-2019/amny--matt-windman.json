    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show offers 'reasonably fun time' but the closing question 'don't we expect better than that?' suggests disappointment with settling for mediocrity. This qualified endorsement with clear reservations places it in Mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show is enjoyable but questions if it meets higher expectations, indicating a mixed review. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The review suggests a \"reasonably fun time\" but questions if it should be better, indicating a positive but not enthusiastic recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers mild praise for the cast and concedes the show provides 'reasonably fun' entertainment, but the closing rhetorical question implies the production lacks substance or quality, suggesting a qualified, lukewarm recommendation at best. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
