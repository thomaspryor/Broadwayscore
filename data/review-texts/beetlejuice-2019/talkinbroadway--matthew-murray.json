The use of \"remarkable precision and panache\" indicates a strong endorsement. | Kimi: Unqualified praise with strong superlatives ('remarkable precision and panache'), clear confident recommendation with no caveats or reservations. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
