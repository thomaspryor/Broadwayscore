This balanced praise-and-criticism pattern indicates a mixed reception. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the musical's unique charm but also describes it as overwhelming and chaotic, suggesting a mixed experience. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's charm despite some reservations about feeling trapped in a hyperactive funhouse, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show achieves a distinct appeal ('grotesque charm') but weighs this against a vivid negative comparison to being trapped in a chaotic funhouse, suggesting the experience is exhausting and overstuffed rather than fully recommended.",
