  "bwwExcerpt": "Maybe if they'd said it a fourth time. Three times - \"Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice!\" - summons to life the stripe-coated, fright-wigged demon that made a superstar of Michael Keaton way back when. Could a fourth have magically conjured that extra something needed to transform Broadway's Beetlejuice into something beyond the realm of good enough?",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic directly characterizes the show as 'good enough' but suggests it lacks 'that extra something' to be truly special. This indicates a mixed verdict - not negative, but not enthusiastically positive either. Single excerpt warning applies, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show is 'good enough' but lacks an 'extra something' to elevate it further. This indicates a mixed review, neither fully positive nor negative. | Gemini: The review questions if the show could have been better, implying it's currently just \"good enough,\" which suggests a mixed reaction. The truncated nature of the text lowers the confidence. | Kimi: The critic explicitly characterizes the show as merely 'good enough' and suggests it misses the 'extra something' needed for greatness, indicating a lukewarm reception. Confidence is low due to limited excerpt availability.",
