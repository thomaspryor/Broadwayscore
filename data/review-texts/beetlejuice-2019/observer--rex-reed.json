Given the single excerpt warning, the positive tone suggests a strong recommendation for its aesthetic appeal. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as a \"feast for the eyes and ears\" with \"spectacular sets, costumes and makeup.\" Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive, but with low confidence. | Kimi: Strong praise for visual and technical elements using words like 'feast', 'spectacular', and 'vibrant life'. While limited to production values in this single excerpt, the tone is clearly enthusiastic and recommending.",
