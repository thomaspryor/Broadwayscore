  "bwwExcerpt": "Beetlejuice, the rowdy, raunchy musical adapted from Tim Burton's 1988 horror-comedy, openly embraces the theme park-y aspects of an enterprise like the one it's engaged in. True to its source material, it's loud, it's cheeky, and it's all about excess. It's also-thanks in large part to Alex Brightman's spot-on performance as the incorrigible titular ghoul-a pretty fun time. Roma Torre, NY1: The score by Eddie Perfect isn't exactly perfect but it's plenty jaunty, though \"The Banana Boat Song\" an",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows qualified positivity ('pretty fun time', 'spot-on performance') but with caveats about excess and imperfect score. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mildly positive so scored at lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'pretty fun' and praises Alex Brightman's performance, indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. The text quality warning and single excerpt availability lower confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show is \"a pretty fun time,\" which suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. The presence of reservations is implied by the \"theme park-y aspects\" comment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, acknowledging the show's 'theme park-y' commercial nature but ultimately endorsing it as 'a pretty fun time' thanks to Brightman's performance. Single excerpt and truncation warrant low confidence and lower-end Positive score.",
