    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear enthusiasm with vivid positive imagery ('candy-colored carnival', 'energy to power a small city') and praise for cast commitment. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's energy and the cast's commitment, suggesting a lively and engaging production. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt is positive, describing the show as energetic and the cast as committed. However, due to the limited text available, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the production's visual style, energy, and cast commitment using enthusiastic hyperbole ('power a small city'), indicating a clear positive recommendation despite limited context.",
