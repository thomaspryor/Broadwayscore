Actually, the story careens all over the place, which doesn't matter because the performances are mostly excellent and the sets by David Korins notably stunning (including a mansion living room seemingly redecorated mid-performance).",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite acknowledging plot issues ('careens all over the place'), the critic dismisses these problems because the performances are 'mostly excellent' and sets 'notably stunning.' This is a qualified positive recommendation. Low confidence due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights excellent performances and stunning set design, which suggests a positive view, but the lack of full context and mention of a story that 'careens all over the place' tempers the enthusiasm. | Gemini: The review praises the performances and sets, but notes the story is all over the place. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as a positive with reservations. | Kimi: The critic explicitly dismisses the messy story as irrelevant ('doesn't matter') due to 'mostly excellent' performances and 'notably stunning' sets, constituting a clear recommendation despite reservations.",
