    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('ghoulish delight') with praise for both faithfulness and originality. Single excerpt warning noted, but tone is clearly enthusiastic rather than qualified praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'ghoulish delight' with positive attributes like capturing 'manic energy' and establishing a 'theatrical identity'. The original rating of 87 suggests strong praise, aligning with the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"ghoulish delight\" and praises the show's ability to capture the source material's energy while creating its own identity. Given the single excerpt, I am placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 87 falls within the Rave range (85-100), and the excerpt provides enthusiastic praise calling the show a 'ghoulish delight' that successfully captures its source material while establishing its own identity. Confidence is set to low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
