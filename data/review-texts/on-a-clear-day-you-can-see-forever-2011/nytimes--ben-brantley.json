    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The metaphor of failed spiritual contact clearly indicates disappointment with the revival's inability to capture the original's essence, suggesting the production falls short of expectations. | GPT-4o: The review suggests the revival lacks vitality and fails to fully capture the essence of the original, indicating a negative impression overall. | Gemini: The review uses the metaphor of a failed séance to describe the revival, indicating a negative assessment. The phrase \"only intermittent contact with the spirit world\" suggests the production is not fully realized or successful. | Kimi: The metaphor suggests the revival fails to bring the show fully back to life, offering only sporadic moments rather than a complete resurrection.",
