It seems to me, Doc, that you and your show have been suffering instead from a case of clinical depression that you’ve never been able to get over, no matter how hard you’ve tried. And, believe me, I know how you’ve tried. I have felt the pain of your efforts.\n\nWhere the heck is Zoloft (and Prozac and Abilify) when you need the little suckers? This wholesale reconception of a fluffy, muddled 1965 musical about reincarnation appears to have given everyone who appears in it — including its charismatic star, Harry Connick Jr. — a moaning case of the deep-dyed blues. Though done up to resemble a psychedelic fun house (the sanitized, perky kind that brings to mind middle-of-the-road rock album covers from the late 1960s and early ’70s), this “Clear Day” still has the approximate fun quotient of a day in an M.R.I. machine.\n\nThere’s no doubt that the original “Clear Day,” which features a perfectly lovely score by Burton Lane (music) and Alan Jay Lerner (lyrics), required some serious tinkering if it was going to fly on Broadway in 2011. Though this tale of reincarnation and a love that crossed generations starred the peerless Barbara Harris, as a psychically gifted young woman with a past life just waiting to leap out of her, it was generally agreed that the 1965 production was overdressed, overplotted and more or less out of its mind.\n\nSo the director Michael Mayer, who had always had an understandable soft spot for the show’s music, decided to enlist the playwright Peter Parnell to see if “Clear Day” might be clarified. The focus was shifted from the beguiling Daisy (Ms. Harris’s part) to Dr. Mark Bruckner (Mr. Connick), the psychiatrist who stepped over a whole lot of professional lines in treating her.\n\nMark, in this version, is a widower of five years who has never gotten over his wife’s death. As in the earlier “Clear Day” Mark still accidentally winds up treating an unexceptional-seeming patient who, under hypnosis, delivers a full-blown previous incarnation from years earlier. And that inner soul happens to be just the sort of woman Mark’s been waiting for. The big difference is that Daisy is now David, a gay florist with commitment issues.\n\nWell, that’s the first big difference, anyway. Daisy/David’s alter-ego, Melinda, is no longer a love-crossed English beauty from the 18th century but a feisty big-band singer from the early 1940s in search of a professional break. This transformation was even more troublesome to the “Clear Day” team than Daisy’s sex change, since it meant coming up with songs that were more Benny Goodman than Thomas Arne. (To do so, the creators raided the Lerner and Lane score for the 1951 film “Royal Wedding” and a few numbers from the unfondly remembered 1970 “Clear Day” film starring Barbra Streisand.)\n\nFinally, and most unfortunately, it was decided that Mark’s prize patient would be played by two people instead of one. While I didn’t see Ms. Harris in the original “Clear Day,” I was lucky enough to catch Kristin Chenoweth in the same role in an Encores! concert version. And that show’s greatest (if not only) pleasures came from watching her melt from one character into another, with a posture, an accent and a singing style to match.\n\nAnyway, now we have David Turner as David, and Jessie Mueller as Melinda. And while they perform a couple of fleeting pas de trois with the doctor in the hypnosis scenes, mostly they stay out of each other’s way. Once Melinda takes over David, she becomes a sort of human time machine who allows the doc to hang out with her in jazzy old Manhattan of yore.\n\nNever mind trying to figure out the logic of all this. Reincarnation, I’m sure, has its own transcendent laws. But you can’t avoid the casualties of this approach. The most conspicuous is the muffling of Mr. Turner, an actor of wit and charm, who is here required to be witless and charmless.\n\nMs. Mueller, who has a fetching affinity for swing-era song stylings, comes off better. (Her version of “Ev’ry Night at Seven,” an interpolation from “Royal Wedding,” is the show’s high point.) But in reshaping Melinda as a concept, someone forgot to make her a character as well. And concepts, as opposed to characters, don’t generate chemistry with their leading men.\n\nMr. Connick, who was a splendid matinee-idol-style star of the 2006 revival of “The Pajama Game,” here appears to be taking his character’s bereavement too much to heart. Known for Sinatra-esque timbre and phrasing, he evokes Old Blue Eyes here, too, but the terminally heartsick, lost-in-a-gin-bottle Sinatra of “In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning” and “One for My Baby (and One More for the Road).” He has the look of a man just out of grueling dental surgery, who is both in pain and still semi-anesthetized. And he makes even an up number like the title song sound like an exquisitely sung dirge.\n\nDid I mention that the show is now set in 1974 instead of 1965? I’m not sure why, except that perhaps it allows for more jokes about psychiatrists and their methods in the Me Decade, when everybody was shrink-wrapped. (Mark describes his tribe as being “sweethearts of Sigmund Freud.”)\n\nAnd of course there’s that whole 1970s aesthetic. Christine Jones’s sets and Catherine Zuber’s costumes are meant, I presume, to pulse with kinetic visual playfulness. They are filled with mixed Op Art designs and bright (my eyes, my eyes!) shades of orange, pink and green.\n\nBut there was never a less flattering decade in fashion than the early 1970s. And I couldn’t help feeling that members of the talented supporting cast — who include Kerry O’Malley (as Mark’s loyal and adoring colleague), Sarah Stiles (as David’s roommate) and Drew Gehling (very good as David’s boyfriend) — wished they were somewhere else, in more attractive costumes, doing less spasmodic dances (choreographed by Joann M. Hunter).\n\nA warning: All those elaborately mixed patterns of circles and squares can affect your vision. I found myself seeing double at the show’s beginning, until my eyes had adjusted. What a relief when things fell into normal focus again. One “Clear Day” at a time is more — much more — than enough.\n\nON A CLEAR DAY YOU CAN SEE FOREVER\n\nMusic by Burton Lane; lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner; new book by Peter Parnell, based on the original book by Lerner; reconceived and directed by Michael Mayer; choreography by Joann M.
