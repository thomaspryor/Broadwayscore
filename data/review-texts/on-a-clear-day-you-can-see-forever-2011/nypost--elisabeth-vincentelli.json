  "bwwExcerpt": "'On a Clear Day You Can See Forever” is known for its great songs — and nutty book. Revived on Broadway for the first time since its 1965 opening, the Burton Lane/Alan Jay Lerner musical has undergone a drastic overhaul. Guess what? This “revisal” still has great songs and a nutty book — along with a downcast lead who looks as if he’d rather be anywhere but the St. James Theatre, where the show opened last night.",
