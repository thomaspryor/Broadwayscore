  "bwwExcerpt": "Cordero is good and sleazy enough so that we never miss the original too much. He lacks Palminteri's heavy elegance, but his is an understated performance that gives the musical a solid foundation. Also very fine is the delectable Ariana Debose, who plays the love interest, and a gifted child actor named Hudson Loverro. The huge obstacle to overcome in putting \"A Bronx Tale\" on stage is finding the right kid for the early scenes. Problem solved: Loverro brings real street edge to the young Calog",

However, limited text and qualified praise ('never miss the original too much') suggests restrained positive assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances of the cast, particularly Cordero and Loverro, suggesting a positive view of the production. However, the lack of full context and only a single excerpt limits confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The review praises Cordero's performance and highlights other strong performances, indicating a positive overall experience despite the comparison to the original. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for multiple performances, describing them as 'very fine' and 'gifted' and declaring a major casting challenge 'problem solved,' indicating a genuine recommendation despite the limited context.",

What began as a tough one-man play written and performed by Palminteri, in 1990, soon spawned a film in which the actor essayed just one role: Sonny, a street-corner mobster who wrestles for the soul of a young boy against the best wishes and deep fears of his bus-driver father.",
