    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Explicit enthusiastic recommendation with superlatives like 'perfect telling' and 'emotionally powerful climax,' plus direct audience directive to see it immediately. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong positive language with phrases like 'perfect telling', 'emotionally powerful', and 'go see this show right now!' indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"emotionally driven\", \"perfect telling\", \"emotionally powerful\", and \"will fill your heart\", indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise ('perfect telling', 'emotionally powerful') and an explicit command to see the show immediately, placing it at the high end of Positive despite the risk of cherry-picking with only one excerpt available. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
