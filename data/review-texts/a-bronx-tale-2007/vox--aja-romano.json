    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Opens with clear positive language ('perfectly enjoyable', 'charm-infused') but includes multiple qualifications about flattened characterization and shallow social commentary. Single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review describes the musical as 'perfectly enjoyable' and 'charm-infused', indicating a positive tone. However, it also notes some limitations in the lyrics and depth of social commentary, suggesting a mildly positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses the phrase \"perfectly enjoyable\" and praises the fast-paced nature of the musical, but also notes that the lyrics flatten out characterization and the social commentary is not particularly nuanced. Given the single excerpt and mixed signals, I'm scoring it as a low-end positive. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers mild praise ('perfectly enjoyable') balanced by criticism of shallow characterization and glancing social commentary. Strong endorsement of direction supports a positive recommendation, but the tepid enthusiasm and significant reservations place this in the lower Positive range.",
