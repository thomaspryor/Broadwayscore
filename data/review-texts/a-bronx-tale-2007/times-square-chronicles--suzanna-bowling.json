  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"From an outstanding score by Alan Menken, touching and cohesive book by Chazz Palminteri, the effervescent choreography by Sergio Trujillo and an award-winning cast, 'A Bronx Tale' has it all. 'A Bronx Tale' is an old-fashioned musical, done the way musicals used to be with heart, soul and just a little bit of schmaltz. It is exactly what the doctor ordered in these trying times. You will get your money’s worth in entertainment and will leave feeling good about the world.\"\n\nRead more",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this may be cherry-picked positive content. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the score, book, choreography, and cast, describing the show as having 'heart, soul' and being 'exactly what the doctor ordered.' Despite the single excerpt warning, the tone is clearly enthusiastic. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly positive, using phrases like \"outstanding score,\" \"touching and cohesive book,\" \"effervescent choreography,\" and \"award-winning cast.\" The reviewer explicitly states that it is \"exactly what the doctor ordered\" and that you will \"leave feeling good about the world.\" | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise ('outstanding score', 'has it all', 'exactly what the doctor ordered'), indicating a strong recommendation to see the show. However, confidence is low given this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's balance or caveats.",
