    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('warm, funny, touching and altogether entertaining') suggests strong recommendation, but confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'warm, funny, touching and altogether entertaining,' indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language such as \"warm, funny, touching and altogether entertaining\", which indicates a strong positive review. Given that it is only one excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong positive descriptors ('warm,' 'funny,' 'touching,' 'entertaining') indicating a clear recommendation. Following the guidance for clearly positive single excerpts, scored in the upper Positive range (80-84) with low confidence due to limited context.",
