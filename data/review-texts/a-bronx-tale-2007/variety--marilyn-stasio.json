While there are fun things to be found, like those jailbait Doo-Wop Guys singing and snapping a cappella under the streetlight, the music is soggier than overcooked meatballs and the lyrics have absolutely no bite...Sergio Trujillo’s choreography is a snooze.\"\n\nRead more",

This is clearly negative overall despite isolated praise. | GPT-4o: The review highlights significant issues with the musical, such as an 'anemic score' and 'soggy' music, despite acknowledging some fun elements. The overall tone suggests the production is not recommended. | Gemini: The review excerpt clearly indicates a negative assessment due to the weak score and choreography, despite some positive aspects like the casting. | Kimi: While praising the casting and some fun moments, the critic pans the anemic score, soggy music, and snooze-worthy choreography, clearly concluding the show fails to deliver.",
