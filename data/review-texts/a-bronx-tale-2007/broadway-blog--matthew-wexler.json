Cordero manages to find the delicate balance between tough guy and heart of gold.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review uses negative metaphors ('sinks like a thug with cement shoes', 'polluted plot lines') but praises individual performances. The final verdict 'adequate evening of theater' is lukewarm at best, suggesting a mixed experience that neither recommends nor discourages. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'adequate,' with some performances praised but overall issues with the plot. The single excerpt suggests a mixed verdict without strong recommendation or discouragement. | Gemini: The review states that the show is \"an adequate evening of theater,\" which is a mildly positive statement. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic praises specific performances for rising above the material but describes the plot as 'polluted' and suggests the A-list cast 'sinks' the show, ultimately offering only the faint praise of 'adequate' rather than a clear recommendation.",
