Just when it was getting cool to go to a Broadway musical, along comes the lumbering and hackneyed 'A Bronx Tale'...A musically unmemorable mix of sappiness and contrived melodrama...Aside from Machiavelli-quoting mobster Bobby—played with expertly calibrated swagger by Nick Cordero—none of the characters command interest, and Alan Menken and Glenn Slater’s doo-wop–heavy score is far too lightweight for a plot that features murders.\"\n\nRead more",

Only praise is for one performer (Cordero), but overall verdict is clearly negative. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show as 'lumbering and hackneyed', with 'musically unmemorable' elements and characters that 'do not command interest'. While there is praise for a single performance, the overall tone is negative. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"lumbering and hackneyed\", \"unmemorable\", and \"lightweight\". The reviewer only praises one character, but overall does not recommend the show. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as lumbering, hackneyed, and musically unmemorable, praising only Nick Cordero's performance while criticizing the lightweight score, contrived melodrama, and lack of interesting characters.",
