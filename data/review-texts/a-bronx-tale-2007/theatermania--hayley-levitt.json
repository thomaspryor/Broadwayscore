    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt expresses qualified praise - acknowledges commercial polish may have lost original character but finds the show 'completely captivating' when it works. Mixed signals suggest lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the musical as 'completely captivating' when it engages with its story's milieu, suggesting a positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show is \"completely captivating\" when the music and rhythms are fully engaged, but also mentions that it's been \"waxed to a commercial Broadway shine,\" suggesting some loss of original character. Given the single excerpt and the reservations, a score of 75 seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers strong praise calling the show 'completely captivating' while noting reservations about its polished commercial Broadway production. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced.",
