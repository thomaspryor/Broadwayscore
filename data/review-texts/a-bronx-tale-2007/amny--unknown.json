  "bwwExcerpt": "The characters are simple, the storytelling is derivative of better-known musicals (\"West Side Story,\" \"Jersey Boys\") and the tone is excessively sentimental and solemn. But \"A Bronx Tale,\" the new Broadway musical based upon actor-writer Chazz Palminteri's coming of age in an Italian-American neighborhood in the Bronx of the 1960s, is nevertheless an entertaining crowd-pleaser and a poignant piece of theater. If it works, it works.",
