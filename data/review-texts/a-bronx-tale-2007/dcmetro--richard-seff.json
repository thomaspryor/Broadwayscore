  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Clearly Mr. Palminteri’s biographical play has served him well, and now his good fortune is being spread to a marvelous group of featured actors and a gifted ensemble. It’s a dark tale, at first glance seemingly hardly the stuff on which to base a Broadway musical. But every choice in fashioning it into a very good musical has been the right one…The conflicts are the building blocks that make this a solid story, told without compromise, a first-rate drama.\"\n\nRead more",

Despite the limited excerpt, the language suggests a strong positive recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt uses phrases like \"marvelous group\", \"gifted ensemble\", \"very good musical\", and \"first-rate drama\", indicating a strong positive assessment. However, due to the single excerpt and truncated nature, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the adaptation and performances, calling the show 'very good' and 'first-rate' with 'marvelous' actors, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the full review's tone.",
