  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The show’s makers and shapers haven’t squandered their gifts. But they haven’t dug especially deep in the imagination department, either.

The mixed tone suggests neither a strong recommendation nor a discouragement. | Gemini: The review notes 'tasty ear candy and fine performances' but also states it's 'as conventional as it gets' and 'could use a surprise or two,' indicating a mixed assessment. The truncated nature lowers confidence. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges strong performances and enjoyable music but finds the production overly conventional and predictable, lacking imaginative surprises.",
