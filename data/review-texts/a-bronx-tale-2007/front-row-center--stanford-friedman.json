    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic praises the cast performance ('winningly performed', 'cast shines') but heavily criticizes the script and structure ('losing-ly scripted', 'jarring', script problems). This creates a clear mixed verdict where strengths don't overcome fundamental flaws. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights significant issues with the script, describing it as 'losing-ly scripted' and 'jarring'. Despite praise for the cast, the overall tone suggests a negative verdict. | Gemini: The review highlights strong performances but criticizes the script and overall coherence, suggesting a mixed experience. The limited excerpt and negative tone lead to a score in the middle of the mixed range. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the cast ('winningly performed', 'shines') but heavily criticizes the script ('losing-ly scripted', 'jarring') and plot coherence, suggesting an uneven production where performances outshine the material.",
