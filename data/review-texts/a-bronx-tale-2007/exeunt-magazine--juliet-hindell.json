  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"A crowd-pleasing, nostalgic coming-of-age story with a welcome dose of racial tolerance just right for our times...The direction plays it fairly safe but confidently establishes a warm retro approach...The promising a cappella song from the opening is cut short but there’s plenty of other music to enjoy, with early rock 'n’ roll and Motown influences...The Longacre’s stage seems to confine the action. The dance numbers in particular need more space to breathe.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Positive opening assessment calling it 'crowd-pleasing' with praise for music, but notes limitations with staging and space. Single excerpt warning applies - qualified positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'crowd-pleasing' and 'nostalgic', indicating a positive tone. However, it also notes limitations like the stage confining the action and the direction playing it safe. Given the single excerpt and mixed elements, a mildly positive score is appropriate. | Gemini: The review excerpt is mostly positive, calling the show \"crowd-pleasing\" and noting its welcome message. However, it also mentions the direction playing it safe and the stage feeling confined, indicating some reservations. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers qualified praise, describing the show as crowd-pleasing and timely with enjoyable music, while criticizing confined staging and safe direction, indicating a mild recommendation.",
