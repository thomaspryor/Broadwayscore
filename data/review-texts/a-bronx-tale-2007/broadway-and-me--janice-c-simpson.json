Positive recommendation with clear reservations. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as entertaining with a 'good time' verdict, despite noting it isn't innovative. The review is mildly positive, but the single excerpt warning suggests caution. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"well-crafted\" and \"entertaining\", but also notes that it isn't innovative and the lyrics aren't clever. Overall, it seems to be a positive review with some reservations. | Kimi: The critic praises the well-crafted traditional musical elements, peppy dances, and entertaining performances while noting it lacks innovation, resulting in a solid but qualified recommendation.",
