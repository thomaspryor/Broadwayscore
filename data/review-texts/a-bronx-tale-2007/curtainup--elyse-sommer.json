    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review praises performances and technical elements ('enjoyable musical entertainment', 'easy on the ears', 'showstoppers') but qualifies with 'sugary Disney gloss' and 'standard Broadway musical territory'. Single excerpt warning requires caution - this sounds mildly positive, so lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt describes the show as 'enjoyable musical entertainment' with positive elements like a charismatic performance and showstopping lyrics. However, it also notes a 'sugary Disney gloss' and 'pleasing but standard' feel, suggesting a mild recommendation. | Gemini: The review highlights enjoyable aspects and strong performances, but also notes it falls into 'standard Broadway musical territory,' indicating a positive but not rave recommendation. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
