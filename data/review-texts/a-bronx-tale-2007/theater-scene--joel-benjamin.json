  "showScoreExcerpt": "“‘A Bronx Tale’ at the Longacre Theatre has its pleasures and delights, particularly if you have never seen Chazz Palminteri's original insightful monologue. Adding songs by Alan Menken (music) and Glenn Slater (lyrics) to Palminteri's book doesn't expand on the original but merely buff the rough diamond that was the original into a glitzier version. The original depended on Palminteri's brilliant acting and the imagination of the listener to picture the Bronx in the sixties.”\n\nRead more",

With only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some positive aspects ('pleasures and delights') but suggests the musical version doesn't expand on the original monologue, implying a mixed reception. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to low confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges \"pleasures and delights\" but suggests the musical adaptation doesn't improve upon the original monologue, indicating a mixed assessment. The truncated text and single excerpt lower the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges 'pleasures and delights' but heavily qualifies this by noting the musical adaptation fails to expand on the superior original monologue, suggesting it is enjoyable mainly for newcomers to the material.",
