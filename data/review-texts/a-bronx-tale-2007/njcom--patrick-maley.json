  "bwwExcerpt": "New York gangsters sing and dance successfully in \"Guys and Dolls,\" and uptown street punks do the same in \"West Side Story.\" \"A Bronx Tale\" recalls both if only to illuminate its comparative limitations. Palminteri's semi-autobiographical story at the heart of this show remains compelling, but \"A B...",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The show takes a gritty, complex story and renders it trite, maudlin, and moralistic...The package is certainly finely tuned for maximum razzle-dazzle: Menken and Glenn Slater's songs are full of big hooks and soaring crescendos...and Sergio Trujillo's lively choreography hums with a steady energy...Palminteri's semi-autobiographical story at the heart of this show remains compelling, but 'A Bronx Tale' is ultimately much better (and more inexpensively experienced) as a movie.\" \n\nRead more",

The final recommendation suggests the movie is a better experience, indicating a negative verdict. | Gemini: Despite praising some elements like the songs and choreography, the reviewer ultimately finds the show trite and recommends experiencing the story as a movie instead, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: Although the critic praises the catchy songs and lively choreography, the overall verdict finds the adaptation trite and moralistic, explicitly recommending the movie version instead.",
