    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review acknowledges flaws (rushed second half, stereotypes, no breakout songs) but concludes positively with 'genuine charms' and notes it works better as a musical. The qualified praise suggests lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges both strengths and weaknesses: it praises the story's fit as a musical and the show's charm, but criticizes its melodramatic pacing and lack of standout songs. The mixed tone and lack of a strong recommendation place it in the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The review notes stereotypical aspects and a rushed feeling, but ultimately concludes that the musical has genuine charms and works better than previous incarnations. This suggests a positive, but not rave, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic finds the musical adaptation superior to previous versions and praises its tuneful score, but notes the second half feels rushed and unconvincing. The 'genuine charms' verdict suggests a qualified recommendation.",
