It’s not even half as good as 'Jersey Boys.'\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite acknowledging 'well-meaning efforts' and some engaging musical numbers, the critic finds fundamental flaws in mixing serious themes with musical theater, says it diminishes the core story, and explicitly states it falls far short of its aspirations and isn't even half as good as comparable shows. | GPT-4o: The review highlights significant flaws and shortcomings compared to other shows, despite acknowledging some engaging musical numbers. The overall tone suggests disappointment and a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review highlights flaws and shortcomings, comparing it unfavorably to other musicals. The excerpt suggests a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges 'engaging' musical numbers and 'well-meaning efforts,' the overall verdict is clearly negative: the genre mix is compared unfavorably to 'gin and Diet Coke,' the songs diminish the core story, and the show is judged 'not even half as good as Jersey Boys,' indicating a recommendation against seeing it.",
