  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"While ‘A Bronx Tale’ never exactly falsifies its subject, it gives the effect of skating over everything lightly, never quite coming to grips with the grit it touches on…Within these limitations, ‘A Bronx Tale’ has its good points…The Menken-Slater songs, carefully crafted in period-pastiche forms, supply pleasantly accurate atmosphere…The overall result isn't bad, just a little bland for the vital matters involved.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges good points (songs, atmosphere) but finds the show 'bland' and says it 'skates over everything lightly' without engaging with its serious subject matter. This lukewarm assessment falls in Mixed range, with low confidence due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some good points and atmosphere but criticizes the show for being bland and not fully engaging with its subject. The excerpt suggests a mixed verdict, but with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review acknowledges good points but ultimately finds the show bland, suggesting a mixed reaction rather than a clear recommendation. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the show has good points and pleasant atmosphere, the dominant critique is that it skates lightly over serious subject matter and comes across as bland, resulting in a tepid, neither-here-nor-there assessment.",
