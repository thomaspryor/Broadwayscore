  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Sometimes even the most stellar combination of exceptional creative talent doesn’t add up to exceptional theatre. That’s the case with the musical version of 'A Bronx Tale'...The book, reduced to Broadway musical formula, doesn’t get too deep, so the melodrama seldom rises above the sentimental. The themes of family, loyalty and morality are obvious...Cordero’s performance is the highlight...All the parts fall into place methodically and precisely but without much originality or inspiration.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic finds the show formulaic and uninspired despite praising Cordero's performance. The overall assessment is clearly negative, calling it sentimental melodrama that doesn't rise above Broadway formula. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for lacking depth and originality, describing it as formulaic and sentimental. While Cordero's performance is highlighted, the overall tone is negative, suggesting the show does not meet expectations. | Gemini: The review notes the lack of depth and originality, but also highlights Cordero's performance as a highlight, suggesting a mixed experience overall. The single excerpt and truncated nature of the text lowers the confidence. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the show as formulaic and lacking depth or inspiration, despite acknowledging competent execution and one strong performance. The excerpt consistently emphasizes the production's failure to transcend sentimental mediocrity.",
