    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review acknowledges the show delivers what it promises and praises some elements (Menken, performances), but finds it emotionally flat ('none of it causes your spine to tingle') and offers only faint praise ('far worse ways'). Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as having some appealing elements, like 'showy, starry central performances' and 'solid form' music, but it also notes a lack of emotional impact ('none of it causes your spine to tingle or your eyes to leak'). The mixed tone suggests a neither strong recommendation nor discouragement. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like the music and performances, but also notes a lack of emotional impact. The final line suggests it's not a waste of time, but not particularly compelling either. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges 'starry' performances and 'solid' music, the review dismisses the production values ('fake-looking') and emotional impact, ending with faint praise about killing time, suggesting a thoroughly mediocre but not terrible experience.",
