Praises direction, cast, and plot. Single excerpt warning noted, but tone is clearly enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the musical, highlighting its realism, moral ambiguity, and engaging plot. The direction and ensemble cast are also praised, indicating a high level of enthusiasm. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses very positive language such as \"stunning\", \"delicious\", and \"worth seeing once if not twice\", indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('stunning', 'delicious', 'wonderful') and explicitly recommends seeing the show twice, indicating strong approval. However, confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review.",
