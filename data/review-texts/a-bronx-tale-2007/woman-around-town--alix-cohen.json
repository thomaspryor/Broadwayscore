  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The book holds solid...Most numbers emerge an amalgam of pop and generic Broadway. I’m afraid the talented Alan Menken has been too long with Disney to put much pith into the score, which sounds homogenized...The tale has a big heart and aspects to recommend, but it could have been so much better...To my mind, directors Robert De Niro and Jerry Zaks both miss opportunities to show character definition and allow the leading man to get away with being bland.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Mixed assessment with both positives (solid book, big heart) and significant criticisms (homogenized score, bland leading man, missed opportunities). The phrase 'could have been so much better' suggests disappointment despite some redeeming qualities. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some positive aspects but criticizes the score and direction, suggesting missed opportunities and a lack of character definition. The overall tone is mixed, with both praise and significant reservations. | Gemini: The review notes positive aspects like the \"big heart\" but also criticizes the score as \"homogenized\" and the direction for missing opportunities, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the critic praises the solid book and 'big heart,' they deliver significant criticism of the homogenized score, missed directorial opportunities, and bland lead performance. The phrase 'aspects to recommend' indicates a qualified recommendation, but the tone is mildly positive at best with clear disappointment that the production 'could have been so much better.'",
