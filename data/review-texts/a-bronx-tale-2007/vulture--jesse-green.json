    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise ('handsome and reasonably well performed') but cuts off mid-sentence discussing moral concerns, suggesting unresolved issues. Limited text prevents clear verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a mildly positive assessment, noting the musical is 'handsome and reasonably well performed.' However, the lack of a full review and single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious approach, resulting in a lower score within the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt is positive, praising the performances and production quality. However, due to the limited text available, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers mild, qualified praise ('reasonably well performed') for the production and cast, acknowledging the show's handsome presentation and timely themes without enthusiasm. As a single curated excerpt with truncated text, the confidence is reduced.",
