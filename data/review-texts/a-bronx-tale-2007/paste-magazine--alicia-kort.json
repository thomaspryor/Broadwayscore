  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Although this musical isn’t particularly groundbreaking, it’s fun...'A Bronx Tale' hits on classical Broadway tropes to mostly positive results...'A Bronx Tale' is best during its ensemble numbers...It’s at its worst when Menken and Slater ply on the sentimentality. Certain songs are way too cheesy and seem old-fashioned in a bad way, but the fun characters and unexpected plot twists, which go against the conventions of many mob movies, show why this tale continues to take on new forms.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges that while the musical is not groundbreaking and has some cheesy elements, it is fun and has positive aspects, particularly in its ensemble numbers. The overall tone suggests a mild recommendation. | Gemini: The review states the musical is \"fun\" and has \"mostly positive results\", but also notes that some songs are \"way too cheesy.\" This suggests a positive recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise, noting the show is fun with strong ensemble numbers but suffers from cheesy songs and excessive sentimentality, resulting in a mild recommendation in the 70-74 range.",
