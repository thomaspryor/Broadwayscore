The story, about a boy's coming of age in an Italian neighborhood in the Bronx in the 1960s, has had a long, chameleon-like existence. Created by actor Chazz Palminteri ...",

With only one excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt states the musical \"isn't bad\" but also \"doesn't seem a necessary one.\" This suggests a mixed or neutral sentiment. | Kimi: While the critic concedes the production is competent ('isn't a bad musical'), the core criticism that the show 'doesn't seem a necessary one' questions its value and reason for being on Broadway, indicating a mixed verdict with significant reservations about its redundancy.",
