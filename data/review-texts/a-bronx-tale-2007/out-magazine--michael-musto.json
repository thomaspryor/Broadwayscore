  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The kid’s coming of age—and ongoing crisis deciding between love and fear—is well told in this appealing musical, which is expertly cast, slickly staged and dramatically involving. The boy’s Act Two romance with a black girl bogs down a bit in too many misunderstandings, and there may be too many songs about following one’s heart, but still, the creative team did a sturdy job in making this project sing.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Calls the musical 'appealing' and 'dramatically involving' with expert casting and slick staging, but notes specific flaws like pacing issues and repetitive themes. Single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the musical as 'appealing', 'expertly cast', 'slickly staged', and 'dramatically involving', indicating a positive recommendation. However, it notes some issues with Act Two and song repetition, suggesting reservations. Given the single excerpt and text quality warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"appealing musical\", \"expertly cast\", \"slickly staged\", and \"dramatically involving\". However, it also mentions some issues, indicating a recommendation with reservations. Due to the excerpted nature of the review, confidence is low. | Kimi: While noting minor issues with the second act romance and repetitive themes, the critic offers strong praise for the casting, staging, and storytelling, calling the creative team's work 'sturdy' and clearly recommending the show.",
