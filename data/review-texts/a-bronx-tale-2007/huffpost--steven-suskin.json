  "bwwExcerpt": "A Bronx Tale is unlikely to work without a strong performance in the central role of the gangster Sonny. (Palminteri played all the roles in the one-man show; he was Sonny in the film version.) Fortunately, Nick Cordero carries the musical with aplomb. This is the actor who appeared out of nowhere in 2014 and practically nabbed a Tony in the Woody Allen-Susan Stroman Bullets on Broadway, as the bodyguard Cheech. (Not incidentally, this role was created in Allen's 1994 film version by: Chazz Palm",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the lead performance as carrying the show 'with aplomb' and references the actor's previous near-Tony nomination. However, this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review verdict, requiring caution in scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Nick Cordero's performance, suggesting it is strong enough to carry the musical. However, the limited excerpt and lack of a full verdict necessitate a cautious, low-confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the strength of Nick Cordero's performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. Given the limited text, a score in the lower end of the positive range is appropriate. | Kimi: The critic emphasizes that the show depends entirely on the central performance of Sonny, and praises Nick Cordero for carrying the production with skill and confidence, indicating a clear recommendation based on his work.",
