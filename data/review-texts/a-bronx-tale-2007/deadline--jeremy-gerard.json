They don’t make ’em like they yoozta (try as they might)...Astutely staged by Zaks and, OK, De Niro, 'A Bronx Tale' unfolds briskly...As to the score, like the story itself, it’s instantly forgettable. Every line and every rhyme comes roaring down the straightaway from a mile off.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt shows mixed signals - praising staging as 'astutely staged' and 'unfolds briskly' but criticizing the score and story as 'instantly forgettable' with predictable writing. Single excerpt warning applies, suggesting cautious scoring. | GPT-4o: The review notes the show's brisk staging and nostalgic familiarity but criticizes the score as 'instantly forgettable.' The mixed tone suggests neither a strong recommendation nor a strong discouragement. | Gemini: The review notes familiarity and nostalgia, but also calls the score \"instantly forgettable.\" The staging is praised, but the overall impression is mixed, suggesting a middle-ground score. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the staging as 'astute' and 'brisk' but criticizes the score and story as 'instantly forgettable' and derivative of 'older, better shows,' suggesting a middling assessment.",
