    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt criticizes weak lyrics/book and dismissive treatment of women characters, but finds the central relationship moving and appreciates the score. The 'Still' suggests qualified interest despite reservations, indicating mixed reception rather than clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review notes weaknesses in the lyrics and book, and describes the women as 'window dressing', indicating some significant issues. However, it finds redeeming qualities in the father-son relationship and the score, suggesting a mixed but somewhat engaging experience. | Gemini: The review notes weaknesses in the lyrics and book, but finds the relationship between Calogero and his father moving, and the score pleasing, leading to a mildly positive recommendation. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: Single excerpt displays significant criticisms (weak book/lyrics, reductive female characters) but ultimately highlights redeeming qualities—a moving father-son dynamic and Menken's pleasing score—that 'keep us interested.' The tone is qualified approval rather than enthusiasm. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
