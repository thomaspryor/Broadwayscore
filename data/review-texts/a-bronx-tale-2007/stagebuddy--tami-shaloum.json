    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Multiple positive elements praised including score, choreography ('some of the best on Broadway'), and narrative balance. 'Sure to please fans' indicates recommendation. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but consistent praise suggests upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong praise for the choreography and music, suggesting a positive reception. The mention of it being a 'love letter' and 'sure to please fans' indicates a strong recommendation, despite the lack of a full review. | Gemini: The review excerpt is positive, highlighting the score, choreography, and balanced portrayal. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the choreography ('best on Broadway'), an 'unabashed love letter' to the material, and a 'fun' score, indicating a clear recommendation. However, confidence is low given this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's balance or verdict.",
