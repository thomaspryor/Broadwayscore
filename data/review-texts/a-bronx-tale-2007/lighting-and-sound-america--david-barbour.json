However, this is only one excerpt, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for being 'half-hearted' and 'weightless', indicating a lack of emotional depth and impact. Despite some positive notes about the production's efficiency, the overall tone is negative. | Gemini: The review expresses disappointment, stating the show \"lacks the flavor of life\" and ultimately feels \"weightless\" despite its dramatic elements. The critic finds the book and songs lacking depth. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges tuneful songs and efficient staging, the overall verdict is that the show lacks emotional weight and fails to dig deeply into its dramatic material, ultimately feeling 'weightless' despite its violent subject matter.",
