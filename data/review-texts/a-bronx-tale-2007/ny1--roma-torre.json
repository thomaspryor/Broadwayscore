Blake's Lorenzo and especially Nick Cordero's Sonny, possessing an irresistible mix of menace, street smarts and charisma!…Menken’s tunes–a terrific pastiche of ‘60’s sounds–are memorable...But you know what they say about too many cooks, and somehow the heart of the story ends up overpowered.\"\n\nRead more",

Praises specific performances and music but concludes the 'heart of the story ends up overpowered.' Single excerpt with low confidence due to potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The review highlights strong performances and memorable music, but notes that the heart of the story is overpowered, suggesting a mixed reception. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review highlights enjoyable aspects like the performances and music, but ultimately concludes that the story's heart is overpowered, suggesting a mixed experience. The truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises Menken's score and specific performances (particularly Cordero's 'irresistible' turn) but concludes that the adaptation loses the story's emotional core, suggesting a conflicted rather than fully recommendable verdict.",
