However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt calls the musicalization \"entertaining\" and the score \"tuneful\", indicating a positive, though not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. The single excerpt and truncated nature lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the production's entertainment value and fresh approach, highlighting the tuneful score and effective musical adaptation despite familiar source material.",
