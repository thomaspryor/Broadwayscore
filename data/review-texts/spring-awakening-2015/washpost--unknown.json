  "bwwExcerpt": "They're softer interpretations of the roles pioneered respectively by Jonathan Groff and John Gallagher Jr. (Lea Michele was the original Wendla, Melchior's love interest.) And with supporting actors such as Camryn Manheim and Patrick Page delivering more vocally assaultive turns this time as the oppressive adults in the story, the musical's dynamic has shifted: the teens in director Michael Arden's revival seem less defiant than embattled.",
