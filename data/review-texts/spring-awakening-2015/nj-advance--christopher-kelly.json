  "bwwExcerpt": "Arguably the strongest turn here is from Durant, whose Moritz is alternately prideful and meek, stoic and sweetly sensitive - in short, like every teenager you've ever met. But his voice counterpart, Boniello, falters as he strains to reach the high notes in 'And Then There Were None' and 'Don't Do Sadness.' The latter, a thrashing cri de couer of a boy considering suicide, should be among the show's most powerful moments, but here falls flat. Elsewhere, Manheim - making a very impressive Broadway debut - neatly defines four different adult characters. But Matlin feels wasted, and never gets a scene worthy of her potentially volcanic talents. See this 'Spring Awakening' anyway, because even a flawed performance of this great musical is still better than most of what's on Broadway right now; and because in a few instances - including the final exit of the teenage characters - Arden really has improved upon the original.",
