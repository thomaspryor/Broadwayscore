  "bwwExcerpt": "'Spring Awakening' puts such inclusivity to thematic use while keeping the show's rock-music energy high. For most of the show, the band remains integrated into the shadows of Dane Laffrey's industrial-looking set, whose steel walls and rolling stairs look more like a 20th-century power station than a German boys' school. But when necessary, the musicians aren't afraid to run out into the audience, who won't soon forget the sight of Matlin rocking an electric guitar in the boxed seats.",
