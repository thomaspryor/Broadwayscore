  "bwwExcerpt": "Occasionally - and Deaf West Theatre's production of Spring Awakening is a superb example - something latent in the material meets the mood of the time to make a revival not just a necessity but a great pleasure... This revival would have been unjustifiable were it not for the brilliant idea of placing the story in the context of deafness and using many deaf actors to tell it.",

The terms 'intimate and universal' imply a strong positive impact. | Gemini: The review describes the production as both faithful and radically reimagined, suggesting a positive take on the revival. The description of the production as intimate and universal further supports a positive classification. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the production's concept and emotional impact ('intimate and universal'), though the extreme brevity prevents a higher confidence rating or definitive bucket placement.",
