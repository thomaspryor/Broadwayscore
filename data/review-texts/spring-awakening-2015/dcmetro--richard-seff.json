  "bwwExcerpt": "Michael Arden and his Choreographer Spencer Liff have arranged a simple set, a brilliant lighting design, and stage movement that is inventive, startling and very useful in moving the long and complicated story forward. The role of \"Melchior\" once helped launch the career of Jonathan Groff, and it will do so once again with Austin P. McKenzie, who brings youth, good looks, a fine voice and total delivery of all of Melchior's charismatic qualities.",
