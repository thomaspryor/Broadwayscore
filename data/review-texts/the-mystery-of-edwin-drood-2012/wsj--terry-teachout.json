  "bwwExcerpt": "\"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" ran for 608 performances. Now the Roundabout Theatre Company has brought \"Drood\" back to Broadway in a revival directed with rip-roaring éclat by Scott Ellis, and I'll be surprised if it doesn't run at least as long as the original 1985 production. For sheer fun, this show is hard to top.",
