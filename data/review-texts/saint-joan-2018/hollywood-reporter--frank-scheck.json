  "bwwExcerpt": "Burn me at the stake for heresy if you must, but I'll say it. Even when done well, Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan is a slog. And since Manhattan Theatre Club's Broadway revival of the 1923 play isn't done very well, it's even more of a slog than usual. The production has been anticipated for the starring turn of three-time Tony nominee Condola Rashad in the title role. Unfortunately, this talented actress fails to galvanize the lengthy proceedings, making the play feel longer than it is. And at nearly three talk-filled hours, it's already very long.",

And since MTC's revival isn't done very well, it's even more of a slog than usual...Rashad certainly possesses the necessary physical presence...But she never quite gets a handle on the role...Shaw's play is more academic than dramatic, largely consisting of indigestibly windy philosophical debates and monologues...In this visually monotonous, static production, you come away feeling that the dialogue would be much better read than heard.\"\n\nRead more"
