  "bwwExcerpt": "Rashad does not turn Joan into John, but her maid of Orleans looks as though she could wallop any of the 17 men in the cast. With some help from heels and buoyant hair, she matches, if not exceeds, the height of the guys around her. Only John Glover's Archbishop towers over her. Then again, under his robes, like so many men in their priestly drag, he too may be wearing high heels.",
