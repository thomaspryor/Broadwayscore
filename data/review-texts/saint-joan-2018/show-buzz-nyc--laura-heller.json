  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"What a joy it is to watch a superb production of a Shaw play...Rashad radiates in a performance that has us enthralled from beginning to end. And this is no easy task since she is surrounded by a marvelous, venerated group of actors...The result is some of the finest character acting around.
