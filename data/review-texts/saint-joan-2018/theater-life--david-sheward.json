  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Rashad doesn’t deliver Shaw’s complete package in Sullivan’s tepid production...Rashad grows in power and conviction, but she never convinces as Shaw’s plain-spoken woman of the people or as a charismatic leader...A vital scene...which conveys Shaw’s central theme...falls flat due to the surface-y liming of Bobbie and Davenport.
