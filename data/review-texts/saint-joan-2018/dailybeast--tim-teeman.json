  "bwwExcerpt": "In this under-charged production of Shaw's 1923 play, first performed three years after Joan of Arc's canonization by the Roman Catholic Church, Rashad plays the iconic martyr as a lost-seeming, somewhat dreamy young woman. As directed by Daniel Sullivan, she is resolute, but gently so. She stays strong for sure, she leads an army, but our impression is of someone who is happier staring devotedly skyward.",
