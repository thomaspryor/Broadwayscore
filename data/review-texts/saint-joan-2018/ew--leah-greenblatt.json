  "bwwExcerpt": "The 1923 vintage of Shaw's play hardly shows its age in Scott Pask's staging (though his rich, gold-tinted set does lean toward the Art Deco) or in the loose, slightly winky direction by Daniel Sullivan (The Little Foxes). But color-blind casting and the occasional 20th-century colloquialism feel mostly like modern window-dressing on a story that's been marinating in the collective psyche for more than half a millennium.",
