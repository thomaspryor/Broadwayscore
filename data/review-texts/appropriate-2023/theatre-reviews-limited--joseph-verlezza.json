    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction for its pacing, suggesting a positive view of the production's energy. However, without more context, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt praises the director's pacing, suggesting a positive aspect of the production. Given the limited information, a low-end positive score is appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the director's pacing ('lightning speed'), indicating a well-crafted production. Following guidance for single clearly positive excerpts, this scores in the upper Positive range (80-84), though confidence is low due to the risk of cherry-picking.",
