    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows criticism of the play's social themes feeling 'detached' but praises direction and performance as 'expert' and 'artful'. With only one excerpt available, the mixed signals and lack of clear recommendation suggest neutral territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges expert direction and performance but notes a detachment in the play's use of race, indicating a mixed review. With only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a mixed assessment, criticizing the play's use of race but praising the direction and performances. This indicates a neither positive nor negative recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt presents a mixed assessment: it criticizes the play's thematic handling as detached from its entertainment mission, yet praises the direction and performances as expert and artful. As a single curated excerpt, the full verdict remains unclear, but the text balances significant criticism with production praise.",
