    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear recommendation with enthusiastic praise calling it 'the best kind of theater' and promising 'dramatic reward,' but single excerpt warning requires caution about full review context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'the best kind of theater' and recommends it for those seeking a challenge and reward, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language, calling it \"the best kind of theater\" and recommending it for those seeking a \"dramatic reward.\" | Kimi: The critic calls it the 'best kind of theater' and explicitly urges readers to 'See it,' promising a 'dramatic reward' despite challenging content.",
