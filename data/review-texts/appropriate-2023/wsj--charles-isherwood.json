And over, and over') and emphasizes excessive length as a negative, suggesting the production is tedious and not recommended. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt suggests a repetitive and potentially tedious experience, but without a full verdict, it leans towards a mixed impression. The critique of the play's length and repetitive nature implies some dissatisfaction, but the lack of explicit negative language suggests it isn't entirely dismissive. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the play is long and repetitive, indicating a mixed or slightly negative sentiment. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring conservatively within the Mixed bucket.",
