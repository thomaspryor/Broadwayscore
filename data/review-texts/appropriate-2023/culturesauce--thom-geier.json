    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('powerful', 'powerfully entertaining') with praise for direction making a 3-hour show 'fly by'. Single excerpt warning noted - this sounds clearly positive so scored in upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction and describes the play as 'powerful' and 'powerfully entertaining', suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language, calling the play \"powerful\" and \"powerfully entertaining.\" The director is praised for orchestrating the scenes with \"clockwork precision.\" | Kimi: The excerpt delivers strong praise for both the direction ('clockwork precision') and overall experience ('powerfully entertaining'), warranting an upper-range Positive score. However, confidence is reduced given this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's balance.",
