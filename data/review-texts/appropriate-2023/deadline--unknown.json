    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises the show's emotional impact and stagecraft as 'remarkable' and 'stunning', indicating a positive recommendation, but with only one curated quote available, I'm scoring conservatively within the positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a strong positive element of the production, focusing on the emotional impact and stagecraft of the ending. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The quote indicates a positive experience with the show's ending, but without more context, it's difficult to gauge the overall recommendation strength. I am placing it in the 'Positive' bucket with a score in the middle range due to the limited information.",
