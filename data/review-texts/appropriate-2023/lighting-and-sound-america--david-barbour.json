  "showScoreExcerpt": "“In its original production, Appropriate had a clanky, monotonous quality that undermined the playwright's premise; the characters came off as shrill and uninteresting, a gaggle of one-note harpies having at each other at a high decibel level. I can't tell what, if any, rewriting has taken place but, under the direction of Lila Neugebauer, a superb cast revivifies the play's foreground, bringing its legacy-of-slavery backdrop into sharper relief. Pulling off the niftiest trick of the season so far, Appropriate engages both as a cankered, poisonously funny black comedy and as a scalding satire on white privilege.”\n\nRead more",
