    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic identifies 'power' in the play's character work, suggesting appreciation for its psychological depth. However, with only one excerpt available, this could be from a mixed or negative review that acknowledges strengths while critiquing other elements. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests an interesting but not necessarily compelling play, focusing on character dynamics rather than impactful revelations. The lack of strong praise or critique indicates a mixed review. | Gemini: The single excerpt provided does not clearly recommend or discourage seeing the show, but suggests the play has some merit. The lack of a clear verdict and the single excerpt results in low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly identifies 'power' in the play's character dynamics and psychological insight, representing a clear positive evaluation. However, given this is a single curated excerpt that may not capture the full verdict, confidence is reduced. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
