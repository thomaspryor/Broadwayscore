  "fullText": "According to the dictionary, there are several definitions of the word ‘appropriate,’ but there may possibly be one that could be added, that being “a brilliant play by Brandon Jacob-Jenkins.” which is now having a stunning production mounted on Broadway by Second Stage Theater. Aptly titled “Appropriate” follows the ultra-dysfunctional Lafayette clan back to their family plantation home in Southeast Arkansas to settle the estate of their late father. They are plagued with troubles and scandals including divorce, incest, anti-Semitism, racism, rape, pedophilia, greed, and resentment to name just a few. What becomes fascinating as you watch the situations unfold and listen to the explanations and arguments, Branden Jacob-Jenkins is able to make this tortured family seem absolutely normal. Along with inheriting the southern gothic home and the contents, they must sell everything in hopes of raising enough money to cover the family debt which is attached to the estate. As the plot unfolds and the siblings gather, they begin to discover several family skeletons in the closets, along with those buried in the family and slave cemeteries that exist next to the house on the property. As the curtain rises what comes into view is a dimly lit, magnificent but neglected interior of a southern gothic plantation house, bursting with clutter and radiating a sense of doom and sadness into the air. A window is broken and what appears to be a burglar turns out to be Franz (a complex and emotional Michael Esper), the estranged sibling who vanished after committing a hideous act years ago. He is accompanied by his new partner River (a compelling, aloof new age Elle Fanning). Hearing the noise, sister Toni (a forceful and domineering Sarah Paulson) appears to confront the situation only to be shocked by the sight of her missing brother. It is a rocky and confrontational reunion. Toni seems to be running the show since she was abandoned by her siblings to be left as caretaker of their ill father and has been named executor of the estate. She is divorced, living only on alimony and is there with her teenage son Rhys (an emotionally complicated Graham Campbell). Finally, Bo (a structured and uptight Corey Stoll) the last of the clan arrives with family in tow which includes his Jewish wife Rachael (an irritated and distant Natalie Gold) and their two children Cassidy (an inquisitive and devilish Alyssa Emily Marvin) and Ainsley (a rambunctious Everett Sobers). Now that everyone has arrived, the once elegant and stately mansion can be stripped to its bare bones, revealing secrets from the past, as it serves as a slaughterhouse that aims to destroy the maladjusted, deteriorating Lafayette family. Artifacts from the past are discovered that give question to a history of racism that might have existed in the family. Rachael accuses the Lafayette patriarch of being anti-Semitic because of overheard slurs. Cassidy is having an online relationship with her questionable Uncle Rhys. Bo has lost his job and is broke hoping that he can profit from the estate. Toni has an endless list of events that have occurred that will support her anger. Rhys wants to go and live with his father to escape his smothering mother. Franz wants the past to disappear and has a very difficult time grasping the concept of right and wrong. This is demeaning, detrimental dysfunction at its best! The entire cast is remarkable, diving deep into their characters to expose every flaw, never falling to stereotype but rather building believability into the absurd situations. Director Lila Neugebauer moves the production along at lightning speed, but never misses an opportunity to convey the playwright’s message. Even the gorgeous, eerie, ominous set by dots, speaks volumes when it transforms into a powerful image for the final scene, as the deafening sounds of cicadas, by sound designers Bray Poor and Will Pickens invade the now abandoned battleground. After a successful run at the Helen Hayes Theater, “Appropriate will move and reopen at The Belasco Theater March 25th. Don’t think about it. Buy a ticket soon. It is a play not to be missed! Currently running at the Hayes Theatre, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s “Purpose” joins the important pantheon of plays about families, dysfunctional families in particular. These plays, including Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s recent “Appropriate,” focus on the behavior patterns and the social practices that undermine and often destroy the integrity of family systems. Sometimes there is… Loneliness, the quest for authentic and meaningful love, the fear of rejection, the need for respect, and the excruciating separation from situations of abuse are not unique to members of the LGBTQ+ community of any decade or location, and perhaps that is why audiences have responded positively to Harvey Fierstein’s… The familiar post-TONY lull that usually occurs during the summer months of July and August, when everyone takes a break to flee the city for a bit of ocean breeze, doesn’t seem to be happening this theater season. So those theater going tourists and local homebodies can partake in a…",
