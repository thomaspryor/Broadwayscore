However, this is only one curated excerpt, so confidence is low and the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction and performances, suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the direction and cast performances, suggesting a positive experience, but without more context, it's hard to determine the strength of the recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the direction ('skilled') and performances ('raw and nuanced,' 'depth'), indicating a clear recommendation. However, as a single curated quote, it may not capture the full scope of the review.",
