  "showScoreExcerpt": "Not only is Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ \"Appropriate\" a classic American family drama with a new wrinkle, it is also a trenchant and scorching look at American racism which is just under the surface. So fine a playwright has Jacob-Jenkins become that every line of dialogue develops character and plot. What is most shocking about the play is how little the younger generation depicted knows about its American history, things we all should be aware of. Lila Neugebauer’s production for Second Stage mines all of the play’s nuances and her staging is smooth and effortless.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the playwright ('so fine'), production quality ('mines all nuances', 'smooth and effortless'), and calls it a 'classic' with 'trenchant' social commentary. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential for cherry-picking. | Gemini: The review excerpt is highly positive, praising the play as a classic and trenchant look at American racism, as well as highlighting the smooth and effortless staging. Given the single excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for both the playwriting ('trenchant,' 'scorching,' 'classic') and direction ('mines all nuances,' 'smooth and effortless'), indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited single-excerpt context.",
