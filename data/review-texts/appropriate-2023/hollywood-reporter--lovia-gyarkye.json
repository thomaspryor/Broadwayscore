  "fullText": "There are no Black characters in Branden Jacobs-Jenkins' caustic family drama Appropriate, but they nevertheless haunt the play. They are the unmarked graves scattered over the grounds of the former plantation home in southeast Arkansas, where the story’s action takes place. They are the spirits, felt like a shiver by guests in the home. And they are the objects collected — hoarded, really — over decades by the estate's patriarch.\n\nHe's dead now, and Appropriate, which opened Monday at Second Stage’s Hayes Theater in New York, concerns the blistering reunion of his heirs. The production is the first of Jacobs-Jenkins’ original works to be on Broadway and is staged by Lila Neugebauer (Causeway), who directed the dramatist’s Everybody at Signature Theater in 2017.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "“...funny and sophisticated. The jokes are biting and some lines are impressively abrasive. But it edges away from the satire. Neugebauer’s fine direction instead leans into the acid drama of fraught sibling relationships. The play treats each character’s plight with an earnest consideration. There’s a more reflective, tragicomic stance as it considers what happens to families afraid to confront the past.”",
