    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows analytical praise for the playwright's thematic work, suggesting intellectual engagement and appreciation. However, with only one curated quote available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a thematic analysis rather than a clear recommendation. The tone suggests a complex view without clear praise or criticism, fitting a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive evaluation of the play's themes and impact, but without more context, it's difficult to gauge the overall strength of the recommendation. I am placing it in the positive bucket with a lower score due to the limited information. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for Jacobs-Jenkins' thematic execution and intellectual content using strong positive verbs ('demolishes'), placing it in the Positive bucket. However, confidence is low due to the single-excerpt warning indicating potential cherry-picking.",
