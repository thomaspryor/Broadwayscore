  "showScoreExcerpt": "“...funny and sophisticated. The jokes are biting and some lines are impressively abrasive. But it edges away from the satire. Neugebauer’s fine direction instead leans into the acid drama of fraught sibling relationships. The play treats each character’s plight with an earnest consideration. There’s a more reflective, tragicomic stance as it considers what happens to families afraid to confront the past.”",
