However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is conservatively placed in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive experience due to the direction, but the single excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation warrant a score on the lower end of the 'Positive' bucket.",
