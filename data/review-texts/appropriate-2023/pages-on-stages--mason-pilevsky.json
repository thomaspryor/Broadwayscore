  "showScoreExcerpt": "\" 'Appropriate' showcases three siblings discovering that their late father was in the KKK. The myriad effects on the siblings were coupled with a plot about inheriting property, losing property, and a legacy where people were property. The extent to which the characters struggled with that concept (and how to pass on the lessons of that legacy to the next generation), left me feeling that the most significant thing a person can inherit or pass down is intergenerational trauma.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: This single excerpt focuses entirely on thematic content and emotional impact without any clear evaluative language about the production quality or recommendation. The contemplative tone suggests engagement with the material but provides no indication of whether the critic recommends seeing it. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the themes and impact of the play, but doesn't offer a clear recommendation for or against seeing it. It's more of an observation than a judgment. | Kimi: The critic indicates the play effectively conveyed its themes about legacy and trauma, suggesting meaningful engagement with the material. However, the lack of explicit evaluative language and the limitation of only one curated excerpt warrant a lower Positive score and reduced confidence.",
