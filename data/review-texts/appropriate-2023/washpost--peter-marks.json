However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the play's power and the revival's \"searing precision,\" indicating a positive assessment. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm placing it in the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the revival's execution, describing it as achieving 'searing precision' in delivering the play's power, which indicates a clear recommendation.",
