  "fullText": "Death is cruel to the living. Mourning and memories often bring out a viciousness in those left behind. Hidden secrets and things left unsaid usually come spilling forth, fueled by the rage of grief. The weight of a dead loved one’s burdens isn’t easily suppressed. Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ “Appropriate,” now playing on Broadway, is a searing narrative about family ties, past hurts and unbridled pain. It’s a shocking play centering on legacy, race and the fragility of memory.\n\n“Appropriate” opens on the dilapidated estate of the Lafayette family in the dead of summer in rural Arkansas, where the cicadas can be heard loudly buzzing at night. Six months after their father’s death, three siblings, Toni (Sarah Paulson), Bo (Corey Stoll) and Franz (Michael Esper), come face to face for the first time in a decade to settle their dad’s affairs and rid themselves of the family home that has become overrun with junk.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The story holds together with incredible performances from the entire cast...Racist histories and artifacts are appalling, of course, but it’s the unwillingness to discuss the past that allows these prejudices to fester across generations. These beliefs not only continue to suffocate us as a society but are also wreaking havoc on the lives of families like the Lafayettes every day.”",
