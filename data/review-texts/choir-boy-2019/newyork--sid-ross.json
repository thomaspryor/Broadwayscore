  "showScoreExcerpt": "“McCraney refuses to settle for a modern, coming-of-age story...He starts there and incorporates—and implicates—the rest of humanity...‘Choir Boy’ succeeds not just because of its words and themes...It is impossible not to be swept away by the soaring, a cappella heights of the show’s songs and its use of complex, explosive dance movement...The production is sumptuously, sensitively directed...This is a play that exquisitely balances light and dark, hope and despair.”\n\nRead more",
