  "bwwExcerpt": "There are other tensions operating here, too. McCraney typically layers his stories with myth and archetype. But here he's abandoned most of his poetic and thematic flourishes (barring an on-the-nose speech in which Pharus discusses the beauty of spirituals), working instead in a more naturalistic style that while friendly to Broadway can sometimes feel a little pat. The short scenes tumble on speedily, but it's really only in the clefts between scenes, when the young men step forward, not necessarily in character, and deliver forceful, emotive versions of Rockin' in Jerusalem or Rainbow Round My Shoulder, that the play takes on a real intensity. In these moments Choir Boy ascends and its choirboys achieve, as long as the notes hold, what feels like freedom.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed assessment - criticizes the naturalistic style as 'pat' and notes issues with pacing, but praises the musical moments where 'Choir Boy ascends.' The critic sees clear strengths and weaknesses without a definitive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights moments of intensity and freedom in the play, indicating a positive experience, but also mentions some stylistic choices that feel 'a little pat'. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, the score reflects a mild positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review notes both positive aspects (intensity in musical moments) and negative aspects (naturalistic style feeling \"pat\"). The overall assessment is mixed, with no clear recommendation. | Kimi: While criticizing the naturalistic style as 'pat' and noting the play achieves intensity only during the musical interludes, the critic uses elevated language ('ascends,' 'freedom') to describe these sequences, indicating a qualified recommendation based on specific standout elements. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Positive, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
