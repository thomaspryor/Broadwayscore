  "bwwExcerpt": "Music and movement are central to the production. Camille A Brown's poetic and triumphant choreography and Jason Michael Webb's arrangements of traditional black spirituals provide cultural context and connect these boys to their history. These interludes also permit the characters to express themselves in ways that are not verbal - to move beyond words.",
