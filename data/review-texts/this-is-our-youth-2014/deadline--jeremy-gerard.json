  "bwwExcerpt": "The production is the latest transfer by Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater, and as staged by Anna D. Shapiro, it's typical of that celebrated troupe in its physicality combined with thoughtfulness...The play, which launched the careers of both Lonergan and Mark Ruffalo (the original Warren), now feels like a period piece; a shell of amber surrounds it. This may have to do with fine performances that nonetheless fail to connect. Culkin exudes energy but not the menace that makes Warren interesting; Cera raises blankness of expression almost to the level of art and Gevinson is simply out of her league on the Broadway stage.",
