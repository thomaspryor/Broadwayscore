  "bwwExcerpt": "Given a physically dynamic staging by director Anna D. Shapiro, 'This Is Our Youth' is diverting, and frequently funny. It does, though, go on too long. Stretched to 2 1/2 hours, it reveals its slenderness, as Dennis' bad behavior becomes repetitious, and we wait impatiently for his inevitable showdown with Warren. Despite that, it's the rare play that takes a serious and perceptive look at the challenging rituals and relationships people go through on the way to adulthood.",
