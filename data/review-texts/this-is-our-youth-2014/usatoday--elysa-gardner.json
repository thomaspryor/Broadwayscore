  "bwwExcerpt": "Shapiro is more restricted here, working with a smaller, less practiced company on a play that, for all its appealing aspects, betrays both its age and the relative inexperience of its gifted creator. But she manages to mine the wry humor and pathos in Youth's portrait of privileged despair and spiritual malaise...Sadly, Gevinson, who plays Jessica, is the production's weak link. Squirming and shouting her lines in a high-pitched whine that suggests barely repressed hysteria, she overplays Jessica's feigned confidence and confusion, making Warren's enduring attraction to her less convincing. Still, under Shapiro's patient guidance, this Youth is intermittently funny and poignant -- and provides a timely reminder that when our economy and culture are fractured, even the young and well-off suffer.",
