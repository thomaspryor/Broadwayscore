  "bwwExcerpt": "In spite of it all, I walked out of the two-acter curiously unfulfilled. The play rarely feels relatable, and I'm afraid it's mostly an issue with Cera, the talented 'Juno' and 'Superbad' star who here steps into a role quite similar to that of George Michael, the awkward man-boy he played on 'Arrested Development.' That's the rub -- I think Warren would be better cast with an actor who's got more range...'This Is Our Youth' comes to life whenever Culkin -- 31, but playing a character a decade younger -- is on stage. Dennis, the alpha, is abusive, caustic, violent and a crappy friend -- and yet, you absolutely care about him, because Culkin makes him human...Gevinson, 18, a fashion blogger and burgeoning actress, does effective work making us see Jessica as a young woman trying to own her sexual identity...Shapiro directs with her usual spot-on spontaneity and fluidity.",
