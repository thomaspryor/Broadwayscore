  "bwwExcerpt": "Kenneth Lonergan has made a career on stage and film with stories that summon the funny and sad quirks of ordinary lives. He's at the top of his game in his 1996 play 'This Is Our Youth,' now running at the Cort Theatre in a terrific revival...Cera mines every ounce of Warren's comedy and ache. His forlorn charm...makes you want to hug him. Culkin brings just the right cockiness for Dennis. The lesser-known Gevinson, who's famous in fashion circles, is the show's wild card -- and she's an ace. She brings a weird and wonderful vitality as the pretty and opinionated Jessica. Director Anna D. Shapiro...showcases the play's ample humor and the disquieting tones. Nearly two decades after its New York debut Off-Broadway, 'This Is Our Youth' has aged well.",
