The lack of reservations suggests a solid recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the actors for making the play feel immediate and urgent, indicating a positive experience. | Kimi: The critic offers strong praise for the central performances ('so good') and indicates they successfully elevate the material to feel 'immediate and urgent,' constituting a clear recommendation despite the brevity of the excerpt.",
