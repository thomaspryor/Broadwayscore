    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | Claude: This appears to be a brief excerpt with only neutral-positive description of the actors' approach. No clear recommendation or evaluation of the overall production quality, making it difficult to determine the critic's verdict. | Gemini: The review praises the actors' performances, describing them as bringing \"naturalistic energy\" to the play. This suggests a positive experience, warranting a \"Positive\" bucket score. | Kimi: The excerpt offers specific praise for the lead performances ('naturalistic energy') but is too brief to determine a clear overall recommendation for the production.",
