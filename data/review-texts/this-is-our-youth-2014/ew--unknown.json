  "bwwExcerpt": "Culkin is sensational as Dennis, a talkative schemer whose occasional stumbles in no way impede his innate sense of self-confidence. Cera is nearly as strong as Warren, a willfully quirky boy who collects action figures and vintage toasters and who endures Dennis' poetic rants of invective against him like a pound puppy who craves attention no matter what form it takes...At 18, Gevinson is closer to her character's age than her castmates--but she can seem less at ease on stage for reasons that have nothing to do with Jessica's natural discomfort hanging out in a strange apartment with a virtual stranger.",
