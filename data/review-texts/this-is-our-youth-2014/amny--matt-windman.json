  "bwwExcerpt": "Staged by Anna D. Shapiro with raw intensity and a rough edge, the current Broadway production features Michael Cera, Kieran Culkin and writer Tavi Gevinson...There's no escaping the fact that Cera is giving a performance that closely mirrors his nervous nice guy persona from 'Arrested Development' and 'Superbad.' Even so, it suits his character and he brings plenty of laughs. The 18-year-old Gevinson, who has terrific rapport with Cera, vigorously conveys Jessica's suspicious nature. Culkin displays greater range as Dennis, who embodies cocky 1980s materialism, seeing himself as an entrepreneur.",
