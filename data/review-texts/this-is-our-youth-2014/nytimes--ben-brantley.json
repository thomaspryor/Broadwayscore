  "bwwExcerpt": "Just watch these bodies in motion: loping, flying, dancing, vamping and writhing at an altitude known only to the permanently high and perpetually crashing. The acrobatics being performed in Anna D. Shapiro's sensational, kinetically charged revival of Kenneth Lonergan's 'This Is Our Youth,'...aren't anything like those you'd find at the Cirque du Soleil. But they're every bit as compelling, and probably (painfully) a whole lot closer to your own experience...Shapiro...knows how to scale up intimate confrontations to Broadway dimensions without losing nuance. Under her direction, 'Youth' becomes more explosively physical than I recalled it, a ballet of gracefully clumsy collisions. And Mr. Cera, Mr. Culkin and Ms. Gevinson imprint highly legible and individual signatures onto their characters, in ways that extend into every inch of their postures.",
