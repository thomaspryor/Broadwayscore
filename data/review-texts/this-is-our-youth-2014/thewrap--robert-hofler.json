  "bwwExcerpt": "Cera...is the Cera we know from the movies: quiet, nerdy, low-key with a delicate imbalance to his delivery that fits Warren as perfectly as the baseball cap he treasures. The 'Arrested Development' star is genuinely funny and endearing, and if you've never seen him on-screen before, his Warren will be a revelation. For those who have seen him, it's a performance without many surprises from an actor who has been here, done this male-waif thing. The good news is that he's not playing to the camera, and his performance fills the theater...The words 'total surprise' sum up Culkin's achievement here...Culkin presents a perfectly reasonable young cynic, one who's better than most slackers at selling drugs and conning his parents. There's real businessman acumen on display here...It's difficult to see what Shapiro wants to achieve with Tavi Gevinson's loud, hysterical interpretation of Jessica.",
