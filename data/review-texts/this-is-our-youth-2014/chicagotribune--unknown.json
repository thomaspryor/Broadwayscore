  "bwwExcerpt": "In its home base of Chicago, the Steppenwolf Theatre Company's studiolike production of Kenneth Lonergan's closely observed and emotionally potent 'This Is Our Youth' was an intimate, immersive affair...On Broadway, though, 'This Is Our Youth' is very different proposition...Shapiro's enjoyable production remains a sincerely acted and smart-eyed take...[Dennis is] exceptionally well played by Kieran Culkin, the cast member here who is most at home on a Broadway stage. He drives the production much more explicitly than was the case in Chicago. Cera ('Arrested Development,' 'Juno') remains his minimalist self, his back stiff and his body constantly residing on the lines of various acute angles. Not all of his work lands as easily on the bigger stage -- to expand Cera is not necessarily to improve him -- but this still is a very smart, funny and painful take on Warren, a tricky character whom Cera turns into an inept but empathetic soul...Gevinson...does not find the technical demands of working in a big Broadway house easy.",
