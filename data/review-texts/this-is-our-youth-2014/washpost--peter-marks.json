  "bwwExcerpt": "Under Anna D. Shapiro's superb direction - maybe the best work of her increasingly impressive Broadway career - Cera and his co-stars mine the material for every desired laugh, every interlude of pathos. Culkin's Dennis, a repository of self-regarding bravado whose out-of-control drug-dealing has prompted his rich parents to banish him to an apartment of his own, is no less remarkable: The bullying bile he aims at Cera's cowed Warren is spewed with magnum comic impact. And Gevinson, as self-conscious Jessica Goldman, a girl so contrary she manages to turn Warren's admiration for her into something bitter, makes the acting triumph here a triumvirate. What she and Cera do with a twisting scene, built around Warren's gift to her of a sentimental item, is itself a little treasure.",
