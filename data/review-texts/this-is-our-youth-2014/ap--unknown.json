  "bwwExcerpt": "Michael Cera, making his New York stage debut, once again perfectly captures being an awkward man-boy, while veteran fashionista and acting newbie Tavi Gevinson matches his goofy nervous energy. Kieran Culkin is marvelous as their smug, narcissistic friend. Spending two hours watching these wealthy, unmoored slackers is a treat, even without the contact high. The production...is directed by Anna D. Shapiro, who knows her way around onstage arguments ('August: Osage County') and movie stars (James Franco in 'Of Mice and Men'). She keeps this revival fresh and electric, crackling with energy even as the stoned get more stoned.",
