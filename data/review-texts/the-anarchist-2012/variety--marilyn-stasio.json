  "bwwExcerpt": "David Mamet being David Mamet, he can write plays about whatever he damn well pleases. But he can't seriously expect Broadway auds to share his fascination with the 1960s radical politics of the Weathermen, which he explores ad nauseam in 'The Anarchist.' David Mamet being David Mamet, he can also direct his own play however he damn well pleases. But he does no favors for the thesps in this two-hander by enabling Debra Winger to drone on and on and Patti LuPone to swallow half her lines. Better ship this one off to the college circuit tout suite.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The phrase 'generates more heat than light' is a clear negative assessment suggesting the play is argumentative but lacks meaningful insight or substance. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that while the play has some engaging elements ('battle of wits'), it ultimately lacks substance ('more heat than light'), indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review describes the play as a 'talky two-hander' that generates 'more heat than light,' suggesting it has some interesting aspects but ultimately falls short of being fully engaging or impactful. This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic uses the idiom 'generates more heat than light' to indicate the play produces drama but lacks intellectual substance, while 'talky' suggests a static, dialogue-heavy production that fails to engage. The brief length limits certainty, but the evaluative language clearly signals a negative assessment. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
