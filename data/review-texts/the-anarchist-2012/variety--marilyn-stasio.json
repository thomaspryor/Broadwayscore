  "bwwExcerpt": "David Mamet being David Mamet, he can write plays about whatever he damn well pleases. But he can't seriously expect Broadway auds to share his fascination with the 1960s radical politics of the Weathermen, which he explores ad nauseam in 'The Anarchist.' David Mamet being David Mamet, he can also direct his own play however he damn well pleases. But he does no favors for the thesps in this two-hander by enabling Debra Winger to drone on and on and Patti LuPone to swallow half her lines. Better ship this one off to the college circuit tout suite.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The phrase 'generates more heat than light' is a clear negative assessment suggesting the play is argumentative but lacks meaningful insight or substance. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that while the play has some engaging elements ('battle of wits'), it ultimately lacks substance ('more heat than light'), indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review describes the play as a 'talky two-hander' that generates 'more heat than light,' suggesting it has some interesting aspects but ultimately falls short of being fully engaging or impactful. This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic uses the idiom 'generates more heat than light' to indicate the play produces drama but lacks intellectual substance, while 'talky' suggests a static, dialogue-heavy production that fails to engage. The brief length limits certainty, but the evaluative language clearly signals a negative assessment. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",

The concept of a renegade assassin longing to quit may be a time-worn staple of noir cinema, but helmer-scribe Lim Sang-yun’s action-thriller is a jaunty ride nonetheless, straddling workaday reality and a fantasy world of kickass combat. The Showbox title has done socko business, with sales to 55 countries and more than 1 million domestic admissions. A bright career in ancillary looks likely.\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Music Industry Moves: Joy Oladokun Signs With Concord \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Miranda Lambert Sells Entire Song Catalog to Sony Music Publishing Nashville and Domain Capital\n\nJi Hyeong-do (So Ji-sub, “Always,” “Sophie’s Revenge”) is a midlevel employee at a contract-killing agency masquerading as a metal-shipping company. When he’s assigned to perform a post-assassination clean-up operation, which requires him to dispose of his newbie partner, Hun (Kim Dong-jun), Ji agrees to grant Hun’s dying wish, and pays a visit to the man’s family. He’s beside himself when he discovers that Hun’s single mother, Mi-yeon (Lee Mi-youn), was a pop idol he adored as a teenager.\n\nAlthough his onetime mentor, Ban (Lee Geung-young), advises him to stick around long enough for the retirement check, Ji’s buttoned-up existence begins to unravel even faster when he’s assigned to eliminate his supervisor, Jin (Yoo Ha-bok), a family man so burned out, he’s gone MIA.\n\nThe pic’s hook is hardly new: A firm of professional killers subscribing to the same soulless, number-crunching ethos of any conglomerate also serves as the underlying operational premise of recent Hollywood entries such as “Haywire” and “Looper.” But although the conceit quickly wears thin, the incongruity of Ji and his colleagues going to work in starchy suits, spending as much time filing reports and making presentations as they do practicing at a firing range, exerts a surreal fascination. Colorful supporting roles, including meddling senior manager Gwon (Kwak Do-won) and outwardly avuncular but ruthless chairman Jeon (Jeon Kuk-hwan), drive home the reality that office politics can be found anywhere.\n\nThe plot developments are nothing if not formulaic, from Ji’s “Le Samourai”-style existential emptiness to the inevitability with which he becomes a target himself, and the picture’s thematic comparisons become bluntly obvious toward the end. But innovation and contemplation are hardly the point here; Nam Na-young’s punchy editing keeps auds hooked with rapid fire shootouts and bone-crunching action, while scenes of hand-to-hand combat are choreographed with devil-may-care abandon.\n\nIn the sole departure from convention, Ji risks everything not for a young love interest, but for a snappy middle-aged housewife, played with endearing self-pity by Lee Mi-youn (emerging from a five-year hiatus). Their furtive exchange imbues Ji’s stiff-necked personality with some tenderness.\n\nTechnical execution is on the ball, though Lee Hyung-duk’s hyperactive lensing tends toward kitschy. Electronic rock riffs accompany the action sequences to spunky effect."
