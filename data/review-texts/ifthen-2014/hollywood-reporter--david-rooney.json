Praise for Menzel's performance doesn't override the fundamental critique of the show itself. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for being overstuffed and lacking emotional connection, despite praising Menzel's performance. The overall tone suggests a negative view of the production. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a committed performance but ultimately finds the show overstuffed and lacking emotional connection, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging the lead's committed performance, the critic uses 'despite' to emphasize that the show itself is critically flawed—overstuffed narratively and lacking emotional depth—indicating a negative recommendation.",
