Praises the lead performance but identifies significant structural issues that prevent a positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The critic acknowledges strong performances but highlights significant structural issues, aligning with the original rating of 60, which suggests a mixed review. | Gemini: The review acknowledges Menzel's strong performance but ultimately finds the show's flaws too significant to recommend without reservation. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The critic explicitly rates the show 60/100, praising Idina Menzel's committed performance while criticizing the show's structure and plot mechanics, resulting in a balanced mixed assessment where the negatives slightly outweigh the positives.",
