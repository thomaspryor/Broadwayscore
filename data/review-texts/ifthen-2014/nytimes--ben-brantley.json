    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite praising Menzel's powerful voice as 'a force of nature,' the critic clearly states that even her exceptional performance 'cannot lift' the show's fundamental flaws. This is a classic pattern where performer praise doesn't redeem an overall negative verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges Menzel's vocal talent but criticizes the overall concept of the show, indicating it fails to achieve its ambitions. The tone suggests a negative recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises Menzel's voice but ultimately states that she cannot save the show, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Kimi: While the critic praises Idina Menzel's voice as a 'force of nature,' the decisive 'but' clause establishes that the show itself fails due to its 'unwieldy concept,' making this a negative recommendation despite the lead's talent.",
