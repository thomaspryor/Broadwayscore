  "bwwExcerpt": "To be a Jew in 'Leopoldstadt' is unmitigated bad news, an identity to shed in good times and shun in bad ones. Mr. Stoppard's play delivers little of the joy of Jewish life, and plenty of its travails. It is a serious and old-fashioned play, admirable in its refusal to universalize, in its adamantine insistence that Jewish pain of 1942 matters in 2022. In telling his own tale, Mr. Stoppard, a lion in winter, proves that he still can create work that bites.",
