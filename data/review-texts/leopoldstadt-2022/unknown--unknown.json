However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The text is positive, calling it a \"critic's pick\" and saying it brings a lost world \"lovingly back to life.\" Given it's a single excerpt, I'm using the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The CRITIC'S PICK designation and appreciative praise for bringing the world 'lovingly back to life' indicate a clear recommendation, though the single excerpt limits confidence in the full verdict.",
