    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Clear positive assessment calling it 'deeply personal and moving' from 'one of our greatest living playwrights', but the excerpt is quite brief which limits confidence in the full review context. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong positive language ('deeply personal and moving', 'greatest living playwrights') indicating a high level of praise. However, the excerpt is short, so confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"deeply personal and moving\" and \"one of our greatest living playwrights\", indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives ('greatest living playwrights') and strong positive descriptors ('deeply personal and moving', 'epic in scope') that indicate enthusiastic, unqualified praise typical of a rave review. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
