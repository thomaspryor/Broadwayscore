    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt emphasizes the show's meaningful emotional impact and message. However, with only one curated quote available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive sentiment about the show's thematic impact, emphasizing its emotional and historical significance. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The quote suggests a positive and respectful portrayal of the subject matter, but the limited text and excerpt-only warning necessitate a lower confidence and a score on the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the show's emotional impact and thematic depth, appreciating its ability to humanize historical tragedy. While clearly positive, the single-excerpt limitation requires low confidence.",
