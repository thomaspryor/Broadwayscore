  "bwwExcerpt": "When seeing a Tom Stoppard play, one expects to be intellectually dazzled, if not emotionally devastated. That changes with 'Leopoldstadt,' now getting its U.S. premiere at Broadway's Longacre Theatre, which magnificently succeeds at both challenging the brain and piercing the heart. (So yes, it's worth the sometimes-painful effort to sit for two-plus hours without intermission.)",
