    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the work positively as 'accessible, straightforward, and emotional' but with qualification 'compared to other cerebral works.' This suggests mild praise rather than enthusiasm, placing it in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of 'Leopoldstadt' as accessible and emotional, though it implies a comparison to more complex works by Stoppard. The single excerpt and lack of full context result in a low confidence level. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive assessment, describing the play as accessible, straightforward, and emotional. However, due to the limited text and excerpt-only warning, the confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers qualified praise highlighting the show's accessibility and emotional resonance relative to Stoppard's typically cerebral style, suggesting a mild recommendation but lacking the superlatives of a rave.",
