  "bwwExcerpt": "The great playwright Tom Stoppard and his simpatico director Patrick Marber make a lasting gift of remembrance in the brilliant, gorgeous and devastating new play Leopoldstadt, opening tonight at Broadway's Longacre Theatre. But it's a gift that comes with strings, ropes even, the author seems to be warning us: There's burden attached to memory, and pain, and, above all, responsibility - duty, even - that accompanies every yellowed snapshot in an old family album and every fading face that once seemed fixed with such clarity.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear positive verdict - critic acknowledges flaws but finds the work 'compelling' enough to 'embrace.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential for cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the show's overall impact, despite some reservations about character connection. The praise for the 'sprawling and compelling' family history indicates a recommendation, albeit with noted challenges. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive but qualified recommendation. The phrase \"struggle with the details\" indicates a reservation, but the overall sentiment is positive due to the \"compelling\" family history. | Kimi: While acknowledging flaws (sacrificed character connection, dense details), the critic emphasizes the work is 'compelling' and that audiences 'embrace it,' indicating a solid recommendation despite structural challenges.",
