    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it a 'masterpiece' which is strong praise, but this is only a single excerpt so the full verdict may be more nuanced. The language is unambiguously positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'masterpiece' with 'characteristic wit and intellectual rigor,' indicating a highly positive assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"masterpiece\" and phrases like \"deeply personal meditation\" and \"characteristic wit and intellectual rigor,\" which indicate a strong positive assessment. Given that this is only one excerpt, the confidence is low, but the language is strong enough to warrant a score in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs superlative praise ('masterpiece') and describes the work as deeply personal and intellectually rigorous. However, as a single curated excerpt that may be cherry-picked and not fully representative, it scores in the upper Positive range (80-84) per the specific guidance for single-excerpt reviews, with low confidence.",
