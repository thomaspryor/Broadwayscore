    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows structural criticism (pacing, length issues) but doesn't dismiss the show entirely. With only one curated quote available, confidence must be low as this could be cherry-picked from a more positive or negative overall review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the production is not fully effective in its current form, indicating a mixed review. The lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning lead to low confidence. | Gemini: The review states that the play needs more time to let its drama play out effectively and could use an intermission, indicating a negative assessment of the play's pacing and overall impact. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt criticizes the production's pacing and condensed structure, suggesting the drama suffers from the lack of an intermission. This indicates significant reservations about the production's effectiveness, though without the full review context, the overall recommendation remains unclear.",
