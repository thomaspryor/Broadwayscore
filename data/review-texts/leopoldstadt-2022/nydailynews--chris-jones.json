  "bwwExcerpt": "Marber's production has enough energy and forward motion to ensure that the emphasis on character does not impede its dramatic intensity. And he helps make it easier to follow (it's not always easy to recall who is related to whom, as the years spin on to 1955). But the unfussy direction also lets everyone talk, emote, kvetch and, of course, go on with their lives as best as they can.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt focuses on a specific aspect of the show (use of photographic technologies) without clear evaluative language indicating a strong recommendation or discouragement. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach, placing it in the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt is mildly positive, focusing on a specific element of the show. Given the limited text and the warning about cherry-picked quotes, a lower positive score is appropriate. | Kimi: The critic suggests the production will be remembered for its distinctive staging involving photographic technology, indicating a positive, if qualified, impression. Given only one excerpt is available, confidence is low.",
