The positive tone suggests recommendation, but limited text warrants low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the show's narrative and character development, with an implied recommendation. However, the single excerpt and text quality warning limit confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, highlighting the narrative, characters, and credibility. Given it's a single excerpt, the confidence is low, and the score is in the lower-middle of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the play's narrative structure, character development, and thematic relevance, indicating a clearly favorable recommendation despite the limited available text.",
