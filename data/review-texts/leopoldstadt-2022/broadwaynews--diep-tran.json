    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | No bucket consensus - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows powerful emotional impact but also concern about length. With only one curated quote available, this could be cherry-picked from either direction, requiring low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a significant emotional impact but also hints at potential drawbacks with the length and pacing ('a lot of play'). The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a mixed interpretation. | Gemini: The excerpt describes a negative emotional impact, suggesting the reviewer did not enjoy the show. Given the single excerpt and the warning, I am scoring this as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt describes a visceral, overwhelming emotional impact ('oxygen had left the room'), indicating the production delivers a powerfully affecting experience appropriate to its serious subject matter. Scored at the upper end of Positive per single-excerpt guidelines, though confidence is low given limited text availability. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Positive",
