  "bwwExcerpt": "Leopoldstadt is the sort of dizzying intellectual panorama for which Stoppard is revered - a chronicle of social movements, theoretical frameworks, and geopolitical catastrophes. (Drink every time someone speaks passionately about the state of the world, and you'll have to crawl home.) The play, directed by Patrick Marber in a production that premiered in the West End, proceeds through 50-plus years in just over two hours, introducing more than two dozen characters that it seems to understand we won't be able to keep straight. Those details don't matter in the larger sweep of history, and the family's fate is evident from the start.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls the show 'remarkable' which is strong praise, but with only one excerpt available, confidence is low. The language suggests intellectual appreciation and recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'remarkable,' indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low despite the clear positive tone. | Gemini: The single excerpt uses the word \"remarkable,\" which indicates a positive assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a score in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strong positive language ('remarkable') regarding the production's thematic resonance and dramatic impact, indicating a favorable review, though the limited single-excerpt scope warrants cautious confidence.",
