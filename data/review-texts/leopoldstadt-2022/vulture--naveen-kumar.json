    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls the show 'remarkable' which is strong praise, but with only one excerpt available, confidence is low. The language suggests intellectual appreciation and recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'remarkable,' indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low despite the clear positive tone. | Gemini: The single excerpt uses the word \"remarkable,\" which indicates a positive assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a score in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strong positive language ('remarkable') regarding the production's thematic resonance and dramatic impact, indicating a favorable review, though the limited single-excerpt scope warrants cautious confidence.",
