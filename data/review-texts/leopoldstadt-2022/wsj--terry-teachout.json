    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Calling it potentially Stoppard's 'finest play' is extremely high praise from a major critic. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked praise from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as possibly Stoppard's finest, highlighting both intellectual and emotional achievements. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt contains very high praise, calling the play Stoppard's \"finest.\" Given the single excerpt, I am placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise describing the work as Stoppard's 'finest play' with unprecedented emotional directness, indicating strong recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt that may be cherry-picked, the score is capped at the upper end of the Positive bucket with low confidence. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
