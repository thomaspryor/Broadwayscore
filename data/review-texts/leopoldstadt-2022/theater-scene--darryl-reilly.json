    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the drama as 'entrancing' and highlights the theatrical rendering by the director, suggesting a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The phrase \"entrancing epic drama\" suggests a positive assessment, but the limited excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation necessitate a score on the lower end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly positive evaluative language ('entrancing', 'theatrically rendered'), placing it in the upper Positive range. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence is low regarding the full review's verdict.",
