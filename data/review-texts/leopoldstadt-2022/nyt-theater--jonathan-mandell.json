  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Leopoldstadt” – bustling with characters, bristling with debate, packed full of facts — is less a collection of distinct portraits or plot points than a rich tapestry of twentieth century Jewish life, and then the frayed threads of Jewish loss….a straightforward if sprawling epic about a dark history that also winds up both intimate and ultimately moving. It’s hard not to see it as the 85-year-old playwright’s attempt at a personal reckoning.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic describes the play as 'intimate and ultimately moving' with clear appreciation for its emotional impact, but notes it's 'sprawling' which suggests some structural concerns. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mildly positive but may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as a 'rich tapestry' and 'ultimately moving,' indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"rich tapestry\", \"intimate\", and \"ultimately moving\", suggesting a positive experience. Given the limited excerpt, the confidence is low, but the positive tone suggests a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates clear appreciation for the show's emotional resonance and historical scope, describing it as 'ultimately moving' and a 'rich tapestry,' though noting it is 'sprawling.'",
