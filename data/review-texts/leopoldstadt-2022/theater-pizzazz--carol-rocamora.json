    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt uses strong evaluative language ('should be hailed as a great new play') suggesting enthusiastic recommendation, but low confidence due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, suggesting the play is a significant work. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single quote is extremely positive, calling it a \"great new play\". Given the limited text, I am placing it in the upper end of the positive bucket, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The single available excerpt contains strongly positive evaluative language ('great new play,' 'should be hailed'), warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket per the single-excerpt instructions. Confidence is low due to the severely truncated text and lack of full review context.",
