  "showScoreExcerpt": "Stoppard manages to give most of those assembled significant dramatic material to chew on, thereby presenting their individual stories in a way that reveals them—even if more in outline than three dimensions—as human beings to whom we can relate, while also illuminating issues of anti-Semitism. The plethora of characters, however, does create the dilemma of trying to keep track of who’s who and how they’re related to one another.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt praises Stoppard's dramatic writing and character development, but notes structural issues with tracking multiple characters. Single excerpt warning suggests caution - this appears mildly positive but may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the dramatic material and relatability of characters but notes a significant issue with the plethora of characters creating confusion. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence in the verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the play has significant dramatic material and reveals characters in a relatable way. However, the excerpt also mentions the difficulty of keeping track of the characters, suggesting a reservation. Given the single excerpt, the score is placed at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt balances praise for the dramatic material and thematic illumination of anti-Semitism against criticism of shallow character development and confusing narrative structure, resulting in an ambivalent evaluation without clear recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Mixed",
