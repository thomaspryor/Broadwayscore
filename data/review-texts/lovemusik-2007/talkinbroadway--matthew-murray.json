However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be setup before a more positive verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates the show fails to succeed as both a musical and a drama, suggesting a negative assessment. However, the single excerpt may not fully represent the review's overall sentiment, leading to low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt clearly states the show fails as both a musical and a drama, indicating a negative assessment. Confidence is low due to the limited text. | Kimi: The critic delivers a definitive negative verdict, stating the show fails to succeed as either a musical or drama, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence.",
