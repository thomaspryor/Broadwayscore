However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a longer, more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a negative verdict with 'it doesn't work,' suggesting the show fails in its thematic execution. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic states that the show \"doesn't work,\" indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic delivers a definitive negative verdict on the show's core premise, explicitly stating that it 'doesn't work,' indicating a clear failure of the production to achieve its intended thematic goals.",
