  "bwwExcerpt": "In this new work, a sequel -- with different good actors and capital letters -- to his 2008 \"reasons to be pretty,\" the play is a surprisingly straightforward and awfully mundane relationship drama about four working-class people with what-does-it-all-mean? crises...Understandably, LaBute appears to be working to escape his reputation for shock endings. Alas, the alternative, at this point, is pretty dull.",
