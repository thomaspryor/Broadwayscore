  "fullText": "A firestorm of abuse and invective, hot enough to scald the hide off a thick-skinned man, blasts through the opening minutes of “Reasons to Be Pretty,” the surprising new play by Neil LaBute that opened Monday night in a superbly acted production at the Lucille Lortel Theater.\n\nThomas Sadoski and Alison Pill in Neil LaButes new play \"Reasons to Be Pretty,\" at the Lucille Lortel Theater.\n\nSentimental education in LaButeville: Thomas Sadoski, on the ground, with Pablo Schreiber in Neil LaButes Reasons to Be Pretty, directed by Terry Kinney.\n\nEven audience members accustomed to the outright nastiness of much of Mr. LaBute’s previous plays will find themselves squirming as a young woman (played by Alison Pill) attacks her boyfriend, at ear-scraping volume, with every epithet within her vocabulary. LaBute characters are rarely happy campers, yet none of them have ever been so unconditionally, uncontrollably, overwhelmingly angry as this one.\n\nBut Mr. LaBute has a bigger surprise in store than this opening fireworks display.\n\nPeople will continue to erupt and lash out, not to mention punch one another bloody, in “Reasons to Be Pretty,” which is directed with a fine hand by Terry Kinney. But the authorial force that drives them is one I have never encountered in a work from this writer: Neil LaBute, the harsh and unforgiving chronicler of men’s darkest impulses, is making nice.\n\nMr. LaBute’s earlier works, both dramas (“bash,” “The Mercy Seat”) and screenplays (“In the Company of Men,” “Your Friends and Neighbors”), have been shaped by a glaring judgmental vision of the ways men and women (especially men) use and hurt one another. If there was comic glee in these pieces, there was also puritanical contempt.\n\n“Reasons to Be Pretty” is less condemning than questioning. And it’s shot through with compassion for four young working-class friends and lovers who are starting to realize that they are trapped in dead-end lives. The four immensely talented cast members  Piper Perabo, Thomas Sadoski, Pablo Schreiber and Ms. Pill  respond to this newly found empathy with some of the most sensitively shaded performances in town.\n\nIt’s not all that easy to smile after more than a decade of professional scowling. “Reasons to Be Pretty” has an adolescent awkwardness at times that is the opposite of the contrived jigsaw-puzzle precision associated with Mr. LaBute.\n\nIn a playwright’s note in the program, he writes that this is “the first coming-of-age story I’ve written.” And he doesn’t avoid the clichés or mistiness of that genre in recounting the sentimental education of Greg (Mr. Sadoski), an autodidactic warehouse worker trying to figure out who he is in the wake of a brutal breakup with Steph (Ms. Pill).\n\nBut Mr. LaBute has also released himself from the obligations of feeding a single moral theme and a corkscrew-turn plot leading to a “gotcha” ending. And he stretches like someone who has taken off a tight girdle. The relatively easygoing sprawl of “Reasons to Be Pretty” allows his characters to talk naturally and at leisure as they ponder their own often less-than-pretty natures.\n\nIn the course of these conversations, you realize anew what a sensitive ear Mr. LaBute has for the uncommonness in common speech  of the individuality within everyday language  and for how people of all levels of education and eloquence use words as instruments of power. Those four-letter missiles that Steph hurls at Greg in the first scene are only the flashiest examples of words as defensive artillery. There are far more subtle variations to follow.\n\nWhat provoked that initial tirade, by the way, was Steph’s hearing that Greg, in comparing his girlfriend with a pretty new employee where he works, has described her face as “regular” looking. An innocuous adjective, you might think, but it’s potent enough to make Steph walk out in high dudgeon on a four-year relationship.\n\nAt the warehouse Greg sifts through his life with Steph in conversations with Kent (Mr. Schreiber) and Carly (Ms. Perabo), a security guard and Kent’s wife. That no one could call Carly, a knockout blonde, regular-looking becomes the subject of further ruminations on the nature and importance of beauty.\n\n“Reasons to Be Pretty” is the final installment of a trilogy by Mr. LaBute devoted to the contemporary obsession with physical appearance, following the abrasive “Shape of Things” and the gentler (and superior) “Fat Pig.” The subject is explored here in four monologues, one per character and all strong, except for a concluding speech by Greg that sums up the-lessons-he-has-learned way too sweetly and glibly. All of these pale, though, next to a rivetingly uncomfortable scene in which Steph reads aloud  quite audibly, in a food court at a mall  a catalog of everything that’s wrong with Greg’s appearance.\n\nRoom for Debate asks whether shorefront homeowners should have to open their land to all comers.\n\nNew York City's top public schools must become more diverse.",
