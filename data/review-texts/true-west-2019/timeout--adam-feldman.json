  "bwwExcerpt": "If the charismatic Hawke all but wipes the floor with Dano in the play's first half, Dano gets his turn to act out in Act Two. These are showcase roles, and the actors play them with gusto. James Macdonald's Roundabout Theatre Company production occasionally errs on the side of the obvious: Marylouise Burke brings her customary off-kilter comic panache to her cameo as the brothers' late-returning mom, but Gary Wilmes smears an extra layer of grease on the already oleaginous role of a Hollywood producer, and a showy change of lighting undermines Austin's big story about how his dissolute father lost two pairs of teeth.",

The key quote highlights the strong performances of the leads, indicating a recommendation. | Gemini: The review is very short, but the critic explicitly states that the production succeeds due to the leads' performances. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic assigns an 80/100 rating and praises the 'ferocious commitment' of the alternating leads as the primary reason for the production's success, indicating a solid recommendation despite the brief excerpt.",
