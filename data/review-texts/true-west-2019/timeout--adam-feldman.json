Given the original rating of 80, this indicates a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The review explicitly states the production 'succeeds' and praises the 'ferocious commitment' of the lead actors, indicating a clear positive recommendation. The original rating of 80 supports this classification in the Positive bucket.",
