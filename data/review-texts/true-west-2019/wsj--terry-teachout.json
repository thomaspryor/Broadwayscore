  "bwwExcerpt": "But while 'True West' fails to add up to a convincing dramatic whole, it still works as a vehicle for two first-class actors, and the stars of this revival qualify. Mr. Hawke, who has the flashier of the two parts, comes on strong, occasionally over-egging the pudding (you get the feeling that he's enjoying himself a little too much) but nonetheless giving a performance in which you can smell the anger and envy leaching out of his pores. Mr. Dano, by contrast, is both subtler and more interesting: Here as in 'Love & Mercy,' he plays a character whose bland surface serves as camouflage for roiling interior turmoil, and everything he does in 'True West' is excitingly surprising.",
