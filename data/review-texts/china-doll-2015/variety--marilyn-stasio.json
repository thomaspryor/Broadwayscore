    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Clear praise for Pacino's performance but decisive criticism of Mamet's script as 'static, repetitive.' The 'but even' construction indicates the performance doesn't redeem the material. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges Al Pacino's performance but criticizes the script as static and repetitive, leading to a negative overall assessment. | Gemini: The review praises Pacino's performance but criticizes the script, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the critic praises Pacino's 'bravura' and 'magnetic' performance, the 'but' construction makes clear that the flawed script sinks the show, constituting a recommendation against seeing it. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
