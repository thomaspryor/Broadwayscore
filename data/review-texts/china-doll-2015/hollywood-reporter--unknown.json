  "bwwExcerpt": "If the expiration date on Donald Trump's turn in the political arena should arrive any time soon, and he wants to try his hand at another kind of acting, there's a vehicle tailor-made for his blustery shtick in David Mamet's new play, China Doll. In fact, during the boring parts -- and yes, there's no shortage of them in this windy anecdote about the clash between one-percent arrogance and political opportunism -- it's mildly entertaining to imagine Trump vomiting indignation as besieged moneybags Mickey Ross. In the meantime, Al Pacino, for whom the role was written, huffs and puffs his way through a performance that remains oddly tentative despite all the showboating mannerisms.",
