  "bwwExcerpt": "In David Mamet's new play 'China Doll,' Al Pacino circles the stage, puttering and muttering in the manner of an adrift and aggrieved Lear...It's an intriguing lion-in-winter performance, one that captures both the vanity and tragedy of a giant trying to hang onto his old glory -- a subject Pacino presumably knows a bit about himself. If only Mamet had given him a coherent story and character to work with...The reality isn't nearly that terrible, but Mamet nonetheless seems to have no idea what he's trying to say here...Whether 'China Doll' is actually about old age, or instead about the intersection of politics and money, or how ambition destroys itself -- or something else entirely -- remains anyone's guess.",
