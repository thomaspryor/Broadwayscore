  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"David Mamet has written a tense and involving one-act play. Trouble is, he’s written it as a two-act play…Although the playwright holds off on his ending for longer than he should, when it does arrive, it’s explosive...It’s not only a surprise, it’s perhaps even too much of an unexpected plot turn.
