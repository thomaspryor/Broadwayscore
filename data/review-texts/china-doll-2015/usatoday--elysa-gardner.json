  "bwwExcerpt": "In Mamet's new play, China Doll (*** out of four stars)...both businessmen and politicians take their lumps, but the latter emerge as the real scourge...During much of the play, Mickey is on the phone, making his case to different key players whom we neither see nor hear. The only other character present is his assistant Carson, a stoic but patently ambitious young fellow played with marvelous discretion by Christopher Denham...Pacino, stooping slightly, paces and gesticulates; his pauses and occasional mumbled lines (others are shouted, with sometimes alarming intensity) seem entirely in character...The play itself is not always coherent, veering from obvious political commentary...to recurring references to 'seduction' and 'protection' in male-female relationships...But if China Doll is sometimes shaky or confounding, it is never boring. Whatever Mamet's points, he and Pacino consistently engage us -- which is more than you can say for a lot of the folks the playwright is targeting here.",
