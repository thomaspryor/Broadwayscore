    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative assessment comparing the show unfavorably to forced therapy, criticizing it as meandering rather than dramatic. No redeeming qualities mentioned. | GPT-4o: The review is strongly negative, describing the play as a 'very expensive therapy session' and criticizing its structure as a '90-minute monologue'. There are no redeeming qualities mentioned. | Gemini: The review clearly states the show is more like a therapy session than a play, indicating a negative experience. The description of a meandering monologue further supports this classification. | Kimi: The critic employs dismissive language calling the show a 'therapy session' that audiences are 'forced to attend,' and criticizes the writing as 'meandering.' While this appears to be an excerpt of a longer review, the available text conveys a clear negative assessment.",
