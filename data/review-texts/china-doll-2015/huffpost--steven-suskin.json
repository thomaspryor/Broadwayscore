  "bwwExcerpt": "Mamet has come up with something that is not quite an extended monologue, but almost so...China Doll is almost exclusively Pacino on the phone having endless conversations with unseen characters. The advantages of this are several...We never hear what the other people are saying, although one imagines that Mickey Ross--in context--doesn't listen to what other people are saying, anyway...In Act Two, though, we fall into a web of plotting that becomes more and more intricate...As the events spin out, we wonder if maybe the playwright is purposely keeping things enigmatic so he doesn't have to do the work of concisely figuring it out. Ultimately, it feels like a stunt; by keeping the other side of the discussion silent, the playwright doesn't have to justify what Mickey is saying...If China Doll has its weaknesses--and it has--it also has Al Pacino. And Al Pacino, on this occasion, is enough.",
