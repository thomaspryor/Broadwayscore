  "bwwExcerpt": "And even if that Bluetooth device that's stuck in his ear for most of the night has someone cueing him for every line...Pacino's not letting on. He's detailed, committed and always interesting to watch. The play itself is pretty meat-and-potatoes Mamet with the star playing a standard Mametian patriarchal, alpha male son of a slime ball...While Pacino's Mickey is erratic and caustic, speaking in an unpredictable cadence and tone, Christopher Denham's Carson is soft and unobtrusively in control of every potential crisis. Though onstage for nearly the entire play, he spends much of it quietly handling matters in the background, while Mickey is bullying his way through an unseen cast of supporting characters...but the balance he adds to the play is invaluable and the most effective asset of director Pam MacKinnon's production.",
