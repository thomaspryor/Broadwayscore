  "bwwExcerpt": "For the most part, 'China Doll' is a rambling, incoherent monologue. Since we never hear from the people that Pacino is speaking to by phone, it is the equivalent of a conversation where half the lines are missing...With big gestures and expressions, Pacino delivers a highly worked-up, outlandish performance that could be interpreted as a desperate attempt to add entertainment. Despite the play's problems, Pacino's theatrics throw it off further dramatically. The visual opulence of Pam MacKinnon's production is also questionable. It would be interesting to compare this with a leaner production of the play. But on second thought, it may be best to just put 'China Doll' to rest.",
