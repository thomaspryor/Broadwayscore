  "fullText": "Updated December 3, 2015 10:35 PM\n By Linda Winer linda.winer@newsday.com\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nWHERE Schoenfeld Theatre, 236 W. 45th St.\n\nINFO $82-$167.50; 212-239-6200; chinadollbroadway.com\n\nBOTTOM LINE Pacino works hard on Mamet’s lazy “China Doll.”\n\nLittle wonder there were rumors that Al Pacino couldn’t remember his lines in David Mamet’s new “China Doll,” which had its opening postponed for two extra weeks of previews at top prices.\n\nThe playwright has given Pacino, apparently one of his favorite actors, almost no story to build around his character and given him lines that pick over the same obvious plot points, mostly with the same barking emphasis, to nonexistent people supposedly on the other end of his phone’s Bluetooth earpiece.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nSo except for Carson, an ambitious office flunky (Christopher Denham in a thankless role), this is an almost two-hour (including an intermission) monologue that leaves Pacino virtually alone up there trying to dazzle us with shockingly little help from Mamet’s celebrated motormouth.\n\nPacino plays Mickey Ross, a rich old hotshot mogul/politico/crook with an oblique back-story, who desperately wants to reunite with his beautiful young girlfriend in Toronto and his new $60 million plane. The business isn’t fun anymore. Rivalry with a candidate for governor, the son of “the old man” who mentored Mickey, is getting uglier.\n\nPacino is legendary for his obsessive work for years on the same handful of plays, including Mamet’s “American Buffalo.” It is always a kick to watch him wrestle with a character — and this one is a beast. There are times, mostly in the second act, when he seems delighted with the Mickey that he and (we assume) director Pam Mackinnon are creating.\n\nAnd this one is a beast. With his unsettling gray bouffant, his lizard eyes and his wrinkled black power suit, he cuts a scary yet baleful figure in a penthouse as big and cold as an airplane hangar (designed by Derek McLane). He yells at Carson, wheedles and hollers and goes mock-humble on the phone. Every so often, Mamet gives him a wonderful line that sums up the dark side of humanity. More often, however, the writing is as lazy as Mickey calling someone “more fun than a Swiss Army Knife.”\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nMickey wants to retire with his spoils. But, with what we hope are intentional echoes of Michael Corleone’s famous “Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in” speech, Mickey is stuck. So, alas, is Mamet.\n\nComing soon: Newsday's Entertainment newsletter, for the latest on celebs, TV, more.\n\nNewsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

The review criticizes the script as repetitive with 'shockingly little help from Mamet's celebrated motormouth' and calls the writing 'lazy.' While praising Pacino's legendary work ethic, the verdict is that both star and playwright are 'stuck' in an unsatisfying work. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the play for having almost no story and lazy writing, despite acknowledging Pacino's efforts. The overall tone is negative, focusing on the play's shortcomings. | Gemini: The review indicates that Pacino works hard, but the writing is lazy. The reviewer uses negative language such as \"thankless role\", \"shockingly little help\", and \"writing is as lazy\". Overall, the review does not recommend the play. | Kimi: While praising Pacino's committed performance and presence, the critic finds Mamet's script lazy and structurally unsound, describing it as a monologue with 'shockingly little help' for the star, ultimately recommending against the production.",
