The business isn’t fun anymore. Rivalry with a candidate for governor, the son of “the old man” who mentored Mickey, is getting uglier.\n\nPacino is legendary for his obsessive work for years on the same handful of plays, including Mamet’s “American Buffalo.” It is always a kick to watch him wrestle with a character — and this one is a beast. There are times, mostly in the second act, when he seems delighted with the Mickey that he and (we assume) director Pam Mackinnon are creating.\n\nAnd this one is a beast. With his unsettling gray bouffant, his lizard eyes and his wrinkled black power suit, he cuts a scary yet baleful figure in a penthouse as big and cold as an airplane hangar (designed by Derek McLane). He yells at Carson, wheedles and hollers and goes mock-humble on the phone. Every so often, Mamet gives him a wonderful line that sums up the dark side of humanity. More often, however, the writing is as lazy as Mickey calling someone “more fun than a Swiss Army Knife.”\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nMickey wants to retire with his spoils. But, with what we hope are intentional echoes of Michael Corleone’s famous “Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in” speech, Mickey is stuck. So, alas, is Mamet.\n\nComing soon: Newsday's Entertainment newsletter, for the latest on celebs, TV, more.\n\nNewsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.
