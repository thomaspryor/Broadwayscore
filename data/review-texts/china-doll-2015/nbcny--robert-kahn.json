  "bwwExcerpt": "Mickey spends most of 'China Doll' yammering away in one-sided conversation...Pacino doesn't veer far from his usual delivery, working in a characteristically disheveled and hot-tempered fashion...Mamet raises subjects that feel provocatively timely. One need only skim the business pages to read about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and a crack about politics...earns the biggest reaction of the night. But 'China Doll' too often gets itself revved up with no place to go and no clear position. The climax, which occurs impossibly soon after the events that set it in motion, would have benefited from a firmer hand by director Pam MacKinnon ('The Heidi Chronicles'). 'China Doll' is muddled, but it's still a treat to see Pacino, even if we're not always sure what he's doing.",
