  "bwwExcerpt": "There's no understudy for Al Pacino in David Mamet's new Broadway play 'China Doll' -- and nor could there be. No one else could possibly fit into the main character -- a blustery, charming and venal political mover and shaker -- like Pacino. The part has been tailored for him like the snappy three-piece Georgio Armani suit he lounges in. And while the Oscar- and Tony-winner is impossible to stop watching -- mostly because he never leaves the stage and also because the only other character is an assistant -- the play itself is a meandering one-note character study of a doomed man.",
