  "bwwExcerpt": "The 'China Doll' that has now been deemed fit for public consumption would seem to be a classic Mametian study of competitive, clumsy men behaving badly to one another...One of the biggest problems (though not the only one) in comprehending 'China Doll' is that Mr. Pacino's lurching, stammering performance is not easy to follow in terms of content, character or subtext. There has been more than enough evidence in the past to certify that Mr. Pacino is a bona fide genius, so let's assume that there are reasons for what he's doing here...Traditionally, Mr. Mamet's plays are conducted at high velocity, with his characters spraying words like machine-gun bullets...But fast talk is rare in 'China Doll,' meaning that it creeps, hunched and sluggish, instead of rushing forward.",
