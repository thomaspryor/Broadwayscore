    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the lead performance as 'delightfully, entirely right' suggests positive recommendation, but extremely limited text makes full assessment impossible. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Grey Henson's performance, indicating a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of broader context, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt praises a performance as \"delightfully, entirely right,\" which suggests a positive recommendation. Due to the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive sentiment warrants a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers enthusiastic, unqualified praise for the actor's performance using words like 'delightfully,' suggesting a clearly positive assessment. However, with only one curated excerpt focused solely on a single cast member, the overall verdict for the full production remains uncertain.",
