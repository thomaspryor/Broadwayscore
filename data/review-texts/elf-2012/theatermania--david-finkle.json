    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges good intentions but identifies a fundamental flaw - the adaptation doesn't justify its existence by adding value to the source material. This is a measured but ultimately lukewarm assessment. | GPT-4o: The review indicates that the musical fails to offer anything new or substantial compared to the original movie, suggesting a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the musical is \"well-meaning\" but ultimately finds it lacking, stating it doesn't add much to the original movie. This suggests a mixed or neutral stance. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges good intentions, the verdict clearly states the show fails to justify its existence as a theatrical adaptation, offering nothing new beyond the original film. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
