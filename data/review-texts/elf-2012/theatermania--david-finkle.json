This is a measured but ultimately lukewarm assessment. | GPT-4o: The review indicates that the musical fails to offer anything new or substantial compared to the original movie, suggesting a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the musical is \"well-meaning\" but ultimately finds it lacking, stating it doesn't add much to the original movie. This suggests a mixed or neutral stance. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges good intentions, the verdict clearly states the show fails to justify its existence as a theatrical adaptation, offering nothing new beyond the original film. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
