  "fullText": "“Watch Me Walk,” “Ulysses” and other offerings from Under the Radar and the Exponential Festival engage with personal histories and the works of literary lions. In Matthew Libby’s play, a brilliant young computer programmer finds himself at the center of one of the most contentious issues of the moment: immigration. Erica Schmidt’s discordant comedy, starring Hamish Linklater and Miriam Silverman, is a farce clumsily straddling two genres. Jade Franks mines the awkwardness of social mobility in her one-woman show “Eat the Rich.” Tracy Letts’s eerily topical, decades-old play about a woman’s descent into a world of conspiracy theories makes its nerve-rattling Broadway debut. At Greenwich House Theater, Greta Gertler Gold and Hilary Bell’s stage adaptation of Joan Lindsay’s novel hovers between reverie and reality. Some had wondered how the show about Abraham Lincoln’s wife would fare after its creator left the Broadway cast. But mirth is abundant as it opens on the West End. There is plenty of stimulation for young theatergoers in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s adaptation of Roald Dahl’s beloved book. Matthew Broderick plays Tartuffe and David Cross his naïve prey in this Lucas Hnath adaptation of a 17th-century French comedy classic. The actress stars in Thomas Kail’s luminous revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play about a woman whose past threatens her future. A new London staging of the Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine musical makes the most of its comedic elements and delivers a visual treat. June Squibb stars in the Broadway premiere of Jordan Harrison’s meditation on grief and the nature of human and artificial intelligence. This production, which retains many of the charms of its 2019 Broadway staging, has lost some of its necessary darkness. Arthur Miller and Ivo van Hove are a perfect match again, in a new production starring Bryan Cranston and Paapa Essiedu. Kara Young and Nicholas Braun star in the Off Broadway revival of Rajiv Joseph’s two-hander about best friends on parallel paths to self-destruction. A new production at the Public Theater takes up five hours of stage time to tell the story of a group of friends from their first day to graduation. The effervescent musical, a new London import, delivers lavishly on the promise of a rom-com: laughter, escape and fantasy. By Laura Collins-Hughes and Sara Krulwich Nazareth Hassan’s darkly witty satire follows an imperious director who pushes his eager actors to extremes. The movie star plays a man from the future at the 1939 New York World’s Fair in an adaptation of some of his stories. Kelli O’Hara shines as his love interest. Talene Monahon’s captivating play uses a 1925 court decision to explore what identity means to Armenians here (a certain reality TV star included). Adult actors play fierce middle-school spellers in a wonderful revival of William Finn and Rachel Sheinkin’s musical. This new revival, starring Lea Michele, Nicholas Christopher and Aaron Tveit, is a reminder why the erratic yet rewarding show has endured all these years. By Elisabeth Vincentelli and Sara Krulwich Ruthie Ann Miles, Shuler Hensley and Micaela Diamond lead a dream-team cast in Ethan Lipton’s musical adaptation of Thornton Wilder’s “The Skin of Our Teeth.” Mark Strong and Lesley Manville are superb as a doomed political power couple in Robert Icke’s adaptation of the Sophocles tragedy. Rajiv Joseph’s farcical play follows the nationalists who carried out the assassination that ignited World War I. The Oscar winner takes on a lovely yet tricky role in a Stephen Schwartz musical that never made it to Broadway back in 1976. The inventive comic actor delivers a commanding performance in Shakespeare’s portrait of feckless leadership in a sleek Off Broadway adaptation. In Anne Washburn’s darkly enigmatic play, a countercultural community hides the death of one of its own. But why? Material excess can never be too excessive for the central character of this gilded Broadway musical, based on the 2012 film. Prince was mysterious, sexy. This adaptation of his 1984 film, onstage in Minneapolis, explains too much and comes off as disorienting. Martyna Majok reimagines her 2018 play about the immigrant women who at various points live in a basement apartment in the New York City borough. The Off Broadway shows “Hannah Senesh,” “Jewish Plot” and “Playing Shylock” take stock of discussions around casting and storytelling. Drew Droege’s newest play Off Broadway is a lot like his others, skewering the entitlement of wealthy, oblivious gay men in Manhattan. At Lincoln Center Theater, a new play from the makers of “The Jungle” tries to dramatize the negotiations that led to the Kyoto Protocol. This movie adaptation has a couple of laughs, but could have been better served by expanding its reach. The playwright Samuel D. Hunter makes his Broadway debut with an addition to his Idaho oeuvre, set during the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath. For its gala, New York City Center revives an antic show about a half-man tabloid sensation, with catchy music and lyrics by the versatile Laurence O’Keefe. All four characters in this bleak tragicomedy, staged by the Druid theater company, share the human desire to hear the same tales again and again. Bess Wohl’s play, about a consciousness-raising group in 1970s Ohio, transfers to Broadway where it remains powerfully moving — and funny. Ari’el Stachel’s “Other” and Zoë Kim’s “Did You Eat?” are self-interrogations that deal with family, race and identity. A gleefully provocative new musical and a quiet 1930s domestic drama speak to each other across time, resounding quite loudly in our present. David Cale’s astonishing one-man show in Brooklyn erects some familiar signposts before swerving into the unexpected. Adapted for the stage, the baseball rom-com is now less sexy and sophisticated than the ’80s classic. Joshua Henry, Caissie Levy and Brandon Uranowitz lead the glorious cast of Lear deBessonet’s inspiriting Broadway revival at Lincoln Center Theater. By Laura Collins-Hughes and Sara Krulwich An urgent family mission propels Jordan E. Cooper’s pain-spiked supernatural comedy, a very loose riff on the biblical story of Noah. It’s unusual for an Atlantic Theater Company production to feel so uninspired, but in this set of one-acts, committed actors are let down by juvenile language. The “Severance” actor portrays all the roles in a play she wrote with Frank Winters, inspired by her evangelical upbringing. Bedlam’s sharply irreverent production of Emily Breeze’s comedy, a riff on “Pride and Prejudice,” has period dress, contemporary vernacular and a magnetic Mrs. Bennet. Samuel Beckett’s 55-minute contemplation of mortality comes to NYU Skirball in a neat and handsome staging by Vicky Featherstone. In her bold, funny solo show, the social media influencer details a life of identity-searching, controversy and a determination to be absolutely herself.",
