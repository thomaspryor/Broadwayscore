The America portrayed onstage may be a vision of hell, but the way it's being presented flies us right into musical heaven.\n\nThis sharp-edged, self-defined tale of ''murder, greed, corruption, violence, exploitation, adultery and treachery'' received a healthy initial run in the mid-1970's but very ambivalent reviews.\n\nEven with such mesmerizing stars as Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera, swell vaudeville-pastiche songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and the acutely stylish direction and choreography of Bob Fosse, ''Chicago'' seemed too chilly, in those days, to be truly loved in the way ''Oklahoma!'' or ''A Chorus Line,'' its warmhearted contemporary and rival, might be.\n\nYet this new incarnation, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Ann Reinking (who also stars), makes an exhilarating case both for ''Chicago'' as a musical for the ages and for the essential legacy of Fosse, whose ghost has never been livelier than it is here.\n\nThere's been talk in the press that theatergoers, in the era of O. J. Simpson and Amy Fisher, are now more likely to accept the work's jaded take on pathological celebrity worship and a fractured justice system. But that's not what makes this ''Chicago'' so immensely appealing.\n\nWhat this production makes clear is how much ''Chicago'' is about the joy of seducing an audience that goes to the theater, above all, to be seduced. Fosse, who had a fiercely conflicted relationship with his profession, may have regarded entertainers as applause-addicted grifters. (Take another look at his autobiographical movie, ''All That Jazz,'' if you want confirmation.)\n\nYet he also reveled in the adrenaline rush that comes from singers and dancers doing what they do best, at their best. Every number in this ''Chicago'' (and most of them are show-stoppers) buzzes with an implicit, irresistibly arrogant declaration: ''Watch me. What I'm about to do is going to be terrific, and you're going to love every second of it.''\n\nThis sensibility was already evident when the show, which is set in the violence-drunken Chicago of the 1920's (and based on Maurine Dallas Watkins's play of that period), was staged last spring in a concert version as part of the Encores! series at City Center.\n\nUnderscoring the conceit of this musical as a self-conscious series of vaudeville turns, the show (which had the same stars and much of the same production team) brought down the house, using only minimal scenery and costumes.\n\nStill, there were worries about how the production might transfer to Broadway. To dress it up more elaborately for a big house might dilute what was magic about it to begin with. On the other hand, would theatergoers paying top ticket prices of $70 feel cheated by the lack of the flashy scenery and special effects to which they had become accustomed?\n\nWell, this is not a show to leave anyone feeling bilked. The revival's creators have indeed retained the spare visual essence of what was seen at City Center. The orchestra (still sublime under the direction of Rob Fisher) remains center stage in John Lee Beatty's witty evocation of a giant witness box in a courtroom.\n\nAn elevator (for grand entrances and exits) has been added, but most of the scenery is still nothing more than some chairs and ladders. And nearly everything, down to the last, flesh-framing inch of William Ivey Long's sleek costumes, is in shades of black and white, set off by Ken Billington's expert film-noir lighting.\n\nAnd yet somehow everything feels richer, like an expensive, perfectly constructed sheath from a designer like Mainbocher. It creates the ideal environment for a tribute to the illusions that can be woven out of air by the right combination of music, actors, singers and dancers. And each of the performances has been polished like the Astors' silver.\n\nMuch of the credit, of course, goes to Mr. Bobbie, whose delightfully inventive direction sustains just the right tone of heady irony. Ms. Rein king, a former dancer for Fosse (and, for a time, his companion), has brought her own light-handed sparkle in evoking the Fosse spirit, and the corps de ballet couldn't be better, physically capturing the wry, knowing pastiche of some of Kander and Ebb's best songs.\n\nDance for Fosse, a man who came of age backstage at Chicago's bump-and-grind houses, always had an air of the striptease. And the numbers, which usually begin with Mr. Kander's gripping, sustained vamps, are all built on the idea of tantalizing. They often start with Fosse's come-hither pelvic thrusts and finger snapping, segue into slow, silky routines (punctuated by eruptions of splits and leaps) and finally burst into orgasmic displays of energy that never spin out of control.\n\nIt's hard to know where to start in singling out cast members. Ms. Reinking's Roxie Hart, the over-the-hill chorine who becomes a star when she murders her straying lover, emerges as the most entertainingly erotic cartoon character since Jessica Rabbit. Every vocal inflection and gesture is writ large (watch how she keeps extending her arms as if to embrace an entire adoring throng) but also with precise, elegant calligraphy.\n\nMs. Reinking meets her match, though, in her co-star. As Velma Kelly, a vaudevillian in jail for a bloody crime of passion and Roxie's competitor in publicity seeking, Ms. Neuwirth has translated her deadpan comic persona and technical proficiency as a dancer into an ecstatic benchmark performance.\n\nThe deliciously mechanical wriggle in her walk embodies the very soul of the show. And to see her turn her legs into a pair of air-slicing scissors, her face set in a bewitching expression of self-satisfaction, is like falling in love, against your better judgment, with a specialist in breaking hearts.\n\nJames Naughton, a superb musical leading man who in another age would have the status of a Robert Preston, brings flawless timing and a velvety crooner's voice to the role of the press-manipulating lawyer. Marcia Lewis, as a predatory prison matron, and D. Sabella, as a gooey gossip columnist who is not what she appears to be, have refined what were already superior performances.\n\nAnd as Amos, Roxie's limp dupe of a husband, Joel Grey (best known as the decadent emcee in another Kander-Ebb musical, ''Cabaret'') achieves the miracle of turning passivity into pure show-biz electricity, all the more arresting for being kept a low voltage.\n\nAmos's big number, ''Mr. Cellophane,'' is a lament on the worst thing that can befall an actor: not to be noticed. ''You can look right through me,'' he wails. ''Chicago'' is, of course, all about being noticed, with the characters' lust for attention mirrored by that of the performers playing them.\n\nThe show takes the bold extra step of breaking down the methodology of getting attention in a musical. When Roxie sings of the raptures of being famous, she summons a phalanx of chorus boys to ''frame me better.'' Her lawyer lets us know in advance just how he's going to sing to win over reporters (and then does so using Roxie as a ventriloquist's dummy). And when Velma rehearses her appearance on the witness stand, it's a dancer's anatomy lesson.\n\nSee, the performers seem to be saying, what we're doing is all illusion, and you're falling for it. Or as a line from the song ''Razzle Dazzle'' has it, ''Long as you keep 'em way off balance, how can they spot you got no talents?''\n\nNonsense. This production isn't smoke and mirrors. It's flesh and blood shaped by discipline and artistry into a parade of vital, pulsing talent. If there's any justice in the world (and ''Chicago'' insists that there isn't), audiences will be exulting in that parade for many, many performances to come.\n\nBook by Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse; music by John Kander; lyrics by Mr. Ebb; based on the play by Maurine Dallas Watkins; original production directed and choreographed by Fosse.

  "garbageFullText": "Erica Schmidt’s discordant comedy, starring Hamish Linklater and Miriam Silverman, is a farce clumsily straddling two genres. Jade Franks mines the awkwardness of social mobility in her one-woman show “Eat the Rich.” Tracy Letts’s eerily topical, decades-old play about a woman’s descent into a world of conspiracy theories makes its nerve-rattling Broadway debut. At Greenwich House Theater, Greta Gertler Gold and Hilary Bell’s stage adaptation of Joan Lindsay’s novel hovers between reverie and reality. Some had wondered how the show about Abraham Lincoln’s wife would fare after its creator left the Broadway cast. But mirth is abundant as it opens on the West End. There is plenty of stimulation for young theatergoers in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s adaptation of Roald Dahl’s beloved book. Matthew Broderick plays Tartuffe and David Cross his naïve prey in this Lucas Hnath adaptation of a 17th-century French comedy classic. The actress stars in Thomas Kail’s luminous revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play about a woman whose past threatens her future. A new London staging of the Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine musical makes the most of its comedic elements and delivers a visual treat. June Squibb stars in the Broadway premiere of Jordan Harrison’s meditation on grief and the nature of human and artificial intelligence. This production, which retains many of the charms of its 2019 Broadway staging, has lost some of its necessary darkness. Arthur Miller and Ivo van Hove are a perfect match again, in a new production starring Bryan Cranston and Paapa Essiedu. Kara Young and Nicholas Braun star in the Off Broadway revival of Rajiv Joseph’s two-hander about best friends on parallel paths to self-destruction. A new production at the Public Theater takes up five hours of stage time to tell the story of a group of friends from their first day to graduation. The effervescent musical, a new London import, delivers lavishly on the promise of a rom-com: laughter, escape and fantasy. By Laura Collins-Hughes and Sara Krulwich Nazareth Hassan’s darkly witty satire follows an imperious director who pushes his eager actors to extremes. The movie star plays a man from the future at the 1939 New York World’s Fair in an adaptation of some of his stories. Kelli O’Hara shines as his love interest. Talene Monahon’s captivating play uses a 1925 court decision to explore what identity means to Armenians here (a certain reality TV star included). Adult actors play fierce middle-school spellers in a wonderful revival of William Finn and Rachel Sheinkin’s musical. This new revival, starring Lea Michele, Nicholas Christopher and Aaron Tveit, is a reminder why the erratic yet rewarding show has endured all these years. By Elisabeth Vincentelli and Sara Krulwich Ruthie Ann Miles, Shuler Hensley and Micaela Diamond lead a dream-team cast in Ethan Lipton’s musical adaptation of Thornton Wilder’s “The Skin of Our Teeth.” Mark Strong and Lesley Manville are superb as a doomed political power couple in Robert Icke’s adaptation of the Sophocles tragedy. Rajiv Joseph’s farcical play follows the nationalists who carried out the assassination that ignited World War I. The Oscar winner takes on a lovely yet tricky role in a Stephen Schwartz musical that never made it to Broadway back in 1976. The inventive comic actor delivers a commanding performance in Shakespeare’s portrait of feckless leadership in a sleek Off Broadway adaptation. In Anne Washburn’s darkly enigmatic play, a countercultural community hides the death of one of its own. But why? Material excess can never be too excessive for the central character of this gilded Broadway musical, based on the 2012 film. Prince was mysterious, sexy. This adaptation of his 1984 film, onstage in Minneapolis, explains too much and comes off as disorienting. Martyna Majok reimagines her 2018 play about the immigrant women who at various points live in a basement apartment in the New York City borough. The Off Broadway shows “Hannah Senesh,” “Jewish Plot” and “Playing Shylock” take stock of discussions around casting and storytelling.",
