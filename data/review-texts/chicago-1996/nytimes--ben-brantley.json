  "fullText": "Erica Schmidt’s discordant comedy, starring Hamish Linklater and Miriam Silverman, is a farce clumsily straddling two genres. Jade Franks mines the awkwardness of social mobility in her one-woman show “Eat the Rich.” Tracy Letts’s eerily topical, decades-old play about a woman’s descent into a world of conspiracy theories makes its nerve-rattling Broadway debut. At Greenwich House Theater, Greta Gertler Gold and Hilary Bell’s stage adaptation of Joan Lindsay’s novel hovers between reverie and reality. Some had wondered how the show about Abraham Lincoln’s wife would fare after its creator left the Broadway cast. But mirth is abundant as it opens on the West End. There is plenty of stimulation for young theatergoers in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s adaptation of Roald Dahl’s beloved book. Matthew Broderick plays Tartuffe and David Cross his naïve prey in this Lucas Hnath adaptation of a 17th-century French comedy classic. The actress stars in Thomas Kail’s luminous revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play about a woman whose past threatens her future. A new London staging of the Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine musical makes the most of its comedic elements and delivers a visual treat. June Squibb stars in the Broadway premiere of Jordan Harrison’s meditation on grief and the nature of human and artificial intelligence. This production, which retains many of the charms of its 2019 Broadway staging, has lost some of its necessary darkness. Arthur Miller and Ivo van Hove are a perfect match again, in a new production starring Bryan Cranston and Paapa Essiedu. Kara Young and Nicholas Braun star in the Off Broadway revival of Rajiv Joseph’s two-hander about best friends on parallel paths to self-destruction. A new production at the Public Theater takes up five hours of stage time to tell the story of a group of friends from their first day to graduation. The effervescent musical, a new London import, delivers lavishly on the promise of a rom-com: laughter, escape and fantasy. By Laura Collins-Hughes and Sara Krulwich Nazareth Hassan’s darkly witty satire follows an imperious director who pushes his eager actors to extremes. The movie star plays a man from the future at the 1939 New York World’s Fair in an adaptation of some of his stories. Kelli O’Hara shines as his love interest. Talene Monahon’s captivating play uses a 1925 court decision to explore what identity means to Armenians here (a certain reality TV star included). Adult actors play fierce middle-school spellers in a wonderful revival of William Finn and Rachel Sheinkin’s musical. This new revival, starring Lea Michele, Nicholas Christopher and Aaron Tveit, is a reminder why the erratic yet rewarding show has endured all these years. By Elisabeth Vincentelli and Sara Krulwich Ruthie Ann Miles, Shuler Hensley and Micaela Diamond lead a dream-team cast in Ethan Lipton’s musical adaptation of Thornton Wilder’s “The Skin of Our Teeth.” Mark Strong and Lesley Manville are superb as a doomed political power couple in Robert Icke’s adaptation of the Sophocles tragedy. Rajiv Joseph’s farcical play follows the nationalists who carried out the assassination that ignited World War I. The Oscar winner takes on a lovely yet tricky role in a Stephen Schwartz musical that never made it to Broadway back in 1976. The inventive comic actor delivers a commanding performance in Shakespeare’s portrait of feckless leadership in a sleek Off Broadway adaptation. In Anne Washburn’s darkly enigmatic play, a countercultural community hides the death of one of its own. But why? Material excess can never be too excessive for the central character of this gilded Broadway musical, based on the 2012 film. Prince was mysterious, sexy. This adaptation of his 1984 film, onstage in Minneapolis, explains too much and comes off as disorienting. Martyna Majok reimagines her 2018 play about the immigrant women who at various points live in a basement apartment in the New York City borough. The Off Broadway shows “Hannah Senesh,” “Jewish Plot” and “Playing Shylock” take stock of discussions around casting and storytelling.",
