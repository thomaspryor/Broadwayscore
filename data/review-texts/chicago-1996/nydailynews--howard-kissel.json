  "fullText": "(Originally published by the Daily News on Nov. 15, 1996)\n\nBecause the revival of “Chicago” is so wildly entertaining, I’m hesitant to call it important always an ugly adjective for a reviewer to use but I’m afraid I must.\n\nThis revival is based on the concert version of “Chicago” presented last May in the City Center “Encores!” series. I had remembered the original with distaste, but left thinking it was a great musical.\n\n“Chicago” is about the way we make celebrities of criminals, a theme more pertinent today than it was in 1975. Set in the ’20s, the musical depicts two murderesses vying for the fickle affections of the press and the William Morris agency. The ironic plot lends itself easily to a concert presentation. The book has been judiciously adapted so it provides a link between one boffo number after another.\n\nThe production has been transferred from City Center intact. Ann Reinking has recreated Bob Fosse’s choreography and, if I’m not mistaken, softened it a bit. Fosse had a Brechtian sensibility. Many of his steps seemed deliberately sinister. They invariably made me shiver, as you do when you see things squiggling under a rock.\n\nIn re-creating the choreography, Reinking, who was in the show 21 years ago, has stressed the liquid quality of Fosse’s trademark movements.\n\nHe might miss the hard edges. I sure didn’t.\n\nReinking plays Roxie Hart. She sings and dances up a storm, and her gravelly voice seems absolutely perfect for a woman parlaying homicide into a showbiz career. The performance could be reined in a bit, but because she has done such a brilliant job with the choreography, she can be excused.\n\nBebe Neuwirth is sensational as Velma, a sister convict Roxie shoves out of the spotlight. She does a dynamite job with “All That Jazz,” and has a rousing duet with Marcia Lewis in the show’s funniest number, “Class.” Lewis is simply fabulous as the prison matron who manages the convicts’ careers.\n\nJames Naughton is expectedly suave as the girls’ cynical lawyer, singing “Razzle Dazzle” as debonairly as it can be sung. Joel Grey seems unusually endearing as Roxy’s hapless husband. Countertenor D. Sabella brings a stunning voice and style to the role of a chic gossip columnist.\n\nThe production itself was the idea of Walter Bobbie, who has directed it impeccably. William Ivey Long’s largely black costumes are an exploration of the shadings of that color Ad Reinhardt might have envied. Ken Billington’s magical lighting brings great variety to John Lee Beatty’s simple, dramatic set.\n\nHaving the orchestra in full view keeps John Kander and Fred Ebb’s dazzling score center stage, where it belongs. Conductor Rob Fisher moves the numbers along forcefully, and brings out the Chicago jazz growl of Ralph Burns’ orchestrations.\n\nWhat makes “Chicago” here’s that dreaded word important is that it reminds us that musicals are about songs and performers, not scenery. When you have material and performances as dynamic as this, you don’t need chandeliers.",
