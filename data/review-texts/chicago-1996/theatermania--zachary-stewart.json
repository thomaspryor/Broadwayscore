  "showScoreExcerpt": "“I am typically of the opinion that no show has any business occupying a Broadway house for more than a decade: Theater is ephemeral, and the magic tends to wear off as the years pass and performances become stale. ’Chicago’ makes this a difficult position to maintain. Ten thousand performances later, it's still dazzling.”",
