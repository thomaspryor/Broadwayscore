  "showScoreExcerpt": "The pulse-racing revival of the musical ''Chicago,'' involves a cast of top-flight artists perfectly mated to their parts and some of the sexiest, most sophisticated dancing seen on Broadway in years...The America portrayed onstage may be a vision of hell, but the way it's being presented flies us right into musical heaven.\""
