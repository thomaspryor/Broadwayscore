  "fullText": "Broadway's busiest revolving door, better known as the nearly 10-year-old revival of Chicago, has someone new passing through: the R&B superstar with the single moniker of Usher has joined the company through October 1. The 27-year-old, baby-faced Grammy Award winner is the latest performer to wear the dapper duds of silver-tongued lawyer Billy Flynn, and while he's a good two or three decades younger than most of his predecessors, the tuxedo fits decently enough. He won't linger in the memory — like Jerry Orbach or James Naughton — but neither does he embarrass himself or producers Barry and Fran Weissler, who tapped him for the role.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "“I am typically of the opinion that no show has any business occupying a Broadway house for more than a decade: Theater is ephemeral, and the magic tends to wear off as the years pass and performances become stale. ’Chicago’ makes this a difficult position to maintain. Ten thousand performances later, it's still dazzling.”",
