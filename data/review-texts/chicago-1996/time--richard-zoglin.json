Find a Rodgers and Hammerstein gem that's been away for a while or dust off a fondly remembered piece of froth like A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, and nostalgic theatergoers will probably beat a path to your stage door.\n\nBut Chicago, the 1975 musical about a '20s nightclub floozy who becomes a celebrity after shooting her lover, doesn't really fall into that category.

However, the lack of specific praise or detailed evaluation of the current production limits the confidence in the verdict. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive outlook for the revival, indicating it will likely be well-received by audiences. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it cautiously at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt characterizes the revival as a 'sure bet' that audiences will flock to, indicating a clear recommendation, though the single curated quote and lack of specific production details warrant low confidence.",
