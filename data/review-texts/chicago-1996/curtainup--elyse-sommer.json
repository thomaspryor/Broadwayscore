It's as much about the people\nwho perform it as it is about the merry murderesses of Roxie Hart and\nVelma Kelly who skyrocket to fame after the murder of their husbands.\n\nThe set (by John Lee Beatty), the lights (Ken Billington), and\nparticularly William Ivey Long's costumes are all heavily based on the\nCity Center's Encores! production of the show that spurred the revival,\nbut they all serve to illuminate the hearts and souls of the people who\nkeep the dream of theatre alive.  Each of the actors' vocal and physical\nlines are accented in meticulous detail so while you experience the\nwonderful score, the thought provoking story (by Ebb and Fosse, adapted\nby David Thompson), and the energetic dances, you're ever conscious of\nthe human machines working underneath, marking with every motion the\nlegacy of Fosse and musical theatre itself.  When all the elements are\nworking in such pitch-perfect harmony, how can the audience escape its\nspell?\n\nFortunately, even at this point in the show's life, it has attracted\ntop-flight talent, some of its performers among the best of the many\nthat have appeared in the show on Broadway.\n\nOver the years, the Broadway company of Chicago has seen any number of\nluminaries in the starring roles, and the current production is no\ndifferent.  The primary above-the-title wattage is provided by film star\nBilly Zane.  As Billy Flynn, Zane makes an impressive Broadway debut,\nless the experienced shyster of previous actors, but more an ambitious -\nyet no less devious - upstart.  Zane croons his songs and acts his\nscenes with conviction, putting his own convincing and satisfying spin\non the lawyer who's only in it for the money, though all he cares about\nis love.\n\nZane's obvious marquee value aside, the show's Velma and Roxie - the\nreal stars of the evening - are superb.  Charlotte d'Amboise is a vision\nas Roxie, putting her songs across with a strong voice and the dynamic\npersonality with which she injects each of her scenes.  She's also\na top-notch dancer, making Reinking's Fosse-steeped steps\nlook easy.  Caroline O'Connor's Velma is similarly one-of-a-kind, second\nonly to Bebe Neuwirth (the role's originator in the revival) of all the\nones I've seen on Broadway.  She telegraphs herself as one of a kind as\nsoon as she begins her cat-like strutting through \"All That Jazz,\" and\nshe doesn't let up until the very end of the evening.  She's got a\nspectacular belt, a keen common sense, and dances with a verve that\ndefines each of her numbers anew.\n\nAs the prison matron, Mama Morton, Roz Ryan is at great ease with the\nother performers and the audience, and possessing a powerful voice that\nthreatens to rock the rafters in her big solo, \"When You're Good to\nMama.\"  Her comic duet with O'Connor later on, \"Class,\" is equally\neffective, the two performers giving one honed comic performance.  Rob\nBartlett, as Roxie's almost invisible husband Amos, is great in his\nscenes, though his second act showstopper \"Mr. Cellophane,\" in which he\nfinally comes out of his shell, lacks the complete transformation into a\nfull-on dynamo that has defined the best performers in this role.  While\nevery performer was giving it his or her all, R. Bean, was giving too\nmuch, pushing far too hard as the sob-sister Mary Sunshine.  Bean's big\nsong in the first act and climactic moments in the second were the only\nmiscalculations this time around; pulling back would result in a more\neffective characterization and overall performance.\n\nSpecial mention should also be made of four additional important\nperformers:  Michael Kubala, John Mineo, Michelle M. Robinson, and David\nWarren-Gibson are all members of the revival's original cast, still\ngiving the show their all and then some.  The names and faces of the\nmore visible performers may change on a regular basis, but these four\nrepresent with talent and distinction the soul at the heart of Chicago\nthat Bobbie, Reinking, and everyone else brought to the surface six\nyears ago, and which still remains in blissful abundance.\n\nAt the very least, Chicago is as good now as it's ever been.  It remains\na heartening experience, a life-affirming dedication to the magic and\nart of theatre, and something that absolutely should not be missed.\nThough all shows must eventually close, the glory and genius of Chicago\nshould be celebrated while it's here, and with any luck, it will still\nbe gracing and energizing Broadway for many years to come.",
