  "dtliExcerpt": "In that dicey district known as Broadway, there are no sure bets, but reviving a cherished old musical comes close. Find a Rodgers and Hammerstein gem that's been away for a while or dust off a fondly remembered piece of froth like A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, and nostalgic theatergoers will probably beat a path to your stage door.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "The pulse-racing revival of the musical ''Chicago,'' involves a cast of top-flight artists perfectly mated to their parts and some of the sexiest, most sophisticated dancing seen on Broadway in years...The America portrayed onstage may be a vision of hell, but the way it's being presented flies us right into musical heaven.\"",
