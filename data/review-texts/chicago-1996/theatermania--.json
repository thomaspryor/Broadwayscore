  "dtliExcerpt": "Broadway's busiest revolving door, better known as the nearly 10-year-old revival of Chicago, has someone new passing through: the R&B superstar with the single moniker of Usher has joined the company through October 1. The 27-year-old, baby-faced Grammy Award winner is the latest performer to wear the dapper duds of silver-tongued lawyer Billy Flynn, and while he's a good two or three decades younger than most of his predecessors, the tuxedo fits decently enough. He won't linger in the memory — like Jerry Orbach or James Naughton — but neither does he embarrass himself or producers Barry and Fran Weissler, who tapped him for the role.",

The lack of strong praise or criticism places it in the mixed category, with a score reflecting a balance between adequacy and lack of distinction. | Gemini: The review suggests Usher is adequate in the role, not exceptional but not a failure. This indicates a mild recommendation.",
