    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong endorsement calling this 'the production' the show 'has been waiting for' with praise for achieving the right balance. Single excerpt limits full confidence but language suggests high recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as the definitive staging of the musical, achieving a balance that previous productions may have lacked. The tone suggests a strong recommendation, fitting the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt clearly praises the production as the one Sondheim's musical has been waiting for, indicating a positive assessment. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise calling this the production the show has been waiting for, warranting the upper Positive range, but confidence is low due to availability of only a single curated quote.",
