    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the production as 'crisp' and 'well-acted' with 'new clarity' - positive descriptors but measured tone. Low confidence due to single excerpt warning and potential for cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'crisp' and 'well-acted', with 'new clarity', indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the production as \"crisp, well-acted\" and bringing \"new clarity,\" which indicates a positive assessment, but the lack of a full review and the mention of it being a \"challenging musical\" suggests some reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the production's performances and interpretive clarity, warranting a score in the upper Positive range. Confidence is low due to the limitation of a single curated excerpt.",
