However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation which may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a strong positive evaluation of the production, describing it as 'a joy' and highlighting its ability to remind audiences of Williams' brilliance. The language suggests an enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The critic states that the production \"definitely isn't a trap\" and is a \"joy\", indicating a strong positive recommendation. The single excerpt and lack of reservations suggest a score at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic enthusiastically praises the production as 'a joy' that effectively showcases Williams' greatness, indicating a strong recommendation despite the limitations of a single excerpt.",
