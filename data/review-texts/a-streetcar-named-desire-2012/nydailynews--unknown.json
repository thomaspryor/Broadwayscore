  "fullText": "READY FOR THE DAILY NEWS IN REAL TIME?\n\nSign up now to start receiving breaking news alerts on the web.\n\nAvailable only on Chrome and Firefox browsers\n\nShe’s held her own against aliens on “The X-Files,” but Blanche DuBois proves elusive for Gillian Anderson. Her star turn as Tennessee Williams’ doomed southern belle in “A Streetcar Named Desire” is a mixed bag. So is the revival of the 70-year-old drama that began at the Young Vic Theatre in London.\n\nAnderson captures Blanche’s teetering vulnerability and is quite touching as the character descends into madness. But her overripe posturing and fresh-from-the plantation — or “Hee-Haw” — drawl feel out of place in a production so contemporary that you could call it “A Streetcar Named Ikea.”\n\nAnderson’s co-stars are more in sync with the modern setting. As Blanche’s sister Stella, the English actress Vanessa Kirby is natural and convincing, although her southern accent often goes up the waterspout. Ben Foster, seen in \"Orphans\" on Broadway, nails Stanley’s brutish animal sexuality so keenly it could make your head spin.\n\nIf it wasn’t already doing that. The stage in this in-the-round production slowly revolves almost constantly. The impulse to ask audiences to pay attention and shift perspective on a well-known work is a good one by Benedict Andrews, even if it isn’t terribly enlightening. But noisy rock music between scenes gets gimmicky. And there’s even a black-light effect, as though Williams’ enduring drama didn’t glow in the dark on its own.",

No clear recommendation either way. | Gemini: The review praises some performances (Foster as Stanley) and Anderson's vulnerability, but criticizes her accent and the production's modern setting. The overall assessment is 'a mixed bag,' indicating a middle ground. | Kimi: The critic explicitly labels both the lead performance and the revival a 'mixed bag,' praising Anderson's vulnerability and the supporting cast while criticizing her accent, the revolving stage gimmick, and intrusive rock music.",
