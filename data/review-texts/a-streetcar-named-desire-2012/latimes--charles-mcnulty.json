  "bwwExcerpt": "Rebecca Frecknall, who directed the recent Broadway revival of “Cabaret” that made a choppy Atlantic crossing, has brought to Brooklyn the best revival of “A Streetcar Named Desire” of my lifetime. The production had two touted West End runs, but I didn’t expect to hear Williams’ play as if for the first time.\"",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic states this is the best revival of 'A Streetcar Named Desire' of their lifetime, which is very high praise. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as a strong positive.",
