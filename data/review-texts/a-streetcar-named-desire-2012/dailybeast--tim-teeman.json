  "bwwExcerpt": "Streetcar has the additional depth and richness of Williams at his best; one of the standout aspects of this production—thanks again to the actors’ and Frecknall’s care—is the breadth of Williams’ language; its vibrancy and perfectly aimed poison darts of lyricism hit mark after mark. Even when what is being said is terrible or heartbreaking or both, you marvel at Williams’ soaring dramatic poetry, his relentless drilling into psyches, his perverse sense of play and mischief (especially around madness and pain), and his committed interrogations of both untethered, delusional romance and brutish, transactional reality.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the production's handling of Williams' text, crediting both actors and director. The excerpt focuses on depth and richness achieved, suggesting enthusiastic recommendation despite being a single curated quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's depth, richness, and the vibrancy of Williams' language, suggesting a highly positive view. However, given the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the richness and vibrancy of Williams' writing, highlighting the production's success in capturing the play's depth. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper end of the positive range due to the enthusiastic tone. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production's depth, direction, and performances, describing the language as vibrant and calling the show a standout, though as a single curated excerpt it may represent the most positive portion of the review.",
