  "bwwExcerpt": "There's little poignancy in the performance. When Blanche goes crackers at the end, it seems to come out of nowhere, rather than being the inevitable result of a long slide. [...] Blair Underwood, another performer from films and TV who is normally a sensitive actor, overdoes Stanley's macho-ness to the point of excluding any other qualities.",

However, single excerpt warning means full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the lack of emotional depth in the performance and overacting by a key performer, suggesting a negative view. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt criticizes the performances of the lead actors, indicating a negative assessment of the production. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic specifically faults the lead performance's lack of emotional depth and supporting actor's one-note portrayal, indicating significant deficiencies in the production's acting.",
