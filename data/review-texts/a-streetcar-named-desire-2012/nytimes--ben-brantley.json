No redeeming qualities mentioned. | GPT-4o: The review indicates a failure to capture the essential qualities of the play, suggesting a negative assessment without recommending it. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the revival 'never finds the savage poetry' of the original, indicating a failure to capture the essence of the play. This suggests a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic states that the production fails to achieve the 'savage poetry' central to Williams's work, indicating a fundamental artistic failure, though the text is brief and may be truncated.",
