  "bwwExcerpt": "Sometimes there's yuks so quickly. The latest production of Tennessee Williams' masterwork \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" is an unfathomable misstep from the gifted Emily Mann, whose work I have often admired as both director and playwright. Helmer Mann and her starry cast treat the work as if it were a combination soap opera and sitcom. The result is embarrassing and sad.",

Despite praising the director's previous work, the verdict for this production is total rejection. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt strongly criticizes the production, describing it as an 'unfathomable misstep' and 'embarrassing and sad'. This indicates a strong negative verdict, placing it in the Pan bucket. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly negative, calling the production an \"unfathomable misstep\" and \"embarrassing and sad.\" The critic clearly pans the direction and the performances. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains devastating criticism calling the production an 'unfathomable misstep' that reduces a masterwork to 'soap opera and sitcom,' with the final verdict 'embarrassing and sad.' Even allowing for excerpt bias, this language places it firmly in Pan territory.",
