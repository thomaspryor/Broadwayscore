    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: This appears to be a brief excerpt focusing only on one performance aspect. The critic gives qualified praise ('welcome dignity') but notes a significant flaw ('lacks the animal magnetism'). However, this seems to be truncated text from a larger review, so the overall verdict may not be represented. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a positive aspect (dignity) but also points out a significant shortcoming (lack of animal magnetism), resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic offers qualified praise for the lead performance, acknowledging dignity while noting a critical deficiency in the character's essential magnetism. As an excerpt, the overall recommendation remains unclear.",
