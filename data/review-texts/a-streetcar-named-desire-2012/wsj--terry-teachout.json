    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: This appears to be a truncated excerpt focusing only on one performance aspect, with both positive ('welcome dignity') and negative ('lacks the animal magnetism') elements, suggesting a mixed overall assessment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges a positive aspect (dignity) but also points out a significant shortcoming (lack of animal magnetism), resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The single available sentence offers mixed signals—acknowledging dignity in the performance while emphasizing a critical lack of essential magnetism. Without the full review context or final verdict, the assessment remains ambiguous.",
