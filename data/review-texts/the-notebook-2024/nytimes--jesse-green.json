However, with only one excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively within the negative range. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the production for lacking the qualities that made the original work, suggesting it fails to justify its adaptation. The tone is negative, but the single excerpt and aggregator context suggest a conservative score within the Negative range. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the musical fails to justify its existence, indicating a negative assessment. The phrase 'de-slicking was a mistake' further reinforces this negative sentiment.",
