  "fullText": "Musical theater can be a sucker for a romantic tale, whether it's about obsessive devotion, idealized passion, or lost loves. \"The Notebook,\" based on Nicholas Sparks‘ bestselling, 1996 debut novel, has elements of all three — but they’re thinly rendered here in this Hallmark movie of a musical, awash in sentimentality and drenched in wistful longings and wish fulfillment.\n\nThe huge fanbase of the romance novel and the 2004 hit film might initially boost the box office, but it will take more than recreating that iconic rainstorm to win over other theatergoers looking for more than clichés, tropes and triggers.",
  "bwwExcerpt": "As for the production, the staging by Michael Greif (“Dear Evan Hansen,” “Next to Normal”) and Schele Williams (“The Wiz”) feels, for all its intention of intimacy, contrived and unsurprising. For a while the cross-cutting of the three couples haunting each other is intriguing but soon Katie Spelman’s choreography of past and future lives ever-circling each other simply becomes a dizzying one-note effect. The cross-racial casting of couples nicely underscores the universality of the romance and the ease of imaginative leaps in musical theater.",

The staging is described as contrived and unsurprising, suggesting the critic does not recommend the show. | Gemini: The review points out flaws like sentimentality and clichés, but also acknowledges the potential appeal to fans and some intriguing staging choices.
