  "bwwExcerpt": "But Be More Chill is as confused and un-self-aware as a hormonal teenage boy - and nearly as reckless. Fitting then, that it begins with one grousing in song that his porn won't load so he can beat off before school. It's funny, sure, and perfectly natural (no shame!). It's also our first sign that the musical, with score by Joe Iconis and book by Joe Tracz, considers frustrated male desire its primary problem in need of solving. Not by teaching its protagonist that he's not entitled to the girl",
