The playwright does not give us enough exposition about the protagonist Jeremy or his best friend Michael...Brackett’s direction and Chase Brock’s choreography move the action along at an appropriate pace...Tracz’s book and Iconis’s lyrics fail to address the depth of teenage angst and the tragic events that often erupt from deep despair and depression.\"\n\nRead more",

Mixed elements with no clear recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review highlights strong performances but criticizes the book and lyrics for lacking depth and memorability. The overall tone is mixed, acknowledging strengths in performances and direction but significant weaknesses in writing. | Gemini: The review praises the cast and direction but criticizes the book and lyrics, resulting in a mixed assessment. The lack of a clear recommendation and the negative comments about the writing lead to a score in the mixed range. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the cast highly but criticizes the book as merely 'serviceable,' notes few memorable songs, and faults the writing for failing to address the depth of the show's serious themes. With strong positives and significant negatives balanced, this reads as a mixed assessment, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence.",
