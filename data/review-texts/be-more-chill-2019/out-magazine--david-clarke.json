  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The entertaining new musical will be remembered for finally bringing edgy, accomplished downtown composer and lyricist Iconis to Broadway all while being plagued by Tracz’s uneven book and Brackett’s inconsistent direction. These elements collide to ensure that ‘Be More Chill’ cannot decide if it wants to be a campy, cult classic or a hard-hitting teenage drama...Brock’s dance vocabulary is absolutely one of the production’s strongest creative assets.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Review highlights significant creative accomplishments (bringing Iconis to Broadway, strong choreography) but also identifies major structural problems (uneven book, inconsistent direction, unclear identity). Single excerpt with balanced praise and criticism suggests mixed overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review highlights both positive and negative aspects, praising the composer and choreography but criticizing the book and direction. The mixed elements suggest a balanced view without a clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the music and dance, but criticizes the book and direction as inconsistent, resulting in a mixed verdict. | Kimi: While the excerpt opens with the verdict 'entertaining' and praises the score and choreography as 'strongest creative assets,' it spends equal space on significant criticisms of the 'uneven' book and 'inconsistent' direction. Given this is a single curated excerpt, the score reflects a mildly positive, qualified recommendation.",
