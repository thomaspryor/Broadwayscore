    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt acknowledges flaws ('storyline predictability', 'too-happy-resolutions') but praises the authentic emotional core. The phrase 'stakes its most righteous claim' suggests merit despite reservations. With only one curated quote available, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges predictable storylines and happy resolutions but praises the book and lyrics for addressing darker themes. This suggests a positive view with some reservations. | Gemini: The review acknowledges predictability but praises the book and lyrics, indicating a positive but not rave review. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, acknowledging flaws like predictability and tidy resolutions while strongly commending the book and lyrics for their unflinching portrayal of teenage darkness. Given this is a single curated excerpt with explicit caveats, it represents a mildly positive recommendation.",
