  "bwwExcerpt": "'Be More Chill' feels more even and flows more smoothly than it did Off Broadway. On occasion you missed the frenetic, awkward pace of the original: the Off Broadway 'Be More Chill' felt gawky, quick and weird, like its subject matter. The new 'Be More Chill,' on the other hand, seems to want to grow up faster and get to the point more sharply. Still, rushed or relaxed, 'Be More Chill' is Broadway's wiliest and socially savviest night out for teens and parents alike.",
