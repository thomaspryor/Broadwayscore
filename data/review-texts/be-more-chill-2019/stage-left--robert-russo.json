The phrase 'justifies its existence' suggests overall recommendation despite flaws. Low confidence due to single curated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights improvements in narrative clarity and tone, and praises the music and orchestrations, indicating a positive view despite some criticism of the lyrics. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws in the lyrics but praises the music and orchestrations, suggesting a qualified positive recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
