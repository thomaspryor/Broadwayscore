  "bwwExcerpt": "Much has been written about this heartfelt musical's unlikely road to Broadway, the tiny production in New Jersey, the album that went viral (more than 200 million downloads and counting), the Off-Broadway run that sold out before it opened. And everything's been spruced up for Broadway - the cool computer-screen set by Beowulf Boritt, the outlandish costumes by Bobby Frederick Tilley II, the slick projections by Alex Bosco Koch. As the squip sings near the end of the first act, 'you gotta get an upgrade.' And with this one, 'Be More Chill' gets a fighting chance to stand out in a capacity crowd of musicals about kids who don't feel like they belong.",
