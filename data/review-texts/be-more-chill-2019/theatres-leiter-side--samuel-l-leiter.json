    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic explicitly raises their score to 70 and shows increased appreciation for the company, indicating a positive shift. However, they note the material 'borders on banality' which suggests significant reservations. Single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked positivity. | GPT-4o: The critic acknowledges improvements and appreciates the talented company, raising the score from a previous mixed review. However, concerns about the material bordering on banality suggest a qualified recommendation. | Gemini: The critic explicitly states they are raising their score to 70, indicating a positive, albeit reserved, recommendation. The excerpt also mentions entertaining staging and choreography, but notes the material borders on banality. | Kimi: The critic explicitly raises their rating to 70 (the Positive threshold), citing greater appreciation for the cast and entertaining staging, though significant criticism of the material as 'banal' keeps this at the lower end of the Positive range. Single-excerpt format warrants low confidence.",
