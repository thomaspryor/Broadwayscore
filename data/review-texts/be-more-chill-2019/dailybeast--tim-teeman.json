  "bwwExcerpt": "Be More Chill feels squawkily split between camp sci fi romp and searing teenage-life-today commentary. The title itself is the last annoying puzzle. If anything the show suggests that we all have to live with our insecurities and other inner demons; the trick is not to let them dominate us.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as 'squawkily split' between elements, suggesting unevenness. Acknowledges thematic value but implies tonal confusion. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt indicates a mixed tone, highlighting a split between different thematic elements without clear praise or criticism. The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning suggest a low confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a mixed reaction, highlighting a split between campy sci-fi and teenage commentary. The lack of a clear recommendation and the single excerpt contribute to the low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the show's tonal inconsistency ('squawkily split') and calls the title 'annoying,' while acknowledging its ambitious attempt at serious teenage commentary, suggesting an ambivalent, mixed reception rather than a clear recommendation.",
