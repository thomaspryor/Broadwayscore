Single excerpt warning noted - this appears genuinely enthusiastic rather than cherry-picked mild praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'one of the strongest new musicals of the past decade' and praises the cast as 'close-knit', indicating a highly positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"one of the strongest new musicals\" and praises the cast and story. The overall tone is enthusiastic, indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise calling the show one of the strongest musicals of the past decade and commends the cast highly, though confidence is reduced given this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review.",
