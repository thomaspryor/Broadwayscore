It’s also the important message for kids to be themselves, to develop a sense of self-worth, to stop the bullying, and to connect with others around you, even if they seem different than you on the outside.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with superlatives ('even more exuberant', 'even more colorful') and calls it 'a hit' with important messaging. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives ('even more exuberant', 'funny and moving and insightful') and praises the show's message, indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using superlatives and describing the show as a hit with an important message. Given the single excerpt, I've placed it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's energy, humor, and emotional resonance, explicitly calling it a 'hit' and highlighting its positive messaging. However, as a single curated excerpt, the overall verdict may not fully represent the complete review.",
