The super-loud electronically oriented pop music and mostly witless lyrics are by Joe Iconis, and the book about high school angst by Joe Tracz...The cast does its job big-time, eliciting loud applause for solo numbers from the adoring audience members who act as if they are experiencing euphoria...I do have one optimistic takeaway: anything that introduces a younger generation to the theater is a plus.\"\n\nRead more",

Only positive is the general concept of introducing youth to theater, not this specific production. | GPT-4o: The review notes the show is aimed at young audiences and criticizes the music and lyrics as 'witless,' but acknowledges the cast's strong performance and the positive reception from the audience. The optimistic takeaway about introducing younger audiences to theater suggests a mixed but not entirely negative view. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's appeal to young audiences but expresses reservations about the music and lyrics. It's a mixed bag with a positive takeaway. | Kimi: The critic warns older audiences away while criticizing the lyrics as 'witless,' though acknowledging the cast performs well and the show has value for introducing youth to theater. With only one excerpt available, the overall sentiment appears mixed to negative.",
