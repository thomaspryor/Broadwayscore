Single excerpt warning reduces confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses strong criticism of the show's messages and tone, suggesting a negative view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses negative sentiments about the show's messages, tone, and characterizations, indicating a negative overall assessment. The single excerpt and negative language suggest a negative score. | Kimi: The critic explicitly advocates caution for viewers due to repellent implicit messages and finds the tone off-putting, with particular criticism of cheap humor and characterization despite acknowledging the cast's talent.",
