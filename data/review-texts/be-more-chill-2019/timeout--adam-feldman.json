  "bwwExcerpt": "But however much you root for it, Be More Chill ultimately seems like a talented, likable team that is playing in the wrong league, and the Lyceum looms around it like a judgment. Directed in broad strokes by Stephen Brackett, the show doesn't take itself seriously enough; many of the jokes are underbaked, and by the time it reaches its wacky, hectic finale, it has thrown internal logic out the window. And the production's embrace of cartoonishness works against the sentimental effects it sometimes reaches for, especially since we have little reason to care about Jeremy one way or the other; Roland, who was terrific as the needling sidekick in Dear Evan Hansen, sings well but doesn't project the sensitivity that might help fill out his role. Be More Chill takes it for granted that we'll like Jeremy just because most of the kids at his school do not. But unpopularity, like popularity, only goes so far.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Despite acknowledging the team's talent and likability, the critic finds fundamental flaws: wrong venue scale, underdeveloped direction, weak characterization, and internal logic problems. The sports metaphor suggests they're out of their depth on Broadway. | GPT-4o: The review expresses significant criticism, noting the show doesn't take itself seriously, has underbaked jokes, and lacks internal logic. The production's cartoonishness undermines its sentimental effects, and the protagonist fails to engage the audience's sympathy. | Gemini: The review expresses disappointment, stating the show doesn't take itself seriously enough and throws internal logic out the window. Despite acknowledging talent, the overall assessment is negative. | Kimi: The critic finds the show underbaked and tonally inconsistent, criticizing the broad direction, weak jokes, lack of internal logic, and failure to generate emotional investment in the characters, concluding it belongs in a smaller venue.",
