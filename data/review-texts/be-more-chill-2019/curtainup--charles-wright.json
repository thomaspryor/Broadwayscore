    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with consistent praise for adaptation quality, musical composition, and direction. However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of positive quotes. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the musical's adaptation and execution, highlighting its emotional impact and effective direction. The tone is clearly positive, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"touching and upbeat\" and praises the musical's ability to capture the characters' emotions and the director's work. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers consistent praise for the book adaptation ('judiciously' modified), score ('reminiscent of Broadway's golden age'), and direction ('precision and velocity'), calling the show 'touching and upbeat.' While clearly positive, the lack of extreme superlatives keeps it in the Positive bucket rather than Rave.",
