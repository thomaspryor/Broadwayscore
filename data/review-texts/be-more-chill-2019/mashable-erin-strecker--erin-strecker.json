However, this is only one excerpt so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for failing to address its intended themes and settling for stereotypes, suggesting a negative view. However, due to the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt criticizes the show for not grappling with relevant issues and settling for stereotypes, indicating a negative assessment. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic finds the show fails to grapple with contemporary issues, resorting to outdated stereotypes rather than meaningful commentary, indicating significant disappointment with the production's writing and thematic execution.",
