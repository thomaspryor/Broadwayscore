    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('high-octane delight', 'not a single weak link') with enthusiasm for performances and score. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is strongly positive, praising the show's energy, music, and cast without reservations. The tone suggests an enthusiastic recommendation, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, describing the show as a \"high-octane delight\" with a strong cast and sincere portrayal of teenagers. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the score ('high-octane delight'), universal cast strength ('no single weak link'), and emotional sincerity ('resonated so well'), indicating a clear positive recommendation. Score placed at upper end of Positive range per single-excerpt guidance, with low confidence due to cherry-picking risk.",
