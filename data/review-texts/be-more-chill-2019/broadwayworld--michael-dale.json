    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows measured praise for book, staging, and choreography using positive terms like 'solidly,' 'nailing,' and 'fun.' However, with only one curated quote available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the book and staging, highlighting both comic timing and sincerity. Given the single excerpt warning, the positive tone suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the book, staging, and choreography, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic review. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise for the book, staging, and choreography, using positive descriptors like 'solidly,' 'nailing,' and 'fun.' As a single curated excerpt with clearly positive language, it falls in the upper range of the Positive bucket per scoring guidelines, though confidence is reduced due to limited available text.",
