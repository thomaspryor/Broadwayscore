  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Science fiction is the uninspired twist that sets ‘Be More Chill’ apart from other teen angst musicals...The narrative often seems like an excuse to pad the story...The performances from the cast are mostly forgettable...There is ultimately nothing redeeming whatsoever about the characters...An unsatisfying evening of theater and reeks of amateur writing...Watching the show is akin to being on a bad acid trip—awkward, painful, jarring and unsatisfying.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Pan | Claude: Devastating pan with phrases like 'nothing redeeming whatsoever,' 'reeks of amateur writing,' and comparing it to 'a bad acid trip.' No positive elements offered. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly negative, describing the show as 'unsatisfying', 'awkward', and 'painful'. The lack of redeeming qualities and comparison to a 'bad acid trip' indicates a strong pan. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly negative, describing the show as an \"unsatisfying evening of theater\" with \"nothing redeeming whatsoever about the characters\" and comparing it to a \"bad acid trip.\" | Kimi: The excerpt contains uniformly negative language describing the show as amateurish, with forgettable performances and 'nothing redeeming whatsoever' about the characters. Despite the single-excerpt limitation suggesting potential cherry-picking, the severity of the criticism—including comparisons to a 'bad acid trip'—warrants a Pan classification.",
