    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive recommendation in final verdict despite acknowledging directorial issues. Single excerpt warning means this may not represent full review tone, so scoring at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive recommendation despite noting directorial inconsistencies. The phrase 'a pill worth swallowing' indicates a recommendation, albeit with some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review acknowledges directorial inconsistencies but ultimately recommends seeing the show, calling it \"a pill worth swallowing.\" Given the single excerpt, the score is at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic delivers a qualified but clear recommendation ('worth swallowing') while praising the writing ('deftly package') and performances ('deeper roots,' 'chameleon-like'), despite significant reservations about the direction and staging.",
