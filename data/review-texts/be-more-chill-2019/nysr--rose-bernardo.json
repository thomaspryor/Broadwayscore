  "bwwExcerpt": "What I liked-actually, loved-about Be More Chill more than anything is its potential. The show can so easily be produced in a high school or college on a shoestring budget. It could be staged in a black box. The cast could shop their own closets for the costumes (no offense to Bobby Frederick Tilley II's work here, which is a spot-on celebration of neon). The songs would sound just as good without all the amplification. Perhaps-no, definitely-even better.",
