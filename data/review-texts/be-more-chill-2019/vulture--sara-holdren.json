  "bwwExcerpt": "There's a cheeky, open-eyed quality to Be More Chill that knows better than to spill over into archness - because musicals aren't actually chill at all, ever. And no one sums up this mixture of sincerity and worldly mischief better than Christine, who, when things look bleakest, delivers a distressed zinger that might just qualify for best self-own of the current theatrical moment: 'I look around and everyone's hurting. I wish there was something real I could do to make things better but I don't know how. So I guess I'll just do theater.' How do the kids put it? I feel so seen.",
