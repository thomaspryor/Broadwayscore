  "bwwExcerpt": "There's a cheeky, open-eyed quality to Be More Chill that knows better than to spill over into archness - because musicals aren't actually chill at all, ever. And no one sums up this mixture of sincerity and worldly mischief better than Christine, who, when things look bleakest, delivers a distressed zinger that might just qualify for best self-own of the current theatrical moment: 'I look around and everyone's hurting. I wish there was something real I could do to make things better but I don't know how. So I guess I'll just do theater.' How do the kids put it? I feel so seen.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic appreciates the show's tonal balance and finds it relatable ('I feel so seen'), but this is only one excerpt so full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a positive tone, emphasizing the show's sincerity and humor. The critic's personal connection ('I feel so seen') suggests a strong positive reaction. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights a positive quality of the show, suggesting a recommendation. The single excerpt and lack of a clear verdict statement lead to a 'medium' confidence. | Kimi: The critic praises the show's self-aware tone and sincere humor, highlighting a standout moment as 'best self-own of the current theatrical moment' and responding enthusiastically with 'I feel so seen.'",
