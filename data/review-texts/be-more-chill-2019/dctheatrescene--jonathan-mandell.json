  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"‘Be More Chill’ has some seriously devoted fans...I wish I could share more fully in their ardor for this show...The story, a mix of satire, high school bestiary, and sci-fi, serves best as setting for the loud, lively and often tuneful score...It no longer feels like the little show that could. It's a noisy, high-powered commercial enterprise, selling itself largely to kids...I do regret the moments in the musical when the high school students feel one-note.\"\n\nRead more",

Mixed signals with slight negative lean. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's lively and tuneful score but expresses regret over one-note characters and describes it as a high-powered commercial enterprise. The critic wishes to share in the fans' enthusiasm but cannot fully do so, indicating a mixed sentiment. | Gemini: The review expresses mixed feelings, acknowledging the show's devoted fans and lively score, but also noting its commercial nature and one-dimensional characters. The phrase \"I wish I could share more fully in their ardor\" suggests a lack of strong positive sentiment. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the 'loud, lively and often tuneful score' but criticizes the commercialized production and one-note characters, expressing distance from the show's fan enthusiasm without fully dismissing it.",
