  "showScoreExcerpt": "“’Be More Chill’ is likely to get a cool reception from anyone past prom age. Iconis’s score has a tuneful array of teen empowerment songs, but Tracz’s book can’t consistently deliver a compelling story or characters. Spending two and a half hours with them feels...like being stuck in detention...The tone lands somewhere in the lumpy middle of campy parody and heartfelt teen vehicle.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative verdict with compelling metaphor ('stuck in detention'), criticism of book quality, and dismissive tone despite acknowledging some tuneful songs. | GPT-4o: The review highlights issues with the book and overall tone, suggesting a negative experience. The excerpt suggests a lack of engagement and enjoyment, but with limited text, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review praises the score but criticizes the book, resulting in a mixed assessment. The excerpt suggests a lack of strong recommendation. | Kimi: While acknowledging the tuneful score, the critic finds the book uncompelling and the tone uneven ('lumpy middle'), ultimately comparing the experience to detention and suggesting it will receive a 'cool reception' from adult audiences.",
