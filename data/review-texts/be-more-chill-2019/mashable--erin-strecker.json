    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges some elements work ('fun and rare idea') but delivers sharp criticism of the show's execution, calling it 'stereotype-filled retrograde' that 'misses the mark' and fails to deliver on its promise. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for missing the mark with its intended message and settling for stereotypes, indicating a negative view. However, it acknowledges some fun elements, suggesting it's not a complete pan. | Gemini: The review excerpt acknowledges some fun and rare ideas, but ultimately finds the show misses the mark and settles for stereotypes. Due to the truncated text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the sci-fi concept is 'fun and rare' and that 'some of it works,' but heavily criticizes the execution as 'missing the mark' with 'stereotype-filled' storytelling, resulting in a neither-here-nor-there assessment. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Mixed",
