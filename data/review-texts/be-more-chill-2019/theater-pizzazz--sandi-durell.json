This is a show that speaks directly to the young generation and makes parents happy that their kids now want to attend theater.\"\n\nRead more",

The language is enthusiastic, suggesting a solid positive recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using terms like \"genius,\" \"brilliantly,\" and \"exceptional.\" It also highlights the show's appeal to a younger audience, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers strong praise for the direction ('genius'), design ('exceptional'), and overall entertainment value ('brilliantly'), representing a clear recommendation despite the limitation of having only a single curated excerpt.",
