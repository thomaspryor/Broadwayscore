  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It’s a young and feisty High School musical, something akin to 'Mean Girls' mixed with the Sci-Fi out of this world 'Little Shop of Horrors', with a dash of outsider angst 'Dear Evan Hansen' layered on top of its catchy fun soundtrack...It hasn't slipped a bit since transferring to the Lyceum Theatre..And as guided with ADD enthusiastic energy by both the formidable Stephen Brackett, and choreographed by the talented Chase Brock, it deserves every bit of the hyper hype it has accumulated.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language including 'deserves every bit of the hyper hype' and praise for direction/choreography, but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict representation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show with enthusiastic language, comparing it to popular musicals and noting its successful transfer to Broadway. The phrase 'deserves every bit of the hyper hype' indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is highly positive, using phrases like \"catchy fun soundtrack\" and stating that it \"deserves every bit of the hyper hype it has accumulated.\" Given the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, but the positive tone warrants a score in the upper end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows strong enthusiasm for the direction and choreography, explicitly stating the show deserves its hype. However, as a lone curated quote, confidence is reduced per instructions.",
