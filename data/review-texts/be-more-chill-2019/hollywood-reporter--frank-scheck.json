  "bwwExcerpt": "Be More Chill doesn't benefit from a repeat viewing for anyone who's already gone through adolescence. Iconis' pop/rock score, augmented for its Broadway debut with an additional, inconsequential song, 'Sync Up,' is catchy enough. It features some fun, upbeat numbers, including the title tune and 'Upgrade,' while another, 'Michael in the Bathroom,' is a terrific showcase for Salazar, who gets a huge ovation when he first walks onstage, signifying how familiar many audience members already are with the show.",
