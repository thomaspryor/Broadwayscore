    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Mixed signals: praises sci-fi elements and acknowledges target audience appeal, but criticizes formulaic characters and hit-miss writing. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the unique sci-fi element as a main attraction but notes the archetypal nature of the high school genre and the hit-miss rate of pop culture references. The single excerpt suggests a mixed reception with specific appeal to younger audiences. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive and negative aspects, such as the sci-fi element and the hit-or-miss pop culture references, without a clear recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the show's distinctive sci-fi elements and commitment to genre, but criticizes the by-the-numbers archetypes and hit-miss lyrics, suggesting a balanced, unenthusiastic verdict.",
