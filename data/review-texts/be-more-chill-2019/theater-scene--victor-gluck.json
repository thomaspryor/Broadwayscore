However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as \"dazzling and inventive\" and states that it made a \"successful transfer to Broadway.\" However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('dazzling,' 'inventive') and explicitly calls the Broadway transfer 'successful,' indicating a clear recommendation. Confidence is low due to availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
