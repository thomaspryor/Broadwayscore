    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, this contains clear superlatives ('rarest of wonders', 'everything a Broadway musical should be') and unqualified praise across multiple elements. The language suggests exceptional enthusiasm warranting the high Rave range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses highly positive language, describing the show as 'new, exciting, and alive' and a 'rare wonder.' The praise for its humor, music, and staging suggests a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using terms like \"new, exciting, and alive\", \"successful\", and \"spectacular staging\". It explicitly states that it is \"everything a Broadway musical should be\". | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives ('rarest of wonders,' 'everything a Broadway musical should be,' 'best kind of science-fiction') indicating enthusiastic, must-see recommendation despite limited context.",
