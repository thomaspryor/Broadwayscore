  "showScoreExcerpt": "“’Be More Chill’ offers teachable moments galore, but luckily none of them get in the way of the show’s explosive high spirits. Director Brackett and choreographer Brock keep the action hopping and the sound-level deafening, a wise decision considering that ‘Be More Chill’ never achieves the touching gravity of ‘Dear Evan Hansen’ or the sharp wit that writer Tina Fey brings to ‘Mean Girls’. But, hot-damn, does this show know its audience.”\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mildly positive, so scored at lower end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's limitations compared to others but highlights its 'explosive high spirits' and understanding of its audience, suggesting a positive experience overall. However, the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges shortcomings compared to other shows but praises its 'explosive high spirits' and understanding of its audience. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as a positive with reservations.",
