  "bwwExcerpt": "Hwang's 1988 Tony-winning play is a critical-minded drama dissecting race relations, gender roles and international affairs - and also a gripping thriller full of sex, spying and disguises. Its seriously misguided and marred Broadway revival contains direction by Taymor, lead performances from English actor Clive Owen (\"Closer\") and Jin Ha (Chicago cast of \"Hamilton\") and extensive, unnecessary and mostly detrimental rewrites.",
