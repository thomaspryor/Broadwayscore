  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The complex issues so elegantly evoked on the page don’t translate quite as well in this current revival...The production is fluid but inconsistent and surprisingly lackluster...The staging looked more prosaic than operatic...Owen is a terrific actor.

Butterfly’ is riveting theatre, even when the production fails to fully take wing.”\n\nRead more",
