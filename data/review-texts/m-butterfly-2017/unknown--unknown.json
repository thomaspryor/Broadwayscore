Butterfly' returns to Broadway on heavier, drabber wings...Hwang more than implicitly compares Gallimard’s dim vision regarding his love object to the unrealistic beliefs that Western countries hold about the East...For 'M. Butterfly' to have emotional impact, it must make its audiences uneasily complicit in that fantasy. In this version, you always maintain the distance...We’re not being seduced, but preached at.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic finds this revival fundamentally flawed - describing it as 'heavier, drabber' and lacking the essential emotional impact the play requires. However, single excerpt with 'Read more' suggests incomplete text, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view of the production, describing it as 'heavier, drabber' and lacking emotional impact, with the audience feeling preached at rather than engaged. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a low confidence level. | Gemini: The review states the production fails to create emotional impact and instead preaches to the audience, indicating a negative experience. Given the excerpted nature, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the production for failing to create the necessary emotional impact, describing it as 'drabber' and didactic ('preached at') rather than seductive. Despite being a single excerpt, the language clearly indicates a recommendation against seeing this version.",
