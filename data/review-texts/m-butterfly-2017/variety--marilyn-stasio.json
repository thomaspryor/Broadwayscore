  "bwwExcerpt": "Taymor has shielded Hwang's poetry from being overwhelmed by the sheer theatricality of the story, which was based on a real-life case. In one of the playwright's many ravishing lines, Gallimard embraces his fate because \"I have known - and been loved by - the perfect woman.\" By fortifying the scenes that frame the love story, Taymor has also strengthened the political undercurrents of the play.",
