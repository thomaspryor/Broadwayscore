    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite acknowledging dated aspects, the critic praises the leads' performances as bringing 'fresh intensity,' suggesting the revival succeeds despite the material's age. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges dated elements but praises the performances, suggesting a positive recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review acknowledges dated elements but praises the performances, suggesting it's worth seeing despite the play's flaws. The praise is not overwhelming, so a lower positive score is appropriate. | Kimi: While the critic notes the play's 'exotic orientalism' feels dated, the strong praise for the lead performances ('fresh intensity') indicates a qualified recommendation to see this revival.",
