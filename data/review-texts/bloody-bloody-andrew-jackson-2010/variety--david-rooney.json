    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('sugar rush', 'infectious energy') with specific recommendation for target audience. Single excerpt limits full assessment, but tone is enthusiastically positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'irreverent' with 'infectious energy,' suggesting a positive and fresh experience. The language indicates a strong recommendation, especially for younger audiences. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"sugar rush,\" \"anachronistic attitude,\" and \"infectious energy,\" suggesting a positive experience, especially for younger audiences. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise using descriptors like 'sugar rush' and 'infectious energy,' and explicitly states the show 'should connect' with its audience, indicating a clear recommendation. Score reflects the upper range of Positive given the clearly favorable tone, though confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation.",
