    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows qualified appreciation ('still one of those shows that capture a moment') but with only one curated quote available, the full verdict is unclear. Single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed or negative review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show captures a moment but lacks strong evaluative language indicating a clear recommendation. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the show captures a moment and the cast is good, but it's a single excerpt, so confidence is low and the score is in the lower end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt clearly praises the show's cultural resonance and the cast's enthusiastic, disbelieving energy, suggesting a worthwhile experience despite the limited available context.",
