  "bwwExcerpt": "Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson is 90 minutes long, and around minute 70, I began to despair of it. I started to wonder: Surely the whole play couldn't be about just that-facile, glib language mirroring a facile, racist political movement. Or maybe it was simply suffering from the move to Broadway, another show that originated in a small space dying in a big house.",

The excerpt suggests mixed-to-negative feelings but may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses disappointment and suggests the play suffers from its Broadway transition. The tone is negative, indicating a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses doubt and concern about the play's quality and its suitability for Broadway, suggesting a mixed or neutral stance. | Kimi: The critic expresses despair during the performance, criticizes the writing as facile and glib, and notes the show suffers in its transfer to a larger Broadway venue, comparing it to shows that die in big houses. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
