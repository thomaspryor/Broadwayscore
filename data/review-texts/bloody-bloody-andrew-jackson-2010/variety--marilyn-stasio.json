    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it 'effective' and 'raucous' which are positive descriptors, though 'crude' suggests some reservations. The overall tone is appreciative of its political theater impact. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'effective' despite being 'crude', suggesting a positive recommendation with some reservations about its execution. | Gemini: The review calls the show \"effective\" despite being \"crude,\" indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The review offers qualified praise ('effective') with acknowledged limitations ('crude'), suggesting a solid but not enthusiastic recommendation. The 'raucous' and 'mosh pit' imagery implies energetic, entertaining qualities without reaching rave territory.",
