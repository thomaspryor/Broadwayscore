However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may be more nuanced. | GPT-4o: The critic indicates a personal lack of enjoyment despite the audience's reaction, suggesting a negative view. However, without more context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic states they couldn't find the show hilarious, unlike the audience around them, suggesting a negative experience. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While acknowledging the audience enjoyed the show, the critic explicitly states personal disappointment and inability to engage with the material, representing a negative recommendation. Single excerpt limits confidence.",
