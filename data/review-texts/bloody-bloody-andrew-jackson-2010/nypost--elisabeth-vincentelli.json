    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear positive sentiment ('never fails to entertain', 'crowd-pleaser'), but limited text and 'And yet' opening suggests this may follow criticism. Conservative positive score given excerpt-only limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a strong positive sentiment, highlighting the show's entertainment value and crowd-pleasing nature. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt states that the show 'never fails to entertain', which indicates a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise calling the show entertaining and a crowd-pleaser, indicating a clear recommendation to see the production.",
