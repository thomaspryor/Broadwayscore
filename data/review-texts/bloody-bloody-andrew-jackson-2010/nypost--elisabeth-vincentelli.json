    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The phrase 'never fails to entertain' and 'crowd-pleaser' indicates positive assessment, but the opening 'And yet' suggests this entertainment value comes despite other issues. Single excerpt limits full context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as consistently entertaining and a crowd-pleaser, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests a cautious approach, so the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt states the show 'never fails to entertain,' which indicates a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt provides a clear positive verdict with phrases like 'never fails to entertain' and 'crowd-pleaser,' indicating a recommendation to see the show. However, confidence is low given this is a single curated excerpt that may not capture the full review's nuance.",
