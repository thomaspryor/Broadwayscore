  "bwwExcerpt": "Tall, dark and very handsome Benjamin Walker is beyond charismatic as Jackson, portraying him more like a rock idol than a crusty Presidential icon. A dozen other youngsters depict a hundred other folks while singing the blazes out Friedman's pulsating emo-cratic score banged out by a three-man band. Dear Kristine Nielsen drolly rolls around as the show's cozy narrator until she is gunned down by — well, you'll have to see 'BBAJ' to get the joke behind her murder. And to be reminded by the authors how the native population was systematically slaughtered during those glorious times by Jackson and other Americans expanding the nation's boundaries.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance ('beyond charismatic') and other elements ('singing the blazes out', 'pulsating score'), but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation of the performances and the musical score, suggesting an entertaining and engaging production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the lead actor's performance and the score, suggesting an enjoyable experience despite mentioning the show's reminder of historical atrocities. Given the single excerpt, a mid-range positive score seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance ('beyond charismatic'), ensemble ('singing the blazes out'), and score ('pulsating'), and explicitly encourages attendance ('you'll have to see'), though as a single curated excerpt the full critical verdict may not be fully represented.",
