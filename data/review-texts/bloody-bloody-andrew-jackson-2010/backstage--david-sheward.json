  "bwwExcerpt": "In its transfer to Broadway, 'Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson' has gotten even wilder since its incarnations at Off-Broadway's Public Theater last season. This raucous combination political cartoon, rock concert, and extended 'Saturday Night Live' sketch now fills the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre with irreverent wit, in-your-face satire, and lots of sweaty sex appeal. Alex Timbers' off-the-wall book and direction and Michael Friedman's pulse-pounding score provide the first two elements, and Benjamin Walker in the lead delivers the third.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear enthusiasm with vivid descriptors ('raucous', 'pulse-pounding', 'irreverent wit') and praise for all key elements. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the Broadway transfer as wilder and highlights its wit, satire, and appeal. The tone is enthusiastic, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is highly positive, describing the show as a raucous and irreverent combination of various entertaining elements. The praise for the book, direction, score, and lead performance suggests a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the show's direction, score, and lead performance with descriptors like 'pulse-pounding' and 'irreverent wit,' indicating a strong positive recommendation, though the single-excerpt format warrants caution.",
