  "bwwExcerpt": "Oskar Eustis, artistic director of The Public Theater, where this production originated, says in a program note that the show uses 'the immensely pleasurable tools of Populism to critique that most dangerous of American political phenomena.' I can see his point, I guess; but I can just as easily argue that BBAJ employs a key technique of the contemporary Radical Right—misrepresenting historical fact—to try to create some kind of cautionary tale about celebrity and apathy.",
