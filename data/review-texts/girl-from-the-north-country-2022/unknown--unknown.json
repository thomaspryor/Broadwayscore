    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises the show for exceeding jukebox musical expectations with sophisticated integration of Dylan material. However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of positive quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the production, highlighting the incorporation of Dylan's music in a meaningful way. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the show is more than just a jukebox musical, implying a positive assessment. However, due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the show for transcending typical jukebox musical conventions, complimenting the 'pungent, poignant' integration of Dylan's music as sophisticated 'oblique commentary' on the characters. While clearly positive, the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
