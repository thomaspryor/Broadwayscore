  "bwwExcerpt": "The genius of Girl From the North Country, which opened tonight at the Belasco Theatre, is that it treats Dylan's oeuvre, which forms the basis for the lovely, lyrical musical, not as hits to be played from a jukebox but as poetry that constructs a mythic, broken American landscape. The music sets a scene and tone; the story, original to the play and equally mythically American, unfolds within it.",
