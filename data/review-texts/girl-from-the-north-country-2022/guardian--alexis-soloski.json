  "bwwExcerpt": "Overstuffed, often hollow, and for all that, incontestably ravishing, Girl From the North Country, Conor McPherson's Depression-era gloss on Bob Dylan's back pages, makes its windblown way to Broadway. In 1934, in Duluth, Minnesota, a frostbitten piece of earth and Dylan's hometown, lost souls congregate in the parlor of a rundown guesthouse, hurtling toward foreclosure. They drink, they scrap, they fumble toward what they might call love. And sometimes, when the lonesome piano plinks, they lean into I Want You or Idiot Wind.",
