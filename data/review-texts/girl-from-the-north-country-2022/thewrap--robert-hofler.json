  "bwwExcerpt": "Something similar is going on in the theater, only different. 'Flyover porn' is too strong, so let's call it 'country pulp fiction.' After engagements in London and Off Broadway's Public Theater, the musical 'Girl From the North Country' opened Thursday at Broadway's Belasco Theatre. It features 20 songs by Bob Dylan that have nothing to do with the lurid Depression-era melodrama written by Conor McPherson, who hails from Dublin. The story's connection to the legendary songwriter hinges entirely on the show's setting, a boarding house in Dylan's hometown of Duluth, Minnesota. The result could be titled 'Not So Grand Hotel' or 'Really Hot L Duluth.'",
