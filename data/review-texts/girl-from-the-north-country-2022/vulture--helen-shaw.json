  "bwwExcerpt": "McPherson's main dramaturgical problem here is magnitude. The size of the show is wrong, the size of the stories, the scenes, everything. It's simultaneously too long and too short-at times, so many people are getting introduced, it feels like a pilot episode, setting up the machinery for a ten-episode season. We know McPherson, when undistracted by songs, has one of the great senses of theatrical balance: He wrote plays like The Weir and The Night Alive, so perfect that they seem to continue on even after they're over, like a bicycle still wheeling along with the rider gone. That equilibrium abandons him in this, his first musical-he hasn't worked out how to get into songs gracefully, nor how to disguise that repetitive, get-to-the-next-number structure.",
