  "bwwExcerpt": "To its credit, Girl From the North Country doesn't offer up a false, crowd-pleasing closer; it's as sober as the historical moment it depicts. (It's like Mamma Mia! on downers.) By the end of the show, the random encounters have left some characters broken and others uplifted; one of them dies. But like a Dylan show with strangely rearranged songs and a baffling set list, it leaves you both humming its songs and puzzling over what you just witnessed.",
