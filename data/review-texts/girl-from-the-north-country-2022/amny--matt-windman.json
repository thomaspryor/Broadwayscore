    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('beautifully intermixed', 'haunting, mysterious and stunning') suggests enthusiastic recommendation, but single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('haunting, mysterious and stunning') to describe the musical, suggesting a highly favorable view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"beautifully intermixed,\" \"haunting, mysterious and stunning.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring it as positive with a higher score due to the enthusiastic tone. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly positive evaluative language ('beautifully intermixed', 'haunting', 'mysterious', 'stunning') indicating clear enthusiasm for the production, though confidence is reduced due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
