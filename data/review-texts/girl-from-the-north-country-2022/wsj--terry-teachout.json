  "bwwExcerpt": "Wonderful news: 'Girl From the North Country,' Conor McPherson's self-directed jukebox musical based on the songs of Bob Dylan, has reached Broadway after hugely successful runs in London and at New York's Public Theater, slightly altered but essentially the same as the show I reviewed in 2018, calling it 'a musical that does complete justice to the artistry of the great American songwriter whose genius inspired it.'",
