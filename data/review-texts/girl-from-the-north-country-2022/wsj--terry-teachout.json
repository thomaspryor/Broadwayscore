  "bwwExcerpt": "Wonderful news: 'Girl From the North Country,' Conor McPherson's self-directed jukebox musical based on the songs of Bob Dylan, has reached Broadway after hugely successful runs in London and at New York's Public Theater, slightly altered but essentially the same as the show I reviewed in 2018, calling it 'a musical that does complete justice to the artistry of the great American songwriter whose genius inspired it.'",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it 'wonderful news' that the show reached Broadway and quotes their own 2018 review praising it as doing 'complete justice' to Dylan's genius. However, this is only one excerpt and may not represent the full current review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as doing 'complete justice' to Bob Dylan's artistry, indicating a strong endorsement. The use of 'wonderful news' and reference to successful past runs supports a rave classification, despite the single excerpt limitation. | Gemini: The excerpt quotes the critic's previous positive review of the show, indicating a strong recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am scoring it on the higher end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic declares it 'Wonderful news' that the show has reached Broadway, affirming it remains essentially the same as the 2018 production they praised for doing 'complete justice' to Bob Dylan's artistry, indicating a strong recommendation despite limited excerpt availability.",
