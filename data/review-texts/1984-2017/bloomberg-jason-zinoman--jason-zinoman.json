However, this is only one excerpt from a longer review, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'harrowing' and 'forceful', suggesting a strong and impactful adaptation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the production as a \"forceful theatrical response\" and \"nerve-jangling adaptation\", suggesting a positive, albeit potentially unsettling, experience. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strongly positive descriptors ('most forceful', 'nerve-jangling', 'harrowing') indicating the production is effective and impactful, warranting a score in the upper Positive range, though limited context necessitates low confidence.",
