The original 87 rating confirms this is a strong positive recommendation despite the challenging subject matter. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'punishing, visceral experience' which aligns with the critic's original rating of 87, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. The phrase 'that's exactly the point' indicates the production successfully achieves its intended impact. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as a \"punishing, visceral experience\" but clarifies that this is intentional and \"exactly the point,\" indicating a positive assessment despite the potentially negative descriptors. Given the single excerpt, I am placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt validates the show's intense emotional impact as intentional and successful, indicating strong approval. The original rating of 87 supports a high Positive score, though confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation.",
