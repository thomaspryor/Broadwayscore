    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('thrilling and visceral experience') suggests enthusiastic recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires caution about representativeness of full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('thrilling', 'visceral') indicating a highly favorable view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"thrilling and visceral experience\", suggesting a positive review. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt employs enthusiastic descriptors ('thrilling,' 'visceral') and praises the production's immersive psychological impact. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, the score falls in the upper Positive range, though confidence remains low due to limited text availability.",
