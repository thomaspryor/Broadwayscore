  "bwwExcerpt": "This dramatization of George Orwell's 1949 dystopian classic serves as a reminder. For all its moving set pieces, along with a busy, ear-blasting soundscape, frequent blackouts, blinding lights and live video, it's strangely unmoving and low-impact. The action meanders and jumps in time, so some familiarity with the story is a must. On the plus side, authors and directors Robert Icke and Duncan MacMillan deserve credit for letting Orwell's cautionary story about a world of fake news and government control speak for itself.",

Since only one curated quote is available, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The review highlights both positive and negative aspects, noting impressive elements like set pieces and direction, but ultimately finds the production 'strangely unmoving and low-impact'. The single excerpt suggests a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review notes both positive and negative aspects, ultimately finding the production \"strangely unmoving and low-impact.\" The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to a \"low\" confidence score. | Kimi: The excerpt balances praise for the directors' faithful adaptation against significant criticism that the production is emotionally flat and narratively confusing, with the single-quote warning necessitating caution about the overall verdict.",
