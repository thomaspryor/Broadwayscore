    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic states the production 'succeeds' in its goals and creates 'genuine terror', which is positive evaluation. However, this appears to be a very brief excerpt, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the production's success in evoking the intended atmosphere, suggesting a positive recommendation. However, the lack of additional context or details about the overall production limits the confidence level. | Gemini: The review states that the production \"succeeds\" and creates a visceral sense of the nightmare, indicating a positive recommendation, although not an overwhelmingly enthusiastic one. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states the production 'succeeds' in delivering effective atmosphere and emotional impact, using unambiguous positive language, though the brevity of this excerpt limits certainty about the overall verdict.",
