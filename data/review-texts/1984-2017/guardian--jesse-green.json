    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as a 'visceral theatrical experience' using 'every theatrical trick in the book' - positive assessment of theatrical craft and impact. However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential for cherry-picked quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'visceral theatrical experience,' suggesting a strong, positive impact. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low and the score is at the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as a \"visceral theatrical experience\" and praises its use of theatrical tricks, suggesting a positive recommendation. Given that this is a single excerpt, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt strongly praises the production's visceral impact and technical effectiveness, using words like 'visceral' and emphasizing the successful use of theatrical techniques to achieve its goals. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced per instructions.",
