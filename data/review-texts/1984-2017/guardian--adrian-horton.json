Of its swift return to Australia, this time for a national tour, the playwrights Robert Icke and Duncan Macmillan wrote: “Even more now than last time we visited, Orwell’s dystopian vision of a surveilled and totalitarian world seems horribly relevant.”\n\nAustralian political events that make the story “horribly relevant” include the metadata retention laws that began in April, and the habit of successive immigration ministers of shoving truth down the “memory-hole”. (The chute used in 1984 to dispose of proof that doesn’t support the ruling party’s agenda.)\n\nBut the production’s relevance is really a global phenomenon. 1984 swept to bestseller status in January after President Trump’s advisor Kellyanne Conway used the phrase “alternative facts”. Trump’s “fake news” slurs were freakishly Orwellian ​– but Conway’s redefinition of a word to serve the interests of the state was “newspeak” to a tee.\n\nRead moreAs the book reached number one on Amazon, it begged the question: why did so many reach for a bleak dystopian novel? I suspect it’s because after Trump’s election the word “unprecedented” was used a lot. Yet in 1984 there was a place where all this, and worse, had happened. Fictional, yes, but still a precedent, and a safe space to process the realities of a post-Trump world. Many recalled studying its themes at school; marking its atrocities in highlighter. Here, at least, fear was orderly.\n\nIcke and Macmillan have come to Australia to direct a local cast, aided by Australian associate director, Cory McMahon. The production is noisy and novel, with inventive multimedia flourishes. But the adaptation isn’t able to surmount three key challenges presented by Orwell’s book – and this particular staging brings its own specific flaws as well.\n\nThe first challenge is how to stage Oceania. In the book, it is barren and bomb-pocked. The only zest permitted is zealotry for the party and hatred of the enemy. For the main character, Winston Smith (Tom Conroy), the dour days pass indistinguishably. Were Oceania represented faithfully, Winston’s ennui may become ours.\n\n​Most of the play is set in a library encased in ruddy wood that I can’t recall from the book … so where are we exactly? Winston doesn’t seem to know either. “Where am I?” he repeats. The library setting, with its dream-sequence bar scenes, gives little visceral sense of the physical and emotional deprivations Winston rails against.\n\nView image in fullscreen‘Where am I?’: Tom Conroy and Trinity O’Shea in 1984. Photograph: Shane ReidBlasts of noise – foreshadowed by a tinnitus-like whine – punctuate the short scenes. We leap in our seats repeatedly as the noise-blasts keep the action hurrying along. It is energising but patronising too, as if the playwrights expected a mass nod-off. Increasingly, the noise seems gratuitous – and tonally, it is wrong. The book has its loud moments – such as Hate Week and when the telescreens fire commands – but it is quietly sinister too.\n\nThen there is the second, knottier challenge: how to externalise Winston’s thought crimes (unorthodox thoughts prosecutable by the Thought Police). To speak them means death, so in the book Winston masks his “ungood oldthink” with “facecrimes” and “doublethink”. \n Not in the play, however. Here, confusingly, his disgust and disorientation is on full display. During Hate Week, instead of chanting with the others, Winston screams: “Down with Big Brother!” When a party comrade Parsons (Paul Blackwell) talks about how his child reported a man to Big Brother, Winston doesn’t murmur in support. He doesn’t nod along when another comrade, Symes (Guy O’Grady), enthuses about “newspeak’s” aim to obliterate original thought.\n\nI understand that thoughts are anathema to a form that needs dialogue and action. But Winston’s expressiveness – acted over-zealously by Conroy, especially given the play frequently uses film-style close ups writ large on a monitor – undermines the text’s core of repression, secrecy and paranoia. Instead of it building then boiling over, his distress simmers throughout. People who haven’t read the book may think: why don’t the Thought Police arrest him? It does become clear he’s not speaking out – merely dreaming of it – but some crucial scenes slip by in the interim.\n\nView image in fullscreenUrsula Mills in 1984 Photograph: Shane ReidThe adaptation’s third main departure from the book is its most problematic. Bear with me while I explain – it’s a bit of a ride.\n\nEarly on in their writing, Icke and Macmillan became fascinated by 1984’s appendix. Grasping “the importance of the appendix … is integral,” they claim, because it “thrusts the novel into the past, making it a historical document.” \n They linked this concept with Winston’s resolve to write his diary “for the future, for the unborn” and decided to open and close the play with two new scenes set in a bookclub, or perhaps an English literature tutorial, in the future, with a group of people deconstructing 1984. It makes for an enormously confusing opening scene. “Who are these people?” you wonder, while also trying to follow their hypothesising. It works immeasurably better as a final bookend because by then we understand the conceit. \n The tactic is described in the program by London critic Dominic Cavendish as pulling off “a theatrical correlative to doublethink, a state of contrary interpretation”. Elsewhere, he asks: “Does this sound like an over-complication?”\n\nActually, Dominic, yes. The approach smacks of a text that’s been a classic for 70 years with professorial types circling, seeking new roads in. Yet with themes this loudly and freshly relevant, why bother? 1984 did not become a bestseller in January because of where its appendix does or does not place the reader. No close reading is necessary. I’ll take the blaringly obvious themes of state surveillance, intimidation, centralised power structures and the atrophy of political discourse, thanks.\n\nIf Icke and MacMillan were confident enough to meddle, why not meddle with Orwell’s gross sexism too? Instead, the script is faithful to Winston’s lover Julia (Ursula Mills) being capable of only lying, sex, sleeping and making coffee – roughly in that order – while Winston waxes about ideology Julia says is “boring”. She doesn’t even daintily slap his face when he screams: “You’re a only a rebel from the waist downwards!” Mills plays the role obediently – frustratingly so. There is no reason why Julia couldn’t be given a smidge more depth – other than remaining loyal to what verges on misogyny from Orwell.\n\nUltimately any adaption needs to do something better, different or more thought-provokingly than the book. In this case, it is the stark latter scenes. Scenes that in the book become bloated and didactic are here stripped back to their brutal moving parts and most galling revelations.\n\nIn the second-last scene, an exchange between Julia and Winston is the first that cuts through – their earlier passion had not rung true. It is a revelation that in retrospect is not political but personal; the kind that knocks around in your head for days. It is also a direct quote from the book.\n\nAt any point, you can opt out of the sale of all of your personal information by pressing",
