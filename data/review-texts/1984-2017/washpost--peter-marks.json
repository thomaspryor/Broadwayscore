    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Strong praise calling the theater 'vital' and crediting the production with successfully creating an inescapable reality. The language suggests this is must-see theater despite being challenging. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong language to describe the production as both 'punishing' and 'vital', indicating a powerful and impactful experience. The success in making Orwell's nightmare feel relevant today suggests a high level of effectiveness and importance. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"vital\" and states that the production \"succeeds\" in making the nightmare feel real. This indicates a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives ('most punishing — and vital') and unreserved praise for the production's success in making Orwell's work feel urgently contemporary, indicating a strong recommendation.",
