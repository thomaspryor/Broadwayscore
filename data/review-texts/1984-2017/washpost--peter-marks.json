The critic's use of 'succeeds' suggests a high level of achievement in the production's goals. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"vital\" and states that the production \"succeeds\", indicating a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic employs superlatives ('most vital', 'succeeds') to praise the production's effectiveness and contemporary relevance, framing its intensity as a virtue rather than a flaw. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
