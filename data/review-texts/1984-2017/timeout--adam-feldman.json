    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic's own 80 rating clearly places this in positive territory. The 'blunt instrument' description acknowledges lack of subtlety but 'hits its target with considerable force' indicates the production succeeds powerfully in its goals. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 80 places the review firmly in the Positive bucket. The review acknowledges the production's effectiveness in delivering Orwell's ideas, albeit in a forceful manner, suggesting a solid recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the production's direct approach but ultimately finds it effective, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. The original rating of 80 aligns with the positive bucket. | Kimi: The critic praises the production's visceral impact and effectiveness despite its lack of finesse, noting it 'hits its target with considerable force.' The provided rating of 80 aligns with a solid positive recommendation, though the extreme brevity of the text warrants low confidence.",
