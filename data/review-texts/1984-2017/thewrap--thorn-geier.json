  "bwwExcerpt": "Even for audiences inclined to feel jaded about revisiting a story from a long-ago school reading list, this \"1984\" manages to pump new, discomforting life into the mother of all dystopias. Icke and MacMillan also hit on some home truths that feel all too pertinent at a time when so many are called to \"resist\" authority. \"The people will not revolt,\" O'Brien notes. \"They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice what's really happening.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows clear praise for making familiar material feel fresh and relevant, overcoming audience jadedness. However, with only one curated quote available, confidence is low as this may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production for revitalizing a classic story with relevant themes. Despite the limited text, the positive tone suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the production manages to bring new life to the story and feels pertinent, suggesting a positive, though possibly qualified, recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it in the middle of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt strongly praises the production for revitalizing the classic story with contemporary relevance, recommending it even for potentially jaded audiences. The language ('pump new life', 'home truths') indicates clear approval within the Positive range.",
