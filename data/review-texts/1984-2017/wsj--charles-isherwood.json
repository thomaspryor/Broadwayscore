However, the lack of broader evaluative context or explicit recommendation suggests a moderate score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review highlights the production's success in creating an immersive and impactful atmosphere, suggesting a positive experience despite the potentially oppressive nature of the subject matter. | Kimi: The excerpt uses clearly positive evaluative language ('succeeds,' 'palpably oppressive') to praise the production's atmospheric achievement, indicating a favorable assessment, though the brevity of the excerpt limits certainty about the overall recommendation.",
