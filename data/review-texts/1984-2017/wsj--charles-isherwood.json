However, the lack of broader context or additional evaluative comments suggests some reservation. | Gemini: The review highlights the production's success in creating an oppressive atmosphere, suggesting a positive, albeit potentially unsettling, experience for the audience. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states the production 'succeeds' in creating an immersive, oppressive atmosphere, indicating a positive assessment of the staging and its emotional impact. However, the brevity of the excerpt suggests this may be truncated text, warranting lower confidence in the overall recommendation strength.",
