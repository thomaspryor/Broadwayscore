    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite describing the show as 'gut-churning' and intense, the critic clearly states it 'rewards watching,' indicating a positive recommendation. However, confidence is low due to truncated text and single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'gripping' and 'rewards watching,' indicating a strong recommendation despite its intense nature. The absence of a full review and the single excerpt warning suggest using the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show is \"gripping\" and \"rewards watching,\" but also mentions that children under 13 have been barred from attending. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive with reservations and low confidence. | Kimi: While the critic emphasizes the show's disturbing intensity ('gut-churning,' 'shake in their seats'), the explicit statement that it 'rewards watching' constitutes a clear recommendation. However, as this is a single truncated excerpt, confidence must remain low.",
