  "fullText": "George Orwell’s “1984” returned to the best-seller lists earlier this year on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration as president of the United States. But Robert Icke and Duncan MacMillan’s new stage adaptation, first staged in the U.K. in 2013 and opening on Broadway Thursday, remains joltingly timely even without a direct nod to current events.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Even for audiences inclined to feel jaded about revisiting a story from a long-ago school reading list, this '1984' manages to pump new, discomforting life into the mother of all dystopias. Icke and MacMillan also hit on some home truths that feel all too pertinent at a time when so many are called to 'resist' authority. 'The people will not revolt,' O'Brien notes. 'They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice what's really happening.'",
