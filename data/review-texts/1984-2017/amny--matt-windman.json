  "bwwExcerpt": "Running about 101 minutes (in a nod to 'room 101,' the novel's chamber of horrors), this visceral and unpredictable staging is more exciting and effective than this summer's other politically-oriented productions (including Robert Schenkkan's prison drama 'Building the Wall' and The Public Theater's uneasily Trump-infused 'Julius Caesar').",
