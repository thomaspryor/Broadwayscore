  "bwwExcerpt": "Running about 101 minutes (in a nod to 'room 101,' the novel's chamber of horrors), this visceral and unpredictable staging is more exciting and effective than this summer's other politically-oriented productions (including Robert Schenkkan's prison drama 'Building the Wall' and The Public Theater's uneasily Trump-infused 'Julius Caesar').",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise ('visceral and unpredictable', 'exciting and effective') with favorable comparison to other shows, but limited text and possible cherry-picking requires caution with lower positive score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'visceral and unpredictable,' and more effective than other similar productions, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive assessment, calling the staging \"exciting and effective\" compared to other productions. However, due to the limited text available, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise calling the staging 'visceral,' 'unpredictable,' and superior to comparable productions, indicating a solid recommendation. However, confidence is low as this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's verdict.",
