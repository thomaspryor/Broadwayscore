    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Acknowledges the production succeeds at its immersive goals but criticizes it as theater. 'Works better as a stunt than as theater' suggests theatrical disappointment despite technical achievement. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the production's approach as more of a 'stunt' than effective theater, implying it lacks theatrical value. The tone suggests disappointment, leading to a negative classification. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the immersive approach's success in creating a specific feeling but ultimately finds it more of a stunt than effective theater, indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the show as a 'stunt' rather than legitimate theater, and while acknowledging technical effectiveness, frames the audience experience ('trapped and surveilled') as unpleasant rather than artistically valuable. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
