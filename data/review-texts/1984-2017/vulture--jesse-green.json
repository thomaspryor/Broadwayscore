The tone is neither strongly positive nor negative, indicating a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the immersive approach's success in creating a feeling of being trapped and surveilled, but ultimately finds it more of a stunt than effective theater, suggesting a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the production as gimmickry ('stunt') that fails to achieve legitimate theatrical merit, despite acknowledging it succeeds at creating a specific atmospheric effect. The implicit recommendation is against seeing it for substantive drama.",
