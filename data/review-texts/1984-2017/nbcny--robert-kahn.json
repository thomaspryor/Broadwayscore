  "bwwExcerpt": "A new British stage adaptation of George Orwell's Dystopian novel, now at the Hudson Theatre, is an assault on the senses, pointedly designed to run over an audience like a tank crushing resistors in its path. Here's what has me fidgety, though. To some degree, the strobe lights, gunshots and gore become such a distraction from the story that they threaten to overwhelm its dire message about government run amok. Where do you dial down the noise and turn up the narrative? The answer will differ for everyone, but if you go, here's some advice -- bring earplugs.",

The advice to 'bring earplugs' suggests tolerance rather than enthusiasm. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the sensory impact but criticizes it for overshadowing the narrative. The advice to bring earplugs suggests a mixed experience, with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review highlights both the impactful nature of the production and its potential to be overwhelming and distracting. The advice to bring earplugs suggests a tolerance is needed, placing it in the mixed category. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the production's intense design but finds the sensory assault distracting rather than illuminating, offering only conditional attendance advice with practical warnings rather than a clear recommendation.",
