  "bwwExcerpt": "Yet the most forceful theatrical response to the administration is now on Broadway, with a nerve-jangling adaptation of George Orwell's classic novel 1984, which just opened at the Hudson Theatre. This harrowing production stages what might be the most famous picture of a totalitarian future, one that's penetrated the lexicon (\"Big Brother,\" \"double-think\") and subconscious of generations of readers because of its vision of perpetual war, constant surveillance, and state-sponsored lies.",
