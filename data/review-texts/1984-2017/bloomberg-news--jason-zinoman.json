  "bwwExcerpt": "Yet the most forceful theatrical response to the administration is now on Broadway, with a nerve-jangling adaptation of George Orwell's classic novel 1984, which just opened at the Hudson Theatre. This harrowing production stages what might be the most famous picture of a totalitarian future, one that's penetrated the lexicon (\"Big Brother,\" \"double-think\") and subconscious of generations of readers because of its vision of perpetual war, constant surveillance, and state-sponsored lies.",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'harrowing' and 'nerve-jangling,' indicating a strong emotional impact. However, the single excerpt and lack of a full review make the overall sentiment unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the production as a \"forceful theatrical response\" and \"nerve-jangling adaptation,\" indicating a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, assessment. Given that it is a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
