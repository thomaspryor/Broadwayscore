  "bwwExcerpt": "It is truly frightening to see the parallels between George Orwell's dystopian novel '1984' and the state of our union today. Orwell wrote of 'doublethink' and 'Newspeak.' We have alternate facts and fake news. Of course, we're not ruled by an authoritarian Big Brother figure - at least not yet - but Robert Icke and Duncan Macmillan's harrowing stage adaptation leaves little doubt we are being watched. This is not an easy play for us to watch. Icke and Macmillan, who also co-directed, employ disorienting effects: light and sound disruptions mess with our heads, the story seems to jump back and forth in non-linear fashion, and the torture sequence at the end is brutally graphic.",
