  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Mostly it’s a pretty predictable plot without much happening...The opening number was so contrived with characters stepping out into spotlight to tell their stories that I wondered whether I had wandered into a high-school production...This musical feels like an unpolished early draft that has potential but needs work...Brickell’s score is pleasant but not very memorable...I salute the idea of putting a wholesome musical on Broadway. I just wish the packaging was wrapped more neatly.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative assessment despite saluting the concept. Critic finds plot predictable, production amateurish, score unmemorable, and execution poor overall. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the plot as predictable and the opening number as contrived, suggesting a lack of polish. While the score is described as pleasant, it is also deemed unmemorable. The overall tone suggests disappointment with the execution, despite acknowledging the concept's potential. | Gemini: The review expresses reservations about the plot, opening number, and score, but acknowledges potential and salutes the idea of a wholesome musical. This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic compares the production to a high-school show and an unpolished draft, criticizing the contrived staging and predictable plot while offering only faint praise for the score, indicating the show is not ready for Broadway.",
