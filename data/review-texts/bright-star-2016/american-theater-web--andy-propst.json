    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language throughout: 'beautifully supported', 'sweeping cinematic feel', 'consistently satisfying and ultimately moving'. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides positive feedback on the score, direction, and overall experience, describing it as 'consistently satisfying and ultimately moving.' The lack of a full review and single excerpt warning suggest using the upper end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"sweet, romantic\", \"beautifully supported\", \"sweeping cinematic feel\", and \"consistently satisfying and ultimately moving\", indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the score, direction, and emotional impact, using words like 'beautifully supported,' 'sweeping cinematic feel,' and 'ultimately moving.' Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this falls in the upper Positive range.",
