  "bwwExcerpt": "Steve Martin and Edie Brickell's 'Bright Star' is a Broadway oddity -- and not just because it has a bluegrass score. No, the weird thing about 'Bright Star' is the way it juxtaposes an over-the-top plot with a low-key production and mild-tempered music...The show ambles along, alternating between lively hootenannies and lovely ditties -- the title song is especially wonderful, performed by Shively and the ensemble with hopeful joy...The show's droll, earnest tone does have its appeal...As a gentle fable, 'Bright Star' has a quirky charm, but its stubborn refusal to face up to its dark side diminishes it.",
  "bwwScore": 7
