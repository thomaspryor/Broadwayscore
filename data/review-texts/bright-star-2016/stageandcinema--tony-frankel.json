Still, there’s freshness and appeal in the storytelling, and the director is at the top of his game...Once the fractured narrative becomes easier to follow in the second act, musical comedy heaven is upon us, and the tidy ending will leave you teary-eyed with a spring in your heart. For first-time musical writers, this is nothing short of a miracle.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Despite opening criticisms of narrative and music, the critic finds the show becomes 'musical comedy heaven' and calls it 'a miracle.' This is positive but qualified recommendation. Low confidence due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges flaws in the narrative and music but ultimately finds the storytelling fresh and appealing, with a strong second act and emotional impact. The positive elements outweigh the negatives, leading to a recommendation with reservations. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws (\"unwieldy narrative\", \"mostly forgettable music\") but ultimately finds freshness and appeal, especially in the second act. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as a slightly positive recommendation. | Kimi: While the excerpt notes flaws in the narrative and music, it offers enthusiastic praise for the direction, second act, and emotional impact, calling the show 'nothing short of a miracle' and promising 'musical comedy heaven.'",
