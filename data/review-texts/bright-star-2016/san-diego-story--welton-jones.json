Despite minor suggestions for improvement, the overall tone is highly enthusiastic. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, calling the show \"very special\" and a \"reward.\" Despite some minor suggestions, the overall tone is enthusiastic, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The critic uses enthusiastic superlatives ('very special,' 'cherished,' 'dream of') and emphasizes the show is 'one of those shows that you really don't want to mess with,' indicating strong unqualified praise despite minor quibbles about specific plot elements.",
