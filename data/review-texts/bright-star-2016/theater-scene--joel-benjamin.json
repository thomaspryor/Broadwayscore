His first-rate production almost makes the surprising plot devices credible.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show 'rises above' its material and praises the score, lead performance, and direction as 'first-rate,' but qualifies this with 'just barely' and notes significant flaws like monotonous music and trite lyrics. The positive elements outweigh negatives but reservations are substantial. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges strengths like the energetic score and Cusack's performance but criticizes the lyrics and potential monotony. The overall tone is mixed, with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review praises Cusack's performance and the production, but criticizes the lyrics and repetitiveness. The overall tone is mixed, not strongly positive or negative. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, highlighting an 'astonishing' lead performance and 'first-rate' direction while criticizing the 'repetitious' lyrics and 'monotonous' score; the 'rises just barely' framing indicates a mild, conditional recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
