  "showScoreExcerpt": "“‘Bright Star’ isn’t the trendiest of new musicals, but it’s one of the most affecting that has opened in the pre-Tony nomination flood, not so much for its unapologetically traditional story or its wholesome, old-fashioned theme, but for its overall emotional coherence...Even though it’s not too too hard to figure how the play will conclude, I felt as if I had discovered something fresh and new.”\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds clearly positive, so using upper end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the emotional coherence and freshness of the show despite its traditional elements. The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review states that the show is \"one of the most affecting\" and that the reviewer \"felt as if I had discovered something fresh and new,\" indicating a positive recommendation despite some reservations about its traditional story. | Kimi: While acknowledging the show isn't 'trendy' and follows a traditional structure, the critic praises it as 'one of the most affecting' musicals with 'emotional coherence' and a 'fresh' quality, indicating a clear recommendation.",
