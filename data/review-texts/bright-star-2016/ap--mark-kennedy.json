But after 2½ hours of this down-home hokum, the answer is clear: No, we don't. Comedian and banjo enthusiast Steve Martin has...",

The music is weak...The book and lyrics are even more feeble, with graceless lines and weird characters...The show, so long exploring lost love, then descends into virtual farce before ending on such a forced happy note and with such swiftness that it'll knock the corndog out of your hand.\"\n\nRead more",

The vivid closing metaphor about knocking 'the corndog out of your hand' shows total dismissal. | GPT-4o: The review is highly critical, describing the show as a 'third-rate version' with 'weak' music and 'feeble' book and lyrics. The tone suggests a strong negative verdict, but the excerpt is limited, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly negative, describing the show as a \"third-rate version\" with weak music, feeble book and lyrics, and a forced happy ending. The overall tone indicates a strong disapproval and a recommendation to avoid. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a scathing assessment with no redeeming qualities mentioned, describing the show as 'third-rate' and 'feeble' with 'graceless' writing.",
