With only one excerpt available and no clear recommendation, this appears mixed with slight negative lean. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights both positive aspects (playful and lovely music) and issues (struggling to fill the house), suggesting a mixed review. The single excerpt and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review notes both positive aspects (tender story, playful and lovely music) and negative aspects (struggles to fill the house, issues of scale), suggesting a mixed reception. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: The critic praises the 'playful and lovely' staging and music but emphasizes significant reservations about the show's scale on Broadway, noting it 'sometimes struggle[s] to fill the house,' indicating neither a clear recommendation nor dismissal.",
