    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review acknowledges appeal and charm but identifies significant structural problems that prevent a recommendation. The final verdict balances positives against substantial negatives without clear guidance to see or skip it. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's charm and appeal to fans of Martin's humor, but also notes significant drawbacks such as its refusal to engage with darker themes. This suggests a mixed verdict with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive and negative aspects of the show. It acknowledges the show's charm and appeal but also points out its shortcomings, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The review acknowledges the show's 'quirky charm' and appeal for fans of Steve Martin's humor, but criticizes the tonal mismatch between the over-the-top plot and low-key production, noting the show 'ambles along' and fails to engage with its darker elements. The mixed signals and qualified praise place it in the Mixed bucket.",
