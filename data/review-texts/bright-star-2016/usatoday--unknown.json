  "bwwExcerpt": "...Bright Star aspires to the kind of emotional sweep and folksy wit we associate with Golden Age musicals, from Rodgers and Hammerstein classics to Meredith Willson's The Music Man. That's a tall order in 2016, with irony and its bratty child, snark, having emerged as prevalent comic tools. But Martin, a master ironist, captures some of that old-school spirit with a book that's as forthright as it is smart, funny and charming...Director Walter Bobbie culls spirited, endearing performances from the actors cast in these roles. Carmen Cusack's Alice evolves convincingly from a mischievous girl to an accomplished but lonely and disappointed woman, while A.J. Shively makes Billy at once wholesome and credibly ambitious",
