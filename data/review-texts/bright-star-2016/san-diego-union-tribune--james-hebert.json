    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Mixed signals - praises fresh ideas and compelling elements but questions songwriting choices and suggests the show needs better storytelling fuel. Single excerpt warning requires caution about incomplete verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges some shortcomings but highlights the show's fresh ideas and compelling elements. The positive aspects are emphasized, suggesting a recommendation despite reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review acknowledges compelling elements but also expresses reservations about whether some moments merit being turned into song. The overall tone suggests a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the excerpt notes storytelling imperfections and questions some musical choices, it praises the show's fresh ideas and compelling elements, indicating a qualified but genuine recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Positive, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
