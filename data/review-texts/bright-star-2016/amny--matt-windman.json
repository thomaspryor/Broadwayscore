The 'Nevertheless' structure indicates mixed feelings without a clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges significant flaws in storytelling and character development but ultimately describes the show as heartwarming and crowd-pleasing. The mixed tone suggests a conditional recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws like jumbled storytelling and undeveloped characters, but also highlights heartwarming qualities and pleasant songs, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the critic notes significant weaknesses in storytelling and character development, the 'Nevertheless' signals a positive verdict, calling the show 'heartwarming and crowd-pleasing' with pleasant music.
