Yes, it's headed from the get-go to an inevitably happy ending that relies on some pretty far-fetched contrivances...But with Carmen Cusack as Alice, this is your chance to see a-star-is-born Broadway debut.\"\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning applied - cautious positive scoring. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges that 'Bright Star' may not be groundbreaking but highlights its enjoyable and feel-good nature. The positive tone is tempered by mentions of contrivances, suggesting a mildly positive verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws but ultimately recommends seeing the show for its enjoyable qualities and the lead performance, suggesting a positive but not rave experience. | Kimi: The critic explicitly recommends the show as an enjoyable, feel-good experience with standout performances, despite noting its reliance on contrivances and lack of groundbreaking status. Given only one excerpt is available, confidence is low.",
