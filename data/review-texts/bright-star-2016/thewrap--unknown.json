  "bwwExcerpt": "The 'Bright Star' bluegrass score features more twangs per dipthong than a whole evening of 'Tobacco Road'...Walter Bobbie directs and Josh Rhodes choreographs 'Bright Star' in a way that brings to mind Agnes de Mille as rendered by Grant Wood. Time will tell if this musical makes the walls of Joe Allen restaurant's gallery of flops. On the walls of my mind, 'Bright Star' has already taken its place between last season's 'Doctor Zhivago' and 1979's 'Got Tu Go Disco.'",
  "bwwScore": 5
