    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for choreography, direction, and overall warmth, with verdict that it's 'more than entertaining.' Single excerpt warning requires caution, but tone is solidly positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the choreography and direction, describing the show as 'more than entertaining' with 'down-home warmth'. The positive tone and specific commendations suggest a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the choreography, direction, and overall entertainment value of the show, indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I am placing it in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the direction ('makes magic'), choreography ('lively'), and overall experience ('more than entertaining'), indicating a solid recommendation despite the limited text available.",
