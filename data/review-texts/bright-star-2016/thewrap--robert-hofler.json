    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single truncated excerpt with mixed descriptive language - references to artistic influences suggest some appreciation, but the 'time will tell' ending implies uncertainty about the show's success. Truncated mid-sentence makes full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a descriptive evaluation of the direction and choreography, but lacks clear positive or negative sentiment. The single excerpt limits confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt is brief and somewhat ambiguous. The comparison to Agnes de Mille and Grant Wood suggests a unique and potentially appealing aesthetic, but the initial comment about the bluegrass score is less positive. Given the limited information, a mixed score seems most appropriate. | Kimi: Single truncated excerpt offers sophisticated but ambiguous cultural comparisons (Tobacco Road, Grant Wood) without clear recommendation, ending with uncertainty about the show's longevity at Joe Allen's.",
