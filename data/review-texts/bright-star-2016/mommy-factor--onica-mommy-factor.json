However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is on the lower end of the Rave range. | Gemini: The critic states that they \"absolutely loved the show\" and believes it will be an \"instant hit on Broadway,\" indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: Single excerpt displays unqualified enthusiasm ('absolutely loved', 'one of the best'), but confidence is reduced due to potential cherry-picking.",
