  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The musical is gentle-spirited, not gaudy, and moves with an easygoing grace where others prance and strut. And it tells a sentiment-spritzed story...While the story certainly skirts (if not embraces) sentimentality and the overripeness of melodrama, the production’s soft-hued style keeps it from curdling into treacle. The songs boast simple but seductive melodies, and lyrics that have a sweet, homespun quality. The mostly acoustic score is beautifully played.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies. The text shows clear appreciation for the show's style, score, and production values, but acknowledges sentimentality concerns. Given this is a curated excerpt that may not reflect the full verdict, scoring conservatively in lower Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the musical's gentle and graceful style, avoiding excessive sentimentality. The positive tone suggests a recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, highlighting the gentle spirit, easygoing grace, and seductive melodies. However, it also acknowledges the story's sentimentality and melodrama, suggesting a qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers consistent praise for the show's graceful style, seductive melodies, and beautiful acoustic score, acknowledging sentimentality but finding the execution prevents it from becoming treacly. Given the clearly positive tone within this single curated excerpt, it falls in the upper range of the Positive bucket.",
