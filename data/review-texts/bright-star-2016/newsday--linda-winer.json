The 'however' structure shows these are minor caveats to an overall positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges some sentimental and implausible elements but ultimately describes the show as 'downright wonderful' with a complex and satisfying score. The positive language suggests a strong recommendation despite the text quality warning. | Gemini: The review uses phrases like \"downright wonderful\" and praises the score's complexity and satisfaction, indicating a strong positive recommendation despite acknowledging some flaws. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the show's cornball sentimentality and implausible plot, the verdict is strongly positive with 'downright wonderful' and praise for the score's complexity and the story's depth.",
