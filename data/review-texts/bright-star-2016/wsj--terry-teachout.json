However, the limited excerpt provides insufficient context for a higher confidence level. | Gemini: The review highlights a specific positive aspect of the show (authenticity of the score) and implies overall success ('work so well'). This indicates a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: The review praises the score's authenticity and effectiveness ('work so well'), with clear approval of the creative team's approach. However, the excerpt is very brief with no explicit recommendation language or star rating, limiting confidence in the full verdict.",
