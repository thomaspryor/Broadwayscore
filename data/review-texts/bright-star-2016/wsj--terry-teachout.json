  "bwwExcerpt": "Steve Martin is, among many other things, a good banjo player who writes not-so-great plays. Now he's branched out by writing a really bad bluegrass-pop musical. In 'Bright Star,' directed by Walter Bobbie, Mr. Martin and Edie Brickell, a singer-songwriter with whom he has made two albums, tell the story of a painfully earnest young writer from the hills of North Carolina (A.J. Shively) who comes home from World War II and sells a painfully earnest short story to a prestigious Asheville quarterly edited by an unhappy woman (Carmen Cusack) with a terrible secret -- or, rather, a Terrible Secret, this being the kind of show that is constructed exclusively out of uppercase clichés. The best thing about 'Bright Star' is the music, which is bland and undramatic but competently wrought. The plot is trite, the dialogue humorless and stiff, the lyrics stupefyingly banal...The cast and onstage band work hard and Mr. Bobbie does his best to breathe life into 'Bright Star,' but if Mr. Martin's name weren't on the marquee, it wouldn't have gotten anywhere near Broadway.",

This indicates a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: The review praises the score's authenticity and effectiveness ('work so well'), with clear approval of the creative team's approach. However, the excerpt is very brief with no explicit recommendation language or star rating, limiting confidence in the full verdict.",
