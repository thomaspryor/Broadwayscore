The final verdict is enthusiastically positive, describing a transformative theatrical experience despite predictable plot. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'exquisite in every way' and highlights the strong ensemble cast, suggesting a highly positive experience despite minor critiques about scene length. The single excerpt and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly positive, praising Carmen Cusack's performance, the ensemble work, and the overall experience. Despite a minor reservation about trimming scenes, the conclusion is that the show is exquisite and will move the audience in all the right places. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong praise ('exquisite', 'knocks the ball out of the park') and an enthusiastic overall verdict, though minor criticism about scene length tempers it slightly from the Rave bucket.",
