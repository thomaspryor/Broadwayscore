    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear recommendation to 'check out' the show, calling it 'charming' and 'joyous,' but acknowledges significant flaws like forced rhymes and being underdeveloped. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt suggests a positive recommendation for those seeking a feel-good show, despite noting some flaws in the lyrics and development. The overall tone is mildly positive, warranting a score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws (\"forced rhymes\", \"underdeveloped\") but ultimately concludes that audiences will enjoy the \"joyous\" show. The excerpt suggests a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: The critic explicitly recommends the show ('should check out') and calls it 'joyous' with 'delightful' music, though with significant reservations about the underdeveloped book and repetitive lyrics.",
