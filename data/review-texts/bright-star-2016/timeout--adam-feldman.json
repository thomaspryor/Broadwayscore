  "fullText": "Steve Martin and Edie Brickell make their Broadway debuts as composer-lyricists in this romantic tale set in the American South from the 1920s to the '40s. Walter Bobbie directs an ensemble that includes Paul Alexander Nolan (Doctor Zhivago) and Carmen Cusack.\n\nThis is an amazing show. The music is beautiful and beautifully song, the two female leads are incredible. The story is moving and captivating. You won't be bored at any point. Be preapred to go through every emotion possible, when I say the audience was sniffling and crying during the show I am not kidding and no not tears of joy. It definitely takes you to dark places but will leave you feeling good and moved by the actors and story. A must see show.\n\nFull disclosure - I saw this when it was in previews, so I can't speak to the musical's details (as they might change), BUT the music of \"Bright Star\" is absolutely infectious. The story has its ups and downs (emotionally and quality-wise), though Carmen Cusack (who plays Alice Murphy) anchors the whole show and gives the show a full-hearted, earthy feel. If you don't like bluegrass music, you probably won't like this show, but it's absolutely worth seeing if you love theater.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "'If you knew my story, you'd have a good story to tell,' sings Alice (Carmen Cusack) in the introductory number of Bright Star. But would you know how to tell it? That's where Steve Martin and Edie Brickell, cowriters of this gawky tall tale, fall short...Bright Star aspires to be what the older Alice asks from a young fiction writer (A.J. Shively): 'a sweeping tale of pain and redemption.' But it cries out for an editor's sharp blue pen. Sweeping? In lieu of the color that the story seems to call for, Walter Bobbie's production is often actively plain, as though trying to hide its central bathos in beige. Painful? For the audience, perhaps, thanks to shoddy craftsmanship that saddles likable, plucky bluegrass music with lyrics that run from workmanlike to egregious. It does, however, have a genuine redeeming feature in Cusack...Cusack is distinctive and immediately interesting, convincing at playing Alice at both ages, with a voice that is full of beautiful surprises.",
