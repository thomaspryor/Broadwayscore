  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Martin’s book contains many a welcome chuckle. Rob Berman’s music direction and vocal arrangements give the show the hint of a Broadway sound while maintaining the country feel...Anyone who watches soap operas will see where the story is going, but watching the elements fall into place is satisfying...Without a cynical note to be heard, 'Bright Star' is a warm and fuzzy, rose-coloured show for those who like to leave theatre with a smile.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review offers qualified praise with positive elements (chuckles, satisfying plotting, warm feeling) but frames it as niche appeal ('for those who like to leave theatre with a smile'). The predictable plot acknowledgment and conditional recommendation suggest lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's humor, satisfying story, and overall feel-good nature, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning indicates potential cherry-picking, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"welcome chuckle\" and \"satisfying\", and concludes that it is a \"warm and fuzzy\" show for those who want to leave with a smile. However, due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the book's humor and music direction, acknowledges the predictable plot but finds the execution satisfying, and explicitly recommends the show as a warm, smile-inducing experience.",
