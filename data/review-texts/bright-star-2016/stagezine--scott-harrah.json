    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Critic praises multiple elements (choreography, cast, lead performance) but explicitly identifies significant flaws (lyrics, predictable plot, paper-thin material). The phrase 'if one overlooks' suggests conditional recommendation despite problems. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights positive elements like choreography, direction, and a standout lead performance, but also notes issues with lyrics and plot predictability. The overall tone suggests a recommendation with reservations. | Gemini: The review highlights positive aspects like choreography, cast, and Cusack's performance, but also points out flaws in the lyrics and plot. The recommendation is conditional, suggesting a positive experience if these flaws are overlooked. | Kimi: The critic praises the energetic choreography, direction, and Cusack's breakout performance while criticizing the repetitious lyrics and predictable plot, offering a qualified recommendation to enjoy the saga if one overlooks the material weaknesses.",
