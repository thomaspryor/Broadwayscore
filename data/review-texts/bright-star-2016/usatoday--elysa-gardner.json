The final verdict is supportive. | GPT-4o: The review highlights positive aspects such as the smart, funny, and charming book, while acknowledging some challenges with the score and tone. The overall tone suggests a positive recommendation with some reservations. The excerpt is limited, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive aspects (forthright book, old-school spirit) and reservations (score challenges, tone wobbles). The concluding statement suggests a positive, but not rave, assessment. | Kimi: The critic praises the book as 'smart, funny and charming' and concludes the show 'holds its own,' but notes significant issues with the score and tonal consistency, resulting in a qualified recommendation.",
