However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Steve Martin's talent and the conception of \"Bright Star\", suggesting a positive view of the show. However, due to the limited text and excerpt-only nature, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt validates Steve Martin's multifaceted talent and the show's artistic conception, indicating a clearly positive assessment, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
