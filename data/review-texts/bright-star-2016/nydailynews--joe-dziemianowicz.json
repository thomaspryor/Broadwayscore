However, notes repetitive score and pacing issues. Praises lead performance 'even when show doesn't shine.' Balanced positives and negatives suggest mixed verdict. Low confidence due to excerpt-only format. | GPT-4o: The review praises the cast and describes the show as 'sweet and tender,' but also notes repetitiveness and areas for improvement. The overall tone suggests a mixed reception, with positive elements but significant reservations. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, noting the show is \"sweet and tender\" and has a \"fine cast.\" However, it also mentions repetitiveness and suggests it could be shorter, indicating reservations. | Kimi: The critic praises the 'fine cast' and 'sweet and tender' tone but notes significant flaws including a repetitive score, pacing issues, and that the show 'isn't a bullseye,' ultimately finding the production inconsistent.",
