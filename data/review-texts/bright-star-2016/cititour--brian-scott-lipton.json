The single excerpt suggests a negative overall verdict. | Gemini: The review praises Cusack's performance and the score, but criticizes the libretto and expresses a reluctance to see the show again, indicating a mixed overall impression. | Kimi: Despite praising the lead performance as 'flawless' and the score as pleasing, the critic explicitly states they could not endure a second viewing and implies the soundtrack is a better investment than the stage production, constituting a negative recommendation.",
