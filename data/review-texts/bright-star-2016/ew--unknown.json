  "bwwExcerpt": "It's Martin and Brickell's music that's the brightest star in Bright Star. The bluegrass sounds compliment the show's setting and era, Americana music with layered harmonies and beautiful use of banjo and fiddle. Not every song is a winner, but there are stirring ballads and toe-tapping numbers throughout that audience members will enjoy.",
