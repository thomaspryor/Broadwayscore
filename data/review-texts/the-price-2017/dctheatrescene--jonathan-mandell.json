  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"DeVito’s character is the most enjoyable but not a central one in Miller’s sober family drama in a cast that also includes Ruffalo, Hecht and Shalhoub. If none are at their absolute best here, that only means that all of them at one time or another have given performances that have left me in awe...The play also feels dated...People of any era should be able to respond to the themes, but the particulars, at least in this production, make it feel too distant to strike home with full force.\"\n\nRead more",
