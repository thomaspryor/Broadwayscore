  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Ruffalo does his best Brando imitation. DeVito breaks the tension with his savagely hilarious portrayal. Hecht is perfectly needy...It is Shalhoub who you cannot take your eyes off of. His vulnerability in admitting his failure and wanting to make this relationship right are at the heart and soul of this play. Director Kinney’s doesn’t manage to bring this play forward. There are moments that the show seems overly long, and he doesn’t manage to bring the actors all into the same play.”\n\nRead more",
