  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Shalhoub is superb as the smooth-talking Walter...The role of Esther fits Hecht like a glove and she gives one of her best performances in years. Casting DeVito as Solomon was a stroke of genius…Ruffalo does not seem entirely comfortable in the role of Victor, although his performance improves as the play progresses…Kinney has taken the play at face value, rather than attempting to force his stamp upon it. Miller doesn’t need gimmicks.”\n\nRead more",
