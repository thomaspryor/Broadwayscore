  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Shalboub and Hecht are Broadway regulars and can do no wrong. They’re excellent, as expected, and they’re there to keep the boat afloat. They do more than that. You can’t take your eyes off of them. But it’s Mark Ruffalo and Danny DeVito who we’re looking at. 'The Price' offers a bit of comedy in the first act, and DeVito delivers it as if he’s a little cherry bomb...Terry Kinney directs, sharply as ever. There will be lots of awards talk for everyone involved.\"\n\nRead more",
