  "bwwExcerpt": "The portrait that emerges – Manhattan Theatre Club's 'The Columnist' opened Thursday at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre – should send a chill down the spine of any pundit who begins to think he or she is bigger than the story. Director Daniel Sullivan has tried to make each scene stand on its own, but the result is a play that may be more fun to perform than watch.",
