  "fullText": "One of the most famous abduction cases in Dutch history is brought to the bigscreen in this ambitious thriller-drama.\n\nOne of the most famous abduction cases in Dutch history is brought to the bigscreen in writer-director Maarten Treurniet’s “The Heineken Kidnapping.” Pic not only casts Rutger Hauer in the role of the beer mogul-turned-abductee but intriguingly contrasts this world-weary, intelligent and filthy-rich entrepreneur with the youngest of his kidnappers. Though it somewhat struggles to keep things character-focused in the second half, Treurniet’s ambitious thriller-drama was a respectable hit at home last fall, and packs enough commercial elements for some niche biz abroad. MPI Media Group guzzled up U.S. rights.\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Michael J. Fox Says Retiring in 2020 Was 'Non-Emotional' and Finally Acting Again Is 'Not the Beginning of Any Campaign to Reestablish My Career'\n\nIn early 1980s Amsterdam, young and reckless Rem (Reinout Scholten van Aschat) overhears arrangements for a crime and wants in on the job. This creates friction with lowlife Cor (Gijs Naber), the self-appointed leader of a group that also includes the religious Frans (Teun Kuilboer) and funnyman Jan (Korneel Evers). Their proposed kidnapping of brewski baron Alfred Heineken (Hauer) is particularly fitting for Rem, since the boy’s meek father (Ton Kas), who worked at Heineken, was laid off for having become, irony of ironies, an alcoholic.\n\nThough they’re far from professional criminals, the schemers figure out a way to abduct their target and his chauffeur, and lock them up in a storage building in an industrial area of the capital. Though Treurniet, who co-wrote the screenplay with crime novelist Kees van Beijnum, takes ample time to illustrate the planning and execution of the crime, he also builds in enough moments to develop the personalities of polar opposites Heineken and Rem; the supporting characters are more perfunctorily drawn.\n\nThe hardened captain of industry is unaccustomed to not getting what he wants and having people tell him what to do, and his world is turned inside out when he realizes he’s powerless regarding these vicious, masked kidnappers. Rem, barely out of his teens, is charged with watching over Heineken, and lets the responsibility go to his head, allowing a sadistic streak to surface. Hauer, in his first substantial Dutch-language perf in years, and relative newcomer Scholten van Aschat (son of “Tirza” thesp Gijs) easily hold their own, and the two have great chemistry, mostly of the magnetic-repulsion kind.\n\nProduction and costume design, as well as hair and makeup, nail the now-ridiculous early ’80s look without sacrificing dramatic credibility, while the score by Tom Holkenborg (aka Junkie XL) delivers a full-blown, old-fashioned score that helps drive things along.\n\nFor the record, Rem is a composite character, and the pic is prefaced by a statement that “fact and fiction are blended together.” This was likely added to avoid further legal action from the real kidnappers, who were afraid their reputations would be damaged if they were depicted as more violent than the historical record reflects.",
