    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises Lithgow's 'powerhouse performance' and finds the character 'fascinating,' indicating positive reception. However, confidence is low due to limited text from a curated excerpt that may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises John Lithgow's performance, describing it as 'powerhouse' and the character as 'fascinating.' However, the single excerpt warning suggests this may not represent the full review sentiment, leading to a cautious, mildly positive score. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a strong performance by John Lithgow, suggesting a positive aspect of the show. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation strength, so I've placed it in the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains clearly positive evaluative language ('powerhouse performance', 'fascinating character study'), warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket per guidance for cherry-picked excerpts.",
