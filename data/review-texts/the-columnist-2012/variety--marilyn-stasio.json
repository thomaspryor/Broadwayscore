    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performance ('powerhouse') with compelling character analysis. Single excerpt limits confidence, but positive language suggests recommendation despite only having performer assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises John Lithgow's performance as a 'powerhouse' and describes the character as 'fascinating,' suggesting a positive view of the show. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment is uncertain, leading to a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses solely on Lithgow's performance, describing it as a \"powerhouse.\" While this is positive, it's difficult to gauge the overall recommendation without more context. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the positive bucket, leaning towards the higher end due to the strong praise, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear, strong praise ('powerhouse performance', 'fascinating character study') indicating a solid recommendation, though as a single curated quote it may not represent the full review's reservations.",
