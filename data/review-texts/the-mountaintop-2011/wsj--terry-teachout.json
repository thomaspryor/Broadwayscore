  "bwwExcerpt": "Even if you find 'The Mountaintop' too sticky to stomach, you'll admire the cut-to-the-chase directness with which Mr. Leon has staged it. David Gallo's hotel-room set undergoes a climactic transformation that is far more surprising than anything in Ms. Hall's script. Like Mr. Jackson's acting, the set would be worth paying to see if the play were good enough to be worth sitting through.",
