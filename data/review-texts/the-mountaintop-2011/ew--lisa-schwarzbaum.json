  "bwwExcerpt": "Hall's depiction of Dr. King is daring in its vulnerability, and the ideas she explores, through King's conversation with Camae, are provocative, mature, sometimes even dark...toward the end, when we feel like we know everything, the playwright digs deeper and The Mountaintop somehow becomes more majestic, inviting each of us in the audience to join the ascent as we see fit.",
