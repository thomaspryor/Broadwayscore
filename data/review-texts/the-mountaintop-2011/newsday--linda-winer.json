  "bwwExcerpt": "It's a relief, not to mention a thrill, to report that Katori Hall's 'The Mountaintop' -- which arrives with powerful fistfuls of sparky chemistry between Samuel L. Jackson and Angela Bassett -- crackles with theatricality and a humanity more moving than sainthood...There is an up-close-and-personal intimacy in director Kenny Leon's sure-handed production.",
