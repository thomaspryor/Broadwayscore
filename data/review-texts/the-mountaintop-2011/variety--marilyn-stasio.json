  "bwwExcerpt": "Unlike those warts-and-all biodramas that humiliate the celebrated figures they profess to humanize, Katori Hall's imaginative two-hander 'The Mountaintop' does, indeed, burnish the legend of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Set in Memphis on the eve of his assassination, this soul-stirring drama finds King confiding his doubts, fears and morbid premonitions to a sassy motel maid -- a deceptively trite situation that Hall transforms into an emotionally powerful and theatrically stunning moment of truth. Factor in the double dose of charisma from certifiable stars Samuel L. Jackson and Angela Bassett, and this show has wings.",
