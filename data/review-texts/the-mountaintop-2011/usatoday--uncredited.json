  "bwwExcerpt": "The play, which earned its author the Olivier Award in London, aims to put King's legacy in perspective for anyone who takes the struggles and accomplishments of various human rights movements for granted. It's an admirable goal, but one suspects that at least some Olivier voters were more enamored of Hall's spirit than her execution...The play ends on a lofty note, providing both Jackson and Bassett ambitious, lyrical monologues. Still, the actors, and certainly the subject, deserve a higher plane than The Moutaintop provides.",
