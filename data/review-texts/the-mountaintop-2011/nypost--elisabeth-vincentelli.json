  "bwwExcerpt": "Considering one of the characters is a civil-rights hero, the 90-minute two-hander has some surprisingly corny moments. But the finale offers a fantastic pay-off that ranks among the most exhilarating 10 minutes of the year. The path to the peak may be uneven, but the view from there is worth it.",
