  "bwwExcerpt": "The show's production team has asked reviewers not to reveal any plot twists, but let's just say it turns what had previously been a mediocre biodrama into a ridiculous embarrassment. Jackson convincingly highlights King's smoothness as well as his insecurities. If not much else, 'The Mountaintop' leaves its audience hungry for a more substantial play about King.",
