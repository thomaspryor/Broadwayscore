  "bwwExcerpt": "Amid much banter, the play fails to shed any new light on the subject. It's been thoroughly documented that King was a flawed man, and as portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, he does emerge wonderfully human. However, any revelations about his thoughts, his motivations and fears all stem from the author's invention and fantasy, and it gets weird.",
