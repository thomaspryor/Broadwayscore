  "bwwExcerpt": "It is as audacious as it is inventive — a simple premise that allows Hall to create a fictional universe of her own with a historical giant. It is also somewhat sacrilegious, showing the fleshy, banal side of a civil rights saint, which is partly the playwright's goal, too...The inevitable standing ovations after the play are for King as much as for the actors and Hall.",
