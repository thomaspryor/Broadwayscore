  "bwwExcerpt": "This won the Olivier Award for best new play? The question kept flashing through my mind while sitting through 'The Mountaintop,' Katori Hall's two-character fantasy set on the night before Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in 1968...It doesn't help that Bassett delivers such an exaggerated performance, it's hard to believe her as a real person. Fortunately, Jackson underplays King and convincingly conveys the icon's charismatic public persona and his private, fallible side.",
