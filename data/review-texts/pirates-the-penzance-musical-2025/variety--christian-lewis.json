  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"There might be a few bumpy waves in this piratical adaptation, but the booty is well-worth the effort. Even though it is unlikely to spur a trend of Gilbert and Sullivan revivals, this production wholly justifies itself, providing a hearty dose of musical comedy fun and absolutely earning the exclamation point of its title.\"",

The enthusiastic tone and clear recommendation warrant upper-positive range, but single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'wholly justifies itself' and 'providing a hearty dose of musical comedy fun', indicating a strong positive recommendation despite some minor issues. The single excerpt warning suggests using the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review states that the \"booty is well-worth the effort\" and that the production \"wholly justifies itself\", indicating a positive recommendation. The phrase \"hearty dose of musical comedy fun\" further supports this classification. | Kimi: Single excerpt demonstrates a clear recommendation with strong praise ('wholly justifies itself', 'absolutely earning'), though noting minor reservations ('bumpy waves').",
