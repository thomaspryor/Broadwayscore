    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Negative) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise ('jolly enough') undermined by significant criticism ('sweaty quality', 'hopelessly at odds'). The damning comparison to the original suggests disappointment, placing this in mixed territory rather than positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a mixed reaction, noting a mismatch between the production's energy and the original's style. The lack of full context and single excerpt warning suggest caution in interpretation. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the production as having a \"sweaty quality, bordering on frenzy\" which is \"at odds with the cool wit of the original\", indicating a negative assessment. Given that this is the only excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show is 'jolly enough' but delivers a clear negative verdict, finding the production 'hopelessly at odds' with the source material's essence and criticizing its 'sweaty' desperation. Given this is a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the language suggests a do-not-recommend stance. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Negative, kimi=Negative",
