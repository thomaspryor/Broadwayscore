    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt acknowledges some merit ('jolly enough') but expresses significant criticism about the production's tone being 'hopelessly at odds' with the source material. The phrase 'hopelessly at odds' suggests fundamental problems, placing this in mixed territory rather than positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed review, noting a mismatch between the production's tone and the original's wit. The single excerpt and lack of full context necessitate a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses a negative sentiment, contrasting the current production unfavorably with the original. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers faint praise ('jolly enough') but emphasizes a fundamental flaw: the production's frenetic energy clashes 'hopelessly' with the source material's wit. Without a clear recommendation or additional context, this reads as a mixed assessment finding the execution lacking despite some entertainment value.",
