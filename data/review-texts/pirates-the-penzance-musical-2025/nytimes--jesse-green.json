Single excerpt warning applies - may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the production for being at odds with the original's wit, despite praising David Hyde Pierce's performance. The overall tone suggests disappointment with the production. | Gemini: The review praises David Hyde Pierce's performance but criticizes the overall production's \"sweaty quality,\" suggesting a mixed assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While the critic praises David Hyde Pierce's performance as 'marvelous,' the excerpt describes the production as having a 'sweaty quality, bordering on frenzy' that is 'hopelessly at odds with the cool wit of the original,' indicating a fundamental failure of the production concept despite the strong central turn.",
