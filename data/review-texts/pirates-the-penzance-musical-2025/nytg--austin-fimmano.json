  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Pirates! The Penzance Musical comes with a stacked cast and a nearly 150-year history of Broadway adaptations. With such an iconic piece of theatre, any change is bound to stir the pot. But perhaps what makes this version such a smash is that at its core, it's exactly what Gilbert and Sullivan created the original to be: a fun, silly, nonsensical laugh with the lightest plot and a great big happy ending to wrap it all up.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it 'such a smash' and praises how it captures the spirit of the original. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is reduced as this may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as a 'smash' and highlights its fun and entertaining nature, indicating a strong positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language like \"smash,\" \"fun,\" \"silly,\" and \"happy ending,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given that it is a single excerpt, I am placing the score in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic calls the production a 'smash' and praises it for successfully delivering the lighthearted, silly entertainment intended by the original creators, though as a single excerpt, the full context remains unclear.",
