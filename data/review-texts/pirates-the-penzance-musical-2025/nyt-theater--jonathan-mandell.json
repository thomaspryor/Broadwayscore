    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises performances as 'exciting' despite criticizing the production as merely 'tweaked', suggesting a qualified positive recommendation focused on the acting. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the production is not significantly changed but allows for 'exciting performances'. The lack of a strong positive or negative tone and the limited context lead to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive view due to the \"exciting performances,\" but the \"tweaked\" comment indicates reservations. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: While faintly praising the production as merely 'tweaked' rather than fully reimagined, the critic highlights 'exciting performances' as a clear positive, suggesting a qualified but genuine recommendation focused on the acting.",
