  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"If the cast seems instructed to play just a tad broadly, and hit the jokes a touch to hard, and the second act runs a bit too long, well, the overzealousness does little to dampen the overall joyous vibe. And just when things might start to lag, Pierce arrives, nailing every pun, every aside to the audience, every double-take and every droll observation. He's a treasure.\""
