    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear recommendation ('should not keep you away') with enthusiastic language ('so much joy and fun', 'altogether delightful'). Despite mentioning 'quibbles', the overall verdict is strongly positive. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the tone is unambiguously recommendatory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses strong enthusiasm for the production, highlighting 'joy and fun' and calling it 'altogether delightful.' The mention of 'quibbles' suggests minor reservations, but the overall tone is highly positive. | Gemini: The excerpt ends with a clear recommendation to see the show despite some 'quibbles,' indicating a positive review. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly urges audiences to see the show despite acknowledged 'quibbles,' praising it as 'altogether delightful' with abundant 'joy and fun,' indicating a clear positive recommendation.",
