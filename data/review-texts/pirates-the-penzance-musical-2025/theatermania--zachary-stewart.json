  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Rather than a slave of duty, Pirates! is the servant of too many masters: Gilbert & Sullivan, Dixieland jazz, milquetoast liberalism, and the tourism lobby New Orleans & Company, which \"kindly sponsored\" this production. The recipe is for a jambalaya of disparate flavors that come together in delicious harmony. The finished product is operetta as political compromise, in which everyone gets a little taste of what they want, but never enough to be truly satisfied.\"",

The truncated text and lack of a clear recommendation lead to a 'low' confidence score. | Kimi: The excerpt suggests the production attempts to accommodate diverse tastes but delivers only partial fulfillment, resulting in a middling experience that neither fully recommends nor completely rejects the show.",
