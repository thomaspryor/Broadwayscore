    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('exquisitely funny', 'meticulously concocted') suggesting clear praise, but single excerpt warning requires caution about full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('exquisitely funny', 'meticulously concocted'), suggesting a highly favorable view of the production. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt uses very positive language such as \"exquisitely funny\" and \"meticulously concocted\", suggesting a strong recommendation. Given the single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('exquisitely funny,' 'meticulously concocted'), suggesting a strong recommendation. However, given this is a curated excerpt that may not represent the full review's reservations or overall verdict, the score falls in the upper range of Positive rather than Rave.",
