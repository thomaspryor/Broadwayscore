This is a qualified assessment that acknowledges effort without recommending. Single excerpt warning applies - low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the musical as a 'decent, earnest effort' but notes it 'never quite achieves the emotional heights' of the film, indicating a mixed reception. With only one excerpt available, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review describes the show as \"decent\" and \"earnest\" but ultimately falling short of its source material, indicating a mixed assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers qualified praise ('decent, earnest effort') but emphasizes a significant shortcoming ('never quite achieves the emotional heights'), suggesting a middling verdict without clear recommendation or rejection.",
