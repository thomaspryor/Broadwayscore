    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic praises the production's 'clarity and emotional precision' and calls the source material a 'masterpiece.' However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the production's clarity and emotional precision, suggesting a highly positive reception. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"masterpiece,\" \"clarity,\" and \"emotional precision,\" suggesting a positive recommendation. However, because it is a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the production as emotionally precise and clear, referring to the source material as a 'masterpiece'—indicating strong approval. However, as a single curated excerpt, the full context of the review is unavailable.",
