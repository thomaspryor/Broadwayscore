    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for the production's clarity and emotional precision, calling the source material a 'masterpiece.' However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt limitation and lack of broader verdict context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's clarity and emotional precision, suggesting a high level of performance quality. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"masterpiece,\" \"clarity,\" and \"emotional precision,\" suggesting a positive recommendation. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong unqualified praise for the production's performances and emotional precision. However, as a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced and the score reflects the upper range of Positive rather than Rave.",
