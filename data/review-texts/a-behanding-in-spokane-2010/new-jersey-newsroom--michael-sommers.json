  "bwwExcerpt": "One very sick yet awfully funny play, 'A Behanding in Spokane' stars Christopher Walken as a scary guy dead set on finding the forelimb he lost as a boy. Anyone squeamish or especially politically correct should skip the new Broadway play that premiered on Thursday at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre. Racial slurs and moldering body parts fly all over the place. Otherwise snare an adults-only ticket. Showcased at his spookiest best as a one-handed weirdo, Walken is hilarious and the sharply-staged comedy-thriller he haunts packs 90 minutes of nasty entertainment.",
