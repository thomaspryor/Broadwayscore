  "bwwExcerpt": "There's not much to Martin McDonagh's 'A Behanding in Spokane.' While this 90-minute exercise in hilarious terror shares the brutality and pitch-black humor of the Irish playwright's previous works, it doesn't have anything to say about the country of its setting (as his Gaelic-centric plays, such as 'The Beauty Queen of Leenane' and 'The Lieutenant of Inishmore,' do) or the nature of storytelling (the theme of 'The Pillowman'). It just seems as if McDonagh picked a spot on a map of the U.S. that sounded intriguing for the title, then put a psycho in a hotel room with two incredibly stupid crooks and an equally dim-bulb night clerk. Then he stirred in some Tarantino/Coen brothers–style gore, a dash of existential angst, a smattering of pop-culture references (heavy on 'The Night of the Hunter'), and hoped for a box-office hit.",
