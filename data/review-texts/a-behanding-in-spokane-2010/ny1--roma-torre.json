  "bwwExcerpt": "If “Saturday Night Live” allowed foul language, and Christopher Walken happened to be the guest host one week, I could easily imagine the writers brainstorming the idea for a send-up of a Martin McDonagh play. They'd call it 'A Behanding in Spokane' and it would feature McDonagh's signature elements: violence, body parts, and ghoulish humor. Of course 'Behanding...' is actually McDonagh's latest work to open on Broadway. And while I can't exactly say it's a bad play, it's just not a play at all.",
