  "bwwExcerpt": "If “Saturday Night Live” allowed foul language, and Christopher Walken happened to be the guest host one week, I could easily imagine the writers brainstorming the idea for a send-up of a Martin McDonagh play. They'd call it 'A Behanding in Spokane' and it would feature McDonagh's signature elements: violence, body parts, and ghoulish humor. Of course 'Behanding...' is actually McDonagh's latest work to open on Broadway. And while I can't exactly say it's a bad play, it's just not a play at all.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic dismisses the work as 'not a play at all' and compares it to an SNL parody sketch. Despite saying it's 'not exactly bad,' the overall assessment is negative. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that the play lacks substance or coherence, implying a negative verdict despite not being outright dismissive. The comparison to a parody and the statement that it's 'just not a play at all' indicates a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The critic states that the play is \"not a play at all\", which indicates a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is medium. | Kimi: The critic compares the work to an SNL sketch parody and fundamentally denies it qualifies as a play, suggesting it lacks dramatic substance and seriousness despite featuring the playwright's signature elements.",
