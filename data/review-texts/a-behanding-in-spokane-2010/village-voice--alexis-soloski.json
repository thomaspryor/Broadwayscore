  "bwwExcerpt": "This is McDonagh's first play set in America and his second, after The Pillowman, not located in his native Ireland. He takes to certain of our idioms ('a coon's age,' 'y'know,' 'motherfucker'), but A Behanding lacks the lyricism of his earlier works. It also lacks their substance. That no one dies is not the only reason this amusing, harmless piece proves less affecting than any of his previous works. Instead of making the door to this hotel room one of the 'ten thousand several,' McDonagh has merely hung a metaphorical 'Do Not Disturb' sign on it.",
