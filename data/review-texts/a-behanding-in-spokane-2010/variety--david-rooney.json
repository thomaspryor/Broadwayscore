  "bwwExcerpt": "While McDonagh's previous stage works reportedly were written in a sustained burst of early-career productivity, 'Spokane' was penned following completion of his 2008 feature debut as writer-director, 'In Bruges.' It feels here as if the playwright is catering to his fans' expectations -- the gruesome flourishes and blithe violence, the lacerating dialogue and savage humor, the maniacal characters and explosive confrontations -- but in sketch form rather than a full-bodied play. All the same, many will be delighted with what he serves up.",
