  "bwwExcerpt": "While McDonagh's previous stage works reportedly were written in a sustained burst of early-career productivity, 'Spokane' was penned following completion of his 2008 feature debut as writer-director, 'In Bruges.' It feels here as if the playwright is catering to his fans' expectations -- the gruesome flourishes and blithe violence, the lacerating dialogue and savage humor, the maniacal characters and explosive confrontations -- but in sketch form rather than a full-bodied play. All the same, many will be delighted with what he serves up.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt criticizes the play as feeling like 'sketch form rather than a full-bodied play' and suggests McDonagh is 'catering to expectations,' but acknowledges 'many will be delighted.' Single excerpt warning applies - this balanced assessment with significant reservations points to Mixed range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that while the play may feel incomplete, it still delivers elements that fans will enjoy, indicating a positive but qualified recommendation. The limited text and single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious approach, leading to a lower-end Positive score. | Gemini: The review suggests the play is not fully realized but that fans will still enjoy it. This indicates a mixed reaction. | Kimi: While criticizing the work as a 'sketch' that caters to fan expectations rather than a full-bodied play, the critic concludes that audiences will be delighted, indicating a mildly positive, qualified recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Positive, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
