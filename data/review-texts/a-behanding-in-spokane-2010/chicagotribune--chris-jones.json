  "bwwExcerpt": "The latest Broadway play from Martin McDonagh lands somewhere between 'Pulp Fiction' and an extended star-driven sketch from 'Saturday Night Live.' We already knew that McDonagh ('The Beauty Queen of Leenane,' 'Pillowman') writes with remarkable facility in the self-aware, neo-gothic, Tarantino-esque style. But the formative devil has become more formatively devilish. 'A Behanding in Spokane' reveals a more comic and happily anarchic side of this irreverent Irish writer, who consumed American noir as a youth in far greater quantity than Kerrygold butter.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows appreciation for McDonagh's evolution and comic development, but with only one curated quote available, the full verdict is unclear. The positive language about revealing a 'more comic' side suggests approval, but this could be setup rather than final recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises McDonagh's writing style and highlights the play's comic and anarchic qualities, suggesting a positive reception. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context necessitate a low confidence level. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the play's style and influences but doesn't offer a clear recommendation. The comparison to 'Saturday Night Live' suggests a mixed quality. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for McDonagh's 'remarkable facility' and the play's 'happily anarchic' tone, indicating a positive assessment. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced despite the favorable language.",
