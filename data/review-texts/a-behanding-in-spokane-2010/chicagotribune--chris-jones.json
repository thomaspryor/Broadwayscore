  "bwwExcerpt": "The latest Broadway play from Martin McDonagh lands somewhere between 'Pulp Fiction' and an extended star-driven sketch from 'Saturday Night Live.' We already knew that McDonagh ('The Beauty Queen of Leenane,' 'Pillowman') writes with remarkable facility in the self-aware, neo-gothic, Tarantino-esque style. But the formative devil has become more formatively devilish. 'A Behanding in Spokane' reveals a more comic and happily anarchic side of this irreverent Irish writer, who consumed American noir as a youth in far greater quantity than Kerrygold butter.",
