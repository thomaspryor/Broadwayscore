  "bwwExcerpt": "What’s to savor here, then? Two words: Christopher Walken. Who cares whether or not Carmichael was written with his eccentric delivery in mind; Walken can retune any text to his dissonant, syncopated key. Innocuous lines become menacing, and psychotic remarks provoke giggles. Carmichael’s true nature or motive is never revealed, but then no one bothered making him a real character; we’re just enjoying a beloved film star who can get laughs from his zombie stare and demented, wistful phrasing.",
