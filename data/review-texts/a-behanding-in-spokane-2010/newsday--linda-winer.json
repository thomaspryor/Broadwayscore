  "bwwExcerpt": "The matchup of Walken, unpredictably creepy American actor, and Martin McDonagh, virtuosically gruesome Irish playwright, has finally occurred. And it's as perfect a frisson as it always was meant to be - except for one problem. The play is really not good. 'A Behanding in Spokane,' the 90-minute McDonagh world premiere that lured Walken back for a rare stage appearance, is so thin, trivial and underdeveloped that the humor depends on two separate scenes of characters throwing severed hands at one another.",
