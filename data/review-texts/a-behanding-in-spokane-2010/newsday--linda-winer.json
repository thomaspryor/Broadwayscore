  "bwwExcerpt": "The matchup of Walken, unpredictably creepy American actor, and Martin McDonagh, virtuosically gruesome Irish playwright, has finally occurred. And it's as perfect a frisson as it always was meant to be - except for one problem. The play is really not good. 'A Behanding in Spokane,' the 90-minute McDonagh world premiere that lured Walken back for a rare stage appearance, is so thin, trivial and underdeveloped that the humor depends on two separate scenes of characters throwing severed hands at one another.",

This is a negative recommendation where performer appeal doesn't redeem fundamental flaws. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the play as 'thin, trivial and underdeveloped,' indicating a negative assessment. The presence of Walken and McDonagh is noted but does not redeem the play's shortcomings. | Gemini: Despite the positive setup regarding Walken and McDonagh, the review explicitly states \"the play is really not good\" and describes it as \"thin, trivial, and underdeveloped.\" This indicates a negative assessment. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
