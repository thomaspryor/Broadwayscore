  "bwwExcerpt": "Christopher Walken has an eccentric charisma, his hangdog, sorrowful demeanor spiked with a twisted kind of charm. The mix is a perfect fit for Martin McDonagh's particular brand of macabre comedy. That Walken is the main attraction of the playwright's new 'A Behanding in Spokane' is obvious -- the other night, the audience erupted into guffaws every time the star opened his mouth... But the play is on cruise control, and not even Walken can save it.",
