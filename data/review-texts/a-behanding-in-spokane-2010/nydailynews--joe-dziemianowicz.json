  "bwwExcerpt": "Walken's performance is amazing, the stuff Tony Awards are made of. Using his silky voice and haunting eyes, he's spectacularly spooky and funny as Carmichael, a lone-fisted oddball searching for his hand, which, so he says, was severed by hooligans. As if to add insult to injury, the thugs waved goodbye to him with his own purloined paw. That sickly hilarious image is trademark McDonagh, an Irish writer whose credits include the plays 'The Pillowman' and 'The Lieutenant of Inishmore,' and the film 'In Bruges.' 'Spokane,' like those works, has twists and turns and a sense that something awful is around the next bend. It plays out for 90 minutes in a roach hotel rendered to cracked-plaster perfection by Scott Pask, who also did the shrewd costumes.",
