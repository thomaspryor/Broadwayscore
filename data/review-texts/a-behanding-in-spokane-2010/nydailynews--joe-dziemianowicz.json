  "bwwExcerpt": "Walken's performance is amazing, the stuff Tony Awards are made of. Using his silky voice and haunting eyes, he's spectacularly spooky and funny as Carmichael, a lone-fisted oddball searching for his hand, which, so he says, was severed by hooligans. As if to add insult to injury, the thugs waved goodbye to him with his own purloined paw. That sickly hilarious image is trademark McDonagh, an Irish writer whose credits include the plays 'The Pillowman' and 'The Lieutenant of Inishmore,' and the film 'In Bruges.' 'Spokane,' like those works, has twists and turns and a sense that something awful is around the next bend. It plays out for 90 minutes in a roach hotel rendered to cracked-plaster perfection by Scott Pask, who also did the shrewd costumes.",

  "fullText": "Deadpan Christopher Walken injects life into Martin McDonagh's arresting 'A Behanding in Spokane'\n\nFriday, March 5th 2010, 4:00 AM\n\nThrough June 6, Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, 236 W. 45th St., Tickets: $61.50-$116.50; (212) 239-6200\n\nChristopher Walken is famous for bringing an unsettling mix of velvet and violence to every role he plays.\n\nThat arresting blend comes in handy in Martin McDonagh's wee but wildly entertaining black comedy, \"A Behanding in Spokane,\" now in its world premiere at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre.\n\nWalken's performance is amazing, the stuff Tony Awards are made of. Using his silky voice and haunting eyes, he's spectacularly spooky and funny as Carmichael, a lone-fisted oddball searching for his hand, which, so he says, was severed by hooligans.\n\nAs if to add insult to injury, the thugs waved goodbye to him with his own purloined paw.\n\nThat sickly hilarious image is trademark McDonagh, an Irish writer whose credits include the plays \"The Pillowman\" and \"The Lieutenant of Inishmore,\" and the film \"In Bruges.\"\n\n\"Spokane,\" like those works, has twists and turns and a sense that something awful is around the next bend. It plays out for 90 minutes in a roach hotel rendered to cracked-plaster perfection by Scott Pask, who also did the shrewd costumes.\n\nThis rented room in smalltown USA is where Marilyn and Toby (Zoe Kazan and Anthony Mackie), a couple of pot dealers and small-time grifters, try to outsmart Carmichael and get themselves into deep doodoo.\n\nA super Sam Rockwell (\"The Green Mile\") completes the cast as Mervyn, the receptionist who's drawn into the drama and reveals his own bizarre bent.\n\nTo reveal the plot would spoil things, though a loaded gun, a lit candle and a can of gasoline ramp up the danger. But it's McDonagh's incendiary and very un-PC humor that's truly explosive.\n\nWhen Walken isn't onstage, the play does seem to spin its wheels. There's time to notice the rampant profanity turning into slush, the gaping holes in the plot and gaps in logic. For instance, would a white-trash dope dealer like Marilyn use a dainty word like \"mightn't\"? Think not.\n\nBest just to sit back and let this raucous ride directed by John Crowley take you along.\n\nAnd to accept that McDonagh is a writer who likes exploring disconnects in people. Like the cat-loving, cold-blooded terrorist of \"Inishmore,\" Carmichael is a whacked-out creep, but he's also a devoted son.\n\nHumanity lurks in the oddest places. McDonagh noted that in his Irish comedies.\n\nNow, he's done it in this unruly American gothic.\n\nMiss Congeniality is now Oscars' Best Actress.\n\nRED CARPET RE-CAP: Best & Worst of Oscar fashion.\n\nFarrah Fawcett and Bea Arthur omitted from In Memoriam reel.\n\nKathryn Bigelow becomes the first woman to win a Best Director Oscar.\n\n\"If it was good enough for God... it's good enough for me,\" she tells audience.\n\nNearly 60 cops busted in past 10 years; where is the punishment?\n\nPakistanis say they've nabbed an American terrorist, but it's not California native Gadahn.\n\nHit in the head during a firefight in Afghanistan, pilot lands safely.\n\nMyers: Steelers QB accused of another sex assault; Giants eyed him in '04 draft.\n\nNo fish tale: Buttkiss the pacu tips the scales at more than 20 pounds and 23 inches.\n\nRep. Charles Rangel sought an endorsement, walked away with a rain check.\n\nSofia Vergara is just latest star to have a see-through moment.\n\nPint-sized protesters petition coming Catholic school closings at St. Patrick's.\n\nGet tickets to the upcoming game, show or event\nhere.\n\nUse of this website signifies your agreement to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. ©",
