  "bwwExcerpt": "Onscreen, Christopher Walken's oft-imitated shtick has veered into self-parody in recent years. But seeing it live is a whole other matter: On the evidence of his brilliant performance in Martin McDonagh's new play, 'A Behanding in Spokane,' the actor should have returned to the stage a long time ago. Fueling the evening with his endlessly entertaining physical mannerisms, offbeat comic timing and hilarious vocal inflections, Walken lifts this slight shaggy-dog story into the comic stratosphere. Add superb support by a blue-chip cast, including Sam Rockwell, Anthony Mackie and Zoe Kazan, and you have one of the most entertaining if bizarre offerings on Broadway.",

Single excerpt warning requires caution, but language is clearly positive. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt provides strong praise for Walken's performance and the supporting cast, describing the play as 'one of the most entertaining if bizarre offerings on Broadway.' This suggests a highly positive verdict. | Gemini: The review is overwhelmingly positive, praising Walken's performance and the support cast, calling it \"one of the most entertaining if bizarre offerings on Broadway.\" | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Walken's 'brilliant' lead performance and 'superb' supporting cast, calling the production 'one of the most entertaining' on Broadway, though it notes the material itself is 'slight.' Given this is a single curated excerpt, confidence is low, but the tone is clearly strong positive.",
