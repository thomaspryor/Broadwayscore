  "bwwExcerpt": "Onscreen, Christopher Walken's oft-imitated shtick has veered into self-parody in recent years. But seeing it live is a whole other matter: On the evidence of his brilliant performance in Martin McDonagh's new play, 'A Behanding in Spokane,' the actor should have returned to the stage a long time ago. Fueling the evening with his endlessly entertaining physical mannerisms, offbeat comic timing and hilarious vocal inflections, Walken lifts this slight shaggy-dog story into the comic stratosphere. Add superb support by a blue-chip cast, including Sam Rockwell, Anthony Mackie and Zoe Kazan, and you have one of the most entertaining if bizarre offerings on Broadway.",
