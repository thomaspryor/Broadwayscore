  "bwwExcerpt": "While all is not sunshine, lollipops and rainbows in Martin McDonagh's newest gruesome comedy, A Behanding In Spokane, it is, by the playwright's standards, considerably lighter fare. No cats or children are harmed, nobody's shot in the head at point-blank range and there are no pots of urine involved at any time during the playwright's first piece set in America. Yes, there are characters that have gasoline poured on them and are then threatened with a lighter, but in moments like that the real suspense lies in whether or not we're about to see a really cool special effect.",
