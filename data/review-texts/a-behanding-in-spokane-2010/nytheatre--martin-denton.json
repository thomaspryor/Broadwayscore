  "bwwExcerpt": "If only the play felt more consequential! I really don't have a clear handle on what A Behanding in Spokane is supposed to be about, beyond painting portraits of a couple of grotesquely obsessed losers. The play, just 90 minutes long, still overstays its welcome, and in at least one area—its politically incorrect depiction of Carmichael as an unredeemed racist—it doesn't so much push buttons as simply annoy. McDonagh seems less comfortable with American archetypes and dialect than with those of his native Ireland; the decision to set the play in America seems designed mostly to accommodate his American cast (and Walken uses a weird accent that sometimes sounds likes New Orleans and other times sounds like his trademark Hollywood drawl, so the specific locale is beside the point).",
