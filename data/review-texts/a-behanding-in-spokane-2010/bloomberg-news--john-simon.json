  "bwwExcerpt": "Even if, like me, you are no great fan of the Irish playwright Martin McDonagh, you will find “A Behanding in Spokane,” in which Christopher Walken makes a triumphant return to the Broadway stage, insane yet also fiendishly funny. McDonagh is a specialist in unleashed violence, in which he shamelessly revels. Here the violence is comical, and we are kept guessing throughout a farce that is as irresistible as it is improbable.",
