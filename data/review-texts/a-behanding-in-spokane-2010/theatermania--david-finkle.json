This indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises both the writing and direction, indicating a positive overall assessment, but without strong superlatives, it's a solid positive. | Kimi: Brief excerpt offers unqualified praise for both the writing ('hilarious and disturbing') and direction ('right blend'), indicating a strong recommendation despite the limited context.",
