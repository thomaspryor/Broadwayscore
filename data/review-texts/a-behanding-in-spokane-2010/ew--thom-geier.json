  "bwwExcerpt": "There is something delightfully, wickedly off about all four characters in Behanding, including Rockwell's Mervyn. 'I always used to hope they'd have one of those shooting massacres at my high school, didn't you?” he says at one point. 'They'd come in, y'know, as they do, dressed like soldiers, just to be different, and then I'd, y'know, do something brave and save everybody. Well, not everybody, else it wouldn't be a high school massacre, but maybe after they got, say, twelve?' And as McDonagh & Co. build the suspense toward what seems to be an inevitably explosive finale, we're forced to ponder why we too seem to be drawn to stories of extreme violence. How much does our collective curiosity about the extreme and the macabre fuel society's nuttiest members to act out their (and our) most out-there fantasies?",
