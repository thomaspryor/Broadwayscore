  "bwwExcerpt": "Slam poet Saul Williams is a galvanizing presence in his Broadway debut, playing a central role that can be taken as the author's voice. As John, he opens the evening in a prison cell, soon to be released after six years. 'My Block' offers his view of the violent and oppressive world he's returning to ('Now shit's constantly hot on my block / It never fails to be gunshots / Can't explain a mother's pain when her son drops.') but John is determined to just get a job and stay out of trouble.",
