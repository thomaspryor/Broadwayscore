  "bwwExcerpt": "While the language might be rough, the material chosen for 'Holler' is almost unrelentingly on the side of the angels. It decries violence and lawlessness, ill treatment of women, discrimination and grinding poverty, and their collective destructive impact on the lives of many African-Americans. With the same messages repeated, and enacted by the sketchy characters in fairly generic scenes, the show has a hard time moving forward.",
