  "fullText": "Frankly, I wouldn’t trust any veteran Broadway critic when it comes to a new musical that features the songs of Tupac Shakur. In this case, that musical is “Holler If Ya Hear Me,” which opened Thursday at the Palace Theater.\n\nAt the critics’ preview I attended, the show’s heartiest response came from the balcony and not those people seated in the orchestra of the Palace Theatre, which earlier this year housed a revival of “Annie” and before that, “Priscilla Queen of the Desert.”",
