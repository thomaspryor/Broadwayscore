  "fullText": "ExpandSaul Williams as John, Saycon Sengbloh as Corinne in \"Holler If Ya Hear Me\" (Joan Marcus)\n\nIn the Tupac Shakur musical at the Palace, a salvaged 1964 Cadillac rolls onstage — an eight-cylinder symbol of escape. Built from old and new parts and with lots of love, so we're told, the Caddy convertible is a big, eye-popping in-your-face beauty. It sets the scene for a tragedy.\n\n\"Holler If Ya Hear Me,\" Broadway's first rap jukebox musical, brings highs and lows too. The production is vibrant, raw and rousing, but it self-sabotages with predictability and unintelligibility.\n\nShakur, a trailblazing star of rap and hip hop, was prodigious, prolific and dead by gunfire at age 25 in 1996, a rise and fall that is disturbing to this day. The show, which doesn't sanitize a slew of F-bombs and N-words, avoids straight-up biography.\n\nTonya Pinkins as Mrs. Weston and Christopher Jackson as Vertus in \"Holler If Ya Hear Me\" (Joan Marcus)\n\nThe creative team — book writer Todd Kreidler, music supervisor Daryl Waters and director Kenny Leon — wrap Shakur's words and music around an original contemporary Everyman Everywhere narrative about big-city racism, drugs, guns and tears.\n\n\"My Block\" sets that tone and scene. It's a time-honored way to start a musical. The traditional \"Wonderful Town\" did it 60 years ago. The rap-infused \"In the Heights\" reprised the approach in 2008.\n\nDance number with the company of \"Holler If Ya Hear Me\" (Joan Marcus)\n\nThe story follows John (a magnetic Saul Williams), a self-taught artist who's fresh from jail (shades of Shakur, no?) starting over and working for Griffy (Ben Thompson), a mechanic and the lone white guy in the nabe. John struggles with the fact that his girl, Corinne (Saycon Sengbloh), is now with his drug-dealing friend Vertus (an excellent Christopher Jackson).\n\nLike so many jukebox shows, the retrofit story is thin — in this case even including a deadly showdown a la the Sharks and the Jets. The saving grace of the scene is that it makes an astute point about urban warfare. The real enemy is often within a group, not outside it.\n\nTupac Shakur died at age 25 in Las Vegas, a victim of gunshot wounds. (Ron Galella/WireImage)\n\nLeon, fresh from a Tony win for helming \"A Raisin in the Sun,\" guides a fluid, gritty and graceful production. Wayne Cilento's movement and choreography energize everything. Performances are solid, including the reliable Tonya Pinkins, who makes the most of a maternal role, and John Earl Jelks as a street preacher connected to John.\n\nThe score ripples with Shakur's familiar hits, including the emotional \"Me Against the World,\" apologetic \"Dear Mama,\" funky \"I Get Around,\" infectious \"I Ain't Mad at Cha\" and acoustic-driven \"California Love.\"\n\nThe score is carefully curated and threaded among characters. Music consistently grooves but it doesn't always grab. The main problem — and it's a big one — is clarity: Muddy diction and unsure sound mix become a wrecking ball to Shakur's gloriously constructed rhymes. \"Matilda\" brought the same what-are-they-saying woes, but rap is all about the words.\n\nHoller? You bet you will. But just as much out of appreciation as frustration.",
