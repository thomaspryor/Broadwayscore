  "bwwExcerpt": "The show's ambition to remake the theater couldn't be more literal: The Palace has been converted from a traditional Broadway house into something more like a stadium, with its orchestra drastically foreshortened and steeply raked to meet the balcony after just nine rows. (Some 600 seats were eliminated in the process.) The former rear orchestra section is now given over to a few uncaptioned exhibits on loan from the National Museum of Hip-Hop, including a baby-blue tracksuit apparently worn by someone, and a pair of Timberland boots customized with portraits of Mandela and Obama. If the latter retrofit feels dinky and confusing, the bigger one, much mocked in theater chat rooms in anticipation, actually succeeds, all but hurling the audience into the action.",

This indicates a negative assessment. | Gemini: The critic compares the show unfavorably to a music video and criticizes the weak story, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic fundamentally criticizes the production as a glorified concert with an insubstantial narrative, dismissing it as overpriced and lacking theatrical merit.",
