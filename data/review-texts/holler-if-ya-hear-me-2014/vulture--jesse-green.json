This indicates a negative assessment. | Gemini: The critic compares the show unfavorably to a music video and criticizes the weak story, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic fundamentally criticizes the production as a glorified concert with an insubstantial narrative, dismissing it as overpriced and lacking theatrical merit.",
