  "fullText": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/theater/holler-if-ya-hear-me-inspired-by-tupac-shakurs-rap.htmlShare full article12Advertisement\n\nThe beats are sweet, and the words often have an electric charge in “Holler if Ya Hear Me,” a new Broadway musical inspired by the lyrics of the popular but troubled rapper Tupac Shakur, who was shot and killed at 25 in Las Vegas in 1996. Unfortunately, much else about this ambitious show, which opened on Thursday at the Palace Theater, feels heartfelt but heavy-handed, as it punches home its message with a relentlessness that may soon leave you numb to the tragic story it’s trying to tell.\n\nWritten by Todd Kreidler and directed by Kenny Leon, a Tony winner this year for the revival of “A Raisin in the Sun,” the show admirably yanks the jukebox musical, which has mostly been mired in the hit parade of the baby-boomer years, into the last decade of the 20th century. It was then that Shakur’s raw, propulsive music struck a powerful chord, especially among disaffected black (and white) youth living in poverty amid explosive violence, while America was supposedly firing on all economic cylinders.\n\nBut while Shakur’s songs retain their scorching ability to paint pictures with words, describing the challenges faced by Americans living in urban slums then (and now, when the show is set), they tend to cover a limited range of themes: the diminished opportunities for young blacks; the unholy trinity of poverty, drugs and violence; the enduring strength of black women. (Mostly not included are Shakur’s braggadocio-laden celebrations of what he called the “thug life.”)\n\nPerhaps as a result, Mr. Kreidler’s book falls into a few predictable grooves, while the characters never emerge as more than thinly drawn types: the ex-con trying to shake his criminal past; the drug dealer who harbors a deep affection for his mother; the girlfriend who looks on with a mixture of hope and despair; the hotheaded would-be gangster bent on avenging a friend’s killing. (No one character is meant to represent Shakur himself.)\n\nDrawing on themes that Shakur rapped about in his scabrous, four-letter-word-filled lyrics (no one has taken a kid-friendly Magic Marker to them, I’m glad to report), the musical attempts to draw a vision of black life in urban America that acknowledges the danger, the violence and the self-destruction but also the hope, the courage and the potential for transcendence. To this end, it employs more than a dozen of Shakur’s songs and a couple of his poems. But the lyrical density of rap — in words per minute, many of the songs are off the charts — makes an uneasy fit for theatrical presentation, since the sizzling phrases fly by almost before you can grasp their meaning.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show's ambitions and praises Shakur's lyrics, but finds the execution problematic with predictable characters and heavy-handed messaging. Mixed signals without clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's ambition and the power of Tupac's lyrics, but criticizes the heavy-handedness and predictable nature of the production. This indicates a mixed reaction, not strongly recommending or discouraging. | Kimi: While the review praises the 'sweet beats' and 'electric charge' of Tupac's lyrics and finds the concept admirable, it heavily criticizes the book as predictable, characters as thinly drawn types, and the rap-to-theater adaptation as an uneasy fit. The text is truncated, making the final verdict unclear, but the balance of praise for the music versus criticism of the storytelling lands in mixed territory.",
