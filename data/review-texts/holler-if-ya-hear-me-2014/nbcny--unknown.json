  "bwwExcerpt": "It's a safe bet that a swath of theatergoers has steered clear of hip-hop -- at least, the kind not scripted by 'In the Heights' composer Lin-Manuel Miranda -- because it's gritty, racy and has a perception problem in some quarters. If that's you, then 'Holler If Ya Hear Me,' the Broadway musical 'inspired by' the lyrics of Tupac Shakur, is a chance to correct a grave omission. If, however, you've been on the Tupac train all along, then 'Holler,'...is a banner opportunity to stand in awe of a rich canon that, it's difficult to grasp, originated with a man who died at only 25. But the two-dozen songs lushly presented...are threaded together by a fictional story so tired, and so often told, that you can't help but walk away feeling that an opportunity has been missed.",
