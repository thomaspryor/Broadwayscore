  "bwwExcerpt": "But despite its problems, “The Assembled Parties,” which observes a well-off, secular Jewish family living on the Upper West Side, is that very rare kind of play where Act Two is substantially better than Act One. In other words, do not leave at intermission, no matter how much you may want to.",
