  "bwwExcerpt": "Ownership and changing fortunes are at the heart of this mystery play. It's the most engrossing to date from a writer whose work ('Take Me Out' is the best known) I usually find too self-consciously clever to be taken seriously...Nothing and everything happens in this Manhattan Theatre Club production.

They penetrate the walls and overlap, and they always have unforeseen consequences.",
