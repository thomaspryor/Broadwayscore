  "bwwExcerpt": "Richard Greenberg's elegantly moving The Assembled Parties is somewhere between a slice of life and a slice of mille-feuille...A brisk draft of intelligence blows straight through the script, tempering moments of sentiment with astringency and surprise. In Lynne Meadow's lovely Manhattan Theatre Club staging, the first act is a whirl of quips and overlapping scenes-Santo Loquasto's ingenious set spins the stage from room to room-and the second is ominously still, shadowed by past and future death. At the center of both is Julie, played with feathery otherworldliness by Jessica Hecht in one of the year's most absorbing performances.",
