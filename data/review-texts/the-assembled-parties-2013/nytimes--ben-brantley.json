  "bwwExcerpt": "There are tales, still told by the old ones of Broadway, of a time when Charm - with a capital C - was a cardinal virtue in the theater...To my great surprise, a brand-new version of such a play has materialized at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, and it is, in a word, charming. It is also smart, sad and so impossibly well-spoken you may feel like giving up on conversation. It is called 'The Assembled Parties,' written by Richard Greenberg and featuring a leading lady, Jessica Hecht, who is charm - I mean, Charm - incarnate...'The Assembled Parties'...is an elegy to a breed of woman, a style of living and a genre of theater of which only vestiges remain in frantic, self-promoting New York. Directed with loving care by Lynne Meadow, this is an old-fashioned play that ruefully knows that its time has passed and, moreover, why it's passed.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for the playwright's achievement with positive descriptors like 'deeply personal and universal' and 'finds the poetry,' but this appears to be an excerpt with limited evaluative content to assess full recommendation strength. | Gemini: The review praises the work as deeply personal and universal, finding poetry in everyday details, indicating a positive, though not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers strong praise for the play's emotional resonance and craftsmanship, describing it as both personal and universal with poetic qualities. However, as this appears to be a single-sentence excerpt without broader context or explicit recommendation language like 'must-see,' it falls in the solid positive range rather than a rave.",
