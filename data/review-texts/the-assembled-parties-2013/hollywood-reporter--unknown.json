  "bwwExcerpt": "Basically, it's like Aaron Sorkin meets Neil Simon. That should register as studied and artificial, and on many levels it does. But the cleverness is supported by a foundation of warmth, sensitivity, even delicacy that makes this funny-sad comedy as unexpectedly affecting as it is entertaining...This is an idiosyncratic play that reveals itself slowly and perhaps never quite fully, but Lynne Meadow's expertly gauged production has just the right feel for its shifting rhythms...More than the physical production, however, what separates this from a mannered New Yorker cartoon world is the wonderful anchoring performances of Jessica Hecht and Judith Light, both of them rich in complex humanity.",
