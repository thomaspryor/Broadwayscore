  "bwwExcerpt": "Whatever headaches Richard Greenberg might be having, what with this month's closing of 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' on Broadway and next month's opening of 'Far from Heaven' at Playwrights Horizons, he can relax about 'The Assembled Parties.' The Manhattan Theater Club, with a.d. Lynne Meadow at the helm, has done a sweet job on his messy but moving domestic comi-dram about a Jewish family living - and eating and arguing - over two decades in a 14-room rent-stabilized apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side.",
