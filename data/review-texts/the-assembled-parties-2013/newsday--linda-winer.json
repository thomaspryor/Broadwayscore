  "bwwExcerpt": "'The Assembled Parties,' [Richard Greenberg's] first new play here since 2006, has been lovingly directed by Lynne Meadow and cast with such experts of emotional nuance as JudithLight and Jessica Hecht. The tragicomedy, despite a few unexplained improbabilities, shocks us into realizing how hungry we have been for witty and wounded grown-ups who toss off gorgeously written observations without knowing how little we know about what we think we know.",
