She was right, I was wrong. Hers is the right way to direct 'Cost of Living,' but you maybe need to have seen the play twice to realize that.",

The critic suggests the play benefits from multiple viewings, indicating a positive but qualified recommendation. | Gemini: The critic initially had reservations but ultimately realized the director's approach was correct, indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The critic offers strong endorsement by describing the play as one that immediately warrants a second viewing, while thoughtfully validating the directorial approach after initial reservations. The tone is appreciative of the work's complexity, though the text appears truncated.",
