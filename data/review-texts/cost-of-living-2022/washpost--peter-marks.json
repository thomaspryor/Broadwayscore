    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise calling the play 'beautiful' and highlighting 'four exceptional performances.' Single excerpt warning suggests this could be cherry-picked positive content, but the language is genuinely enthusiastic without reservations. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as 'beautiful' and highlights 'exceptional performances', indicating a strong positive sentiment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"beautiful play\" and \"exceptional performances\", indicating a positive review. Given the single excerpt warning, I've placed the score towards the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt features unambiguous praise ('beautiful', 'exceptional') for the play and performances, indicating a strong recommendation, though the single curated quote limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
