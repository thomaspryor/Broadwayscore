    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The quote 'nothing more captivating on Broadway at the moment' positions this as the best current show available, which is strong rave language despite being a single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for its captivating nature and suggests it stands out among current Broadway offerings. The language indicates a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language, suggesting the show is captivating and extraordinary. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I'm placing it in the upper end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise suggesting the show is currently Broadway's most captivating offering, but as a single curated quote, it may not reflect the full review's balanced assessment or any caveats. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
