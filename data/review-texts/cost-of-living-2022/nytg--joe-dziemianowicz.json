However, the single excerpt and lack of full context limit confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, assessment. The phrase \"leaves the door ajar for an optimistic glimmer\" indicates a qualified recommendation. | Kimi: Single curated excerpt offers mild praise for the playwright's craft and tonal balance without strong enthusiasm. Per instructions for single excerpts with mild positivity, scoring at lower end of Positive range.",
