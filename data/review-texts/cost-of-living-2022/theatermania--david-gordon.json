Despite the limited text, the enthusiastic tone justifies a Rave classification. | Gemini: The single excerpt is strongly positive, suggesting an enthusiastic recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise promising significant emotional impact and resonance, placing it in the upper Positive range per instructions for clearly positive single excerpts, though confidence is limited due to availability of only one curated quote.",
