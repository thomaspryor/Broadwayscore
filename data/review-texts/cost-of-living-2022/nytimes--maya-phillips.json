  "bwwExcerpt": "This play left me breathless, and I'm not just using a manner of speech. As I made my way through the crowd of people exiting the theater, I took hard, shallow breaths, knowing that one deep inhale could set off a downpour of tears. This production either broke or mended something in me; I felt - brilliantly, painfully, cathartically - near the point of physical exhaustion.",
