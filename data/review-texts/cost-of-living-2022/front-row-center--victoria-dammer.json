    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the play as offering valuable insight into human relationships, suggesting worth seeing, but lacks clear evaluative language or explicit recommendation strength. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the play's exploration of complex themes and suggests it offers valuable insights, indicating a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the play as a Pulitzer Prize winning drama offering insight into the human struggle, which indicates a positive, though not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, assessment. Given that it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt praises the play's thematic insight and depiction of relationships, but lacks enthusiastic superlatives or explicit recommendation language. Limited to lower Positive range due to mild tone and high cherry-picking risk from single-quote context.",
