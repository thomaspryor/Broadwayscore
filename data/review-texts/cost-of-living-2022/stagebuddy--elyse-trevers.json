    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear positive sentiment with 'beautifully written and heartfelt' and describes meaningful emotional impact. However, limited text requires low confidence and upper-positive scoring due to excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('beautifully written', 'heartfelt') and describes a significant emotional impact ('moved and chastened'), suggesting a highly favorable impression. However, the single excerpt warning reduces confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"beautifully written\" and \"heartfelt\" and describes leaving the theater \"moved.\" Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly praises the writing as 'beautifully written and heartfelt' and describes audiences leaving deeply moved, indicating a clear positive recommendation. Confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
