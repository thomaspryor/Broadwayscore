  "showScoreExcerpt": "Cost of Living asks us to watch, like voyeurs, as two able-bodied characters lovingly minister to two disabled ones...Perhaps we even wonder how we ourselves would function in the same situations. But for all the emotional and physical expressiveness of the actors, and the interest conveyed by the characters’ relationships and often funky dialogue, the play remains basically a series of situations in search of a plot.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Praises the performances and character relationships but criticizes the fundamental structure as lacking plot. The 'but for all' construction suggests the positives don't overcome the core weakness. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the emotional and physical expressiveness of the actors and the interest in the characters' relationships, but criticizes the play for lacking a coherent plot. The single excerpt suggests a mixed impression, with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like the actors' expressiveness and interesting relationships, but ultimately finds the play lacking a strong plot, suggesting a mixed or neutral overall assessment. The truncated nature of the review lowers the confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers genuine praise for the acting and dialogue but delivers a fundamental criticism about the play's lack of narrative structure, creating an ambivalent assessment without a clear recommendation.",
