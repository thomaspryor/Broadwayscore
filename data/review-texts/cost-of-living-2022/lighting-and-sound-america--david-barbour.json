  "showScoreExcerpt": "Working elliptically and with remarkable economy of means, the playwright creates a portrait in miniature of a society that, all too often, leaves the poor, disabled, and psychologically lost to fend for themselves. At the same time, her dialogue crackles with wit and understated feeling. It's a piece that needs extremely special handling, here provided by director Jo Bonney, recreating her 2017 MTC production with three members of the original cast. \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for playwright's economy and wit, plus endorsement of director's 'extremely special handling.' Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds clearly positive, so scored in upper Positive range, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the playwright's skill and the director's handling, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the playwright's economy and wit, and the director's handling of the piece, suggesting a positive experience. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the playwright's craft ('remarkable economy of means,' 'crackles with wit') and the director's 'extremely special handling,' indicating a solid recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt with truncation, the overall verdict may not be fully represented.",
