  "bwwExcerpt": "Martyna Majok's 2018 Pulitzer winner, Cost of Living, has finally arrived on Broadway, and don't be fooled by the Hallmark-esque advertisements or the Enya-sounding New Age music that plays between scenes: This is a remarkable (and remarkably unsentimental) look at who we are, what we have, and what we're able to be for ourselves and others. It's the kind of play that feels too real and too quietly observed for a landscape insistent on broad emotional swings and easy politicization.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt provides only thematic description with no clear evaluative language or recommendation. The neutral, analytical tone suggests neither strong praise nor criticism, placing it in Mixed range with low confidence due to insufficient text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides thematic context without clear evaluative language, making it difficult to determine a strong recommendation. The lack of a clear positive or negative sentiment suggests a mixed review. | Gemini: The excerpt discusses the themes of the play, but does not offer a clear recommendation. Without more context, it's difficult to determine the critic's overall opinion, but it seems to be a mixed or neutral assessment. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
