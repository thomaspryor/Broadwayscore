  "bwwExcerpt": "In alternating scenes, the play focuses on the tenuous relationships between John and Jess, between Ani and Eddie, and, in the end, between the two caregivers who carry their own deep wounds and ache of loneliness. The play's overall theme of dependence, interdependence, and codependence is a gripping one, and all four cast members and the director manage to make a virtue of avoiding full disclosure. What you see as an outsider is what you get, and what you get with Katy Sullivan's performance, in particular, will haunt you long after the final bows. There but for fortune, the 'shit' that happens to them could happen to any of us.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising a haunting, memorable performance suggests strong positive impact. However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a strong performance by Katy Sullivan, suggesting a positive impression. However, the lack of context and single excerpt warning necessitate a cautious approach, placing it in the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a strong positive reaction to Katy Sullivan's performance, using the phrase \"haunt you long after the final bows,\" which suggests a powerful and memorable experience. Given the single excerpt and its strong positive tone, I've placed the score at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong praise for Katy Sullivan's performance using evocative language ('will haunt you') that suggests lasting emotional impact. While limited to a single curated quote focused on one performance element, the tone is clearly positive rather than mixed or negative.",
