    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising the play's 'greatest strength' indicates positive assessment, but with only one curated quote available, the full verdict remains unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play for its handling of disability, indicating a positive aspect. However, without more context, it's unclear if there are other significant positive or negative elements. The single excerpt and lack of full context suggest a cautious, low-confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt praises the play's handling of disability, suggesting a positive aspect. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the lower end of the positive bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt identifies a 'greatest strength' indicating clear merit regarding the show's handling of disability, but limited context requires conservative scoring in lower Positive range per excerpt guidelines.",
