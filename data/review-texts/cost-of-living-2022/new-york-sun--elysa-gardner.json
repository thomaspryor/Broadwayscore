  "bwwExcerpt": "It is through Eddie and Jess that the two stories in \"Cost of Living\" ultimately intersect, at a very low point for both. \"It's just unfortunate that some people have already lived a lot of life before they meet other people,\" she tells him. Yet part of the beauty of \"Cost of Living\" is something else these disparate characters share: a determination to press on - no matter the price.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic identifies 'beauty' in the show and appreciates its thematic depth about human resilience. However, with only one curated excerpt available, this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a positive aspect of the show, focusing on the beauty of the characters' determination. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt highlights a positive aspect of the play, its characters' determination. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as mildly positive. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains explicit praise ('beauty') for the play's thematic resonance and character work, indicating a positive recommendation, though limited context requires reduced confidence.",
