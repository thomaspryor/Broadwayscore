Given excerpt limitation, scored at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as a 'thoughtful meditation' and highlights its relevance and universal themes, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, describing the play as thoughtful and timely. However, as it's a single excerpt, confidence is low and the score is in the lower half of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear, warm praise for the play's thematic richness and writing quality, describing it as both timely and timeless. Limited to a single curated quote, the evaluative language indicates a solid recommendation in the upper Positive range.",
