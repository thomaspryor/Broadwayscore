    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising performances and direction with positive descriptors ('honest and solid', 'veritable forcefield'), but very limited text makes full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the actors and direction, indicating a positive view. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the actors and direction, suggesting a positive experience, but without more context, it's hard to be certain of the overall recommendation strength. | Kimi: Single excerpt provides clearly positive assessment of the acting and direction with enthusiastic language ('veritable forcefield'), warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket per scoring guidelines. Confidence is low due to limited excerpt availability.",
