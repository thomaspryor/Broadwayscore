    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic describes a transformative, deeply emotional experience and frames the show as 'great theater' that offers profound human value. The language suggests this is a must-see theatrical experience. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong, positive language suggesting a transformative experience, indicating a highly favorable view of the production. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"great theater offers us empathy and humanity in return\" suggesting a positive experience. Given it is only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains ecstatic praise describing the production as 'great theater' offering profound emotional impact and intangible 'riches,' warranting a high Positive score per the single-excerpt protocol, though limited context prevents Rave classification. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
