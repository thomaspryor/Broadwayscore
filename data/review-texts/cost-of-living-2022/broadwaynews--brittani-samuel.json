    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises the script's restraint and thematic depth, suggesting appreciation for the writing, but extremely limited text makes full verdict assessment impossible. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the script for avoiding overt sentimentality and highlights its thematic depth, suggesting a positive view. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context necessitate a cautious, low-confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the script, highlighting its avoidance of sentimentality and focus on the spirit. Given the single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation, the score is in the lower end of the positive range with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the playwright's craft, specifically commending the script for avoiding sentimentality while achieving thematic depth regarding human dignity. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict.",
