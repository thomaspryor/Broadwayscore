  "bwwExcerpt": "Somewhat oddly, Majok seems to have given the physically disabled characters less emotional dimension - and basic likeability -- than their caretakers. Indeed, Ani and John can be so unpleasant that, after a while, you almost wish for them to disappear and for the play to focus solely on Eddie and Jess. Indeed, while it perhaps shouldn't be the case, their challenges end up the ones we most care about. By the play's end, we also realize the prices Jess and Eddie pay for remaining alive are something that can never be solved by the Federal Reserve.",
