  "bwwExcerpt": "That part of the show, thanks to the honesty and richness of Brayben’s lead performance, is the more interesting one. The more general satirical wash, and it is a tonally constant covering, grows tiresome as the show progresses. “Tammy Faye” feels like it comes from abroad, as indeed it does, because you never believe that any of the creators have any real skin in the game.",
