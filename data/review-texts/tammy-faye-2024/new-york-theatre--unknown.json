    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt acknowledges flaws but uses 'must admire' suggesting qualified recommendation. Low confidence due to limited text and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges flaws but highlights positive aspects like flash, energy, and a standout performance. The single excerpt and lack of full context suggest a mildly positive review. | Gemini: The excerpt acknowledges flaws but praises the show's energy and star, suggesting a positive but not rave review. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt contains a clear imperative recommendation ('you must admire') alongside specific praise for the production's energy and lead performance, though the 'isn't flawless' qualifier prevents it from being a rave. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced, but the directive language suggests a solid positive verdict.",
