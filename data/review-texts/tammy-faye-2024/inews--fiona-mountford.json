Gift up to 10 articles a month to a friend, so they can read for free How is this for a stage full of superlatives? This ebullient new musical has a book by James Graham, our finest contemporary playwright, and is directed by Rupert Goold, the best director in the country. The music, a riot of stomping tunes, comes from none other than Elton John, with lyrics by Jake Shears of the Scissor Sisters. The peculiar – and peculiarly American – world of televangelism has never experienced such royal treatment. This is very definitely Tammy Faye Bakker’s year. Jessica Chastain won an Oscar for portraying her in the otherwise hollow film The Eyes of Tammy Faye and now it is Katie Brayben’s (Beautiful: The Carole King Musical) turn to don the shoulder pads, sequins and bubble perm of Bakker’s 80s heyday. Brayben’s magnificent voice powers us through an evening in which greed soon outstrips godliness and all thoughts about camels and the eyes of needles are foolishly forgotten. We start at the beginning of the age of the so-called “electric church”, when the possibilities of television are beginning to be explored by less traditional preachers. Young Tammy and her husband Jim (Girls and The Book of Mormon‘s Andrew Rannells), who previously toured a show that used Sesame Street-style puppets, are given their own satellite channel and promise to broadcast 24 hours a day “until the Second Coming”. It’s a scrappy start but Tammy, full of warmth and sincerity, is a natural. Her unlikely support of the gay community during the AIDS epidemic is her most appealing quality. Graham provides few details about the Bakkers’ relationship or faith backgrounds, which can leave us feeling a little unanchored amid the breathless account of the growth of the PTL (Praise the Lord) network, which soon morphs into a demented commercial free-for-all. A strong and salutary subplot, centring on rival preacher Jerry Falwell (Zubin Varla, excellent) tracks the ascent of the Conservative right and its hardline morality, values that hold such pernicious sway in the US today. Goold directs with his customary brio, the ensemble is top-notch as they flit between supporting characters and designer Bunny Christie’s bank of television screens allows for unexpected figures to pop up; a glorious three-way conversation between the otherworldly Pope, the frazzled Archbishop of Canterbury and the leader of the Mormon church frets over the huge “congregations” of the televangelists. The music is strong and catchy; “He’s Inside Me” (sample lyric “He’s inside women and he’s inside men”) is a cheekily suggestive encomium to the Lord and “He Promised Me” is delivered by Brayben as an impassioned foot-stomper of betrayal. The closing number, “See You in Heaven”, is the evening’s stand-out. Heaven might have to wait, but there is little doubt that we’ll be seeing this show in venues beyond the Almeida. Until 3 Dec (020 7359 4404, www.almeida.co.uk)",

Confidence medium due to truncated text potentially missing final verdict. | GPT-4o: The review is filled with praise for the production team, music, and performances, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the truncated nature of the text, the final verdict might be missing, so the confidence is low. | Gemini: Despite the truncated text, the review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the performances, music, and direction.
