By trying to hit so many notes, none of them resonate.\"",

With only an excerpt available, confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt suggests a balanced view, noting the show's generosity but also a lack of depth. Without a clear recommendation or discouragement, it fits the Mixed bucket. The confidence is low due to the limited excerpt. | Gemini: The review praises the musical's generosity but suggests it lacks depth, indicating a mixed assessment. The truncated text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise (generous, nonjudgmental) but levels a significant criticism that the show conflates kindness with depth, suggesting a shallow quality that prevents full endorsement.",
