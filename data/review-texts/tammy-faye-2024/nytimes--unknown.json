However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show fails to deliver a cohesive narrative or emotional experience, suggesting a negative assessment. Given that it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single excerpt available offers decisive criticism of the show's identity crisis and failure to resonate emotionally, suggesting fundamental narrative flaws without mentioning redeeming qualities.",
