  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"But narratively and emotionally, \"Tammy Faye\" is always on shaky ground because it can't decide if it's a satire of televangelism and power-hungry faith salesmen, the tale of the rise of politicized religion, or the earnest feminist journey of an independent-minded woman. By trying to hit so many notes, none of them resonate.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic identifies fundamental narrative and tonal problems, calling the show 'on shaky ground' and concluding that none of its attempted themes work. This is a clear negative assessment of the musical's core effectiveness. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show for lacking narrative and emotional clarity, suggesting it fails to effectively deliver its themes. The tone is negative, indicating a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show fails to deliver a coherent narrative or emotional impact, suggesting a negative assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt delivers substantive criticism of the show's fundamental identity crisis, stating it fails to resonate emotionally or narratively by trying to be too many things at once. The opening 'But' suggests prior praise may exist, but the available text constitutes a clear negative verdict on the production's core effectiveness.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "But after that teasing introduction, Tammy Faye’s signature Kabuki facade barely figures in the disjointed, strangely bland musical that opened on Thursday at the newly renovated Palace Theater. It is laudable that the show’s composer, Elton John; lyricist, Jake Shears (of Scissor Sisters); book writer, James Graham; and director, Rupert Goold, tried to go behind the mask of this complicated, outsize woman, whose public persona was shaped by and for television. The problem is that they ended up making her smaller than life.",
