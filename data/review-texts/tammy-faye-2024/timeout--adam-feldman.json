    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: This appears to be an excerpt focusing solely on praise for the lead performance. The 'powerhouse performance' language is clearly positive, but without broader context about the overall production, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review praises the lead performance as a 'powerhouse' and indicates that the actor avoids caricature, suggesting a positive portrayal. This warrants a positive score. | Kimi: The critic delivers enthusiastic praise for the lead actress's nuanced portrayal using words like 'powerhouse,' though the excerpt's brevity limits full assessment of whether this extends to an unqualified recommendation of the entire production.",
