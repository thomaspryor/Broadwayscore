    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The karaoke comparison is clearly dismissive, suggesting the show lacks depth and substance despite acknowledging the performers are attractive. This is a negative assessment disguised in polite language. | GPT-4o: The review compares the show to a karaoke night rather than a proper tribute, suggesting it lacks depth or authenticity. The tone is dismissive, indicating a negative assessment. | Gemini: The review compares the show to karaoke, which is neither positive nor negative, suggesting a mixed experience. | Kimi: The critic fundamentally dismisses the production as imitative karaoke rather than a meaningful artistic tribute, using 'well-appointed' and 'attractive singers' as faint praise for surface-level qualities that cannot redeem the show's lack of authenticity.",
