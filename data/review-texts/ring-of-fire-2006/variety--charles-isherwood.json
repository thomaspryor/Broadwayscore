    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies - this critique suggests the show lacks theatrical depth despite being 'reverent,' indicating mixed feelings rather than clear recommendation or dismissal. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show lacks theatrical depth, resembling a tribute concert rather than a complete theatrical work. Without more context, it's unclear if this is a positive or negative sentiment, leading to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a lack of theatrical depth, leaning more towards a concert experience. This indicates a mixed assessment, not fully negative but not entirely positive either. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show's respectful treatment of the music but criticizes its failure to transcend concert format and achieve full theatrical realization, indicating a mixed reception with notable reservations about the production's artistic ambitions.",
