  "fullText": "First Date. Longacre Theatre (see Broadway). Book by Austin Winsberg. Music and lyrics by Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner. Directed by Bill Berry. With Zachary Levi, Krysta Rodriguez. Running time: 1hr 30mins. No intermission.\n\nZachary Levi (Chuck) and Krysta Rodriguez (Smash) try to hook up in this new musical about the pleasures and agonies of the blind date. Gossip Girl writer Austin Winsberg provides the book, while the bouncy tunes are by Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner. Bill Berry of Seattle's 5th Avenue Theatre directs.\n\nFirst Date: theater review by David Cote\n\nPart of my job is to be your cultural matchmaker. And so…should I set you up with First Date, sight unseen? Is this cute and frisky musical worth your time and money? Or will initial charm yield to irritation at a one-act comedy that is mostly sitcom quirk, one-liners and a laundry list of barely tweaked gender stereotypes? Despite a little overeagerness, First Date isn’t a bad night out (provided you don’t expect deep engagement).\n\nIf ever there were the platonic ideal of a Broadway summer engagement, this is it: no serious competition, low expectations, emerging talent. There is skill on display in Austin Winsberg’s anything-for-a-laugh book and the inoffensive light-rock score by Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner. But the main selling points are the love interests, meeting in a restaurant for possible romance: uptight office drone Aaron (Levi) and boho babe Casey (Rodriguez). They meet awkward, get on each other’s nerves, say the wrong things and proceed to screw everything up. Can we reasonably expect an eleventh-hour clinch?\n\nThe 90-minute musical is structured in real time, with cartoonish forays into the daters’ inner neuroses—he worries, in a goofy Fiddler-esque romp, what his Jewish relatives would think of the shiksa; she’s haunted by memories of past bad boys. Bill Berry’s jaunty staging keeps the laughs coming, and both leads have charm and vocal chops. Not every hookup has to be forever; First Date aims its love arrow for the middle and hits it with aplomb.—Theater review by David Cote\n\nFollow David Cote on Twitter: @davidcote\n\nDiscounted tickets are available through Time Out Offers until September 1.\n\nTicket Offers from Time Out New York\n\nLooking for tickets to a Broadway or Off Broadway show?

My friends and I laughed the whole time. It was smart and funny i definitely would see it again soon even though i just went haha.\n\nI didn't know what to expect but was looking for a fun night and I found it. The music was serviceable but the actors were spirited, talented and the staging was fun and creative. It was kind of like to the best musical your sleep away camp never put on. This and a nice dinner would prove to be a good evening out.\n\nI was hoping for this new musical to be the first one of the season to come out of the gate at full clip and be several lengths ahead at the finish line. Unfortunately I was finished with the show before the final curtain. Don't let the standing ovation (August 10th, 2 pm showing,) make you think it was a winner take all show.\nI was sorry it didn't have an intermission, I would have reported only seeing the first half of this so-called show.\nThe unmemorable waiter's song, had the worst lead in, I have heard in years. The leads were adequate at best given the material was so poor. Casey was very good in 'The Adam's Family' and I looked forward to seeing her in a leading performance. \nToo bad the numerous doctors listed as producers didn't take the scalpel to this material. I read that the cast of this show was going to the studio to record the original cast album. I would ask the same question some people ask after a 'first date': Why?",

Critic acknowledges charm and skill but calls it 'mostly sitcom quirk' and warns against expecting 'deep engagement.' Mixed user comments range from enthusiastic to negative. | GPT-4o: The review presents a mix of positive and negative elements, highlighting charm and humor but also critiquing the material and depth. The original 3/5 rating suggests a middle-ground assessment. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, stating it's \"not a bad night out\" and highlighting the charm of the leads and the jaunty staging, but it also acknowledges the sitcom-like qualities and lack of deep engagement. The 3/5 rating supports a positive but not rave score. | Kimi: The 3/5 star review acknowledges the show's sitcom-level humor and lack of depth while praising the leads' charm and the staging's skill, ultimately deeming it competent summer filler rather than essential viewing.",
