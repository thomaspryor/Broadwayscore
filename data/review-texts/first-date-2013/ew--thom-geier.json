  "bwwExcerpt": "Levi is particularly winsome and adorable as Aaron..His singing voice, like his character, is engaging but a little thin...Here, [Rodriguez] projects an admirable magnetism as a brusque, red-meat-eating downtown chick...While director Bill Berry keeps the story zipping along, he's hobbled by a bland score (by Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner) that leans too heavily on pastiche as well as a paint-by-numbers book (by Austin Winsberg) that strings together a series of overly broad clichés rather than flesh out truly distinctive characters...But there's a certain crackle to the performances by Levi and Rodriguez, a kinetic in-the-momentness, that elevates the material. Though your head may tell you to cut short this First Date, you find yourself rooting for this unlikely couple (and the show) to succeed. C+",

The language is positive but measured, indicating a solid recommendation without strong enthusiasm. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as a 'pleasant enough diversion' with appealing leads, aligning with a positive but not enthusiastic recommendation. The original rating of 83 confirms the positive classification. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, calling the show a 'pleasant enough diversion.' While the critic praises the leads, the overall tone suggests a recommendation with some reservations, placing it in the lower end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: The review describes the show as a 'pleasant enough diversion' with 'appealing leads' and 'easy chemistry,' indicating a solid recommendation. The provided rating of 83 confirms this falls in the strong-positive range.",
