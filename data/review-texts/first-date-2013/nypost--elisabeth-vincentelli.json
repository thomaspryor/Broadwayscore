  "bwwExcerpt": "But the show really rests on Levi's shoulders - and he carries it effortlessly. The only clue we had that he could carry a tune was from his duet with Mandy Moore in Disney's 'Tangled.' Here, he turns out to be able to do far more than just sing a song: He can sell it. His 11 o'clock number, 'In Love With You,' is a tour de force of comic timing, physical clowning and effective interpretation.",
