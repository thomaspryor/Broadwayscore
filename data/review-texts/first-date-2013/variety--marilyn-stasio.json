  "fullText": "Enjoyably modest musical is buoyed by strong perfs from Zachary Levi, Krysta Rodriguez\n\n“First Date,” a romantic musical comedy about the horrors, humiliations and occasional happy surprises of blind dates, is cute (but not too cute) and sweet (but not too sweet). So, indications are that this appealing show will do well (but not too well) on Gotham’s Main Stem, despite having come out of nowhere and been assembled by no one you’ve heard of. Creative team of Austin Winsberg (book) and collaborators Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner (music and lyrics) should thank their lucky stars for Krysta Rodriguez and Zachary Levi, who are seriously charming as mismatched blind daters destined to become lovers.\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Miley Cyrus Announces 'Something Beautiful' Deluxe Featuring Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood and David Byrne\n\nAh, the joys of the modest musical, a rare commodity on Broadway these days but an ideal tenant for the intimately scaled and lovingly restored Longacre Theater. Helmer Bill Berry, producing director of the 5th Avenue Theater in Seattle where the show originated, makes judicious use of his resources. David Gallo’s unit set adapts to the various restaurants, wine bars, and cafes where all the dating and mating takes place, enhanced by the witty background projections of a big, bad, sexy city. The design is nice and tight, a perfect fit for the stage, which Mike Baldassari has drolly lighted in those deeper shades of midnight-blue-to-black (with splashes of red) that are universal signifiers of moody music, hard liquor and sex.\n\nThe bar is packed with dating couples (for obvious budgetary reasons, scaled down to two boy-girl pairs, joined by a waiter) singing their hearts out in a rousing opening number (“The One”) about the hazards of looking for a mate on the open market. It’s a long list, with blind dates running the gamut from the ones who lie about their age, their weight, and even their gender, to the painfully honest chap who admits that he’s not allowed within 50 feet of a playground.\n\nThe tall, weedy guy who nervously enters this lions’ den is Aaron (Levi, the Chuck of the NBC spy series “Chuck”), who hasn’t been on a date since his wife left him and already regrets that he let his best friend fix him up on this blind date. Aaron is what any woman would recognize as Mr. Nice Guy, who makes a better friend than a lover, so it’s quite an achievement in character-building when Levi carefully draws out the more interesting and yes, sexier side of this sweet, sensitive guy.\n\nRodriguez (\"Smash\") is quite the bombshell as Casey, the neo-punk, height-of-fashion cutie who drinks with both fists and goes for bad boys. Armed with Rodriguez’s strong voice, solid acting chops, and snazzy Jazz Age costume, Casey seems likely to make short work of awkward Aaron.\n\nBut the friction between their personalities produces terrific chemistry, and the smart book guarantees that, while their early exchanges are abrasive, they’re also genuinely witty. When Casey insults Aaron by calling him a BDV (“blind date virgin”), Aaron politely replies that he’d prefer a name like “A-Train” or “Wolverine.” The clever lyrics of “First Impressions” take them a long way in getting over the initial discomforts of their blind date.\n\nOf course, no sooner do Aaron and Casey get past the first meeting rituals, than they find themselves stumbling over other social landmines, like “The Awkward Pause” and, inevitably, “The Check!” Not to mention the familiar critics like friends, exes, and family who materialize at the drop of a hat (or the sound of a musical intro) to offer ill-timed and unwanted advice.\n\nKristoffer Cusick, as Casey’s gay bff Reggie, has some funny moments in the three “Bailout Songs” that he calls in on his cellphone. Blake Hammond scores some laughs as all the waiters in all the single bars in the world, or at least, in this cold and lonely city. The other performers also stand up tall doubling and tripling as the voices in our young couple’s fevered brains.\n\nLike the show’s romantic sensibility, the musical idiom is Broadway-lite; but again, not too-too Broadway and not too-too lite — quite suitable, really, for this entertaining, but not overly pushy show.",

This year’s Comic-Con boasts over 35 parties being held July 17-20 (most locked down by the Hard Rock Hotel), with some so hard to get into it can be as stressful as securing a ticket to the Con or hotel room anywhere close to downtown San Diego, itself.\n\nOne of this year’s more unique events is set to be Ubisoft’s “Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag Comic-Con Party & Showcase,” that will take place on a pirate ship, docked behind the convention center, to replicate the one seen in the game. Event will also promote Ubisoft’s “Watch_Dogs,” “Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist” and “Just Dance 2014.”\n\n1/1\n\nSkip Ad\n \nContinue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nWhile some companies host an impressive bash around the launch of a new film or TV show, Comic-Con does have its list of must-attend events each year that have consistently proved popular, boasting a strong guest list of bold face names from the big and small screens. They include:\n\nHitFix’s Comic-Con Kick Off Party\n\nThe annual event, produced by Gregory Ellwood, co-founder and editor-in-chief of HitFix is the calm before the storm, attracting a notable gathering of bloggers, media and filmmakers on the eve of Comic-Con’s four days of panels and presentations.\n\nUmberto Gonzalez and Daniel Alter‘s third annual event, held this year inside the Pussycat Doll’s Dollhouse at the Keating Hotel, stands out for its decision to go more Gotham in theme and attitude than L.A., and for random acts of cool like when Jon Favreau decided to take over as DJ.\n\nEntertainment Weekly‘s Comic-Con Celebration\n\nJust as Hitfix starts the week, Entertainment Weekly ends Comic-Con on a high note. The magazine’s consistently proved the week’s most sought after ticket given its strong guest list of talent in town to promote their movies and TV series during the week. It’s essentially become a requirement for publicists to send their clients to, given the photo ops and chance to be included in the pub’s Comic-Con coverage. This year’s guest list includes castmembers of “Game of Thrones,” “Teen Wolf,” “True Blood,” “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D,” “Arrow,” “The Walking Dead,” “Grimm,” “Black Sails,” “The Vampire Diaries,” “Once Upon a Time” and “The World’s End.”\n\n“For a lot of actors and people in the industry, the EW party has become a kind of reward for making it through Comic-Con,” says Entertainment Weekly editor Jess Cagle. “It captures the spirit of Comic-Con: fun, relaxed and a little crazy. It’s a good way for us to thank the entertainers we work with all the time.”\n\nThis Year’s Party List (at least most of them):\n\nThe “Course of the Force” 2013 Closing Ceremony & Concert, 6-9 p.m.; Hard Rock Hotel\n\nHitFix’s Comic-Con Kick-Off Party with CBS Films’ “The To Do List,” 8 p.m-midnight; Hotel Solamar\n\nUniversal Cable Prods Cocktail Party, 5 p.m.-9 p.m.; Stingaree\n\n“Game of Thrones” Beer Tasting, 6 p.m.-7 p.m.; Wired Lounge at Omni Hotel\n\nDreamWorks Animation Cocktail Reception, 6-8 p.m.; Southpaw Social Club\n\nMTV2’s Party in the Park, 7-11 p.m.; Petco Park\n\nIGN and Focus Features’ “The World’s End” Party, 7-11 p.m.; Hard Rock Hotel’s Float Bar\n\neOne’s “Haven” Party, 8-10 p.m.; Sidebar\n\nThe Principato Young Cocktail Reception, 8 p.m.-10 p.m.; Rama Restaurant\n\nThe Mashable and Digitaria Party, 8 p.m.-midnight; Ultimate Skybox\n\nFandango, Lionsgate, Summit Party, 8:30 p.m.-12:30 a.m.; Hard Rock Hotel’s 207 Lounge\n\nThe Kings of Con Party, 9 p.m.-2 a.m.; The Keating Hotel\n\nBoom!
