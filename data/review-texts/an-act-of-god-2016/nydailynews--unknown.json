  "fullText": "Put Jim Parsons behind the wheel of a Broadway star vehicle, and he’ll drive like it’s a Rolls-Royce.\n\nEven if it’s really a Ford Fusion Hybrid.\n\nSo it is with the “An Act of God,” a new mixed-bag comedy about the Man Upstairs in which He cops to having “wrath-management issues.”\n\nThe play by David Javerbaum has laugh-management issues. Some of it is divinely, if blasphemously, inspired. Some is sorta tired.\n\nUnevenness isn’t next to godliness. But Parsons is an ace comic act. He does deadpan and flashes the stink eye like nobody’s business, so the show is fun and entertaining.\n\nThe setup is simple. The Creator has inhabited Parsons’ body and plopped himself down on a long, white sofa for a 90-minute couch confessional. As directed by Joe Mantello, Parsons fidgets as if he’s uncomfortable contained in human form.\n\nBeing almighty, the Lord gets the irony of being in Studio 54. The disco-turned-theater has been home to demented debauchery. As for His earthly host, Parsons stars in “The Big Bang Theory,” which is all about science, not divinity.\n\nOn a sleek set conjuring a stairway to heaven bathed in soft pastels, God vents about misinterpretations and irritations. Like the Kardashians, Kanye, Ted Cruz and more.\n\nHe’s really here to lay down commandments for 2015, including “Thou shalt not seek a personal relationship with Me.” He repeats the oldie but goodie “Thou shalt not take My name in vain.” Here’s why: “It cheapens the brand,” he says. And if you plan to pray to Him to win a contest, don’t bother. He doesn’t care who wins.\n\nThe Lord has two angelic wingmen with him. Gabriel (Tim Kazurinsky) is easygoing and reads from an original Gutenberg Bible. Michael (Christopher Fitzgerald), meanwhile, is an upstart. He pays dearly when he annoys God by asking vexing questions. Like, Do you answer prayers? All hell breaks loose and feathers fly when he won’t drop it.\n\nJaverbaum has won 13 Emmys as head writer for “The Daily Show” and can bring the funny. This show is adapted from his book “The Last Testament: A Memoir by God,” and his cheeky Twitter account, @TheTweetOfGod. Jokes are hit and miss. Picking off Red State idols like Sarah Palin is easy and old — B.C., even. Dissing Florida? Heard it before. Even told from God’s point of the view, the bit about Noah and the ark drones on far too long.\n\nThe best material is out of left field and edgy. Like when God says that “Jesus was a middle child, and acted like it. He is the second of My three children: Zach, Jesus, and Kathy.” Nobody saw that coming. But it lifted the show to cloud nine.",
