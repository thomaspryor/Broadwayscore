  "bwwExcerpt": "Hayes, who kept us in stitches as flighty pal Jack McFarland on NBC's \"Will & Grace,\" may not be \"infinity\" years old,\" as the script -- based on a Twitter feed by former \"Daily Show\" honcho David Javerbaum -- allows. But he isn't the young kid we remember from a TV sitcom, either. A touch of gray has crept into Hayes' hair. Forehead lines are visible when he furrows his brow. I'd normally stay clear of comment on a performer's physical traits, but there's a gravitas evident that's a help, here.",
