Despite the single excerpt warning, the enthusiastic tone suggests a solid positive verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, describing the play as \"laugh out loud funny\" and Parsons as \"brilliant.\" The mention of repeat audience members further suggests a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise ('brilliant', 'laugh out loud funny') and explicitly recommends repeat viewings. However, as a single curated excerpt, it may not reflect potential reservations elsewhere in the full review.",
