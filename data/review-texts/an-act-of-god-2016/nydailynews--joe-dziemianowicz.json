    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive reaction to the dialogue, indicating moments of resonance. However, without more context, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a cautious, mildly positive score. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive experience due to relatable dialogue, but the single excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation lead to a lower confidence and a score in the lower-middle of the positive range. | Kimi: Single available excerpt offers mild, specific praise for the show's dialogue/lyrics ('in sync with what's inside your head'), suggesting the writing lands effectively. However, with only one curated excerpt available, the overall recommendation strength remains uncertain; scoring at the lower end of Positive per guidance for mildly positive isolated quotes.",
