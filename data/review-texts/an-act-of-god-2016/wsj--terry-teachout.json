As God, Mr. Parsons is monochromatically campy, but in an unthreatening way—the kind of camp you’d expect from a sitcom star, in other words. If that floats your ark and you’ve got $145 to blow on an orchestra seat, go thou and do likewise. Me, I’d rather go straight to hell than sit through 'An Act of God' again.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Pan) - using median score | Claude: Despite the single excerpt warning, the critic's final verdict is unambiguous: they'd rather 'go straight to hell' than see the show again. This hyperbolic rejection, combined with criticism of predictability and weak performance, clearly indicates a negative recommendation. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses strong disdain for the show, comparing it unfavorably to a mundane experience and stating a preference to avoid it entirely. The tone is clearly negative with no redeeming qualities mentioned. | Gemini: The critic explicitly states they would rather go to hell than see the show again, indicating a negative recommendation. | Kimi: The critic delivers a devastating final verdict, preferring eternal damnation to enduring the show again, indicating a complete rejection despite faint praise for the lead's campiness. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Pan, gemini=Negative, kimi=Pan",
