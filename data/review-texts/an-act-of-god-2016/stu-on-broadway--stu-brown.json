    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows appreciation for the material ('marvel at', 'wickedly funny') and praises the direction, but qualified language like 'mostly amusing' and 'sometimes' suggests moderate enthusiasm. Single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play as 'hip, topical and comically moralizing' with 'mostly amusing, sometimes wickedly funny' content, indicating a positive reception. The direction and performance are also highlighted positively. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"mostly amusing\" and \"sometimes wickedly funny\" to describe the play. The director is also praised for managing Jim Parsons' performance well. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the play's wit, topicality, and direction, describing it as 'wickedly funny' and a 'marvel,' though single-excerpt limitations prevent higher confidence.",
