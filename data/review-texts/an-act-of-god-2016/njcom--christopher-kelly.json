    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative language calling it a 'one-joke sketch' and 'cash grab' with derogatory tone. Single excerpt warning noted, but the dismissive language is unambiguous. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as a 'one-joke sketch' and 'cash grab,' indicating a strongly negative opinion. The lack of redeeming qualities and the description of the show as a tourist trap suggest a deep Pan score. | Gemini: The review excerpt is negative, calling the show a \"cash grab\" and a \"one-joke sketch.\" Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the tone is clearly negative. | Kimi: The available excerpt offers an unambiguously negative verdict, dismissing the show as a thin premise stretched to 'ungodly lengths' and condemning it as a cynical 'cash grab' targeting tourists. With only one excerpt available, confidence is reduced, but the language clearly falls in the negative range.",
