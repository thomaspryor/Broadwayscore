    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Pan | Claude: Clear pan language calling the show 'lame' and suggesting it needs divine intervention, but single excerpt warning means the full verdict may be missing. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is strongly negative, describing the show as 'lame' and in need of 'divine intervention.' Given the lack of full context, the score is placed in the lower Pan range with low confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt is extremely negative, calling the show \"lame\" and stating it \"needs divine intervention.\" This indicates a strong pan. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strongly dismissive language ('lame thing,' 'weakest of authors') to condemn the production, warranting a deep Pan score. However, confidence is low given this is a single curated excerpt that may not capture the review's full nuance.",
