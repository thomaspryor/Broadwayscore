  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"While such casting is perfect and the notion for this show is nifty, writer David Javerbaum doesn’t make nearly so much of these assets as might be hoped. The 90 minutes that ensue turn out to be fairly amusing as God convivially chats about creation...The humor is scattershot. The social satire is mild. The characterization of God as a curmudgeon whose mysterious ways are simply quixotic is scarcely profound. Expect light entertainment here rather than dark or dangerous comedy.\"\n\nRead more",
