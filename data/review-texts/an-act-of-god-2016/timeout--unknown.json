  "bwwExcerpt": "I could say that the return engagement of An Act of God, now with Sean Hayes, is a revelation, a miraculous epiphany or similar \"religious\" experience. Truth to tell, I was already a believer. I thoroughly enjoyed David Javerbaum's theological satire last summer when it starred Jim Parsons, and I could watch Hayes's bratty-campy shtick all night. So what if Hayes and his helpful angels Gabriel and Michael (James Gleason, David Josefsberg) are preaching to the choir? Preach out, Sean!",

The 'Preach out, Sean!' ending shows strong endorsement. Single excerpt warning applied - using upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt shows strong enthusiasm for Sean Hayes's performance and the production overall, suggesting a positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The critic states they thoroughly enjoyed the show and could watch the star all night, indicating a strong positive sentiment despite the caveat of already being a 'believer'. | Kimi: The critic expresses thorough enjoyment and strong enthusiasm for both the writing and Hayes's performance, using words like 'revelation' and 'miraculous,' though notes the show preaches to the choir.",
