  "bwwExcerpt": "I could say that the return engagement of An Act of God, now with Sean Hayes, is a revelation, a miraculous epiphany or similar \"religious\" experience. Truth to tell, I was already a believer. I thoroughly enjoyed David Javerbaum's theological satire last summer when it starred Jim Parsons, and I could watch Hayes's bratty-campy shtick all night. So what if Hayes and his helpful angels Gabriel and Michael (James Gleason, David Josefsberg) are preaching to the choir? Preach out, Sean!",
