    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic states they 'thoroughly enjoyed' the show and were 'already a believer,' indicating strong positive sentiment. However, this is a single excerpt that appears cut off mid-sentence, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates strong enjoyment of the previous production and implies a positive view of the current one with Sean Hayes. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context necessitate a lower confidence level. | Gemini: The critic enjoyed the show previously and implies they still do with Sean Hayes. However, the text is truncated, so confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt features superlative praise ('revelation,' 'miraculous epiphany') and the critic identifies as 'a believer' who 'thoroughly enjoyed' the previous production, indicating strong endorsement. However, as a single truncated excerpt, it warrants the upper end of the Positive bucket rather than Rave.",
