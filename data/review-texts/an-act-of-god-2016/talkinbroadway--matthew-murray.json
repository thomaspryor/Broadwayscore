    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear dismissiveness, calling the content 'disposable' and criticizing it as preaching only to converted audiences. However, low confidence due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show is limited in appeal, offering occasional humor but largely disposable content. The lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning necessitate a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a mixed reaction, with the humor being dependent on the audience's perspective. The phrase \"as of-the-moment disposable\" indicates a lack of lasting impact, leading to a mixed classification. | Kimi: The critic characterizes the show as exclusionary and its content as disposable, comparing it unfavorably to fleeting social media posts and suggesting it offers minimal substantive value despite the occasional chuckle. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
