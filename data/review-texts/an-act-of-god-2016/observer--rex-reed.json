The 'doesn't always live up to' suggests disappointment with the overall show despite the lead performance. | GPT-4o: The review praises Jim Parsons' performance but indicates that the material itself is lacking, leading to a mixed overall impression. | Gemini: The review praises Jim Parsons' performance but notes that the material is lacking, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic praises Parson's committed performance and energy but notes the material is inconsistent. This represents a qualified recommendation to see the show for the star performance despite script weaknesses.",
