    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative verdict criticizing the show as superficial spectacle lacking emotional substance. The 'too much/not enough' structure emphasizes fundamental flaws. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for lacking heart and specificity, while being overly noisy and glittery. This indicates a negative assessment, though not a complete pan. | Gemini: The review uses contradictory language, stating the show is both too much and not enough, indicating a mixed reaction. | Kimi: The critic delivers a concise negative assessment citing both excessive spectacle and insufficient emotional depth and specificity, offering no redeeming qualities to balance these criticisms.",
