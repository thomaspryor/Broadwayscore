No redeeming qualities mentioned. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for lacking substance despite its visual spectacle. The tone suggests a negative assessment overall. | Gemini: The review uses negative language such as \"gaudy\", \"long on flash and short on substance\", indicating a negative assessment of the show. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the visual spectacle ('gaudy, glittery') but explicitly criticizes the lack of depth ('short on substance'), indicating a mixed assessment where production values exceed narrative weight. Confidence is low as this appears to be an excerpt.",
