  "bwwExcerpt": "So what if Stephan Elliott and Allan Scott's crude book, based on Elliott's film \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,\" panders to a crowd that doesn't need winning over? The first act works too hard and Will Swenson's voice seems to be on the verge of going on strike. Nevertheless, he's pretty winning as Tick; so is Nick Adams as Felicia. A cut above, for bringing tremendous heart to a predictable role, is Tony Sheldon as the touching Bernadette. Hats",
