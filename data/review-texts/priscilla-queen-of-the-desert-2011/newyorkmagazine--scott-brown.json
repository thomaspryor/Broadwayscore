  "bwwExcerpt": "By all accounts, Priscilla (already a venerable hit in England and Australia) aims to be a family-friendly drag-musical that's edgier than La Cage, and less edgy than, say, Kiss of the Spider Woman. I'm not sure the show's less focus-grouped moments - its second-act musicalized gay-bashing scene (set, with questionable finesse, to \"Hot Stuff\"), its many F-bombs, or its plentiful anal-sex double-entendres - are going to further that cause with the average tourist.",
