  "bwwExcerpt": "But \"Priscilla\" has a pulsing theatrical heart and soul, not least because its characters are inveterate creatures of the stage. As directed by Simon Phillips, who has been on this bus for years, the tone is warm and inclusive. \"Priscilla\" has a rich dynasty of queens, unfazed by any desert and very much at home on Broadway.",
