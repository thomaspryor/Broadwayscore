    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt highlights fundamental issues with the show's concept and execution, noting 'jarring' efforts to blend elements and 'narrative weakness.' The text appears cut off mid-sentence but suggests neither strong recommendation nor outright dismissal. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a tension between punk and Broadway elements, describing the melding as 'jarring'. While it notes a benefit in emphasizing songs over story, the overall tone suggests mixed feelings about the production's success in balancing its elements. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a mixed reception, with some jarring elements but also swift movement.
