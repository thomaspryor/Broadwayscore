    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt with mixed signals - praises vivid/imaginative qualities but criticizes as inarticulate with boilerplate content. Low confidence due to limited text and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'vivid and lurid' but also 'somewhat inarticulate', indicating a mixed impression. The lack of a clear positive or negative verdict suggests a middle-ground score. | Gemini: The review uses phrases like \"somewhat inarticulate\" and \"boilerplate discontent,\" suggesting a mixed reaction. The single excerpt makes it difficult to determine the overall recommendation, but it leans towards a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the show's visual imagination ('vivid and lurid') but ultimately criticizes it as 'inarticulate' and 'boilerplate,' suggesting uneven execution. As a single curated excerpt, the full verdict is unclear.",
