  "bwwExcerpt": "American Idiot—the rock opera version of Green Day’s 2004 pop-punk album, which opened at the St. James Theatre yesterday—is an energetic and entertaining 95 minutes. It’s fun. But it’s also, amid all the booming rock, a little dull. You’re diverted, but you’re not moved. There are archetypes and themes, but there aren’t really characters or a plot. American Idiot is a concert; it’s not a play.",

This suggests qualified entertainment value but significant artistic reservations. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'energetic and entertaining' but also 'a little dull' and lacking in characters or plot. It suggests the show is more of a concert than a theatrical play, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review calls the show \"energetic and entertaining\" but also \"a little dull\" and lacking in characters or plot, ultimately describing it as more of a concert than a play. This suggests a mixed reaction. | Kimi: The reviewer acknowledges the show is energetic and fun but criticizes its lack of plot, character development, and emotional resonance, concluding it functions as a concert rather than a play.",
