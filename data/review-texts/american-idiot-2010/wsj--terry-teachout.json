  "bwwExcerpt": "All this being the case, 'American Idiot' rises or falls almost entirely on the strength of the songs themselves, and I regret to say that I found them to be brain-numbingly dull. Perhaps I might have felt differently if I were 14, but I was all but incapable of attending to the puerile maunderings of Billie Joe Armstrong, Green Day's lyricist, of which the following specimens are representative:\n• 'Well maybe I am the faggot America / I'm not a part of a redneck agenda.'\n• 'Lost children with dirty faces today / No one really seems to care.'\n• 'Summer has come and passed / The innocent can never last.'\nAs for the music, it reminded me of an amphetamine-crazed hamster running on a treadmill.",

However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a longer review. | GPT-4o: The critic expresses strong dissatisfaction with the songs, describing them as 'brain-numbingly dull' and 'puerile maunderings.' The negative tone and lack of redeeming qualities indicate a Pan verdict. | Gemini: The critic clearly pans the songs, calling them \"brain-numbingly dull\" and comparing the music to \"an amphetamine-crazed hamster running on a treadmill.\" | Kimi: The critic condemns the show's essential element, describing the songs as 'brain-numbingly dull' and the music as resembling an 'amphetamine-crazed hamster,' indicating a strong recommendation against attendance.",
