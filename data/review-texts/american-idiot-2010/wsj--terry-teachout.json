  "bwwExcerpt": "All this being the case, 'American Idiot' rises or falls almost entirely on the strength of the songs themselves, and I regret to say that I found them to be brain-numbingly dull. Perhaps I might have felt differently if I were 14, but I was all but incapable of attending to the puerile maunderings of Billie Joe Armstrong, Green Day's lyricist, of which the following specimens are representative:\n• 'Well maybe I am the faggot America / I'm not a part of a redneck agenda.'\n• 'Lost children with dirty faces today / No one really seems to care.'\n• 'Summer has come and passed / The innocent can never last.'\nAs for the music, it reminded me of an amphetamine-crazed hamster running on a treadmill.",
