  "bwwExcerpt": "If 'Spring Awakening' was the birth of genuine rock musicals on Broadway, then 'American Idiot' is its worthy son. Not as groundbreaking or original as its precocious papa in 2006, the punk-pop opera based on Green Day's multiplatinum album is an exuberant assault - a slick and tough 95-minute package of alienated suburban youth, media overstimulation and seamless, high-concept theatricality.",
