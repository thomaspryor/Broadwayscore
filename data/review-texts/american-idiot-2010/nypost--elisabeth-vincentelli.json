  "bwwExcerpt": "The new Broadway musical 'American Idiot' starts off at a fever pitch -- and stays there. By the time it ends, 90 minutes later, you may feel more numbed than stirred. Based on Green Day's 2004 concept album of the same name, the show, which opened last night, delivers an impressive amount of terrific numbers. Many have a genuine melodic pull underneath their brash power, and they are imaginatively, punchily staged by director Michael Mayer ('Spring Awakening') and choreographer Steven Hoggett ('Black Watch'). If only we could take a breather once in a while.",

  "fullText": "Last Updated:\n 10:14 AM, April 22, 2010\n\nPosted:\n 1:55 AM, April 21, 2010\n\nAMERICAN IDIOT St. James Theatre, 246 W. 44th St.; 212-239-6200.\n\nThe new Broadway musical \"American Idiot\" starts off at a fever pitch -- and stays there. By the time it ends, 90 minutes later, you may feel more numbed than stirred.\n\nBased on Green Day's 2004 concept album of the same name, the show, which opened last night, delivers an impressive amount of terrific numbers. Many have a genuine melodic pull underneath their brash power, and they are imaginatively, punchily staged by director Michael Mayer (\"Spring Awakening\") and choreographer Steven Hoggett (\"Black Watch\").\n\nIf only we could take a breather once in a while.\n\nREAD MORE ABOUT 'AMERICAN IDIOT' ON THE THEATER BLOG\n\nGreen Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong structured the record around a very loose story that was beefed up for the stage -- but not quite enough.\n\nThe musical is about three vaguely disenfranchised 20-somethings. Johnny (John Gallagher Jr., the screwed-up guy from \"Spring Awakening\") goes to the big, bad city and starts doing hard drugs. Will (Michael Esper) is a pot-addled slacker who knocks up his girlfriend (Mary Faber). Tunny (Stark Sands) joins the Army and ends up in the Middle East.\n\nMORE: MICHAEL ESPER CHATS WITH POPWRAP\n\nThe women are little more than window dressing. Typically, Johnny's girlfriend (the vibrant Rebecca Naomi Jones, stuck in a thankless part) is referred to as Whatsername. Maybe Randomchick would have been too obvious.\n\nMayer compensates for the lack of plot by re-creating onstage the media-saturated, sensation-overloaded environment that shaped our anti-heroes. His hyperactive production buries the audience under a blizzard of images and sounds. Christine Jones' scenic design is dominated by flashing TV screens, while Darrel Maloney's projections occasionally take up the entire back wall.\n\nThe cast throws itself with gusto into the elemental movement and the songs. And there are a lot of them: The original \"American Idiot\" album -- including the hits \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" and the title track -- is supplemented with several other Green Day cuts, like last year's \"21 Guns.\"\n\nIt's all aesthetically consistent, which is why \"Extraordinary Girl\" really sticks out. In that fantasy sequence, the wounded soldier Tunny is swept up for a wire-supported aerial love ballad with a woman who takes off a burqa to reveal an outfit straight out of \"I Dream of Jeannie.\"\n\nThis nod to musical-theater conventions suggests that the punk-rock brigade isn't out to upend Broadway -- or the mainstream in general. For evidence, look no further than the encore, in which the actors, strumming acoustic guitars, reveal that an American Idiot is only a breath away from an American Idol.\n\nelisabeth.vincentelli\n@nypost.com\n\nNEW YORK POST is a registered trademark of NYP Holdings, Inc.\n\nnypost.com, nypostonline.com, and newyorkpost.com are trademarks of NYP Holdings, Inc.",
