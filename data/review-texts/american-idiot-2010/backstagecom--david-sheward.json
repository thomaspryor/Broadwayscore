  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Like  its spiritual grandfather \"Hair,\" \"American Idiot\" breaks all the   rules of musical theater. Conventional plot structure is replaced with   poetic ruminations on confusion, need, and disconnection. Mayer's   spectacular staging provides the solid framework the book lacks. Fantasy   figures fly and burst out of TV screens, scaffolding transforms into a   soul-killing office environment, and coaches become cars.\"",

However, this is only one excerpt and confidence is low due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the staging as 'spectacular' and highlights creative elements, suggesting a positive view despite noting the book's lack. The single excerpt warning and lack of full context lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review praises the staging as spectacular but notes the book lacks substance. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the 'spectacular' staging and favorable comparison to 'Hair,' while noting the book lacks framework. With only one curated excerpt available, confidence is reduced.",
