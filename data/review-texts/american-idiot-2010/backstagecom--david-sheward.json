  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Like  its spiritual grandfather \"Hair,\" \"American Idiot\" breaks all the   rules of musical theater. Conventional plot structure is replaced with   poetic ruminations on confusion, need, and disconnection. Mayer's   spectacular staging provides the solid framework the book lacks. Fantasy   figures fly and burst out of TV screens, scaffolding transforms into a   soul-killing office environment, and coaches become cars.\"",
