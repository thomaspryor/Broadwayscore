  "bwwExcerpt": "Thanks for the music, Green Day. But, jeez, could you have spared a story? And a couple characters who aren't clichéd stick figures? Because that's what a Broadway musical needs to make it more than just a music video or a concert. Unfortunately, 'American Idiot' at the St. James comes up short on those essential counts.",

However, the single excerpt limits confidence in fully capturing the review's sentiment. | Gemini: The review states that the musical is lacking in story and characters, which are essential for a Broadway musical, leading to a negative assessment. | Kimi: While acknowledging the music, the critic finds the show fails to deliver necessary Broadway elements like story and developed characters, describing it as little more than a music video.",
