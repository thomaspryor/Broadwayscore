  "bwwExcerpt": "Few could have predicted that American Idiot, the new adaptation of the band's massively popular, starkly disenchanted album of the same name, would be the feel-good musical of the season. But in the hands of director Michael Mayer, who also co-wrote the libretto with Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong, Idiot has become just that — as well as a case study in the power of teamwork in musical theater.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Calls it 'the feel-good musical of the season' and 'a case study in the power of teamwork' - clearly positive language. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential for cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt presents the show as unexpectedly positive and successful, highlighting the effective collaboration in its creation. The tone suggests strong enthusiasm, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt states that the show is the \"feel-good musical of the season\" and a \"case study in the power of teamwork in musical theater.\" This suggests a positive recommendation. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt. | Kimi: Despite the dark source material, the critic praises this adaptation as the 'feel-good musical of the season' and highlights the effective creative collaboration, indicating a clear recommendation.",
