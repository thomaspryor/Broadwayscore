  "bwwExcerpt": "I suspect that I may grow to appreciate 'American Idiot' over time, which is essentially what happened to me with 'Passing Strange.' At first, I was thrown off by the lack of coherent storytelling in 'Passing Strange.' But after listening to the album several times and then watching the filmed performance on DVD, I became able to appreciate the musical on its own terms. I even listened to the original album today on my IPOD. It's also worth pointing out that the Green Day fanbase, by already knowing the lyrics by heart, will be better able to follow the 'Jesus of Suburbia' plotline in spite of its sketchiness and fill in (or ignore entirely) all the gaps. Nevertheless, I need to be true to my gut instincts; and for the time being, will proudly air my initial grievances over the lack of character and story development in 'American Idiot.'",

The critic notes potential for appreciation over time but currently has reservations. | Gemini: The critic expresses initial grievances but also suggests potential for appreciation over time, indicating a mixed reaction.
