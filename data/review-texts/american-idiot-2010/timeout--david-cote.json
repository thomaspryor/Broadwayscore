  "bwwExcerpt": "Rage courses through the Green Day-scored American Idiot and fittingly, this andrenalized gut-punch of a musical is bound to piss you off. Whether you’re a Broadway nostalgist longing for middle-of-the-road kitsch, or a sullen teen who vicariously thrills to the show’s grimacing, bird-flipping punks, your heart will pound, your pupils will dilate, you will sweat and breathe hard. Such a state is intense but not permanent: Anger is just a drug, after all. But for the 90 minutes that American Idiot has you in its white-knuckle grasp, it will electrify and overwhelm your senses. Here’s a musical to thrash to. Goodbye, orchestra pit; hello, mosh pit.",

The key quote suggests some positive elements but also implies limitations in the adaptation, supporting a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review highlights a specific aspect of the show that works well, but also implies that other aspects are less successful. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 60/100 places this firmly in the Mixed range (55-69), and the text suggests an inconsistent show that succeeds in emotional aspects but falters when literal, aligning with 'uneven' or 'hit or miss' descriptors.",
