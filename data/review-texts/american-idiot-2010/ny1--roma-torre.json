  "bwwExcerpt": "There’s a prismatic effect to this show. Some will see 'American Idiot' as an elaborate music video for the big stage while others will find it revelatory. As a mother of a 16-year-old, I found it to be a powerful cautionary tale. As a critic, I felt I’d seen it all before and as someone who appreciates superior talent in any form, it’s quite awesome.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic explicitly presents multiple contradictory perspectives - finding it powerful as a parent but derivative as a critic, acknowledging both awesome talent and familiar territory. This balanced ambivalence places it firmly in Mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt presents a mixed perspective, acknowledging the show's potential impact and talent but also expressing a sense of familiarity. The positive elements slightly outweigh the negatives, suggesting a mild recommendation. | Gemini: The critic acknowledges seeing it all before but also finds it \"quite awesome\" due to the talent. The \"powerful cautionary tale\" aspect also leans positive, though with reservations. | Kimi: The critic explicitly describes a 'prismatic effect' with divergent reactions, personally finding it both derivative ('seen it all before') and impressive ('quite awesome'), resulting in a balanced mixed verdict. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Positive, gemini=Positive, kimi=Mixed",
