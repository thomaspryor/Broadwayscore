  "bwwExcerpt": "There’s a prismatic effect to this show. Some will see 'American Idiot' as an elaborate music video for the big stage while others will find it revelatory. As a mother of a 16-year-old, I found it to be a powerful cautionary tale. As a critic, I felt I’d seen it all before and as someone who appreciates superior talent in any form, it’s quite awesome.",
