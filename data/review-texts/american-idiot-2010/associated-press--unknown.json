    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Review divides audiences - fans will 'marvel' but others 'might want a little more.' This conditional recommendation with reservations falls in mixed territory. Low confidence due to single excerpt. | GPT-4o: The review suggests that fans of the original recording will appreciate the theatrical adaptation, but others might find it lacking in character depth. This indicates a mixed reception, appealing primarily to existing fans. | Gemini: The review seems positive for fans of the album, but suggests others might want more. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low, and the score is at the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
