  "bwwExcerpt": "Although the original concept album is reasonably cohesive, it's a thin premise on which to base a musical, and the show's book, by the band's Billie Joe Armstrong and director Michael Mayer, doesn't manage to flesh it out sufficiently. Telling its story largely through music and movement with only a smattering of dialogue, 'Idiot' never manages to make us care about the fate of its thinly drawn characters. Still, there's a lot of passion onstage, and Mayer has provided the sort of propulsive staging that helps put the material over.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Critic identifies significant structural flaws (thin premise, underdeveloped characters) but acknowledges passionate performances and effective staging. Single excerpt warning applies - this appears to represent a balanced mixed review. | GPT-4o: The review highlights issues with the book and character development, but acknowledges the passion and staging. The single excerpt provides mixed signals, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review acknowledges passion and propulsive staging, but criticizes the thin premise and failure to make the audience care about the characters. This indicates a mixed assessment. | Kimi: While the critic finds the book thin and the characters underdeveloped, the praise for the passionate performances and propulsive staging that 'helps put the material over' indicates a qualified recommendation based on the production values rather than the writing.",
