  "fullText": "By Borys Kit, The Associated Press \n\n \n\n August 25, 2010 8:00pm\n\nA new generation of talent is getting ready to tackle the high school reunion movie.\n\nChanning Tatum is working with Jamie Linden and producers Marty Bowen and Wyck Godfrey of Temple Hill on “Ten Year,” an ensemble drama about friends reuniting a decade after their graduation.\n\nLinden, who wrote “We Are Marshall,” is penning the script and will direct. He also wrote “Dear John,” which starred Tatum and was based on a Nicholas Sparks novel.\n\nTatum has been heavily involved in the development process. He also will star and join Temple Hill in producing the film with his 33andOut Prods. partner Reid Carolin.\n\nThe script is being written with specific actors in mind, with a partial list including Tatum’s wife, Jenna Dewan (“Step Up”); pals Anna Faris and her husband, Chris Pratt; Chris Pine; and Scott Porter (“Friday Night Lights”).\n\nThere are no deals in place for the actors, and involvement will depend on availability. The indie production also is assembling financing, though the filmmakers are hoping to begin shooting in November.\n\nTatum, repped by UTA and Management 360, is shooting “The Vow” with Rachel McAdams in Toronto.\n\nLinden is repped by Paradigm and Magnet Management.",
