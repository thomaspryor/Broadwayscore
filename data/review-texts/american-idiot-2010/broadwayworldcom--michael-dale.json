  "bwwExcerpt": "While our century began with inane 'jukebox musicals' that crowbarred pre-existing songs that were not written for the stage into makeshift plots (a refresher course in the genre is still being offered at The Winter Garden) American Idiot (along with the still-running Jersey Boys) shows it is possible to intelligently use such material to create a dramatically intriguing theatre piece. American Idiot may not offer an uplifting story, or even especially sympathetic characters, but most likely anyone who has gone through a youthful rebellion can see a bit of their determined, frightened, naïve and somewhat stupid selves on stage at the St. James Theatre.",
