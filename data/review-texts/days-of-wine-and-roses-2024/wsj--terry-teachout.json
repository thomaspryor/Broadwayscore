However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the show's power and the superb performances, indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt highlights the show's power and superb lead performances, indicating a positive assessment. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the show's emotional impact ('power,' 'vivid life') and lead performances ('superb'), warranting a high Positive score per the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes.",
