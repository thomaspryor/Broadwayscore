Scored at upper end of Positive bucket due to single excerpt warning and strong language, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong, positive language ('searing power', 'stirred and shaken') suggesting a highly impactful and memorable experience, indicative of a rave review. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single quote available is strongly positive, suggesting a positive review. Given the limited information, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt employs strongly positive, evocative language ('searing power,' 'stirred and shaken') suggesting an enthusiastic recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, it warrants the upper range of the Positive bucket with reduced confidence.",
