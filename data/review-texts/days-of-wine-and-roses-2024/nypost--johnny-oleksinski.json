    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - 'unquestionably absorbing' is positive but the qualifier 'thanks to its fine actors' suggests the show succeeds primarily due to performances rather than overall excellence. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for being 'absorbing' due to its actors, suggesting a positive view. However, without more context, the recommendation seems mild, leading to a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, citing the actors as a reason to see the show. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise calling the show 'unquestionably absorbing' and highlighting the 'fine actors,' indicating a solid positive recommendation in the 80-84 range despite limited context.",
