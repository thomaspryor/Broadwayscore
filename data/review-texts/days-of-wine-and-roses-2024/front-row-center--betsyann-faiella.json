    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The phrase 'astonishing artistry, sophistication and emotional depth' uses strong superlative language indicating a rave review, but confidence is low due to having only a single curated excerpt. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong superlatives ('astonishing artistry', 'sophistication', 'emotional depth') indicating a highly positive assessment. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt is extremely positive, using superlatives like \"astonishing\". Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring at the high end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers superlative praise using terms like 'astonishing artistry' and 'emotional depth,' indicating a strong positive recommendation, though the limited context of a single curated quote warrants reduced confidence. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
