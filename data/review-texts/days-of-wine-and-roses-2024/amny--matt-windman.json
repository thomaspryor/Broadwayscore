  "fullText": "Nineteen years after winning a Tony Award for the enchanting and sweeping score of “The Light in the Piazza,” Adam Guettel — the extremely gifted and adventurous composer and lyricist who also happens to be the grandson of legendary composer Richard Rodgers and son of Mary Rodgers (composer of “Once Upon a Mattress”) — has finally returned to Broadway with “Days of Wine and Roses,” another musically literate and individualized work that is far more acidic in sound and style.",
