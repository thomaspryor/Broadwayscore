  "dtliExcerpt": "The show is caught in the middle, but it’s still a beautifully directed, acted, written and composed piece about, yes, alcohol but also about our responsibility to the very few people in our lives who depend on us absolutely for their own happiness and survival. We all have them. This show might help with that.",

Watching O’Hara in particular is to be drawn as ever to her voice but also to watch her explore self-destruction in a way few of her fans ever will have experienced.",
