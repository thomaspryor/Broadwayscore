    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a strength of the production, suggesting a positive view, but lacks comprehensive context to determine the overall tone. Given the single excerpt warning, a lower score within the Positive range is appropriate. | Gemini: The excerpt is descriptive and mentions a strength, but it doesn't offer a clear recommendation. Given the limited text, it's hard to determine the overall sentiment, so I've classified it as mixed with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly cites a 'strength' in the show's handling of addiction narratives, indicating a positive critical assessment. However, as a single curated quote, it provides limited visibility into the overall verdict, warranting a conservative score at the lower end of the Positive range.",
