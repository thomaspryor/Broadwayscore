Under the direction of Lear deBessonet and with cleverly updated language by Amy Sherman-Palladino (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) this production makes a convincing case of life yet to be had in the old Mary Rodgers-Marshall Barrer score.\n\nPulling together a Who’s Who of Broadway ’24, Mattress stars J. Harrison Ghee, Cheyenne Jackson, Michael Urie, Nikki Renée Daniels, Francis Jue, David Patrick Kelly and, saving the best for last, Harriet Harris as the snooty, plummy-voiced Queen Aggravain and, in the Burnett role of Winnifred the Woebegone, the bog dweller who must prove her worthiness to marry Urie’s Prince Dauntless the Drab, Sutton Foster, having a blast.\n\nBased on the Fairy Tale “The Princess and the Pea,” Winnifred – Fred to her friends – must pass a test to prove she has the royal stuff: The son-smothering queen, to keep young Dauntless tied to her royal ribbons, devises a doomed-for-fail trial: Winnifred must sleep upon on a pile of cushy mattress with nothing to disturb but one tiny pea secreted under the bottom mattress. If she dozes, she’s out: Only a true princess would be sensitive enough to toss and turn from one little ol’ lentil.\n\nAnd guess what? Spoiler Ale…ah forget it. You know the way of Fairy Tales. There’s a happy ending, and Mattress has loads of silly fun and beautifully sung songs getting there.\n\nWith its limited run through February 4, Once Upon a Mattress will pack up its fairy tale finery well before Foster’s February 9 start in Sweeney Todd nine blocks away. Sandwiched between her delightful 2022 spin alongside Hugh Jackman in The Music Man and next month’s costarring role as Mrs. Lovett opposite Aaron Tveit’s demon barber, Foster couldn’t have found a tastier palate cleanser than Winnifred, nor a more charmed home to rest her weary, ever-so-busy head.\n\nTitle: Once Upon a MattressVenue: Encores! at New York City CenterDirector: Lear deBessonetConcert Adaptation: Amy Sherman-PalladinoMusic: Mary Rodgers Lyrics: Marshall BarerBook: Jay Thompson, Dean Fuller & Marshall BarerPrincipal Cast: Sutton Foster, Michael Urie, Nikki Renée Daniels, J.
