  "garbageFullText": "It&#8217;s easy to feel a bit smug early on in Days of Wine and Roses, as we know so much more &#8211; or at least have so much greater vocabularies &#8211; when it comes to things like toxic relationships and the role of abstinence in maintaining sobriety and all the other tenets of Bill W that have passed into common parlance and popular culture since Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick starred in the 1962 feature film version. Would the musical&#8217;s lovestruck alcoholics Kirstin Arnensen (Kelli O&#8217;Hara) and Joe Clay (Brian D&#8217;Arcy James) stood readier for battle if they&#8217;d seen so much as a single episode of Celebrity Rehab?\n\nWhatever misguided self-satisfaction we initially cling to fades fast as this cast, its director Michael Grief, book writer Craig Lucas and composer/lyricist Adam Guettel draw us into their jazzy world of Brandy Alexanders, martini lunches &#8211; what Loudon Wainwright III once described as &#8220;drinks before dinner and wine with dinner and after-dinner drinks.&#8221; We&#8217;re barely into the hour and 45 minute running time before we&#8217;ve begun to see life through the blurry, hazy lens of a couple we&#8217;ve come to know well.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\tBelow The Line\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2024 Awards Season Calendar - Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Tonys & More\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t&#039;Forbidden Broadway&#039; Satirical Revue To Make Long-Awaited Broadway Debut\n\nChalk it up to theatrical arts of the first order &#8211; acting, direction, book and Guettel&#8217;s mesmerizing  operatic bebop &#8211; that we&#8217;re soon hand-in-shaky hand with characters who haven&#8217;t a clue how to break the cycle of whiskey-ice-repeat. We&#8217;re transported back in time by Kirstin&#8217;s lovely sleeveless, A-line cocktail dress (Dede Ayite designed the costumes, showing, among other things, how you really do Barbie), a delightful look that quickly enough gives way to ratty old Baby Jane Hudson bathrobes. And watch Joe morph from Man In a Gray Flannel Suit to rumpled slob in yesterday&#8217;s slept-ins, all inhabiting a midcentury modern world, perfectly designed by Lizzie Clachan, that seems by turns airy and claustrophobic.\n\nOnly Ben Stanton&#8217;s lighting design of colored Mondrian rectangular panels stand as signals for the world beyond, the warm orange of a new morning, the deep black of an enticing New York night. Look there, those backdrops seem to tell us, there&#8217;s life out there if you&#8217;d only care to see.\n\nSomehow, despite its somber theme, Days of Wine and Roses is sumptuous from start to finish, a resplendent melding of music and acting and storytelling that dares us to confront lessons we only thought we learned ages ago.\n\nTitle: Days of Wine and RosesVenue: Studio 54Director: Michael GreifBook: Craig LucasMusic: Adam Guettel Cast: Kelli O'Hara, Brian d'Arcy James, Byron Jennings, Tabitha Lawing, Sharon Catherine Brown, Tony Carlin, Bill English, Olivia Hernandez, David Jennings, David Manis, Steven Booth, Nicole Ferguson , Addie Manthey and Kelcey Watson.Running time: 1 hr 45 min (no intermission)\n\nIf Days of Wine and Roses reminds us that recovery jargon was once as fresh as the young, bound-for-heartbreak couple at the musical&#8217;s center, Encores&#8217; scaled-down presentation of the 1959 fractured Fairy Tale Once Upon a Mattress has a daunting task all its own: To get audiences to put aside beloved memories of a youthful Carol Burnett belting out, in ancient black-and-white TV clips, her once-newfound signature song &#8220;Shy.&#8221;\n\nYou know the one &#8211; and if you don&#8217;t, watch it here. &#8220;Shy&#8221; pretty much made Burnett an overnight star, and whaddayknow, it still works magic. Under the direction of Lear deBessonet and with cleverly updated language by Amy Sherman-Palladino (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) this production makes a convincing case of life yet to be had in the old Mary Rodgers-Marshall Barrer score.\n\nPulling together a Who&#8217;s Who of Broadway &#8217;24, Mattress stars J. Harrison Ghee, Cheyenne Jackson, Michael Urie, Nikki Ren&eacute;e Daniels, Francis Jue, David Patrick Kelly and, saving the best for last, Harriet Harris as the snooty, plummy-voiced Queen Aggravain and, in the Burnett role of Winnifred the Woebegone, the bog dweller who must prove her worthiness to marry Urie&#8217;s Prince Dauntless the Drab, Sutton Foster, having a blast.\n\nBased on the Fairy Tale &#8220;The Princess and the Pea,&#8221; Winnifred &#8211; Fred to her friends &#8211; must pass a test to prove she has the royal stuff: The son-smothering queen, to keep young Dauntless tied to her royal ribbons, devises a doomed-for-fail trial: Winnifred must sleep upon on a pile of cushy mattress with nothing to disturb but one tiny pea secreted under the bottom mattress. If she dozes, she&#8217;s out: Only a true princess would be sensitive enough to toss and turn from one little ol&#8217; lentil.\n\nAnd guess what? Spoiler Ale&#8230;ah forget it. You know the way of Fairy Tales. There&#8217;s a happy ending, and Mattress has loads of silly fun and beautifully sung songs getting there.\n\nWith its limited run through February 4, Once Upon a Mattress will pack up its fairy tale finery well before Foster&#8217;s February 9 start in Sweeney Todd nine blocks away. Sandwiched between her delightful 2022 spin alongside Hugh Jackman in The Music Man and next month&#8217;s costarring role as Mrs. Lovett opposite Aaron Tveit&#8217;s demon barber, Foster couldn&#8217;t have found a tastier palate cleanser than Winnifred, nor a more charmed home to rest her weary, ever-so-busy head.\n\nTitle: Once Upon a MattressVenue: Encores! at New York City CenterDirector: Lear deBessonetConcert Adaptation: Amy Sherman-PalladinoMusic: Mary Rodgers Lyrics: Marshall BarerBook: Jay Thompson, Dean Fuller & Marshall BarerPrincipal Cast: Sutton Foster, Michael Urie, Nikki Ren&eacute;e Daniels, J.
