'Struggles to find its dramatic footing' suggests significant structural issues that outweigh performer praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performers but notes the show struggles dramatically. The single excerpt and text quality warning suggest a mixed review with some positive elements. | Gemini: The review praises the performers but states the show struggles. Given the limited excerpt, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation, but it leans towards mixed. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the considerable talents of the lead performers, the emphasis on the show struggling to find its dramatic footing indicates a fundamental flaw in the adaptation that prevents a recommendation.",
