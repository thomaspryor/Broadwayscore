    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the production positively but with measured language ('stylish and efficient' rather than enthusiastic praise). Given the excerpt warning and moderate praise language, scoring at lower end of Positive range with low confidence due to insufficient context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a mildly positive evaluation of the production's style and efficiency. However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of a full review, the confidence is low, and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, describing the production as \"stylish and efficient.\" Given that it's the only excerpt, I'm scoring it as mildly positive with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers restrained but definite praise for the production's direction, suggesting competent recommendation without rhapsodic enthusiasm. Single excerpt limits certainty of overall verdict.",
