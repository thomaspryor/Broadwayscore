    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a serious tone ('sobering evening') without clear positive or negative evaluation. With only one excerpt and no clear recommendation, it falls into the Mixed bucket. | Gemini: The phrase \"sobering evening\" implies a serious and thought-provoking experience, which is generally positive, but the single excerpt and lack of context make it difficult to assess the overall sentiment with high confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt describes the show as 'sobering,' indicating it effectively conveys serious subject matter with gravity. Limited text suggests mild approval but prevents stronger assessment.",
