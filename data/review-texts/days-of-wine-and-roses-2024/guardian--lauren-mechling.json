  "fullText": "Song-heavy adaptation of the bruising 1962 Blake Edwards drama about a couple grappling with addiction makes for a surprising success It’s probably a good thing there’s no intermission in Days of Wine and Roses, the musical adaptation of Blake Edwards’s 1962 film. The harrowing and hugely captivating Broadway production wastes no time diving into the toll that alcoholism takes on married couple Kirsten and Joe Clay, and it’s doubtful any audience member would be inclined to pony up for a mid-show sippy cup of Chardonnay. Director Michael Greif’s production is shot through with heartache and hangovers, and worth all the squirming in your seat. Twenty-one years in the making, this version of the classic starring Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick incorporates music that manages to underscore the mood without watering down the story’s intensity. The songbook (music and lyrics by Adam Guettel) is full of minor keys and suffused with a darkness that is rare for a star-studded Broadway extravaganza (Kelli O’Hara and Brian d’Arcy James carry the show). No matter how gorgeous the voice of O’Hara – who sings the majority of the tunes – nobody bursts into a larger-than-life medley. (Though a bouffant and bombed Kirsten’s manic and musical vacuum cleaning session comes pretty close.) The script and songs bleed into one another, with plenty of opera-like sing-talking that strikes a smart and serious tone. For all their sophistication, these numbers are low-slung and moody, and likely won’t appear on your favorite Peloton instructor’s upcoming Showtunes-themed playlist. Korean war vet turned PR dynamo Joe (played by James, who inhabits his role with mid-century machismo) meets spritely and initially Sprite-sipping Kirsten at a work event. When we first lay eyes on Joe, he is aboard a booze cruise filled with the smorgasbord of comely women he has arranged for his bosses’ pleasure. He homes in on the innocent and beautiful executive assistant. Over dinner, he introduces her to the twin powers of male attention and Brandy Alexanders, which taste like the chocolate bars that had been her vice until now. “It makes you feel good,” he tells her. “I already feel good,” she retorts. But she takes the plunge, sip by sip, and starts to feel infinitely better. Until, well, you know how this goes. Their love story takes little time in morphing into a tangle of codependence and torment. The underlying horror is offset by Lizzie Clachan’s snappy and chic set design that calls to mind Mad Men, and a parade of fabulous hairdos styled by hair and wig designer David Brian Brown. While Kirsten and Joe are unraveling in the spotlight, supporting cast members dart by in the shadows, appearing as either nattily attired bartenders ready to freshen a cocktail or solitary men self-soothing with their flasks. With only two possible landing points, stories of addiction can feel predictable, but O’Hara and James are an intoxicating tag team. They play their parts with bottomless feeling, and their addiction is matched with a reserve of love and forgiveness. This is not a story of secret drinkers. Kirsten and Joe are in their own form of open marriage, ecstatically complicit in each others’ self-destruction. They have a daughter, Lila (the terrific Tabitha Lawing), but they only have eyes for their love triangle with themselves and anything 80 proof. While such dramas tend to chart a familiar course, with a broken soul portrayed taking one wrong turn too many, Kirsten and Joe bring a novelty to the battle-with-the-bottle story. All the inevitable promises and relapses, the false starts and bleary-eyed lie-ins come with raw dialogue that cuts through the maudlin cliches. Absent from the story is the overblown anger and disappointment that typically attends addiction dramas. When Joe finds Kirsten in a motel, where it appears she has been keeping company with a bottle of gin and other men, he is not let down. He just wants to find his way back to her. But “the world looks so dirty to me when I’m not drinking,” she says with such brokenness and clarity it’s hard to fault her for her choices. Greif’s production soars above after-school special level “problem pieces” and serves up something equally sobering and zippy. The story ends in a heap of fragments and fissures. As we exited the theater, my date was simultaneously upset and electrified. “I’m not sure if I really want a drink or don’t have to want one for a very long time.” We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could support the Guardian at this crucial time for journalism in the US. In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one. From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced. While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts. While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel. Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less. But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.",
