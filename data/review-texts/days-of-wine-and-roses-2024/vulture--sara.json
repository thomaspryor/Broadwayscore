  "dtliExcerpt": "So why, with such a radiant double center, does Days of Wine and Roses feel constrained, a little narrow and flat? Despite all that vocal brilliance—and the leads’ real chemistry—the show evokes a specific kind of quietly disheartened sigh. It’s the sound of great talents put in the service of material that will almost expand to accommodate them, but not quite, and it’s a very common sound on Broadway.",
