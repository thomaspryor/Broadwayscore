Despite the single excerpt warning, the language used is indicative of a highly positive response. | Gemini: The phrase \"searing power that leaves you both stirred and shaken\" suggests a positive experience, but the single excerpt and lack of full context warrant a score in the middle of the 'Positive' bucket.",
