  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Director Michael Grief moves the proceedings along at a steady pace but is unable to overcome the pitfalls of script. Adding fourteen musical numbers and four reprises to a storyline reduces the time necessary to develop the depth of these intense characters and situations. The timeline moves at lightning speed, from first date and first drink to disintegrating marriage and raging alcoholic with no time to examine why this happens.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt criticizes fundamental structural problems - the script's pitfalls, rushed character development, and inadequate examination of key dramatic elements. However, this is only one excerpt and may not represent the full verdict, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights significant issues with the script and character development, suggesting a negative view. However, without the full review, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt criticizes the script and pacing, indicating a negative overall assessment. The lack of full text and potential cherry-picking of the quote reduces confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the show's book and structure, noting that musical numbers reduce character development time and the timeline moves too fast without examining motivations. While acknowledging the director's pacing, the overall assessment finds the script fundamentally flawed.",
