  "bwwExcerpt": "The Iowa featured in the new musical 'The Bridges of Madison County' is flat indeed but, oh boy, the voices soar. Kelli O'Hara and Steven Pasquale come just short of blowing the roof off the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre in this touching doomed romance that features a superb, thrilling score by Jason Robert Brown. Brown, the talented composer behind '13,' 'The Last Five Years' and 'Parade,' has never had a real New York hit. This should be it.",
