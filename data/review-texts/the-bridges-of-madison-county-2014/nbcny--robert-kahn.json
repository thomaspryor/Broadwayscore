  "bwwExcerpt": "The engaging new musical 'The Bridges of Madison County,' now open at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, left me wondering two things. First: Can Kelli O'Hara do anything? And second: Are we so starved for affection we're willing to give over our hearts to a story that is - sorry, folks! - utterly preposterous? Even after swooning over the book? And sighing over the movie? The answers: Indeed, Kelli O'Hara can do anything, darn near perfectly, including transform herself into a chestnut-haired Italian beauty who, for the better part of two decades, has assumed the role of an Iowa housewife. And, apparently ... yes. We are suckers for a good love story, no matter the form, and even when it's likely we recall the outcome.",
