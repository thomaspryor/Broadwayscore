  "bwwExcerpt": "My eyes rolled a bit, I must confess, at the prospect of a Broadway musical based on Robert James Waller's sentimental 1992 bestseller,The Bridges of Madison County (which also inspired a 1995 film with Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood). But I must also admit that those same jaded eyes, by the end of the show, had misted up more than once; and judging from the waves of muffled sniffles around me, this was not an uncommon response. Marsha Norman and Jason Robert Brown's adaptation earns those tears. The musical's emotion is unapologetically grand, and its love story has a wide, old-fashioned scope. Directed with spare precision by Bartlett Sher-reunited with his most of his South Pacific design team­-it's a new work that plays like a classic.",

The original rating of 60 supports this classification. | Gemini: The review is mixed, describing the musical as \"perfectly decent\" and \"respectful, competent\" but also noting that it doesn't find its own voice. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60/100 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory, describing the show as 'competent' and 'decent' but lacking its own voice and feeling 'beside the point'—neither recommending nor discouraging attendance.",
