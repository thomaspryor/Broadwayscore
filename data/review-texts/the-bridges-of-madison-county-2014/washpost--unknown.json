  "bwwExcerpt": "As it is, the tale of a desolate Neapolitan immigrant - distracted from her cold Iowa marriage by a hunky visiting magazine photographer - comes across as rather shaky scaffolding, in a sometimes affecting adaptation of Robert James Waller's best-selling novel that opened Thursday night at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre...But the bony narrative does acquire rewarding flesh whenever O'Hara - veteran of 'The Pajama Game,' 'South Pacific' and 'The Light in the Piazza' - is given a chance to express, in a poignant lyric or hushed speech, the sensual awakening her Francesca Johnson experiences in the presence of the picture-taker, played by the smoldering Steven Pasquale.",
