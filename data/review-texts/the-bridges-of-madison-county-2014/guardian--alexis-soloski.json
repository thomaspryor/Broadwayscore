  "bwwExcerpt": "Wisely, composer/lyricist Jason Robert Brown, book writer Marsha Norman and director Bartlett Sher attempt to mitigate the book's high-flown verbiage and fantastical air...They work well enough together, but in attempting to moderate the novel's silliness, they've shorn the material of some of its import. Brown favours simple, string-heavy compositions that soar only intermittently and feature a puzzling lack of duets...O'Hara is as sumptuously voiced as ever and dazzles in the biographical number Almost Real. Pasquale is implausibly hunky and an able, emotive singer himself. Unfortunately, they seem more like best pals than fervid lovers, the companionable vibe enhanced by chaste choreography that suggests that sex is best achieved with jeans zipped and buttoned.",
