  "bwwExcerpt": "It's very well cast. Hunter Foster, as the decent but culturally limited husband, is a strong presence. But of course, it's all about the lovers. Stephen Pasquale is excellent. As a charming, troubled soul, he sings with the kind of power and conviction that leaves no doubt a new star is born. And the stunningly gifted Kelli O'Hara should win her fifth Tony nomination with this role, the most finely tuned of her illustrious career, and she sings her heart out. Yes, it's a soap opera, but an irresistible one; and if you're in the right mood, expect to be utterly smitten.",
