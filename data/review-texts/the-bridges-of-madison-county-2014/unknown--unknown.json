  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"From beginning to end, Baldwin beautifully sings Jason Robert Brown's score throughout the show...Lazar's intense and passionate portrayal of Robert made audiences root for him, even though his character was put into an awkward position...Baldwin and Lazar's scenes both together and apart were equally as incredible, showing how talented they truly are... Hunter Foster directs a production with excellent actors, beautiful music, and a story that will resonate with audiences for years to come. Anyone who has the opportunity to see this musical in person will love every minute of it.\" \n\nRead more",
