  "bwwExcerpt": "Bartlett Sher's production, which opened Thursday night, is merely a mixed bag, one in which cringe-inducing bits alternate with moments of musical-theater nirvana. Despite the trepidation around her casting, all of the grace notes have to do with O'Hara. Not only does she deliver a finely tuned performance, but she also inspired composer Jason Robert Brown ('The Last Five Years') to new heights. He tailored her character's numbers to his star's range and sensibility, and her songs, like 'What Do You Call a Man?' and 'Almost Real,' have a heartbreaking beauty.",
