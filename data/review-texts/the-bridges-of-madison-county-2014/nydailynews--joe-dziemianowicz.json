  "bwwExcerpt": "The equilibrium and mood return when the lovers are center stage. The Irish O'Hara evokes Naples with a dark wig and a convincing Italian accent. She gives a performance of rare and radiant grace. Pasquale, who starred with O'Hara last year Off-Broadway in the misfire 'Far From Heaven,' has the rugged good looks made for the part. He matches her moment by moment with his virile vocals.Like the story's brief but enduring romance, 'Bridges of Madison County' and its blissfully beautiful score and shimmering star turns stay with you well after the last lovely notes fade.",
