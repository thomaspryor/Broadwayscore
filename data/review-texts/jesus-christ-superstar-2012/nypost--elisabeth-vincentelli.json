  "bwwExcerpt": "Like any good icon, Nolan’s Jesus exerts a pull that’s both spiritual and physical. [...] Without a strong underlying theme, the show feels like a busy patchwork of styles and references. [...] Hearing excellent singers deliver these tunes through powerful, crisp amplification is a primal thrill. Next time, McAnuff may even get the story right.",
