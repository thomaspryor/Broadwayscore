  "bwwExcerpt": "This 'Superstar' began life at The Stratford Shakespeare Festival and then had a final tuneup at the La Jolla Playhouse. McAnuff deserves credit for trying to make the story relevant -- a ticker at the beginning even counts back the years from 2012 to A.D. 33 for those unfamiliar with history -- but with its defiant fringe kids, boxy set, blinding lights and sneering cynicism, he ends up making it feel more like 'Rent.'",
