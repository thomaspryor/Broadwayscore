The qualification 'can tolerate' indicates significant reservations. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the appeal of the score but suggests a significant reservation about the staging, indicating a mixed recommendation. | Gemini: The review recommends the show for those who love the score but acknowledges the staging may be off-putting, indicating a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The critic uses strong positive language ('blessing') but qualifies the recommendation with the caveat that viewers must be able to 'tolerate' the 'bombastic' staging, indicating a solid but not unreserved endorsement. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
