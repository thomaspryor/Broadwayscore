But others might feel cheated by the lack of consistent sense in this tale of a woman, Yeon-i (Yoon Jin-seo), whose husband, Jin-woo (Yoo Ji-tae), has fallen into a coma, leaving her in a state of half-mourning. Enter hubby’s unsuspecting identical twin, Jin-ho (Yoo again), who himself recently emerged from a coma; from there, Ryu Hoon-i’s melodrama shifts from portrait of grief to labyrinthine erotic thriller.\n\nIn the film’s initial stages, Yeon-i’s languid existence seems leached of animation or color, shot in beige half-tones. But when Jin-ho appears, lethargy and ennui give way to chaos and ambiguity. Once Jin-woo awakens from his coma (right after his brother has screwed his wife, natch), it’s virtually impossible to tell at any given moment which twin is courting, stalking or making love to Yeon-i, particularly when it’s revealed that the twins switched identities earlier, in scenes glimpsed in flashback. Yoon and Yoo previously appeared in Park Chan-wook’s “Oldboy.”"
