  "bwwExcerpt": "In its move to Broadway's Helen Hayes Theatre—even though this is one of the Main Stem's smallest houses—director Sheryl Kaller's tender staging has lost most of its intimacy. Fortunately, 'Next Fall' retains its power to move. Nauffts, artistic director of Naked Angels, the company that produced the Off-Broadway run, is an actor himself, and he knows how to create roles of depth and complexity. No one is a villain or a hero here, as each character brings his or her own backstory and set of values to the conflict. Nauffts makes no judgments. The homophobic yet loving father is treated with the same compassion shown to the secularly driven Adam and the purpose-searching Holly, Adam's friend and sometime employer at her candle shop. The playwright also wisely keeps the saccharine to a minimum. What could easily have turned into a gay version of a Lifetime TV movie is instead an honest portrait of realistic people.",
