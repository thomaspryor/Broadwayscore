The tone indicates a negative assessment overall. | Gemini: The review acknowledges good intentions and a sincere cast, but ultimately finds the comedy 'more forced than felt,' indicating a mixed or neutral assessment. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the cast's sincerity and the worthy message but finds the execution 'forced' rather than emotionally authentic, indicating a failed production that does not recommend viewing. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
