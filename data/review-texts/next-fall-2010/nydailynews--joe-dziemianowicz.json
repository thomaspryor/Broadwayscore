  "bwwExcerpt": "For a play that begins with a young man lying in a coma with a head injury after a traffic accident, there's certainly no shortage of laughs in the opening moments of 'Next Fall.' Or, for that matter, throughout its subsequent two hours, when things turn even graver for the patient. Which begs the question: Can a serious drama be seriously funny? In the case of this gay love story, it can, due to Geoffrey Nauffts' sitcom leanings. It can be seriously didactic, too.",
