  "bwwExcerpt": "While 'Next Fall' is a rather quiet and modestly-scaled play, it reaches a dramatic peak when confronting the uncomfortable tension between religious faith, sexuality and family. At one point, Adam confronts Luke with the brutal observation that, 'if Matthew Shepard hadn't accepted Jesus Christ before he died, he's in hell, and his killers who, say, have, are going to heaven.' Sheryl Kaller's production showcases sensitive performances that capture the heart and sadness inherent in the play.",
