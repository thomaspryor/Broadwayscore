  "bwwExcerpt": "Sheryl Kaller’s direction is savvy enough, as are Jess Goldstein’s costumes. Wilson Chin’s set design contends valiantly with the frequent changes of locale, and the acting is mostly good. Only Adam’s intended charm seems to me undercut by Patrick Breen’s machine-gun delivery and cadaverous looks. Patrick Heusinger, however, is thoroughly appealing as the boyishly affectionate and fearful Luke.",
