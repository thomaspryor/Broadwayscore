  "bwwExcerpt": "If a generous spirit and the courage of one's convictions were all it took to craft a great play, then Next Fall would be Pulitzer Prize material... The characters are redolent of archetypes and clichés we've encountered too many times before. Adam, a whiny, wisecracking urbanite with hypochondriac tendencies, suggests an early Woody Allen protagonist without the self-effacing charm, and Patrick Breen's monochromatic performance hardly makes him more appealing.",
