  "bwwExcerpt": "The play, which had a successful run last summer at Playwrights Horizons' small theater, is something of a risk on Broadway today. No stars. A playwright who's not well-known, although he has extensive acting credits and is artistic director of the theater company, Naked Angels. Don't let the lack of celebrity deter you. 'Next Fall' is expertly cast, enormously entertaining and even laugh-filled despite the underlying seriousness of its subject matter.",
