Single excerpt with apparent truncation makes full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the musical is good but not great, with some unexciting numbers and missed opportunities in song style. The tone is mixed, acknowledging both strengths and weaknesses. | Gemini: The review states the musical is \"good\" but not \"great\", indicating a positive but not rave review. The mention of \"less-than-rousing numbers\" suggests reservations. | Kimi: The critic explicitly calls the show a 'good musical' while noting specific shortcomings that prevent it from achieving greatness, indicating a qualified but genuine recommendation. Given this is a single curated excerpt that cuts off mid-sentence, confidence is reduced.",
