The single excerpt suggests more criticism than praise. | Gemini: The review calls the show a \"Broadway clunker\" despite acknowledging some good moments. Given the limited excerpt, the negative sentiment is clear enough to place it in the negative bucket. | Kimi: While the excerpt acknowledges soaring musical moments, the critic's damning label 'Broadway clunker' and complaints about 'cluttered and muddled' dances indicate an overall negative recommendation. Low confidence due to single excerpt availability and truncated text.",
