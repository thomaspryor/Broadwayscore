    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Critic identifies major structural flaws (inconsistent tone, cartoonish characters lacking subtlety) as 'the biggest problem.' However, single excerpt warning applies - this could be from a larger mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights significant issues with consistency and tone, suggesting a negative view. However, due to the single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt points out inconsistency and unfunny characters, indicating a mixed experience. The lack of a clear recommendation and the negative tone suggest a score in the mixed range. | Kimi: Single available excerpt criticizes lack of defining tone and cartoonish characters, but text is truncated mid-sentence where it may pivot to positive elements, preventing definitive classification. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Negative, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Mixed",
