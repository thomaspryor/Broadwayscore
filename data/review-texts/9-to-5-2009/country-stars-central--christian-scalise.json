    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clear praise for multiple production elements (choreography, music, costumes, set). However, confidence is low due to single curated quote that may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the choreography, musical scores, and set changes, indicating a positive view. However, the text is limited, so the confidence is low, and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the choreography, musical scores, and costumes, indicating a positive experience. However, the mention of \"adjustments from the Broadway version\" and \"downscaled play\" suggests potential reservations, so I've placed it in the lower end of the positive bucket.",
