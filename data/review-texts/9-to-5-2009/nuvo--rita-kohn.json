Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed on the higher end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt is highly positive, praising the production's humor, performances, and character development. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the production's comedic writing and ensemble performances, describing the show as 'zany' and full of 'sharp one-liners.' However, confidence is reduced due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt with truncated text.",
