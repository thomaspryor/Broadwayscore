  "bwwExcerpt": "Typical scenes concern Pee-wee's love affair with Chairry, the female armchair our boy sits on, embraces and is hugged by; Jambi, the bodiless swami's head that lives in a box; and Pterri the Pterodactyl, who flits about arousing Pee-wee's yearning to fly. The plot, such as it is, hinges on the possible wiring of The Playhouse for Pee-wee's computer, which turns out to be a very bad idea indeed.",
