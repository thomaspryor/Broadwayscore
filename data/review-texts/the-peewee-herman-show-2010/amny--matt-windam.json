  "bwwExcerpt": "This is essentially an updated version of Reubens' original stage show, which in turn inspired the film \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" and the Saturday morning television series \"Pee-wee's Playhouse.\" There's not much of a plot, but the show is overloaded with atmosphere and laughs.",
