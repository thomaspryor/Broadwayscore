  "bwwExcerpt": "Bringing Pee-wee back is an act of courage in defiance of the media’s puritanical twittering; it is also a great relief to his legion of fans, who, on the night I saw the show, were whooping it up long before Pee-wee skittered onstage like a bow-tied water bug, his face clenched in its familiar rictus of surprise and delight.",
