  "bwwExcerpt": "The result is a nostalgia trip that will appeal most immediately to those who followed Pee-wee in his heyday - they were well represented at a recent preview, where audience members hooted in rhapsodic recognition each time a character was introduced. But to their credit, Reubens, collaborating writers Bill Steinkeller and John Paragon and directorAlex Timbers recapture the gently subversive goofiness that made the brand work, and add contemporary flourishes.",
