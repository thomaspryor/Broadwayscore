  "bwwExcerpt": "Ignoring Reubens’s checkered career, which is irrelevant to the show, here’s the toughest critical call: Is Pee-wee right for middle schoolers and younger kids? There is material that walks the line between naughty innuendo for adults and goofy gags for the children. One masturbation joke (which predates the Florida movie-theater incident) will go sailing right over young’uns' heads. If you bring a nine-year-old to the event, they’ll probably find plenty funny, but just as often, they may ask what Mom and Dad are laughing at. I leave it to you to make that judgment. Pee-wee will never grow up, and for 90 minutes at least, you won’t have to either.",
