  "bwwExcerpt": "Mr. Reubens's Broadway debut is, among other things, a comeback attempt, two widely publicized run-ins with the law having forced him into involuntary semiretirement. With $3 million in the box-office till to date, it looks like a success. I'm fine with that: Mr. Reubens has paid his debt to society, and this show, adroitly directed by Alex Timbers, the co-creator of 'Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,' is good for plenty of laughs. Appearances to the contrary, however, 'The Pee-wee Herman Show' is not really a children's show, so don't bring the kids unless you're prepared to do a fair amount of heavy-duty explaining.",
