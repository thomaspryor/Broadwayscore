However, the lack of superlatives or strong recommendations keeps it in the mid-positive range. | Gemini: The review suggests the show is enjoyable, but also acknowledges its \"creakiness,\" indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The critic praises the production's clever blend of old and new theatrical styles and celebrates its artifice, indicating a favorable verdict despite the excerpt's brevity.",
