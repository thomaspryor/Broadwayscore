However, this is only a single excerpt which limits confidence in the full review's verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is strongly negative, describing the play as a 'disaster' and 'unfunny,' with no redeeming qualities mentioned. This indicates a clear pan. | Gemini: The review excerpt explicitly calls the play a 'disaster' and 'unfunny farce,' indicating a strong negative assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt deploys devastating language ('disaster', 'unfunny', 'clumsiness') with no redeeming qualities mentioned. While a single excerpt may not capture the full review, the word 'disaster' indicates a strong pan.",
