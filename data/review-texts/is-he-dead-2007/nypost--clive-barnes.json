Clear pan despite single excerpt warning - language is unambiguously devastating. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is strongly negative, describing the play as a 'disaster' and 'unfunny', with no redeeming qualities mentioned. The language used indicates a deep pan. | Gemini: Extracted from malformed response | Kimi: The excerpt employs devastating language ('disaster,' 'unfunny,' 'clumsiness') to unequivocally condemn the production, placing it in the Pan range. Confidence is low given only a single curated excerpt is available.",
