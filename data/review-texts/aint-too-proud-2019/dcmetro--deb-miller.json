  "bwwExcerpt": "Ain't Too Proud is a stellar production that elevates the quality of jukebox musicals with its engaging story and direction, top-notch performances, sophisticated design, and a selection of high-voltage choreographed hits that keeps the legacy of Motown alive and 'Temptation strutting.' It's a good-time crossover show for fans of the music who will love to see it performed on the Broadway stage.",
