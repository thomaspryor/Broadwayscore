Single excerpt warning suggests using upper end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('stellar production', 'top-notch performances') and highlights the show's engaging story and direction, suggesting an enthusiastic recommendation. However, given the single excerpt warning, confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"stellar production\", \"top-notch performances\", and \"keeps the legacy of Motown alive\". The critic also calls it a \"good-time crossover show\". | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('stellar', 'elevates', 'top-notch performances'), placing it in the upper range of Positive, though the recommendation is qualified for music fans. Single-excerpt limitation reduces confidence.",
