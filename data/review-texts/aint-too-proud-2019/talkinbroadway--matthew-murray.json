    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt suggests qualified recommendation - praise for the music catalog but implies issues when music isn't featured. Low confidence due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the show's reliance on the Temptations' music, indicating enjoyment, but lacks broader context or enthusiasm. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of Positive. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests the music is a strong point, implying a positive but potentially qualified recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise, suggesting the production succeeds primarily through its musical numbers rather than its book or dialogue, but ultimately finds the catalog strong enough to carry the show.",
