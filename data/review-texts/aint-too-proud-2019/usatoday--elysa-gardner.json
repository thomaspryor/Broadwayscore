Concert comparison suggests missing dramatic depth rather than outright recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review praises the musical elements but criticizes the show for lacking a fully realized theatrical experience, suggesting a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like 'smooth moves' and 'smoother harmonies' but ultimately finds the show lacking as a 'fully realized theatrical experience,' indicating a mixed assessment. | Kimi: Single excerpt shows a 'yes, but' structure: praises the performances (moves, harmonies) but criticizes the show's lack of theatrical depth, comparing it unfavorably to a concert rather than a fully realized musical.",
