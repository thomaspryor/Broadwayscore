  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Ain't Too Proud\" arrived on Broadway Thursday night buoyed by a surge of nostalgia and a slew of Motown hits. But anyone who's seen the earlier jukebox shows \"Jersey Boys\" or \"Motown: The Musical\" is bound to feel a dull sense of déja vu.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise (acknowledging Motown hits and nostalgia) but warns of derivative nature and 'dull déja vu.' Very low confidence due to limited text - full review verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a lack of originality and excitement, comparing it unfavorably to previous jukebox shows. However, the limited excerpt and lack of a clear positive or negative verdict lead to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a sense of familiarity and lack of originality, implying a mixed reception. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges the show's nostalgic appeal and hit songs but criticizes its lack of originality compared to similar jukebox musicals, warning of a 'dull sense of déja vu.' With only one excerpt available, the overall verdict remains unclear, but the tone suggests disappointment with the show's unoriginality.",
