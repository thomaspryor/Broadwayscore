    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise - 'succeeds handsomely' is positive but 'doesn't quite achieve' shows notable reservations. With only one curated quote available, confidence is low and score reflects the cautious positive assessment. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt praises the musical aspect of the show but notes a lack of dramatic depth. The positive elements are emphasized, but the reservations prevent a higher score. Given the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive experience, but the phrase \"doesn't quite achieve the dramatic depth\" suggests a reservation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Isherwood offers solid praise for the musical elements ('succeeds handsomely,' 'extraordinary musical legacy') but qualifies the recommendation with criticism of the dramatic book, creating a positive but not rave verdict.",
