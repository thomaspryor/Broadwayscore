The positive elements outweigh the reservation. | GPT-4o: The review praises the performances as 'stellar' and highlights the vocal and choreographic skills, indicating a positive recommendation. The mention of a formulaic story suggests some reservations, but the overall tone is positive. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, highlighting stellar performances, but notes the story feels formulaic, indicating a reservation. This places it in the positive bucket with a score reflecting the reservation. | Kimi: The critic offers strong praise for the performances ('stellar', 'remarkable') and choreography ('all the right moves'), but tempers enthusiasm with a reservation about the formulaic story, indicating a solid but qualified recommendation.",
