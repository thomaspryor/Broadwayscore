    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows measured praise for set design, dancing, and ensemble cast, though notes some trade-offs. Text cuts off mid-sentence, limiting confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights positive elements like the set and ensemble performance, though it notes a slight cost to vocal precision. Given the single excerpt and lack of a full review, the score is on the lower end of Positive with low confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights positive aspects such as the set design, dancing, and ensemble cast, but also mentions a potential cost to vocal precision. Due to the limited text, confidence is low, but the overall tone suggests a positive recommendation with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise—appreciating the energetic staging and shining ensemble while noting only utilitarian success for the songs and minor vocal trade-offs. As a single curated excerpt with truncated text, confidence is low and the score sits at the lower end of the Positive range per guidance.",
