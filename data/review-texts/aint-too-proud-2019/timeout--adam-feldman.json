    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this firmly in Mixed territory. The excerpt praises performances but appears truncated - the full review likely contains reservations that balance the praise. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 suggests a mixed review. The quote praises the music and performances but does not provide a strong recommendation for the show overall. | Gemini: The review focuses on the strength of the music and performances, but doesn't offer a clear recommendation. Given the 60 rating, it's classified as mixed. | Kimi: The critic's explicit rating of 60 places this firmly in the Mixed bucket (55-69). While the excerpt praises the musical performances highly, the moderate numerical score indicates significant reservations about other elements of the production not visible in this brief snippet.",
