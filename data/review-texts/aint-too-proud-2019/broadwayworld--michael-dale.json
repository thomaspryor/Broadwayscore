However, text is clearly truncated mid-sentence, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises both the music and the storytelling, suggesting a strong positive impression. The mention of Morisseau's 'well-crafted storytelling' alongside 'great Motown songs' indicates a solid recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt limitation. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the storytelling as important, but the limited text and single excerpt make it difficult to gauge the overall recommendation strength. I'm placing it in the lower end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for both the Motown songs and the book, calling the storytelling 'well-crafted' and referencing the playwright's 'brilliant' previous work, indicating a solid recommendation despite the limited available text.",
