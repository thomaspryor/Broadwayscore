  "bwwExcerpt": "'Ain't Too Proud,\" the new Temptations jukebox biomusical, is a Broadway musical for people who don't like Broadway musicals-or maybe for people who like only jukebox biomusicals. The score, which includes such chart-topping hits of the '60s and '70s as \"My Girl\" and \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone,\" is terrific, as are the singing and pit band, but Sergio Trujillo's choreography is way too slick-the real-life Temptations moved like street-corner kids from Detroit, not glammed-up 42nd Street gypsies-a",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Praises the music and performances but criticizes the choreography as inauthentic. The opening line suggests it's not quite a proper Broadway musical. Single excerpt with apparent truncation makes full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the score and performances but criticizes the choreography as being too slick. The mixed elements suggest a balanced view without a clear recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the score, singing, and pit band, but criticizes the choreography. The overall tone suggests a mixed experience, leaning slightly positive due to the emphasis on the music. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers strong praise ('terrific') for the score and singing but levels significant criticism at the choreography; truncated text and cherry-picking risk warrant low confidence and a conservative score at the lower end of the Positive range.",
