    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive verdict calling it 'superior' and 'less pedestrian,' but acknowledges 'limitations' and criticizes the 'workmanlike book.' Single excerpt with truncated text warrants low confidence and lower positive score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates that the show is superior to a previous production, suggesting a positive assessment. However, it acknowledges limitations in the book and narration, indicating reservations. The single excerpt and text quality warning lower confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the show is superior to a previous production but has limitations, suggesting a positive but not rave review. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic considers this production superior to the comparable 'Motown: The Musical' but raises substantial concerns about the workmanlike book and exhausting narration style. As a mildly positive single excerpt with truncated text, this falls in the lower Positive range.",
