  "bwwExcerpt": "There's some overlap here with 2015's Motown: The Musical, which covered a broader swath of the legendary hit factory's history. But this is the superior show, less pedestrian in its storytelling, if not without its own limitations.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls it 'the superior show' compared to Motown: The Musical and praises it as 'less pedestrian in its storytelling,' indicating a positive recommendation. However, significant reservations about the 'workmanlike book' and 'limitations' keep this in the lower Positive range. Low confidence due to truncated text cutting off mid-sentence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive comparison to a previous production, indicating it's a superior show despite some limitations. However, the single excerpt and text quality warnings suggest caution, leading to a lower confidence and score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review states that this show is superior to another, but mentions limitations. Given the truncated text, I'm scoring it as positive with reservations. | Kimi: The critic favors this production over 'Motown: The Musical' calling it 'superior' and 'less pedestrian,' but levies significant criticism at the 'workmanlike book' and exhausting narration, suggesting a qualified recommendation rather than enthusiastic praise.",
