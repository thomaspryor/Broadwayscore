  "bwwExcerpt": "Oh no, the heart sinks, another jukebox musical on Broadway. So many-Cher, Donna Summer-have been varying degrees of cringe. But after leaving Ain't Too Proud: The Life and Times of The Temptations, which opened tonight at the Imperial Theatre (to November 24), a happy revelation: This jukebox musical not only has life, it also has wit, intelligence, while also looking stunning and full of energy.",

However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt expresses a strong positive reaction to the show, highlighting its wit, intelligence, and energy. Despite the initial skepticism about jukebox musicals, the critic finds this production to be a 'happy revelation.' | Gemini: Despite initial skepticism, the critic expresses a \"happy revelation\" and praises the show's wit, intelligence, visuals, and energy. The single excerpt is strongly positive, suggesting a recommendation. | Kimi: The critic overcomes initial skepticism about jukebox musicals to deliver an enthusiastic verdict praising the show's wit, intelligence, visual design, and energy.",
