More Photos »\n\nOMG, everybody, they’re doing instant makeovers at the Broadway Theater. First, this scruffy fox and raccoon suddenly turn into total studmuffins in satin suits. And then — this is the best part — this girl’s lame, retro peasant-chic outfit is transformed, right before our eyes (and while she’s singing), into a red-carpet ball gown. Make that two ball gowns: one white and one gold.\n\nFollow @NYTimestheater for theater news and reviews from Broadway and beyond.\n\nSantino Fontana and Laura Osnes as Topher and Ella in “Cinderella.” More Photos »\n\nYou may have gathered by now that “Cinderella,” that ultimate and most enduring of makeover shows, is back in town. Specifically, it’s “Rodgers & Hammerstein’s Cinderella” (Broadway productions wear their labels on the outside these days), a work that started out as a made-for-television musical in 1957 and has since been restyled more often than a nervous movie star during Oscar week.\n\nTo my surprise the Academy Awards came to mind quite often as I watched this glittery patchwork of a show, which has a new book by Douglas Carter Beane and is directed by Mark Brokaw. It wasn’t just the parade of big-skirted, Technicolor dresses in the ball sequence that inspired such reflections, or the presence of a fairy godmother (poor Victoria Clark) in a humped, sparkly number that would have sent Joan Rivers into overdrive.\n\nNo, the main and most affecting parallel is how these two productions were confronting the knotty problem of being both traditional and up to date in a culture that has no tone to call its own. Like this year’s Oscar host, Seth MacFarlane — who croons like the 1950s and quips like the 2010s — this “Cinderella” wants to be reassuringly old-fashioned and refreshingly irreverent, sentimental and snarky, sincere and ironic, all at once.\n\nAllow me to add quickly that this “Cinderella,” which stars an earnestly pretty Laura Osnes in the title role and an appealingly goofy Santino Fontana as her prince charming, is by no means as long or embarrassing as the Oscars (although the second act does drag on for 10 minutes longer than it needs to). But for a show that’s hawking T-shirts that read “I can be whatever I want to be” (a Hammerstein lyric), it doesn’t seem to know quite what that is.\n\nSuch uncertainty may not bother the little girls in tiaras (you can buy your own in the lobby) who are the show’s target audience. Or even the grown-ups from different generations who have warm childhood memories of one of three television versions of “Cinderella”: the first one from 1957, starring Julie Andrews (who had just wowed Broadway as Eliza Doolittle); the 1965 version that introduced a dewy Lesley Ann Warren (that would be my “Cinderella”); and a 1997 remake with Brandy.\n\nThe keynote songs from the original have been retained. And anyone who swooned however many decades ago over “Ten Minutes Ago,” the prince and Cindy’s musical equivalent to Romeo and Juliet’s “palmers’ kiss” scene, will find that it is sung quite fetchingly here.\n\nBut a lot has been added and deleted. (Extensive revisions, by the way, have been made in every version of this “Cinderella” that followed its inception.) Some lesser-known songs from the Rodgers & Hammerstein catalog have been jimmied in (including “Now Is the Time,” a rousing call for social change that was cut from “South Pacific”).\n\nThere’s been a whole lot of fiddling with the plot too to give it politically progressive substance and those mandatory messages about self-esteem and self-empowerment. The prince’s parents (played by Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon in 1965) have been eliminated, replaced by a devious and manipulative regent figure, Sebastian (the droller-than-droll Peter Bartlett), who tricks the naïve prince, called Topher, into signing bills that repress and rob his people.\n\nSo when Cinderella finally gets the chance to talk to her dream date at that immortal ball, instead of whispering sweet nothings, she says, “You need to open your eyes to what’s happening in your kingdom.” (Maybe she should be renamed Che-erella.)\n\nLike the reinvented cartoon fairy-tale heroines of the past several decades, from Disney’s “Little Mermaid” onward, this Cinderella is no passive damsel waiting for a rescuing knight. She takes charge of her destiny, so much so that she doesn’t lose that glass slipper; she hands it to the prince. It’s a conscious choice, see; she controls her narrative. And, by the way, the prince must undergo a similar process of re-education, which will allow him to conquer his self-doubts and introduce democracy to his kingdom.\n\nBroadway Theatre\n \n 1681 Broadway\n New York , NY 10019 Map &raquo;\n\nTicket Information\n $45-$137\n Telecharge: 1-800-432-7250 or 212-239-6200; http://www.telecharge.com\n Buy Tickets\n\nBillions of dollars have poured into the continent to fight killer diseases.

Single excerpt warning noted - this sounds genuinely positive rather than cherry-picked, warranting upper-positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the musical as 'satisfying' and 'fresh,' indicating a positive recommendation. The lack of full context and single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach, but the language is clearly positive. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive experience, describing the show as \"satisfying\" and \"fresh.\" The phrase \"old-fashioned musical theater\" suggests a traditional approach, which might not appeal to everyone, hence the \"with reservations\" verdict. | Kimi: The excerpt uses unambiguously positive evaluative language ('satisfying,' 'fresh,' 'sweetness') to endorse the show as a successful blend of traditional and contemporary elements. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced per guidelines, but the clearly positive tone warrants the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
