    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive assessment calling it 'satisfying' with praise for feeling 'fresh' while maintaining 'essential sweetness'. Single excerpt warning noted - this sounds genuinely positive rather than cherry-picked, warranting upper-positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the musical as 'satisfying' and 'fresh,' indicating a positive recommendation. The lack of full context and single excerpt warning suggest a cautious approach, but the language is clearly positive. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates a positive experience, describing the show as \"satisfying\" and \"fresh.\" The phrase \"old-fashioned musical theater\" suggests a traditional approach, which might not appeal to everyone, hence the \"with reservations\" verdict. | Kimi: The excerpt uses unambiguously positive evaluative language ('satisfying,' 'fresh,' 'sweetness') to endorse the show as a successful blend of traditional and contemporary elements. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced per guidelines, but the clearly positive tone warrants the upper end of the Positive bucket.",
