    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear praise for production values ('feast for the eyes and ears', 'sumptuous', 'truly magical'). Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds clearly positive so scoring upper Positive range, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong positive language, describing the production as a 'feast for the eyes and ears' and 'truly magical'. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"feast for the eyes and ears\" and \"truly magical experience,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic language ('feast,' 'sumptuous,' 'truly magical') to praise the production design, indicating a clearly positive view of the visual elements, though the single-excerpt format limits certainty about the overall verdict.",
