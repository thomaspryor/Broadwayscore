    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with clear praise for production values ('feast for the eyes and ears', 'sumptuous', 'truly magical'). Set confidence to low due to single curated quote warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a highly positive evaluation of the production's visual and auditory elements, describing it as a 'feast' and 'truly magical.' However, given the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"feast for the eyes and ears\" and \"truly magical experience,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket, but with low confidence due to the limited text. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's design elements, describing it as a 'magical experience' with 'sumptuous' costumes and sets, indicating a strong positive recommendation despite the limited context.",
