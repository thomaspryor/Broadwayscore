  "bwwExcerpt": "As a meditation on disability it's a lot more sophisticated than what's on offer just up the road in Side Show, but under Scott Ellis's brisk, stylish and slightly hollow direction, the ideas never seem emotionally connected to the experience of the characters. The dramatic events - a crisis of confidence and conscience for Treves, a scandal involving an uncorseted Mrs Kendal - seem obvious contrivance on the part of the playwright rather than incidents demanded by character and circumstance. And yet what does that matter? Well before opening, the show had set box-office records. So step right up, ladies and gentlemen, and see something that will astonish and amaze you: a bona fide Hollywood star in nothing but his skivvies. Really, why bother with a play at all?",
