  "bwwExcerpt": "There's nothing subtle about the conceit, but it still works four decades later. And the credit for that belongs to Cooper, who was nominated for Oscars for 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 'American Hustle.' To reflect Merrick's physical ravages, the Hollywood A-lister twists and holds his body in punishing positions. For two hours, he forges his mouth into a misshapen O and labors to speak. Grim stuff. But the production boasts ample humor, largely due to Cooper's delivery.",
