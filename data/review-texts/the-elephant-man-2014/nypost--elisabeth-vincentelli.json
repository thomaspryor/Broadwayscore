  "bwwExcerpt": "The ever-fine Clarkson is a marvel of sympathetic restraint. The tender way in which Mrs. Kendal disrobes for Merrick, who's never seen a naked woman, is one of the most moving moments in the show. 'The Elephant Man' isn't a great play, especially in the way it openly tugs at the heartstrings. But when it's performed well, it's satisfying on a primal level. And yes, it's OK to cry.",
