  "bwwExcerpt": "In Ellis's efficient production, first staged two years ago in Williamstown with the same lead actors, the audience is, obviously, tasked with imagining Merrick's disfigurement. Some theatergoers will suggest that you can't look at Cooper and 'not' see a movie star, People magazine's 2011 'Sexiest Man Alive.' They'll be wrong, but that's beside the point. Cooper humanizes a man few at the time were willing to treat as human.",
