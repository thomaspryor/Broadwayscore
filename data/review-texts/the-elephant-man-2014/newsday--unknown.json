  "bwwExcerpt": "But [Cooper] has long been determined, even oddly obsessed with John Merrick, the hideously deformed man who rose from freak-show monster to high-society pet in Victorian London. And we say good for him and his smashing, heart-ripping portrayal. And good enough for Bernard Pomerance's 1977 philosophical adventure story, which, as always, is better on the theatrical adventure than on its fuzzy philosophy. Cooper, arguably the most beautiful creature to play ugly in the multi-award- winning drama, fully justifies the hyped-up anticipation in his first Broadway turn since getting lost in Julia Roberts' shadow eight years ago in 'Three Days of Rain.'",
