  "bwwExcerpt": "Never seen The Elephant Man onstage? Then the Broadway revival of this 1977 play, by Bernard Pomerance, will provide a palpable sense of the drama's clear storytelling and elegant dismantling of Victorian hypocrisies. The two-act evening also provides a chance for audiences to gawp at a shirtless Hollywood celebrity, Bradley Cooper, just as 1880s London gaped at the severely deformed man he is portraying, Joseph (here John) Merrick. What the cast, under the direction of Scott Ellis, does not bring out so well is Pomerance's humour.",
