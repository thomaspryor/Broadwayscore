  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Part of what makes this revival so absorbing is that you don't always know where to lookat the actor on stage or the same actor live on screen. The giant images tug at your eye; you sometimes can't help choosing them over the small, real person who is actually there. In this revival, itself a kind of re-production, that doesn't feel like a gimmick or a trick. It's a new way to see an old dream.\"",

However, due to the limited text, the overall verdict is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises Scherzinger's performance, indicating a positive, though incomplete, assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performer's stage presence and vocal ability, indicating positive elements, but as a curated excerpt without the full verdict or broader production assessment, confidence must remain low.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Thus described, Lloyd’s approach may sound academic—but in practice, it is often thrilling. The original production was famous for the lavish excess of its set and costumes. Here, by contrast, designer Soutra Gilmour’s set is mostly blank space, and she costumes most of the cast in basic black and white streetwear, sometimes with athletic socks pulled high. (When the ensemble performs Fabian Aloise’s sharp choreography, it looks a bit like an updated Gap ad.) Even Norma wears just a satiny black slip. This is Sunset, stripped. But you don’t miss the frills: Jack Knowles’s excellent lighting—and the video design by Nathan Amzi and Joe Ransom—fill out the scenes with ample film-noir atmospherics and help Lloyd shape the staging for maximum narrative and emotional impact. Not for nothing has the title been tightened to Sunset Blvd.",
