  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Part of what makes this revival so absorbing is that you don't always know where to lookat the actor on stage or the same actor live on screen. The giant images tug at your eye; you sometimes can't help choosing them over the small, real person who is actually there. In this revival, itself a kind of re-production, that doesn't feel like a gimmick or a trick. It's a new way to see an old dream.\""
