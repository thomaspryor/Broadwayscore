    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong praise for lead performance ('nails the comedy', 'inhabiting'). Given single excerpt warning and clear positive language about star performance, scoring upper end of Positive bucket, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights Scherzinger's performance positively, suggesting a recommendation based on her portrayal. However, the single excerpt and lack of a full review limit confidence in the overall sentiment. | Gemini: The single excerpt praises Scherzinger's performance. Without more context, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation, but the positive tone suggests a positive review. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers clear, specific praise for Nicole Scherzinger's performance, stating she 'nails' the character's comedic delusion and ego. As an isolated curated quote about only one element of the production, this indicates a positive assessment but with limited context for the full show.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Lloyd’s revival proves we don’t need a live rendering of Norma Desmond’s gaudy wardrobe, or a large spiral staircase for her to traipse down. He gives us all the pieces to make new meaning of Webber’s classic musical, and asks us to take up the challenge. As Sunset’s aspiring screenwriter Betty Schafer (Grace Hodgett Young) sings directly to the house, breaking the fourth wall, “Audiences are smarter, smarter than you think.”"
