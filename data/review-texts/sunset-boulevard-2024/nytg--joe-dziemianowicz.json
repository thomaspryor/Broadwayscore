    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows positive language ('pulls you into a theatrical universe all its own', 'spiked with humor') but acknowledges staging issues ('not always clear where moments are happening'). However, this is a very limited excerpt making confident assessment difficult. | GPT-4o: The review highlights a unique theatrical approach but notes confusion due to the no-scenery aesthetic. The mix of serious story and humor suggests a mixed verdict. The lack of full text and curated excerpts lead to low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive experience, highlighting the unique theatrical universe created by the production and noting the presence of humor despite the serious nature of the story. However, the lack of full text and the mention of a 'no-scenery aesthetic' potentially causing confusion introduces some reservations, lowering the confidence. | Kimi: The critic praises Jamie Lloyd's immersive direction and the production's effective use of humor, though notes the minimal scenery occasionally obscures the setting. Overall tone is appreciative but the excerpt limits certainty about the full verdict.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Scherzinger, in bare feet and a black slip, could use a shade more vulnerability as past-her-prime Norma. But she shows off powerhouse pipes in the show's best songs, her crowd-rousing solos “With One Look” and “As If We Never Said Goodbye.” Scherzinger makes the most of the show’s in-your-face camera concept. She mugs, flashes her expressive eyes, whips her hair, and breaks into a Valley Girl vocal fry. The camera loves her. That’s the point. Lloyd’s ingenious reimagining puts Norma where she’d kill to be — on screen.",
