  "bwwExcerpt": "Lloyd flips those weaknesses into strengths: The songs that previously seemed like filler material are bulked out with angular, crisp dancing and now register as cris de coeur about the cruel vicissitudes of Hollywood. And the small circle of characters feels more dimensional than ever, with strong supporting turns by David Thaxton as Norma’s devoted, threatening butler and Grace Hodgett Young as the winsomely ambitious studio employee Betty Schaefer. It’s among the most remarkable aspects of Scherzinger’s performance that she creates space for Tom Francis, the appealing and gifted actor playing doomed writer Joe Gillis. (Like his three main castmates, Francis reprises the role after appearing in the West End production.) It’s through Joe’s eyes that we see Norma; he’s a broke and unemployed scribe who finds in Norma an easy mark. Together, they’re working on her comeback vehicle, one that Joe knows will go nowhere even as he gladly takes Norma’s money. As written, there’s a touch too much film-noir chill to the exchange: That Norma and Joe are mutually using one another is apparent, and somewhat thin gruel for an evening of theater.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with qualified praise ('wicked contemporaneity', 'genuinely seductive') but the 'though' suggests contrast with unstated criticisms. Low confidence due to incomplete context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the character Norma, highlighting 'wicked contemporaneity' and 'seductive streak.' However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, describing Norma as having a \"wicked contemporaneity and a genuinely seductive streak.\" Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence and a score on the lower end of the bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise with strong positive descriptors ('wicked contemporaneity,' 'genuinely seductive streak'), placing it in the upper Positive range per the single-excerpt guidance, though limited context necessitates low confidence.",
