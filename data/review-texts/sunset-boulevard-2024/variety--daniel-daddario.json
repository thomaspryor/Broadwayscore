    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with qualified praise ('wicked contemporaneity', 'genuinely seductive') but the 'though' suggests contrast with unstated criticisms. Low confidence due to incomplete context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view of the character Norma, highlighting 'wicked contemporaneity' and 'seductive streak.' However, due to the single excerpt warning and lack of full context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is positive, describing Norma as having a \"wicked contemporaneity and a genuinely seductive streak.\" Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence and a score on the lower end of the bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unambiguous praise with strong positive descriptors ('wicked contemporaneity,' 'genuinely seductive streak'), placing it in the upper Positive range per the single-excerpt guidance, though limited context necessitates low confidence.",
