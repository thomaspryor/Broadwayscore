    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show 'dazzles' but emphasizes that the effect doesn't last, leaving audiences 'stirred and empty.' This is a classic mixed verdict - acknowledging spectacle while questioning lasting impact. Single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's dazzling quality but suggests a lack of lasting impact, leaving the audience feeling 'stirred and empty'. This indicates a mixed reception with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the dazzling spectacle but suggests a lack of lasting emotional impact, leading to a mixed assessment. The truncated text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The review acknowledges the production's visual dazzle and immediate impact but emphasizes a lasting sense of emptiness and lack of emotional resonance, using the metaphor of Joe Gillis (the dead protagonist) to suggest the experience doesn't sustain beyond the theater.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Scherzinger’s ravenous performance provides a great part of the adrenaline, but the show is also jolted into new life by the collision of the spartan Lloydiverse with all the plush and purple of Lloyd Webber’s score. Chu described the composer as, in the ’80s, mounting a kind of maximalist coup on musical theater in the name of the operatic notion of primo la musica: “Nothing—neither plot nor character, not social issues, not even good taste—would be more important,” she wrote about his shows, “than what happened when that invisible beam of music shot across the darkened theater into their souls.” Productions of Lloyd Webber’s aspirations to Puccini have long tended to put a hat on a hat. The music throbs and flourishes; so does the stage, loaded up with gondolas and chandeliers, fog and fashion and fur and roller-skates. Lloyd, true to form, runs the other way. He and his collaborators, the set and costumes designer Soutra Gilmour, and the lighting designer Jack Knowles and video designers Nathan Amzi and Joe Ransom, craft a spare, echoing dungeon, girded by towers of LEDs. (This kind of seeming minimalism is its own circus trick, costing as it does millions of dollars.) Inside Gilmour’s vast, deceptively empty box, Knowles, Amzi, and Ransom’s incredible work is, in and of itself, a liquid, high-octane form of scenery. They’ve kept little but the fog.",
