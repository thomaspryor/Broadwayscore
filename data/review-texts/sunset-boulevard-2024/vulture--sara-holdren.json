    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show 'dazzles' but emphasizes that the effect doesn't last, leaving audiences 'stirred and empty.' This is a classic mixed verdict - acknowledging spectacle while questioning lasting impact. Single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's dazzling quality but suggests a lack of lasting impact, leaving the audience feeling 'stirred and empty'. This indicates a mixed reception with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the dazzling spectacle but suggests a lack of lasting emotional impact, leading to a mixed assessment. The truncated text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The review acknowledges the production's visual dazzle and immediate impact but emphasizes a lasting sense of emptiness and lack of emotional resonance, using the metaphor of Joe Gillis (the dead protagonist) to suggest the experience doesn't sustain beyond the theater.",
