    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt uses clearly negative language ('overblown melodrama', 'ostentatiously minimalist', 'vividly colorless') but with only one curated quote available, the full verdict is uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show negatively as 'overblown melodrama' and 'vividly colorless,' suggesting a lack of enthusiasm. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses negative language like \"overblown\" and \"colorless,\" suggesting a negative assessment of the production. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt employs oxymoronic descriptors to harshly criticize the show's melodramatic material and pretentious direction, indicating a clear negative assessment. Confidence is low due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review.",
