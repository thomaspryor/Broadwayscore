    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Strong praise for the lead performance using superlative language ('tour de force'), but this appears to be a very brief excerpt with no broader production assessment, warranting low confidence. | GPT-4o: The review praises Scherzinger's performance as a 'tour de force', indicating a highly positive evaluation. However, the text is an excerpt, so the confidence is low due to lack of context about the overall production. | Gemini: The review uses the phrase \"tour de force\" to describe the performance, which indicates strong praise and a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt employs the highest-tier praise ('tour de force') without any caveats, indicating an unreserved rave for the central performance. Confidence is low due to the brevity of the excerpt. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
