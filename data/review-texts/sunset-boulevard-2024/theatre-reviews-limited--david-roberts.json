    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a thematic observation but lacks clear evaluative language about the production's quality. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine a strong recommendation or dissuasion. | Gemini: The single excerpt is open to interpretation, but it suggests a serious and thought-provoking experience, which leans towards a mixed or slightly positive assessment. Given the limited context, I'm placing it in the middle of the mixed range. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as an effective meditation on serious themes, suggesting appreciation for its artistic weight and impact, though the single curated quote limits certainty about the full verdict.",
