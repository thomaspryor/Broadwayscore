    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praises a specific performer moment, but lacks context for overall show assessment. Given the limited text and praise for one element, this suggests a qualified positive recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises a specific moment as memorable, suggesting a positive impression. However, due to the limited text and single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt praises a specific performance as \"one of the most memorable stage moments.\" Given the limited text, I am scoring it as positive, erring on the higher side due to the strong praise. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains strong praise ('most memorable') for a specific production element, indicating a positive recommendation. Limited to one curated quote, so scoring at the upper end of the Positive bucket per guidance.",
