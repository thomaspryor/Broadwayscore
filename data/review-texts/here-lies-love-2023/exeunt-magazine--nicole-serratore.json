    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show's emotional power but explicitly states they cannot properly assess it due to limited viewing. This suggests neither clear recommendation nor discouragement. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights a powerful emotional moment but expresses a desire to see more to fully assess the show. This suggests a mixed impression with some positive elements. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates the show has a powerful emotional impact, but the critic wishes they had seen more to fully assess the production. Given the limited text, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the show's emotional power ('shocking', 'cannot shake', 'has the power'), indicating a clear positive response to what was seen. However, the critic explicitly notes they could not see enough to fully assess the production, qualifying the recommendation. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
