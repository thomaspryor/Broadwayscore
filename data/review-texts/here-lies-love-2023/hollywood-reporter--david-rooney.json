However, with only a single excerpt, the overall sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The single excerpt focuses on the immersive staging, which is a positive aspect of the show. Given the limited information, a mildly positive score is appropriate. | Kimi: Single excerpt describes the production design in appreciative terms ('gleaming,' 'transforms'), suggesting mild approval of the staging concept, though the full review context and explicit recommendation are unavailable.",
