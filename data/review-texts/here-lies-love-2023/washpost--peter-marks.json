  "bwwExcerpt": "I was glad I chose a spot on the floor. Things do get a bit crowded, although nowhere near as claustrophobic as the original downtown version of the show in 2013. Fatboy Slim’s jolting tunes, melodic and insistent, send scintillating vibrations through your nervous system; you can’t help but plug into the production’s current. Since the show is more party than parable, the management might want to consider a few more minutes of music after the curtain calls. Because “Here Lies Love” is the kind of stimulant that makes you believe you could dance all night.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: This excerpt is purely descriptive of the staging concept and format, with no evaluative language or recommendation. Given it's a single curated excerpt with no clear positive or negative assessment, and the warning about potential cherry-picking, I cannot determine the critic's actual verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the immersive and transformative staging, suggesting a positive experience. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low, and the score is at the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the staging as \"immersive\" and transforming the theater into a \"glittering nightclub.\" While positive, it's a single excerpt, so confidence is low and the score is in the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the production with mildly positive language ('glittering,' 'immersive'), suggesting the staging concept succeeds, but lacks explicit recommendation or broader evaluative context due to single-excerpt limitations.",
