    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt describes show as 'both dazzling and troubling' - classic mixed language that neither recommends nor discourages. Low confidence due to single curated quote that may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'dazzling and troubling,' indicating a mix of positive and negative elements. Without the full review, it's unclear if the overall tone leans more positive or negative, leading to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as \"dazzling\" and \"a fitting tribute,\" which suggests a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic offers strong praise ('dazzling,' 'fitting tribute') suggesting a recommendation, though the 'troubling' descriptor and the single-excerpt context warrant a mid-range Positive score rather than a rave. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
