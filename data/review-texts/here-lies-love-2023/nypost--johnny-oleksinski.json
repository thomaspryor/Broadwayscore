  "fullText": "And standing in the theater that once hosted the original production of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Evita” — a similar story about Argentina’s power-hungry first lady Eva Peron — makes you crave a stronger point of view on Marcos, rather than just an excuse for party time. The musical, somewhat shallowly, paints the woman as a kindly victim who was swept up by the decadence and momentum as much as we are.\r\n\r\nThat aside, it is indeed awfully easy to lose yourself to the glamorous escape that director Alex Timbers (“Moulin Rouge”) and his team have so splendidly built, accompanied by a devilishly catchy score.",
