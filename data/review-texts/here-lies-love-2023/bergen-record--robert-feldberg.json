  "bwwExcerpt": ": Besides the great songs, with music by Byrne and Fatboy Slim and lyrics by Byrne - the alluring title number might become permanently lodged in your brain - there's inventive choreography by Annie-B Parson, eye-catching, quick-change costumes designed by Clint Ramos, Justin Townsend's atmospheric lighting scheme and David Korins' remarkably engineered mobile stage sections.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt praises multiple production elements (songs, choreography, costumes, lighting, staging) using positive descriptors like 'great,' 'inventive,' 'eye-catching,' and 'remarkable.' However, with only one curated excerpt available, I'm scoring conservatively in the lower positive range as this could be cherry-picked praise from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The review highlights several positive aspects of the production, including the music, choreography, costumes, lighting, and stage design. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the overall sentiment is assumed to be positive but not overwhelmingly so. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights several positive aspects of the production, including the music, choreography, costumes, lighting, and stage design. While it's only one excerpt, the focus on these elements suggests a positive overall assessment, though the lack of a direct recommendation warrants a score in the middle of the positive range.",
