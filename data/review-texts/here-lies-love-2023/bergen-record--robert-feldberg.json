  "bwwExcerpt": ": Besides the great songs, with music by Byrne and Fatboy Slim and lyrics by Byrne - the alluring title number might become permanently lodged in your brain - there's inventive choreography by Annie-B Parson, eye-catching, quick-change costumes designed by Clint Ramos, Justin Townsend's atmospheric lighting scheme and David Korins' remarkably engineered mobile stage sections.",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is medium. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights several positive aspects of the production, including the music, choreography, costumes, lighting, and stage design, suggesting a positive overall experience. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm placing it in the upper range of 'Positive'.",
