Eventually catching the eye of hotshot politico Ferdinand Marcos, Imelda soon becomes both trophy wife and plausible diversion: In her Jackie O pillbox hat and speed-pill physique, she wins over the populace while hubby is stealing the country blind.\n\nImelda, played by Arielle Jacobs, is, for a quick scene or two, the brief heart in an otherwise heartless tale. No sooner is she married to handsome, charismatic Ferdinand (Jose Llana) than the sweet, naive girl from the poor side of town becomes entranced with the baubles and threads and flashbulbs and drugs and attention that set about their corrupting influences with a rapidity one should expect of a 90-minute show. Soon enough she’s building monuments to herself with money her country can ill afford, she’s sending off to places unknown a once-beloved nanny whose only crime is her memory; and she turns a blind eye to the seven-year imprisonment of political rival Ninoy Aquino (Conrad Ricamora), that young paramour from ages past left to rot in jail and, eventually, worse.\n\nSo how can a tale so depressing in description make for what will surely become one of the most popular nights on the town for New Yorkers and tourists alike  It starts with the music. Byrne and Slim (and Tom Gandey and J Pardo) have concocted some terrific blends here. There’s the pulsating American dance club music that so enthralled Filipino nightlifers, there’s a heavy dose of Filipino folk music tradition, some fairly straightforward American show tunes and – listen carefully – a dash here and there of Talking Heads-era Byrne. It all combines into a winning soundscape.\n\nBut the real pull of Here Lies Love is the staging, with a malleable performance space, an audience herded to and fro, and cast members finding perches throughout the venue. In Here Lies Love, a D.J./Emcee provides narrative segues, musical set-ups, dance instructions and how-tos for the dance-floor audience members guided here and there by pink-suited ushers holding large glow-stick-style batons.\n\nThe view from the more traditional mezzanine seats too is fine too, and might even allow for a more encompassing appreciation for Parson's choreography, which crosses cultural boundaries, historical timelines and fast-slow variations to serve the mood of any particular scene.\n\nPeter Nigrini’s video projections take full advantage of the venue’s wall space, using historical footage (and fake historical footage), closed circuit video, and clips of celebrities past to conjure both time and place. There’s even a moment (annoyingly at odds with proper chronology) when we’re transported back to the heady days of Studio 54.\n\nAll this movement requires immense technical know-how; Here Lies Love boasts the talents of David Korins (scenic design), Clint Ramos (costume design), Justin Townsend (lighting design), and M.L. Dogg & Cody Spencer (sound design), all at the top of their games.\n\nAnd no small amount of the show’s appeal is Broadway’s first all-Filipino cast, with stand-outs among the large ensemble including Llana as Ferdinand and Ricamora as the doomed idealist Ninoy Aquino. Lea Salonga, in a guest appearance as Aquino’s grieving mother through Aug. 13, lends her considerable stage presence and powerhouse voice to showstopper “Just Ask The Flowers.”\n\nAs Imelda, Jacobs plays the ambitious, starry-eyed youth pleasantly enough, and does fine in conveying the latter stages of cynical corruption. But Here Lies Love offers only a half-hearted stab at bridging the two chronological extremes of Imelda’s life, with little attempt at explaining the making of this particular political monster. Perhaps that’s why Here Lies Love, for all its impressive confidence, feels a bit thin in afterthought. Maybe a musical needs a central character who can sing “Why Don’t You Love Me?” without it coming off like an anthem to cluelessness.\n\nTitle: Here Lies LoveVenue: Broadway's Broadway TheatreDirector: Alex TimbersConcept, Music & Lyrics: David ByrneMusic: Fatboy SlimAdditional Music: Tom Gandey and J PardoPrincipal Cast: Arielle Jacobs, Jose Llana, Conrad Ricamora, Melody Butiu, Moses Villarama, Lea SalongaRunning time: 90 min (no intermission)\n\nDeadline is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2023 Deadline Hollywood, LLC.
