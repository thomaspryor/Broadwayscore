    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows mixed assessment - praises visuals and cast energy but criticizes that substance is 'overwhelmed or obliterated' by design. Low confidence due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The review praises the visual aspects and the cast's energy but criticizes the design elements for overshadowing the show's substance. The single excerpt provides a mixed impression, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the visual aspects, score, and cast commitment, but notes that the substance is often overwhelmed. This suggests a positive but qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the visual design, David Byrne's score, and the cast's energy, but delivers a significant criticism that the show's substance is 'overwhelmed or obliterated' by its production elements. With only one curated excerpt available, this suggests a mixed reception where strong individual components don't successfully cohere.",
