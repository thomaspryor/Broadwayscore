  "showScoreExcerpt": "“ ‘Here Lies Love’ is a history lesson wrapped in a tale of broken hearts and presented as engaging songs. It’s a fine alternative to traditional Broadway that’s likely to attract the younger audiences that the theater community desperately needs. If it succeeds, expect to see a lot more similarly crafted musicals in the coming years.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt warning applies - this qualified positive recommendation ('fine alternative') suggests modest endorsement but lacks enthusiasm for higher scoring within Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as an engaging and innovative alternative to traditional Broadway, suggesting a positive recommendation. The single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review calls the show a \"fine alternative to traditional Broadway\" and suggests it will attract younger audiences, indicating a positive recommendation despite being a single excerpt. | Kimi: The excerpt offers mild praise ('engaging songs,' 'fine alternative') and suggests the show fills a valuable niche for younger audiences, but lacks the superlatives of a rave review. Given this is a single curated excerpt potentially cherry-picked from a larger review, confidence is low.",
