The musical has no book, and the punchy songs paint broad strokes of the 60-year history... Still, this rollicking, form-breaking musical party is well worth an RSVP.”",

  "dtliExcerpt": "For Here Lies Love, the storied Broadway Theatre has transformed into Club Millennium, a bright, pulsating discotheque sans orchestra seats. A disc jockey (Moses Villarama) pumps up the incoming crowd as energetic ushers, clad in pink jumpsuits, play air traffic control for patrons on the dance floor. A fitting setting for a musical about the rise of a dictatorship, no?",
