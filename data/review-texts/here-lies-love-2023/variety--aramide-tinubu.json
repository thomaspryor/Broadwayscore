    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with strong positive language ('shines', 'spectacular') suggests enthusiastic recommendation, but limited to one quote reduces confidence and prevents higher score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'shining' with 'spectacular cast and staging', indicating a strong positive impression. However, due to the single curated excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is highly positive, praising the cast and staging. Given the limited text, confidence is low, but the positive language suggests a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic language ('shines,' 'spectacular') indicating strong praise for the Broadway production, but as a single curated excerpt, it is scored conservatively at the upper end of the Positive range per instructions.",
