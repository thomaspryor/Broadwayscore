Single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as an 'entertaining and enlightening' experience with high entertainment value, suggesting a strong positive impression despite not being traditional musical theater. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as \"entertaining and enlightening\" and \"almost guaranteed to impress\", indicating a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, I've scored it on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('guaranteed to impress', 'scores very high') with only a minor caveat about traditional musical theater conventions. Single excerpt availability limits confidence.",
