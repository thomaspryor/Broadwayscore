  "bwwExcerpt": "That’s achievement enough, but Here Lies Love does more. Byrne and Slim (with additional music by Thomas Gandey and José Luis Pardo) use disco-pop to tell the fraught history of former Filipino First Lady Imelda Marcos from childhood to exile. The show relies more on the vibes of each song than expository dialogue and lyrics. Projected text identifies characters and events, distilling the rise and fall of the Marcos regime into bullet points that sometimes feel like skimming a Wikipedia article – but the score and performances expand on the general mood enough to flesh out the events.",
