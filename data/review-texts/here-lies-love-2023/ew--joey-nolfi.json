    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear success verdict with 'thrilling' and dual achievement noted. Minor caveat about dazzle vs. serious intentions doesn't undermine the positive recommendation. Single excerpt limits full assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'thrilling' and 'a pointed political statement,' indicating a strong positive impression. The mention of 'disco-ball dazzle' overshadowing serious intentions suggests minor reservations, but the overall tone is highly positive. The original rating of 87 supports a high score within the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The review excerpt is positive, calling the show \"thrilling\" and a \"pointed political statement.\" The phrase \"even if\" suggests a minor reservation, but the overall tone is positive. | Kimi: The critic's explicit 87/100 rating and descriptors like 'thrilling' and 'succeeds' indicate strong enthusiasm despite a minor reservation about the production's dazzle. Single-excerpt limitation reduces confidence.",
