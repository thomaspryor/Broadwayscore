  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Some have complained that Here Lies Love glamorizes the Marcoses, an argument that is hard to credit, especially when their crimes pile up during the show's second half. With a narrative that mirrors bad fiction and a leading lady who so fully embraces her own vulgarity, what are writers to do? More to the point, a show that once came across as an amusingly lurid piece of 1980s history now seems unnervingly predictive of our own modern-day politics, with its stripper lawsuits and rape trials, its insurrections and paranoia, all fueled by a cascade of lies.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt with qualified praise - defends the show against criticism and finds it relevant/predictive, but uses measured language like 'amusingly lurid' rather than strong endorsement. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed view, noting the show's predictive nature but also highlighting its lurid and vulgar elements. The single excerpt and lack of clear positive or negative language lead to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the show is thought-provoking and relevant, despite potential controversy. The phrase \"hard to credit\" implies the reviewer is not convinced by the criticism that the show glamorizes the Marcoses. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt defends the show against glamorization charges and praises its contemporary relevance, but explicitly criticizes the narrative as 'bad fiction,' indicating significant reservations about the book's quality while acknowledging the production's political timeliness. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Mixed",
