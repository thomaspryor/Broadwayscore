  "fullText": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/here-lies-love-review-david-byrnes-dictator-disco-party-a84cc46d\n\nArielle Jacobs and the cast of ‘Here Lies Love’ Billy Bustamante, Matthew Murphy and Evan ZimmermanImelda Marcos, the infamous former first lady of the Philippines, might seem an unlikely heroine for a Broadway musical. But then so was Eva Perón, a figure with whom she has more than a little in common—and the musical based on her life became an international phenomenon.\n\nBroadway Theatre, 1681 Broadway, New York, $49-$199, 212-239-6200\n\nIn any case, “Here Lies Love,” which traces the trajectory of Marcos’s turbulent life, does not remotely resemble a traditional Broadway show. Conceived by Talking Heads frontman David Byrne, who also wrote the lyrics and the music (the latter with Fatboy Slim), the show, first seen off-Broadway 10 years ago, is a disarmingly winning hybrid of disco dance party—replete with a massive mirrored ball hovering over the proceedings—and documentary drama.\n\nThe Broadway Theatre has been transformed beyond recognition: The seats in the orchestra section have been removed, so that much of the audience watches the show while standing (or dancing), while Imelda’s life unfolds as a kind of pageant, both on the theater’s original stage and platforms around the auditorium. The central one does a fair bit of dancing itself, swiveling around in various configurations, requiring the standing audience to be hustled out of its path by stage managers wielding glowing batons—rather like airport workers guiding planes in and out of gates. (I should note that seats are also an option; having been immersed, which is to say standing, back in 2013, I opted for these, and can vouch that those who do so will not feel left out.)\n\nThe irresistible score is similarly like nothing else on Broadway, to use an exhausted phrase that is in this case the simple truth. Mr. Byrne has always been a musical magpie, and here he proffers a dizzyingly eclectic range of songs. There is melodic balladry for the numbers that explore Imelda’s rise from poverty on a provincial island in the Philippines to her fairy-tale marriage to a political up-and-comer. Once Imelda, played with radiant seductiveness by Arielle Jacobs, and her husband, Ferdinand (Jose Llana, exuding cool ambition), have secured the presidency and become beloved public figures, the party proper begins, with powerful basslines surging forth and the audience encouraged to join in the happy melee, even to the point of being given choreographic instructions.\n\nCopyright ©2025 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
