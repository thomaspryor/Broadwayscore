  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Alex Timbers' extraordinarily inventive direction of \"Here Lies Loves\" makes this musical worth seeing... David Korins's scenic design for \"Here Lies Love\" on Broadway is far more expansive than the bare-bones production at the Public, and it is immensely enhanced by Peter Nigrini's jazzy projection designs of vintage photos, documentaries and animated graphics that literally engulf the theater...No, \"Here Lies Love\" isn't about Ferdinand or Imelda or even a bygone Philippines. It's all about Alex Timbers.",

However, the single excerpt and lack of a full review suggest a conservative score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the musical is \"worth seeing\" due to the direction, but the final sentence suggests the focus is more on the director than the subject matter, indicating a reservation.",
