  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Alex Timbers' extraordinarily inventive direction of \"Here Lies Loves\" makes this musical worth seeing... David Korins's scenic design for \"Here Lies Love\" on Broadway is far more expansive than the bare-bones production at the Public, and it is immensely enhanced by Peter Nigrini's jazzy projection designs of vintage photos, documentaries and animated graphics that literally engulf the theater...No, \"Here Lies Love\" isn't about Ferdinand or Imelda or even a bygone Philippines. It's all about Alex Timbers.",
