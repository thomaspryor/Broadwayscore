Set designer David Korins has transformed the Broadway Theater into a vibrant, wild disco with moving platforms and runways which the theatergoers follow as jumpsuit-wearing techies direct them with landing lights as if they were airplanes taxiing for position.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt focuses on positive staging elements - 'innovative staging', 'vibrant, wild disco', engaging pacing. However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of positive quotes. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the innovative staging and vibrant set design, suggesting an engaging and immersive experience. The positive tone and emphasis on the fast-paced, intense action imply a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the staging as innovative and vibrant, and the fast pace as a positive attribute. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the innovative staging, fast-paced direction, and immersive design, indicating an engaging theatrical experience. As a single curated excerpt, it suggests clear positivity but warrants reduced confidence.",
