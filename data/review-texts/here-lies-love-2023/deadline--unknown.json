  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "The rambunctious new immersive musical from David Byrne and Fatboy Slim, pushes the concept to an extreme that likely won't be matched until someone has the bright idea to transform Party Monster into The Michael Alig Musical...Here Lies Love boasts the talents of David Korins (scenic design), Clint Ramos (costume design), Justin Townsend (lighting design), and M.L. Dogg & Cody Spencer (sound design), all at the top of their games.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt shows appreciation for the technical design team but describes the show as 'rambunctious' and pushing concepts to extremes, suggesting ambivalence. However, with only curated excerpts available, the full verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The review highlights the strong creative team and the ambitious nature of the production, suggesting a positive reception. However, the lack of a clear, explicit recommendation and the text quality warning lead to a medium confidence level. | Gemini: The review highlights the talent involved in the production but doesn't explicitly recommend or discourage seeing it. The comparison to transforming Party Monster into a musical suggests a potentially chaotic or niche experience, contributing to the 'mixed' classification.",
