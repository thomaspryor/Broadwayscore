  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "The rambunctious new immersive musical from David Byrne and Fatboy Slim, pushes the concept to an extreme that likely won't be matched until someone has the bright idea to transform Party Monster into The Michael Alig Musical...Here Lies Love boasts the talents of David Korins (scenic design), Clint Ramos (costume design), Justin Townsend (lighting design), and M.L. Dogg & Cody Spencer (sound design), all at the top of their games.",

However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review highlights the talents of the design team, suggesting a positive experience, but the comparison to a potential 'Party Monster' musical tempers the enthusiasm. Given the single excerpt, a conservative positive score is appropriate.",
