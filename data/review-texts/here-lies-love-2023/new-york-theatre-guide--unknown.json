As the action unfolds, stage platforms shift, audience members shuffle, and video projections display live-action crowd shots and historical documents on large screens throughout the auditorium...this rollicking, form-breaking musical party is well worth an RSVP.",

The phrase 'well worth an RSVP' indicates a recommendation to see the show, though the lack of a full review text and single excerpt warning suggests a conservative score within the positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt explicitly states the show is \"well worth an RSVP,\" indicating a positive recommendation. Due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed in the middle of the positive range.",
