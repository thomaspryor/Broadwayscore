However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available states the musical is \"worth a visit,\" indicating a positive, though possibly reserved, recommendation. Given that it is the only excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers a clear but mild recommendation ('worth a visit'), indicating the critic finds merit in the production but without enthusiastic endorsement. Confidence is low due to availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
