However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt highlights the positive energy and suitability of Alicia Keys' music for a jukebox musical, suggesting a positive experience overall, but without stronger language to push it into the 'Rave' category. Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring conservatively.",
