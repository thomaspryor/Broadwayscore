    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as 'entertaining' with praise for the star performance and creator investment, indicating a positive recommendation. Low confidence due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'entertaining' and highlights the positive contributions of Alicia Keys and Maleah Joi Moon. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, the score is placed on the higher end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the word \"entertaining\" and highlights the positive aspects of the musical, indicating a positive recommendation. Given the limited text, the confidence is medium. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise, describing the show as 'entertaining' with a 'powerhouse' lead performance, indicating a recommendation. However, given this is a single curated excerpt that may be cherry-picked, confidence is reduced and the score is placed in the solid-positive range rather than the rave or mild-positive extremes.",
