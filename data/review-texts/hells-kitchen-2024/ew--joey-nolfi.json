    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive verdict with 'succeeds' and praise for 'powerhouse performances.' Single excerpt warning noted, but combined with 87 original rating suggests strong positive assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a successful jukebox musical and coming-of-age story with strong performances, aligning with the original rating of 87, suggesting a strong positive review. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"succeeds\" and \"powerhouse performances\" indicating a positive review. Given the single excerpt warning, I am placing the score at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 87/100 places this firmly in the Rave category (85-100), and the excerpt provides unqualified praise for the show's success and vivid performances.",
