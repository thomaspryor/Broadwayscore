The single excerpt warning suggests caution. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive sentiment, describing the musical as \"deeply personal and sweepingly universal.\" Given the limited text, a score on the lower end of the positive range is appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the show's thematic achievement, warranting the upper end of the Positive bucket per the single-excerpt guidelines, though the limited context prevents higher confidence.",
