    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive language ('rousing, entertaining') and emotional engagement ('you'll find yourself cheering') despite acknowledging the story is 'kinda corny'. Single excerpt warning applies but the praise outweighs the criticism. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'rousing' and 'entertaining', indicating a positive experience despite noting the story is 'kinda corny'. The single excerpt suggests a positive tone, but the lack of full context reduces confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses positive language like \"rousing\" and \"entertaining\" and states that you'll be cheering for the character. The \"kinda corny\" comment indicates a reservation, but overall the tone is positive. | Kimi: Single excerpt uses strong praise ('rousing') and promises audience engagement ('cheering'), but includes a reservation about the story being 'kinda corny,' indicating a solid positive recommendation rather than a rave.",
