  "dtliExcerpt": "Following a sold-out run downtown, the new musical opens on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre.\n\nI never thought I would choke up at the mention of sandwiches. But there I was, near the end of\n\nIt seems like such a small moment to highlight in this spectacularly mammoth new Broadway musical featuring the songs of Alicia Keys, which just transferred to the Shubert Theatre following a\n\nRather than penning a sprawling and dubious career retrospective, as\n\nMoon is a star, instantly winning us over with her matter-of-fact line deliveries and subtly shady facial expressions. She’s a moody teen, but out of her downturned lips emanates the most beautiful and joyous voice, with Moon delivering concert-ready renditions of “The River,” “Kaleidoscope,” and “Work On It.” It is a remarkably mature performance for such a young actor, and she absolutely keeps up with the seasoned pros around her.\n\nBean brings her signature vocal pyrotechnics to the party, stopping the show with “Pawn It All.” She has real chemistry with Dixon, who seduces everyone onstage and in the audience with his interpretations of “Not Even the King” and “If I Ain’t Got You.” We know exactly why Jersey fell in love with Davis, even if he loves his career more and is willing to break her heart again and again to prove it. We cannot control our feelings, but we can control how we respond to them.\n\n“Listen to that pain. Do something with it,” Miss Liza Jane commands Ali as she gestures toward the piano bench. Kecia Lewis gives a stunning performance as Ali’s wise and stern piano teacher, who keeps playing through her own pain and is determined to pass on her knowledge before it is too late. Listening to her performance of “Perfect Way to Die” is like hearing the alto voice of God.\n\nKeys’s music has never sounded better, with top-notch vocalists in the principal and supporting cast. I was particularly wowed by Jackie Leon, who radiates pure joy as she belts out “Girl on Fire.”\n\nEverything about Michael Greif’s production has been supersized for the trip uptown. Robert Brill’s moving scaffold set is taller, conveying both the vertical sprawl of the city and allowing Greif to have actors hanging out on balconies and fire escapes. Ali is just one of millions, living and loving in the city that never sleeps. It all seems to go on forever in Peter Nigrini’s skyline projections, which are so sharp during “Empire State of Mind” you feel like you’re in a helicopter flying over Manhattan.\n\nCostume designer Dede Ayite has collaborated closely with Nigrini and lighting designer Natasha Katz so that every stage picture erupts with color and specificity: autumnal for a flashback to Tompkins Square Park, an intimate teal for the Ellington room at Manhattan Plaza, an explosion of jewel tones during “Kaleidoscope.” It all comes together to create a fairytale version of New York in the 90s, in which music videos spontaneously materialize on the street.\n\nThe orchestrations (by Tom Kitt and Adam Blackstone) incorporate onstage bucket drums with the band (heroically led by Lily Ling), amazingly without screwing up the sound balance. I suspect that sound designer Gareth Owen might be a wizard. Several times a wave of bass passed through the audience, and I swear I felt my hair woosh back.\n\nCamille A. Brown’s energetic, genre-defying choreography explodes off the stage, with dancers regularly appearing as avatars of Ali’s emotions, expressing her feelings better than any words could. All of it comes together to tell the story of a restless city teeming with unfulfilled dreams, a place that will keep moving with or without her but is happy for her to join the dance.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.
