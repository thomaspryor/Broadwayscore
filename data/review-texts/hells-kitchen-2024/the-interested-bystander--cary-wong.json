    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The single excerpt provided is positive, describing the energy as 'infectious'. However, due to the limited text and potential cherry-picking, the confidence is low and the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt is very positive, suggesting an enjoyable experience. Given the limited information, I'm placing it in the upper range of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastic language ('infectious') to praise the show's energy, indicating a clear recommendation. However, as a single curated quote, it may not represent the full review's nuance.",
