    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('vibrant', 'red-hot', 'exhilarating') with clear Broadway recommendation, but single excerpt limits confidence in full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'vibrant', 'red-hot', and 'ready for Broadway', indicating strong enthusiasm. However, the single excerpt warning suggests caution, so the score is set at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"vibrant\" and \"red-hot\", suggesting a positive recommendation. Given that it's only one excerpt, I'm scoring it as a strong positive but with low confidence.",
