However, due to the single excerpt warning, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review highlights the vibrant energy and suitability of Alicia Keys' music for a jukebox musical, suggesting an enjoyable experience. However, the limited excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation warrant a score in the middle of the 'Positive' range.",
