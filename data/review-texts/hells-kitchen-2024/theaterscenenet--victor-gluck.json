The lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates that the show has improved from a previous version, suggesting a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited text. | Kimi: Single excerpt indicates mild approval by noting improvements from a previous version, but the qualified language ('seems to have corrected some') suggests reservations remain. Limited context warrants low confidence.",
