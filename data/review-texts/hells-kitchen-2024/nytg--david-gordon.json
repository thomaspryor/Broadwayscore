    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('pulses with authentic energy', 'powerhouse vocals', 'personal and universal') aligns with the critic's 80 rating. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a positive evaluation, highlighting the show's energy, vocal performances, and relatable story. The original rating of 80 supports a solid positive classification. | Gemini: The quote is very positive, praising the show's energy, vocals, and story. Given the single excerpt and the critic's rating of 80, I placed the score at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the production's energy, vocals, and storytelling, consistent with the critic's 80/100 rating. Confidence is low due to limited excerpt availability.",
