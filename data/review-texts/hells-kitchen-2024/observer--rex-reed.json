However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more nuanced review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a highly positive evaluation, describing the show as 'rousing' and 'jubilant', with praise for Alicia Keys' songbook. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses strong positive language like \"rousing, jubilant celebration\" and \"soars\", indicating a positive review. Due to the limited text, the confidence is low, but the strength of the quote suggests a score in the upper end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise with words like 'rousing,' 'jubilant,' and 'magnificent,' indicating a strong recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, the score is restricted to the upper end of the Positive bucket per guidelines.",
