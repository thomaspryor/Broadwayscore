  "notes": "Mixed review. Noted the show 'traces the early years of Grammy-winning artist Alicia Keys, but it only scratches at the surface' and offers 'a sanitized version of young adult life instead of a gritty retelling with a bit more substance.' Praised Kecia Lewis's performance and the orchestrations by Adam Blackstone and Tom Kitt.",
