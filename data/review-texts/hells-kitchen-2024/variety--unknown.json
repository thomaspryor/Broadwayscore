However, due to the single excerpt and lack of a full review, the score is placed conservatively in the middle of the positive range. | Gemini: The phrase \"sparkling story\" suggests a positive experience, but the single excerpt and lack of explicit recommendation warrant a score in the lower end of the positive range.",
