    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The critic acknowledges 'vocalizing and dancing pleasures' but explicitly states the show is 'short of fabulous' and merely 'nice.' This suggests mild disappointment despite some positive elements. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but the dismissive 'just nice' points to mixed-to-negative sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as offering 'vocalizing and dancing pleasures' but ultimately falls short of being 'fabulous,' settling on 'nice.' This indicates a mixed review with some positive elements but an overall lukewarm recommendation. | Gemini: The review acknowledges \"vocalizing and dancing pleasures\" but ultimately finds the show \"short of fabulous.\" Given the single excerpt and slightly positive tone, a score in the lower end of the Positive bucket seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges 'ample portions' of vocal and dancing pleasures but delivers a qualified verdict calling the show merely 'nice' and 'short of fabulous,' indicating mild approval with significant reservations. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
