  "fullText": "ngs and her greatest hits. BroadwayWorld has pulled together the reviews from New York City s theatre critics. Check out what they re saying about Hell s Kitchen below! Photo credit: Marc J. Franklin Elisabeth Vincentelli, New York Times: The most exciting complement to the music is the choreography by Camille A. Brown, a Tony Award nominee for “Choir Boy” and “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf.” The movement pulses with life and is fully integrated into the show’s overall aesthetics, but it’s the attention to detail that’s memorable. As is standard for Broadway these days, the dancing is ensemble-based, but Brown and her troupe brilliantly find the individual in the group, and each one exists, like the dancer blowing gum bubbles in the middle of a number. There is, always, a sense of the person within a community, as with Ali growing up in a village known as Manhattan Plaza. That she’s back in the old neighborhood feels just right. Aramide Timubu,",
