Photo by Marc J. Franklin. The Broadway Theatre Review: Hell’s Kitchen By Ross Singing to us, like all of New York, Hell&#8217;s Kitchen , magically rising up from the ground floor of off-Broadway’s The Public Theater all the way up to Broadway&#8217;s Shubert Theatre as fast as that internal elevator can go, blossoms big and bright, delivering even stronger vibes than it did downtown. It feels like it has found its place, not surprisingly, uptown just a few blocks east of its Manhattan Plaza location. The latest jukebox musical, pulled strong from the playlist of Alicia Keys, is solidly energetic and completely electric, rising up strong and true to the highest of floors with an excitement level that erupts as the lights dim and the music begins. Ten years in the making, the Grammy-winning and classically trained Keys elevates the genre high above the standard fare of jukebox musicals with its multi-layered approach to song and movement. With a tailor-made book by Kristoffer Diaz (Public’s Hercules ) focusing on the love story between a mother and daughter, discovering yourself, your ultimate purpose, and the community that surrounds and supports you, Hell’s Kitchen lights up the stage with its drive and approach, and as directed with vision by Michael Greif (Broadway’s Dear Evan Hansen ), the music and lyrics by Keys pumps out big and loud, with a pulsating heart and soul that is hard not to be drawn in and held tight. “ She’s 17 and her brain doesn’t work, ” is the key phrase that forms the foundations of this musical’s high leveled floor, and it’s repeated round and round with authenticity by the magnificent Shoshana Bean (Broadway’s Mr. Saturday Night ) as the mother trying to hold her small Hell’s Kitchen family of two together as she works herself down into the ground. It’s no surprise that Bean kills it (in the best way possible) with every number she gets to sink that powerhouse voice and teeth into, but in many ways the musical lies majestically at the feet of the Keys stand-in, the vibrant and gifted Maleah Joi Moon (“ Mystic Christmas “) who plays Ali, the 17-year-old that drives her mother mad with love and concern. Fortunately, I got to see the impressive Moon when she led the downtown pre-Broadway run late last year, and her vocal and acting skills floored me throughout. But this time round, it was the understudy, the determined but not as steady Gianna Harris (Broadway&#8217;s School of Rock ) fighting furiously like only a 17-year-old can with her mother, while also finding Ali&#8217;s purpose and meaning playing the piano.

This is basically the story of Keys and her Manhattan upbringing, being played out in Ali’s Hell’s Kitchen . She&#8217;s living loud and rebellious inside the Manhattan Plaza Tower for artists, with a father, portrayed smoothly by Brandon Victor Dixon (Broadway’s Shuffle Along ), who has a difficult time sticking around long enough to really be of use, an overly busy and controlling mother ( Bean ), and a life-changing run-in with a piano teacher, played to beautiful perfection by Kecia Lewis (Broadway’s The Drowsy Chaperone) , in the Tower’s “ dumb, corny, all-purpose ” Ellington Room who brings Ali’s cold, wet, furious anger into full musical focus. Unlike the more complicated and unfocused Jagged Little Pill and its overdone roadmap of complications and far-too-many characters, the jukebox component in Hell’s Kitchen lives strong, rarely getting in the way of the central story. Keys keeps it simple and straightforward, for the most part, unpacking the autobiographical edge with a clarity and decisiveness that delivers it up far above the others in that crowded genre. There was only one moment, the clumsy audition scene, that felt forced in and outside the requirements of Keys&#8217; tale, but it did give Bean her moment to out-sing everyone on that stage, powering herself and her song to relevance and the highest of heights, even as we withstood the inauthenticity of the framework and staging.

But under the watchful eye of Keys, who had her talented hand in almost every aspect of the show, Hell’s Kitchen is on fire, like the teenage girl at its center (and the song that gives the show one of its best pops of color, sound, and light). I especially appreciated the jumping in of the problematic boy-centric structuring by Ali’s friend. That insert made it feel all the more thoughtful and smart, beyond anything I could have imagined when that famous song energetically brought Act One to its closing. The number, like most, feels refreshingly deliberate and required, filled to the brim with the complicated clarity of l...",
