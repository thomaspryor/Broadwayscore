The 'But it doesn't matter' suggests the music may redeem the flaws, placing this in mixed territory. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt highlights significant narrative issues but also praises the musical numbers. The mixed evaluation suggests a balance of positive and negative elements, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt presents a mixed assessment, criticizing the narrative but praising the musical numbers. This suggests a show with both strengths and weaknesses, fitting the 'Mixed' bucket.",
