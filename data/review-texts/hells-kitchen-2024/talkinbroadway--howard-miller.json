If Alicia Keys has anything to say about it, that will happen soon enough.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise for the cast and anticipates Broadway success, but notes current venue limitations. Low confidence due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast and suggests the production would benefit from a larger space, implying potential for success on Broadway. However, the single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lower confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive outlook, envisioning the show's success on a larger Broadway stage. However, the limited text makes it difficult to gauge the full extent of the recommendation, hence the 'low' confidence.",
