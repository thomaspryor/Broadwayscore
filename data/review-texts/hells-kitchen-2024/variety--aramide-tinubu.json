The following is Aramide Tinubu&#8217;s review of the show&#8217;s Off Broadway premiere published on Nov. 19, 2023 . The credits and copy have been updated to reflect any changes for the Broadway transfer. &#8220;Hell&#8217;s Kitchen,&#8221; playwright Kristoffer Diaz &#8216;s new musical with songs by Alicia Keys , begins at a dinner table. 17-year-old Ali (a magnetic Maleah Joi Moon, making her professional debut) has dinner with her mom, Jersey (Shoshana Bean), in their Hell&#8217;s Kitchen apartment every night at the same time. It&#8217;s a routine that Jersey insists on to keep Ali safe from the perils of New York City in the 1990s. But for Ali, their one-bedroom apartment on the 42nd floor feels like a cage. She longs to hang out with her friends, listen to music and flirt with an older drummer named Knuck (Chris Lee), who uses the courtyard of their Manhattan Plaza building as his stage. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-variety-article-mid-article-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\",\"mid-article\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[300,250],[2,2],[300,251],[2,4],[4,2],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Related Stories &#039;Euphoria&#039; Season 3 Trailer: Zendaya, Sydney Sweeney and Jacob Elordi Return as Rue Battles Drug Dealers, Cassie Becomes a Cam Girl and More",
