Franklin)Adoring Alicia Keys is common sense. Her artist “catalog” is more akin to a trove, spilling over with golden (and Gold and Platinum-status) treasure. The impulse to learn more about her — an action that the new musical “Hell’s Kitchen” with music, lyrics and new arrangements by Keys threadbaringly takes — is only natural. There are similarities to the crooner’s life present here — her upbringing in nefarious 1990s New York, her teenage turmoil under the surveillance of an overburdened single mother, her splintered relationship with her father — but make no mistake, this story belongs to Ali (Maleah Joi Moon), not Alicia.
