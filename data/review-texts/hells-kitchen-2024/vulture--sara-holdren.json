A jukebox plays what you’ve heard before, and though ‘Hell’s Kitchen’ is unquestionably a slick commercial machine, it’s also, with admirable frequency, able to pull off the feat of making the musically familiar feel brand new.”\n\nRead more",

Single excerpt warning applies - this appears positive but confidence is low due to limited context. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show for its ability to make familiar music feel new and highlights its commercial appeal. The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's commercial nature but praises its ability to make familiar music feel new. This suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the show's ability to refresh familiar material despite its commercial nature, indicating clear approval, though the single curated quote warrants low confidence.",
