For all the busy coming and going onstage, it is a strangely low-energy affair that never catches the streetwise, multi-ethnic flavor of Manhattan's West Side before the fancy high-rises and cute restaurants moved in”.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic finds the show 'strangely low-energy' and criticizes the director for failing to utilize the talented creative team effectively. However, this is only an excerpt, so confidence is low. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show for failing to adapt the talents of its creators to musical theatre, describing it as 'low-energy' and lacking in capturing the intended flavor. The overall tone is negative, suggesting disappointment. | Gemini: The review excerpt indicates that the director failed to utilize the talents of the playwright and songwriter effectively, resulting in a low-energy and unconvincing production. Given the negative tone, I've classified it as negative. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the director's failure to shape the material into effective musical theatre, citing low energy and a lack of authentic atmosphere. Given this is a single curated excerpt, the sentiment appears negative but confidence is reduced.",
