    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Positive language ('vibrant celebration', 'tremendous talent') but qualified by 'even if the book feels familiar', suggesting reservations. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the musical as a 'vibrant celebration' with 'tremendous talent', indicating a positive view. However, the mention of a 'familiar' book suggests some reservations. Due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is mostly positive, praising the musical as a vibrant celebration and showcasing talent, but notes the book feels familiar, indicating a reservation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic offers strong praise for the production's energy and performances ('vibrant celebration', 'tremendous talent') but qualifies this with a reservation about the book being familiar, placing it in the solid positive range with caveats.",
