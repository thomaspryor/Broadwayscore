  "bwwExcerpt": "Simply put, Curious Incident is one of the most memorable evenings you're likely to have on Broadway for quite some time. It has the same emotional impact as War Horse, but with a bit of an edge over that excellent offering. The World War I epic enthralled us with a marvelous physical production, led by those puppets; the story itself, though, was a simple if highly effective tale of a boy and his horse. Curious Incident features a production as marvelously intricate, but it is more stimulating and rewarding as a play.",
