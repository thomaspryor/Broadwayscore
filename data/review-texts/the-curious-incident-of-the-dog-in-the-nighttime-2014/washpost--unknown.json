  "bwwExcerpt": "At times, admittedly, you need a little patience with the unfolding of 'The Curious Incident.' While the piece supplies its share of touching moments - and even some outrageously sentimental ones, involving a puppy - the world it conjures is never overrun with kindly types, eager to come to the aid of a struggling young soul. That the production remains true to this rather unsparing vision is as much to its credit as is all that technical wizardry.",
