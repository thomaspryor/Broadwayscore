    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Calls the show 'a triumph' with praise for 'ingenious staging' and theatrical innovation. The critic's own 80 rating supports high positive territory, and 'triumph' language indicates Rave bucket. | GPT-4o: The critic describes the show as a 'triumph of theatrical imagination' with 'ingenious staging', indicating a strong recommendation. The original rating of 80 supports a high score within the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The review uses the word \"triumph\" and praises the staging, indicating a strong positive recommendation. Given the original rating of 80, a score in the high end of the positive bucket is appropriate. | Kimi: The critic's original rating of 80 falls squarely within the Positive range (70-84), and the excerpt contains enthusiastic praise ('triumph', 'ingenious') indicating a strong recommendation, though the brevity of the text limits confidence. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
