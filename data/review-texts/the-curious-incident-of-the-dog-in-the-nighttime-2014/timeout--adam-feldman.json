  "bwwExcerpt": "That combination of intense emotionalism and visual dazzle is captured brilliantly in Marianne Elliott's production, awash in video projections and moving parts (the ingenious grid-lined set is by Bunny Christie). Simon Stephens's lean, fast-moving adaptation makes smart use of the ensemble to create a polyphony of voices for narrative heavy lifting, while his domestic scenes don't stint on grimness.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Uses the word 'triumph' which is a clear Rave indicator, praising both the theatrical imagination and staging as 'ingenious'. The 80/100 original rating confirms this is in the Rave bucket. | GPT-4o: The critic describes the show as a 'triumph' with 'ingenious staging', indicating a strong recommendation. The original rating of 80 supports a high score within the Rave bucket. | Gemini: The review uses the word \"triumph\" and praises the staging, indicating a strong positive recommendation. Given the original rating of 80, I've placed it in the upper range of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The critic uses superlatives like 'triumph' and 'ingenious' to praise the staging and concept, indicating a strong recommendation. The provided numerical rating of 80 confirms classification in the Positive bucket. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
