  "bwwExcerpt": "There are many plays opening on Broadway this fall, mostly limited engagements of well-known plays with starry casts. But if justice prevails, 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,' an exhilarating stage version of Mark Haddon's 2003 young adult/mystery novel, will emerge from the onslaught of openings as the surprise, must-see hit.",
