  "bwwExcerpt": "What Stephens, Elliott and Christies (who also designed the tone-perfect costumes) - along with blazingly expressive lighting by Paule Constable, projections by Finn Ross and music by Adrian Sutton - is bring us inside the head of an exceptional outsider who is also unyieldingly one of us. Don't think for a second this is an after-school special, though special The Curious Incidentcertainly is. It may in the end be too sentimental to qualify as highbrow - but it's brilliant nonetheless.",
