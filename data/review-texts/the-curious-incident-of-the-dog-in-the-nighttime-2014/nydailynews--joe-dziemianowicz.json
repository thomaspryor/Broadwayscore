  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Marianne Elliott, a Tony winner for her stunning staging of 'War Horse,' proves a master at orchestrating visceral and wildly energetic scenes as well as poignant hushed moments. The show's design is another asset, including the set whose walls look like graph paper... When Chris imagines himself tumbling in space, held aloft and spun by his fellow actors, it's lump-in-the-throat time. Not everything works as weightlessly. The play-within-the-play device can confuse, as when Christopher gives fellow actors notes about their performances.",
