  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Marianne Elliott stages a swirling, beautifully kaleidoscopic series of scenes, contrasting with the background of a giant, black-and-white grid representing the complete order that Christopher needs. When Elliott's kinetic vision and Bunny Christie's dazzling technological design - alternately playful and alarming - combine, the orderly grid explodes with fantastical projections including constellations, outer space, complicated city maps and terrifying escalators.",
