  "bwwExcerpt": "Fiery revolutionaries, overheated passions, power ballads belted to the balconies, an upstanding hero and a fanatical villain -- hey, if it worked for 'LES MISERABLES,' it could work for 'Doctor Zhivago'! The only problem is that the creators of this new musical forgot to include such minor details as compelling characters, thrilling drama or, you know, an inspiring score. At a time of heightened competition on Broadway, 'Doctor Zhivago' is so dull, it may soon be Zhiva-gone.",
