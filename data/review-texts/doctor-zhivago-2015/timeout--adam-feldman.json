The original 40 rating confirms this as a negative assessment. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 40 aligns with the negative bucket, and the review text describes the adaptation as both 'rushed and sluggish,' indicating a lack of recommendation. | Gemini: The review explicitly states the show feels both rushed and sluggish, indicating a negative assessment. The critic's rating of 40 further confirms this. | Kimi: The critic's explicit 40/100 rating falls squarely in the Negative range, and the review text describes the adaptation as both rushed and sluggish with clear disappointment.",
