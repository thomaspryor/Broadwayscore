  "fullText": "\"Doctor Zhivago\" Kelli Barrett and Tam Mutu\n (Matthew Murphy)\n\nGenre: musical; Starring: Tam Mutu, Kelli Barrett, Paul Alexander Nolan; Director: Des McAnuff; Author: Lucy Simon, Michael Weller, Amy Powers, Michael Korie\n\nPosted April 21 2015 — 9:00 PM EDT\n\nHere’s the thing about love stories for the ages: chemistry is kind of important. Make that supremely important. So any adaptation of Boris Pasternak’s 1957 Nobel Prize-winning novel hinges on whether Dr. Zhivago and Lara are visibly burning and longing and aching for one another. They are some of literature’s most beloved star-crossed lovers, each married to another, with a passion that endures through wars, imprisonment, and plenty of iced-vodka-cold Russian winters.\n\nSadly, you never quite believe over the course of the misguided musical version of Doctor Zhivago that there’s any great romance–much less a spark of attraction–between the poet-physician Yurii Zhivago (Tam Mutu) and his alleged paramour, the idealistic nurse Lara (Kelli Barrett). Mutu, known mostly for stage work in London, is smoldering and strong, but as with any functional relationship, needs someone his equal. While Barrett’s singing voice is undeniably beautiful, she seems to believe every line out of a Russian love story deserves overwrought delivery. When our title character has a worthy adversary here, as with the underhanded Viktor Komarovsky (Tom Hewitt) or Lara’s revolutionary husband Pasha (Paul Alexander Nolan, who occasionally strays too far into the “more is more” camp of acting), the story finds its pulse.\n\nTwo-time Tony-winning director Des McAnuff (The Who’s Tommy) doesn’t do the show any favors with dull staging, overuse of projections (heaven forbid we think 1919 is 1920!), and far too many deafeningly-loud explosives through battle scenes. (Did he think they would wake up the audience?) While we’re on the subject of auditory unfortunateness, Lucy Simon’s score and Michael Korie and Amy Powers’ lyrics are haunting at their finest (and admittedly, rarest) moments and just plain boring at their worst. There’s a scene in which Maurice Jarre’s “Lara’s Theme” (from the 1965 Oscar-winning movie starring a sizzling Omar Sharif and ravishing Julie Christie) is performed and you can almost feel the audience yearning for what might have been.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: C- grade with consistent criticism of core elements: lack of chemistry between leads, dull staging, boring score. Despite acknowledging some individual strengths, the overall assessment is clearly negative. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the lack of chemistry between the leads, dull staging, and uninspired score. The original C- rating suggests a negative view, but the text is truncated, so the final verdict may be missing. | Gemini: The critic gives the show a C- grade and clearly states that the chemistry between the leads is lacking. The review also criticizes the staging, score, and lyrics, leading to a negative assessment despite some praise for individual performances. | Kimi: The critic assigns a C- grade and describes the production as 'misguided' with 'dull staging' and a lack of chemistry between leads, while acknowledging strong individual performances. Due to the truncation warning, this falls in the lower Mixed range rather than Negative.",
