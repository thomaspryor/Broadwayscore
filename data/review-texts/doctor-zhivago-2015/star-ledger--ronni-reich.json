  "bwwExcerpt": "As it chronicles love, war, survival instincts and purpose in a rapidly changing world, 'Doctor Zhivago' is an earnest romance with an epic, operatic scope...the new Broadway musical covers ample ground, with nothing extraneous...Des McAnuff directs a thoughtful production. Yet in encompassing so much plot and philosophy so economically, the characters and their fates can sometimes feel oversimplified...Tam Mutu proves one of Broadway's strongest current leading men...A spirited Lara, Kelli Barrett shows off an impressive, wide-ranging voice...Simon gives them surging melodies with bold colors, and the score is filled with Russian-style grandeur...As it spans decades, the drama of the play can occasionally feel forced or reductive...The musical is true to the spirit of its age and presents unabashed emotion too rarely seen on the contemporary stage.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Mixed positive assessment - praises direction as 'thoughtful', leads as strong performers, and score as grand, but notes characters can feel 'oversimplified' and drama 'occasionally forced.' Final line suggests value despite flaws. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production's scope, direction, and performances, but notes oversimplified characters and forced drama. The positive elements are emphasized, suggesting a recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review praises the scope and performances, but notes that the characters and drama can feel oversimplified or forced at times. This indicates a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: While the critic notes that characters can feel oversimplified and the drama occasionally forced, the review offers strong praise for the performances (particularly Tam Mutu and Kelli Barrett), the direction, and the grand, operatic score. The overall tone clearly recommends the show.",
