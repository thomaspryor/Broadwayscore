  "fullText": "ExpandKelli Barrett and Tam Mutu as star-crossed couple Lara and Yuri.\n\nBroadway's \"Doctor Zhivago\" is an epic miss.\n\nBased on the acclaimed Boris Pasternak novel, this miscalibrated musical is yet another attempt to bottle page-to-stage lightning a la \"Les Miserables.\"\n\nBut electricity doesn't zap. Not much does in this nearly three-hour show, which has been in the works for almost two decades, set against the bloody upheaval of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and World War I.\n\nMichael Weller's adaptation relies on supertitles to situate us in the sprawling narrative. The score by composer Lucy Simon and lyricists Michael Korie and Amy Powers resonates with occasional Russian-inflected melodies and lots of ardent power ballads. Respectable, but unremarkable, songs hang like wallpaper. The famous song \"Somewhere My Love\" is sung by optimistic nurses.\n\nTam Mutu, a star in London, makes his Broadway debut in \"Doctor Zhivago.\"\n\nDes McAnuff's direction is another issue. Unlike \"Jersey Boys,\" which he moves with near-cinematic smoothness and urgency that complements the Four Seasons' story, in \"Doctor Zhivago,\" he fails to convey what matters most — intimacy. The outsize passion of the star-crossed Yuri Zhivago, a married aristocrat doctor and poet, and Lara, the wife of a revolutionary who inspires his verse, is the soul of this tale. Intimacy is gobbled up in broad strokes and ill-conceived sets and projections.\n\nWe do understand that they're separated by revolution, as well as by Yuri's wife Tonia (Lora Lee Gayer), Lara's husband Pasha (a very good Paul Alexander Nolan) and the lecherous Komarovsky (Tom Hewitt), who's had a thing for Lara since she was a girl. We don't get enough of what's fueling their passion. Or why his writing is so important.\n\nOn film in 1965, the luminous Julie Christie and Omar Sharif captured the eroticism and ache of romantic repression of people desperately in love through tight close-ups and eyes filled with desire. That's all but lost here. As Yuri, London stage star Tam Mutu sings with a manly ardor and has a cleft chin deep as the Volga River. As the staunch Lara, Kelli Barrett's vocals are bright and clear. They're likable together but no fire. Without the inferno, the \"Doctor\" remains in guarded condition.",
