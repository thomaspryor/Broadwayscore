  "bwwExcerpt": "At least one of the musicals that I see on Broadway each season leaves me shaking my head and muttering 'What were they thinking?' on the way out of the theater. 'Doctor Zhivago,' which purports to be adapted from Boris Pasternak's 1957 novel of Russian life before and after the October Revolution but in fact appears to be based on David Lean's 1965 film version of the book, is the worst kind of case in point. No doubt the creators thought it more respectable to claim direct descent from the book, but when you bill such a show as 'one of the most romantic stories of all time,' you're probably not much concerned with suggesting the tone and texture of a serious novel, least of all one that no less a critical heavyweight than Edmund Wilson declared to be 'one of the great events in man's literary and moral history.' Not so the stage version of 'Doctor Zhivago,' a slow-paced commodity musical suitable only for consumption by tone-deaf tweenagers.",
