  "fullText": "Jessie Mueller’s terrific performance in the new musical “Waitress” at the American Repertory Theater makes one hope she’ll still be starring when the show, helmed by ART artistic director Diane Paulus, debuts on Broadway next spring. The actress brings a weary gravity to the title role of the “desperately sad” Jenna, along with a luminous singing voice that makes clear why Mueller won a Tony Award last year for “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical.” Especially in the second act, Mueller elevates an entertaining show that faithfully follows the 2007 movie that starred Keri Russell, including some bits that are only sitcom deep. “Waitress” is an empowerment fable with pie. If it was a novel, it would include recipes and be a favorite of book clubs but not the critics.",
