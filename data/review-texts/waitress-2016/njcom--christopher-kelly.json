  "bwwExcerpt": "The best thing to be said for \"Waitress\" is the brightly colored set design by Scott Pask, which features two giant, rotating pie cases on either side of the stage. Otherwise this musical feels like a few too many slices of a much too sugary pie. It sails right past feel-good and instead leaves you with a stomachache.",
