Photograph: Joan Marcus/AP This article is more than 9 years oldReviewWaitress review – pie-focused musical seems half-bakedThis article is more than 9 years oldBrooks Atkinson Theatre, New YorkBased on the 2007 film, this show about a small-town diner waitress trapped in a loveless marriage is witty and bittersweet, yet its sexual politics leave a sour taste\n\nA musical to soften the heart and harden the arteries, Waitress is the story of Jenna, a small-town diner waitress who bakes pies. Many pies. Pies with names like Ginger Snap Out of It Pie, Couch Potato Pie, and Car Radio Pie, the last of which cannot possibly be delectable. As one enters the theater, one is assailed by an aroma of cinnamon. Tiny jarred pies are for sale at the concession stand.\n\nBut the resulting musical, based on the quirky film Adrienne Shelly completed not long before her death, is both sweet and bitter and only sporadically satisfying.\n\nJenna bakes as a means of achieving solace and self-expression. In softly lit interior monologues (weak points of the show, as interior monologues so often are), we go inside Jenna’s mind as she balletically invents new pies while the chorus intones the soothing words “sugar, butter, flour”.\n\nRead moreIf Jenna finds succor in baking and in her close friendships with the other waitresses at the diner, Keala Settle’s Becky and Kimiko Glenn’s Dawn, it is in short supply elsewhere. She feels trapped in an abusive marriage to the lunkish Earl (Nick Cordero, entirely suppressing his ample charm) and is further burdened by a pregnancy that is not exactly wanted.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear why she remains with Earl and even less apparent why she undertakes an affair with her gynecologist (Drew Gehling), whom she can’t bring herself to address except by his professional name, Dr Pomatter. (Such a relationship is an ethical hazard, but perhaps the fact that he has already seen her vagina legitimizes it in Jenna’s mind.)\n\nView image in fullscreenSuppressing his charm: Nick Cordero with Jessie Mueller. Photograph: Joan Marcus/APJessie Mueller, a luminous presence in On a Clear Day You Can See Forever and Beautiful, plays Jenna with grace and vivacity, her wide mouth opening like a Muppet’s when called upon to deliver a ballad. Gehling is geekily charming, Settle finely acerbic, Glenn sweetly timid, while Christopher Fitzgerald nearly steals the show as Ogie, Dawn’s persistent beau and a clog-dancing enthusiast.\n\nUnder Diane Paulus’ direction, the show at times seems to struggle to fill the stage. The book, written by Jessie Nelson and based on the film script, is nicely witty. But the choreography, by Lorin Latarro, seems an afterthought, and the songs, by the Grammy-winning artist Sara Bareilles, are tuneful, yet often strangely reticent, as though meant to be sung quietly to oneself rather than loudly before a crowd. Bad Idea, a duet between Jenna and Dr Pomatter, is a nicely rowdy exception, as is Jenna’s heartfelt She Used to Be Mine. (One song for Ogie, Never Getting Rid of Me, is a showstopper; the other, I Love You Like a Table, a cheerful muddle.)\n\nThe sexual politics of the piece can be a little troubling, too. Clearly a story of female empowerment, it offers several excellent roles for women, but is less confident in its handling of men. We know we’re meant to dislike Earl, who discounts Jenna’s feelings and won’t take no for an answer. But we’re meant to embrace Ogie, who turns a deaf ear when Dawn says she doesn’t want to date him, and even Dr Pomatter, who violates his relationship with his vulnerable patient. Is this condoned because this Ogie is unmuscled and Dr Pomatter so lean? The show seems to take the moral stance that men who are too slight or too old to beat women up get a pass, but others are to be treated with skepticism. That’s less than delicious.\n\nAt any point, you can opt out of the sale of all of your personal information by pressing",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Despite truncation warning, the review shows clear mixed signals - praises individual performances (Mueller, Fitzgerald) and some songs, but criticizes choreography, sexual politics, and overall satisfaction. The critic finds it 'sporadically satisfying' with troubling elements. | GPT-4o: The review provides a mix of positive and negative elements, praising performances and some songs, but critiquing the show's sexual politics and choreography. The truncated nature of the text and mixed signals lead to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The review is mixed, praising some aspects like the performances and wit, but criticizing the sexual politics and some of the songs. The truncated nature makes the final verdict uncertain, but the overall tone leans towards a qualified recommendation. | Kimi: While the visible text criticizes the show's sexual politics and inconsistent staging, it offers strong praise for Jessie Mueller's luminous performance and the supporting cast. Given the truncation warning and aggregator excerpts suggesting the show is 'substantive enough to leave you satisfied,' the likely final verdict is a qualified recommendation.",
