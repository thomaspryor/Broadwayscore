    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges high energy performances but dismisses the show as merely a 'jukebox' rather than a proper musical, suggesting spectacle without substance. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as energetic but implies a lack of substance by calling it a 'gilded jukebox'. The tone suggests a mixed assessment, highlighting energy but questioning the musical's depth. | Gemini: The review describes the show as a collection of hits, suggesting entertainment value but lacking depth. It neither strongly recommends nor discourages seeing it. | Kimi: While the critic dismisses the show as a 'gilded jukebox' lacking traditional musical depth, the exuberant praise for the cast's relentless energy suggests a qualified recommendation for audiences seeking entertaining performances over substantial storytelling.",
