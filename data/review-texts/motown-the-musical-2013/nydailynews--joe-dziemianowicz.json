  "bwwExcerpt": "There's no shortage of great tunes from which to choose. And if a batch of catchy classics with tasty harmonies and cool grooves like \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine,\" \"Stop in the Name of Love,\" \"My Girl\" and \"ABC\" were enough to make a jukebox musical click, the show would be an automatic hit. But it takes more. While the music catalog runs deep, the story is shallow. The book, penned by Gordy, who also produced the show, suffers from being sketchy, earnest and sometimes corny.",
