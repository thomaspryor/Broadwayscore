    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Clear positive verdict that the show 'works' and is effective as entertainment, despite acknowledging it's formulaic. The qualifier 'despite itself' prevents this from being a stronger positive score. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's appeal and success with audiences, highlighting the strong songbook. However, the phrase 'despite itself' suggests some reservations, leading to a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review states the show \"works despite itself\" and is a \"crowd-pleaser,\" indicating a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show succeeds as a 'crowd-pleaser' and praises the 'incredible songbook,' but the phrase 'despite itself' indicates reservations, suggesting a qualified recommendation rather than unqualified enthusiasm.",
