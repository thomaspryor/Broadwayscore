This indicates a negative overall impression with some redeeming qualities. | Gemini: The review states that the score is what saves the show from being a \"total washout,\" implying that the show is not good overall, despite the music. This indicates a negative recommendation. | Kimi: The critic explicitly states that only the score prevents the show from being a 'total washout,' framing the production itself as a failure despite the quality of the musical performances.",
