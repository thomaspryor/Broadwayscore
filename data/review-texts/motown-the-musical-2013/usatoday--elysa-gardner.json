Brief excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as a 'rousing' celebration, indicating a positive experience despite noting it lacks revelation. This suggests a solid recommendation with some reservations. | Gemini: The review states that the show is \"undeniably rousing,\" which indicates a positive recommendation, although it is qualified by the phrase \"more celebration than revelation.\" | Kimi: While acknowledging the show prioritizes entertainment over insight ('more celebration than revelation'), the critic delivers a clear recommendation with the emphatic praise 'undeniably rousing,' indicating an enjoyable, energetic production worth seeing.",
