The phrase 'heavy on the juke and light on the book' suggests mixed feelings about the show's strengths and weaknesses, but without the full review, the overall verdict is unclear. | GPT-4o: The review suggests a balance of strengths and weaknesses, with the music being a highlight but the narrative lacking substance. This indicates a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review describes the show as a \"jukebox show that's heavy on the juke and light on the book,\" indicating a mixed assessment with strengths in music but weaknesses in the narrative. | Kimi: The brief excerpt describes a production strong on musical numbers ('heavy on the juke') but criticizes the narrative book as lacking ('light on the book'), suggesting an imbalanced, middling experience without clear recommendation.",
