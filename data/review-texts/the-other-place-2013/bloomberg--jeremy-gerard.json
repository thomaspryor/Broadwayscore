  "bwwExcerpt": "Laurie Metcalf's performance as Juliana in 'The Other Place' has both sharpened and deepened since Sharr White's drama ran off-Broadway nearly two years ago. Given a second outing, now on Broadway under the wing of the Manhattan Theatre Club, the one-act drama still packs a formidable punch...but 'The Other Place' has lost some power in the interregnum. The most easily identified reason is a significant casting change: Where Dennis Boutsikaris was sharp, even severe as Ian, Daniel Stern is warm-and-fuzzier, less of a foil to Juliana...Like 'The Great God Pan' earlier this season, 'The Other Place' is yet another ambitious play that's maddeningly unfinished.",
