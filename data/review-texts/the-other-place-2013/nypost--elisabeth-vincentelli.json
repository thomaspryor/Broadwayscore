However, the mention of the play's 'deliberately confusing' structure introduces some reservation, indicating a solid recommendation with some caveats. | Gemini: The review praises Laurie Metcalf's performance as a \"tour de force\" and describes the play as a \"harrowing drama.\" While it notes the confusing structure, the overall tone is positive, suggesting it's worth seeing for Metcalf's performance. | Kimi: Despite apparent truncation, the available text offers high praise for Metcalf's performance ('tour de force') and describes the drama as 'harrowing,' indicating a strong positive assessment, though the full scope of the recommendation is unclear.",
