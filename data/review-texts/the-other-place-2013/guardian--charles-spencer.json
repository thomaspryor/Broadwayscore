  "rejectionReasoning": "openai: The text provided is a single sentence focusing on a performance, lacking a comprehensive evaluation of the show.; kimi: This review describes Laurie Metcalf in a play about a scientist whose mind is fragmenting, which matches 'The Other Place' by Sharr White. That production premiered Off-Broadway at MCC Theater and did not transfer to Broadway. Additionally, Charles Spencer was chief drama critic for The Daily Telegraph (London), suggesting this may review a West End or Off-Broadway production rather than the current Broadway run.",
