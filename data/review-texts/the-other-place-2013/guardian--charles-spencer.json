    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: This appears to be a truncated excerpt focusing solely on praise for Metcalf's performance. The critic's own 80 rating confirms positive territory, but without context about the overall production, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review praises Laurie Metcalf's performance with strong positive language, indicating a positive recommendation. The original rating of 80 supports this classification. | Kimi: The critic's own rating of 80 places this firmly in the Positive bucket, and the excerpt offers high praise for the lead actress's performance. Confidence is low due to the brevity of the provided text.",
