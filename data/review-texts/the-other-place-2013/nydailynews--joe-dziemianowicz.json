  "bwwExcerpt": "The supporting cast is topnotch, including Daniel Stern as Juliana's beleaguered husband, Zoe Perry (Metcalf's real-life daughter), who plays a doctor and a bitter divorcee, and John Schiappa in a couple small roles. But it's really all about Juliana, a brittle individual who seems even tougher than she did during the first run. She's now caustic enough to come with a warning label. It's not a fluke, considering that Ian says to his wife: 'You know, what surprises me almost more than anything else is how cruel this thing has made you.' It's a harsh reality. And played by Metcalf, it hurts so good.",
