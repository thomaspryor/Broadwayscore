  "bwwExcerpt": "Metcalf supplies the gravitation that holds it all together, even as her immense centrifugal energy is, simultaneously, working to fling it all apart. Her physical and spiritual transformation over the course of this brief, intense story is total. I greatly enjoyed The Other Place in its original Off Broadway incarnation, but I wondered if Joe Mantello's exquisite, bounded-in-a-nutshell production would scale up to Broadway. It does, I'm thrilled to report, and a great deal of the credit is due Metcalf herself, who's found several clever ways-near-subliminal physicalization, megaphonic emotional projection-to turn a delicate chamber performance into a great ringing cry from the darkness, suitable for an amphitheater.",
