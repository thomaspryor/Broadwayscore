  "bwwExcerpt": "The Other Place might lack poetry--or Wit--but its emotional moments are potent. And Metcalf? Unforgettable. She even holds focus for the half hour before the play starts, sitting onstage in a chair, fiddling with a device, and trying to make sense of things. I could definitely do without this gimmick in general, but 30 minutes more of Metcalf is always a good thing.",
