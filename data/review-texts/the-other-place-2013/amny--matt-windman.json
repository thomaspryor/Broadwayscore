  "bwwExcerpt": "'The Other Place' is essentially a stream of consciousness monologue padded with a few scenes and flashbacks to add a bit of substance and suspense. It feels derived from previous plays about smart women confronting illness, such as 'Proof' and 'Wit.' With all due respect to Metcalf, who never leaves the stage and gives a brave and raw performance, 'The Other Place' leaves much to be desired. 2 stars.",
