  "bwwExcerpt": "Once again guided faultlessly by director Joe Mantello, the production has been expertly expanded to fill the larger space without sacrificing intimacy or nuance. Laurie Metcalf returns to offer her galvanizing portrayal of Dr. Juliana Smithton, a dementia specialist suddenly faced with the condition herself, and Metcalf's shattering work has only gotten richer. Bold, unflinching, and ingeniously constructed, this is a show not to be missed.",
