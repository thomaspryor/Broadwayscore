  "fullText": "\"All Out,\" much like last year's \"All In,\" has generated accusations of a \"cynical cash grab,\" in the words of a poster in a theater chatroom outraged by ticket prices as high as $320 for a \"lazy\" 80-minute show, during which four celebrities read some dozen short stories by Simon Rich, interspersed with songs by the band Lawrence.\n\nI too recoil at the misleading way the show is being marketed. Some young theatergoers I met at the Nederlander who had gotten their tickets after seeing promos for \"All Out\" on Instagram, expressed surprise that it was in effect a staged reading. Over the next twelve weeks, a rotating cast of four celebrities will read aloud Rich's published stories from hand-held binders. But I also wondered whether the outrage is mostly about the ticket prices: Would theatergoers find \"All Out: Comedy about Ambition\" enjoyable if the tickets were more affordable.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, I entered the lottery, won, and saw the show for $45. For me, the answer is largely yes: If you know what to expect, the show is sufficiently entertaining to feel worth the (80 minute) time and ($45) expense, not least because it is almost as much a concert of original songs by Lawrence, a lively eight-member band led by the siblings Clyde Lawrence and Gracie Lawrence, who is a standout here as she was in the Broadway musical \"Just in Time,\" where she portrayed Connie Francis.\n\n\"All Out: Comedy About Ambition\" is not ambitious theater, nor is it even really about ambition. Although some of Simon Rich's individual stories are inherently theatrical, the selection overall feels random. Whether or not the show is a cash grab, it's certainly a grab-bag. This is reportedly different from last year's more focused \"All In: Comedy About Love.\" But there are also some changes for the better in the sequel. Although top ticket prices are still steep, prices as a whole are lower than last year. (Could word of mouth have done the trick?) And although the current quartet of comedians do still read aloud from hand-held binders, they don't just sit in chairs; they sit on a couch this time (plus a couple of armchairs), and they do occasionally stand up.\n\nRich's humorous stories, which are clever even when they are not laugh-out-loud funny, have been published in seven collections over the past 18 years.\n\n\"All Out: Comedy About Ambition\" exists because \"All In: Comedy About Love\" wound up being one of the rare shows on Broadway to recoup its investment, despite the voluble complaints by theatergoers who see so much about these shows – the celebrity stunt-casting, the misleading marketing, a reading presented as a production, the price gouging — as signs of the degradation of Broadway theater.",
