However, limited text makes full verdict uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a negative sentiment, highlighting the inability of the cast to overcome poor character development. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt states that the cast is competent but cannot overcome the two-dimensional characters, indicating a negative assessment of the show's writing and overall impact. | Kimi: The excerpt offers faint praise for the performers ('competent') while criticizing the fundamental writing ('two-dimensional characters'), suggesting the production cannot transcend its flawed material. With only one excerpt available, the overall verdict remains uncertain.",
