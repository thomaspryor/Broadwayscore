    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt with qualified praise ('at least') suggests mixed overall experience that improves significantly at the end. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive note about the ending but lacks comprehensive evaluative content. The 'at least' implies the rest may not be as thrilling, indicating a mixed review. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a positive aspect of the play, specifically the ending. Given the limited information, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise specifically for the show's ending ('at least'), implying the rest of the production may not sustain that excitement; with only one curated quote available, the overall verdict remains ambiguous but leans toward mixed.",
