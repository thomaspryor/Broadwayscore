  "bwwExcerpt": "*CRITICS PICK* Rather it is a slender, swift and healthy exercise in hagiography, burnishing its saints and martyrs to a high sheen. Clooney’s glamour, abetted by David Cromer’s suave direction, does a lot of that work... Clooney performs them with wit, integrity and charming modesty.",

The language is positive, highlighting 'wit, integrity and charming modesty' in the performance and 'suave direction'. | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"slender, swift and healthy\" and \"burnishing its saints and martyrs to a high sheen,\" indicating a generally positive, though perhaps not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, assessment. The \"Critics Pick\" designation also suggests a positive recommendation. | Kimi: The NYT Critic's Pick designation and warm praise for Clooney's performance and Cromer's direction ('suave', 'wit', 'integrity') indicate a clear recommendation. While the single excerpt limits certainty, the evaluative language ('healthy exercise', 'high sheen') places this in the strong Positive range.",
