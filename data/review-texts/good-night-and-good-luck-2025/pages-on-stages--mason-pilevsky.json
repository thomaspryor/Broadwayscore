However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low due to potential cherry-picking. | Gemini: The single quote suggests the show is inaccessible or irrelevant to its target audience, which implies a negative assessment. However, with only one line available, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt criticizes the show for targeting only existing fans while being financially inaccessible, suggesting poor value and a negative recommendation for general audiences.",
