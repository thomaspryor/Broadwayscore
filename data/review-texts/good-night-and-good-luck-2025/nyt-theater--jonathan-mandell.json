    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the production as 'elegant, meticulous, timely,' which suggests a positive view. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context necessitate a cautious, low-confidence score. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the production as \"elegant, meticulous, timely\", which suggests a positive assessment. However, due to the limited text available, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt uses unambiguously positive descriptors ('elegant,' 'meticulous,' 'timely') indicating a solid recommendation. However, as a single curated excerpt, it may not represent the full review's nuance.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "If there’s not much change in content, ‘Good Night, and Good Luck’ is transformed by its context. On the night I attended, the audience treated the play like the gathering of the like-minded at a public square, responding to this real-life drama from the 1950s as if a comment on life in America under Donald Trump.",
