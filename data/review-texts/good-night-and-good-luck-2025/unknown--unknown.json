    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Mixed/Positive) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt describes the show as 'slender' and 'swift' which could be positive, but 'hagiography' (uncritical worship) suggests superficial treatment. Single excerpt makes verdict unclear, but tone seems more analytical than enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show is polished but possibly superficial, focusing on idealizing its subjects. The tone implies some positive aspects but lacks strong enthusiasm or recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a positive, though potentially sanitized, portrayal. Given the single excerpt and the word \"hagiography\", I'm scoring it as a positive with reservations. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers qualified praise, commending the production's polish and pacing while implying it is somewhat insubstantial and uncritical of its subjects. | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
