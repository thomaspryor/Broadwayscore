    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt suggests the critic recognizes the show's aspirations but finds the execution lacking energy and fluidity. 'Stiff around its joints' indicates structural or pacing problems that prevent full recommendation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a critique of the show's delivery, indicating it lacks urgency and is somewhat stiff. The lack of a full review and the single excerpt warning suggest a mixed sentiment. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a mixed assessment, noting a lack of urgency and stiffness. Without more context, it's difficult to determine the overall recommendation, but it leans towards a mixed reception. | Kimi: The single available excerpt criticizes the production for lacking urgency and being 'stiff,' suggesting it falls short of the best examples of its genre. With only one curated excerpt and truncated text, the full verdict is unclear, warranting a mid-range Mixed score with low confidence.",
