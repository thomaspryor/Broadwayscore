  "bwwExcerpt": "First off, a huge shout-out to the entire ensemble. These heroes too often go unsung, so hear me clearly: this group is so talented it boggles the imagination. And don’t get me started on those Flying Monkeys. Their death-defying aerial work — whirling and twirling through space — was thrilling. Elphaba was not the only challenger of gravity on that stage… or in the air above it.",
