Just another -- yawn -- upscale dinner party in Manhattan, right? Except what's with the ''Towering Inferno'' lighting? And with that mood music, or what passes for it: the sounds of helicopters beating the air and things blowing up in the night? And is that the scent of brimstone that perfumes the room?\n\nSuch festive accents suggest that the setting for ''Omnium Gatherum,'' the piping hot slice of satire that opened last night at the Variety Arts Theater, is somewhat farther south than the Upper East Side. Like way south. Like dangerously close to the bowels of hell. Which, come to think of it, seems to have been at least the metaphorical setting for so many social events since the morning of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\n''Omnium Gatherum,'' written by Theresa Rebeck and Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, has already generated plenty of printer's ink and titillated word of mouth for its find-the-famous-person factor. It is indeed a comédie à clef of sorts, with characters inspired by Martha Stewart, the journalist Christopher Hitchens, the novelist Tom Clancy and Edward Said, the eminent scholar of Middle Eastern affairs, who died on Wednesday.\n\nBut disguised name-dropping doesn't begin to account for the alarming vitality of this production, directed by Will Frears, or the way it creeps under your skin before you've realized it. I went to ''Omnium Gatherum'' anticipating a glib intellectual lampoon, a theatrical version of what might happen if Bonnie Fuller, the queen of celebrity journalism, took over the editorship of The New York Review of Books. What I found isn't so easy to dismiss.\n\nOn a line-by-line basis, this dinner-party debate of a play doesn't provide much that's new. The sending up of pretentiously poetic descriptions of food, for example, is as old as nouvelle cuisine itself. And the weightier subjects under discussion, contentiously addressed by characters representing different extreme points of view, have surely been pondered by every thinking American over the last two years.\n\nThe morality of American imperialism, the motivations behind Muslim terrorism, the cases for Israel and Palestine, the nature of heroism and virtue as defined by Eastern and Western cultures: these are the principal topics that fuel the arguments brought to such dizzying life by the vibrant ensemble of ''Omnium Gatherum.''\n\nThe scrapping revelers include Suzie (Kristine Nielsen), the hostess, a domestic tycoon with whims of steel à la Ms. Stewart; Roger (Phillip Clark), a flag-waving, chest-beating novelist; and the fiercely soft-spoken Lydia (Jenny Bacon), feminist, vegan and victims' rights advocate.\n\nAlso on the dais, as it were, are the scholarly, ever-courteous Khalid (Edward A. Hajj); the blustering, boozing, Cambridge-bred Terence (Dean Nolen); Julia (Melanna Gray), an uneasily upwardly mobile African-American moralist; and Jeff (Joseph Lyle Taylor), a handsome firefighter who did hero's duty on Sept. 11. Just when you thought the party couldn't degenerate any further, a surprise guest (Amir Arison) makes a most disruptive entrance.\n\nThat these pontificators are dining on exquisitely prepared food in luxurious surroundings offers a perhaps too-familiar frisson of irony, of the kind notoriously capitalized on by Tom Wolfe in ''Radical Chic'' and ''Bonfire of the Vanities.'' And didn't Luis Buñuel have the last word on deranged dinner parties among pampered capitalists with his film ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie''?\n\nBut ''Omnium Gatherum'' never feels merely derivative and schematic. What makes the play sing and sting is its radical yet perfectly organic shifts in tone. Tragedy and triviality, ponderousness and pettiness are mixed into a salad so deliriously tossed that you can't separate the individual ingredients. The play's strength is its sloppiness, a sense that orderly boundaries -- even those separating the living and the dead -- have blurred into chaos.\n\nAs Suzie and her guests work their way from amuse-bouche to dessert, they emerge as a self-contradictory bunch, filled with hate and fear, kindness and self-righteousness, selfishness and guilt. They are, in other words, human beings. Multiply their traits by a billion and you've got yourself a juicy recipe for world disorder.\n\nMs. Rebeck (the author of ''Spike Heels'' and ''Bad Dates'') and Ms. Gersten-Vassilaros (''My Thing of Love'') have obviously done time at well-appointed dinner tables in New York. They share a gimlet eye for the veteran party-giver's desperate perkiness, for the combustible chemistry among ill-assorted guests and the shifting ratio between alcohol consumption and emotional temperature.\n\nThey also know that since Sept. 11, there's a newly oppressive darkness hovering over those candlelit tables and that you can usually count on the spectral appearance of some uninvited guests, like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Or as Terence puts it, ''It isn't a dinner party until someone mentions the Grim Reaper.''\n\nThis Stygian-chic sensibility is captured in high style by David Rockwell (who designed the glamorously sharp-edged set), Vincent Olivieri (sound) and the ever-masterly Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer (lighting). And Mr. Frears keeps his cast members in a state of giddy flux as they change in a heartbeat from high dudgeon to low humor, from touchy-feely sensitivity to snarling derision.\n\nMs. Bacon, whose comic timing is as exact as it is stealthy, is especially adept at such transitions. So, in a more cartoonish vein, is the endearingly manic Ms. Nielsen. But all the performers, despite their playing deliberate stereotypes, find a persuasive natural pulse in their characters' erratic behavior. They rarely register as the fish in a barrel you might expect.\n\nThe show begins to tidy itself up a little too efficiently in the last 10 of its 90 intermissionless minutes. And Mr. Hajj's character is allowed to emerge as a voice of sanity in ways that upset the play's judiciously apportioned craziness.\n\nBut for a work that might at first be taken as an exceedingly talky allegory, ''Omnium Gatherum'' sustains a fluid, frantic sense of paradox that feels remarkably close to everyday life in the wake of 9/11. Its characters are irresistibly given to breaking off from discussion of cosmic truths to devote equal passion to the taste of well-cooked salmon or Lydia's riveting confessions about her love life.\n\nMs. Rebeck and Ms. Gersten-Vassilaros savor these moments of pleasure, refusing to discount them as merely frivolous. The most refreshing surprise of ''Omnium Gatherum'' is that it doesn't merely reiterate Sartre's dictum that hell is other people. It hints that heaven, however fleetingly it is felt, is other people, too.\n\nBy Theresa Rebeck and Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros; directed by Will Frears; sets by David Rockwell; costumes by Junghyun Georgia Lee; lighting by Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer; sound by Vincent Olivieri; technical supervision, Gene O'Donovan; production stage manager, Jane Grey; general manager, Lisa M.

  "bwwExcerpt": "As a parable of fascism and freedom, 'Wicked' so overplays its hand that it seriously dilutes its power to disturb. Much of the impact of Baum's original novel, like that of so many fantasy stories, came from haunting, symbolic figures that readers interpret on their own terms. Though there have been numerous literary analyses of Baum's 'Oz' as a coded case for populism and agrarian reform, the book never feels like a tract. 'Wicked,' on the other hand, wears its political heart as if it were a slogan button. This is true not only of the dialogue, but also of Mr. Schwartz's generically impassioned songs, which have that to-the-barricades sound of the omninously underscored anthems of 'Les Misérables.' Though the talk is festooned with cutely mangled word ('swankified,' 'thrillified,' 'gratitution') that bring to mind the language of Smurfs, there's a rock-hard lecture beneath the preciousness. Mr. Mantello reconciles the gap between form and content only in Ms. Chenoweth's performance.",
