  "fullText": "In \"Wicked,\" the muddy $14 million spectacle that opened last night at the Gershwin Theatre, Chenoweth does what musical stars are expected to do in times of theatrical trouble: consult the book of spells, perform a bit of sorcery. This she accomplishes in spades as Glinda, the fabled good witch, promoted here from kitschy movie part to bravura stage lead. Whenever she opens her mouth - whether to demonstrate her supple coloratura or to detonate a verbal grenade or two - \"Wicked\" makes endearingly whimsical noises, the sounds of a bona fide crowd-pleaser.

The mixed praise and criticism with no clear recommendation places this in the mixed category. | GPT-4o: The review praises Chenoweth's performance and some aspects of the show as a crowd-pleaser but criticizes the overall execution as lacking charm and magic. This suggests a mixed verdict with notable positive elements. | Gemini: The review praises Chenoweth's performance and calls the show a \"bona fide crowd-pleaser,\" but also notes that \"the magic fades\" at times. This suggests a positive but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic recommendation. | Kimi: The review offers strong praise for Kristin Chenoweth's performance but criticizes the show overall as 'muddy' and 'charmless' with fading magic when she isn't on stage, resulting in a conflicted assessment.",
