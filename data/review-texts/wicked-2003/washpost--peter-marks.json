  "fullText": "In \"Wicked,\" the muddy $14 million spectacle that opened last night at the Gershwin Theatre, Chenoweth does what musical stars are expected to do in times of theatrical trouble: consult the book of spells, perform a bit of sorcery. This she accomplishes in spades as Glinda, the fabled good witch, promoted here from kitschy movie part to bravura stage lead. Whenever she opens her mouth - whether to demonstrate her supple coloratura or to detonate a verbal grenade or two - \"Wicked\" makes endearingly whimsical noises, the sounds of a bona fide crowd-pleaser.

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Wicked makes endearingly whimsical noises, the sounds of a bona fide crowd-pleaser. Much of the rest of the time, however, the magic fades as the show pursues its rather charmless agenda as a parable about the roots of political evil.\"",
