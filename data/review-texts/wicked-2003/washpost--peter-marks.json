  "fullText": "In \"Wicked,\" the muddy $14 million spectacle that opened last night at the Gershwin Theatre, Chenoweth does what musical stars are expected to do in times of theatrical trouble: consult the book of spells, perform a bit of sorcery. This she accomplishes in spades as Glinda, the fabled good witch, promoted here from kitschy movie part to bravura stage lead.

The standout performance by Idina Menzel is highlighted as a saving grace, indicating a mixed but somewhat positive view. | Gemini: Despite the critic's reservations about the show's plot, they acknowledge that Idina Menzel's performance elevates it, suggesting it is still worth seeing.",
