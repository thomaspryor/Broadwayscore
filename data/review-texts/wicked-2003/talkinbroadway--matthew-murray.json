His Wicked examined the tortured history\nof the green-skinned Witch of the West (whom he called Elphaba), from her\nfriendship with the facile good witch Glinda to the tragic losses that drove\nher to become, in many people's eyes, \"wicked.\" Maguire's writing is\nunrelentingly contemporary, framing events of L. Frank Baum's original books\n(over a century old) in a modern context that ignored or erased every\nvestige of magic, invention, and entertainment present in the originals.\nBut Maguire's novel works because of its completely implacable nature and\nits total defiance of traditional ideas about Baum's setting and characters.\n\nThe musical, lacking Maguire's conviction, is determined to be all things to\nall people to find the broadest possible audience of Oz lovers, Oz haters,\nand passive bystanders. Though the basic story of Elphaba and her crusade\nagainst the increasingly totalitarian rule of the Wizard has been retained\nfor the musical, the lack of a singular vision or firm artistic hand makes\nthe show, unlike the book, a muddled, unfocused enterprise.\n\nDirector Joe Mantello is demonstrating once again (after last year's A Man\nof No Importance) that he has little or no working knowledge of how or why a\nmusical is different from a straight play. He can't make dialogue scenes\nbetween numbers lilt and sing, he doesn't understand how musicals move or\nshould be paced, he doesn't seem to have acknowledged how awful the \"musical\nstaging\" by Wayne Cilento (doing a bad John Carrafa imitation) is, and it\nprobably never occurred to him that Kristin Chenoweth (a neutron star of\nconcentrated theatrical energy), in the secondary role of Glinda, might draw\nattention from the less flashy central role of Elphaba and the less exciting\nactress (Idina Menzel) playing her.\n\nMost importantly, Mantello simply does not know how to derive better work\nfrom his collaborators. Neophyte librettist Winnie Holzman needed all the\ndirection she could get to alleviate some of her book's incoherent and\nunstructured plotting and lame jokes (\"It seems the artichoke is steamed,\"\nand \"I don't see why you can't just teach us history instead of always\nharping on the past,\" to quote two examples from one scene), but she didn't\nreceive it. As for composer Stephen Schwartz, this Broadway veteran should\nhave known better, but has instead composed the most negligible and\nforgettable score of his career. How the man responsible for shows like\nPippin and Godspell was unable to creatively illuminate the slightest bit of\npersonality or drive in the show's characters - let alone write one\nmemorable song! - will likely stand as this Broadway season's single\ngreatest mystery. (At least Wicked's musical director, Stephen Oremus, and\nhis 23-piece orchestra are above reproach.)\n\nThere's little point in dwelling on the performances; when the actors\nsucceed, it's generally in spite of the material rather than because of it.\nChenoweth, charmingly vacant as Glinda, comes close, and has a way with\njokes and songs that few Broadway stars today do, but it's impossible to buy\nmuch of what she says or sings because there's just nothing to sell. Joel\nGrey's Wizard is stuck with the show's two worst numbers, but forces one,\n\"Wonderful,\" to work just only because, as a seasoned pro, he knows his way\naround a vaudeville turn. Carole Shelley, as his partner in crime, has even\nless to work with but compensates as best she can. Christopher Fitzgerald\nas the munchkin Boq and Michelle Federer as Elphaba's sister (the future\nWicked Witch of the East) provide the show's only grounding emotional\nmoments.\n\nElphaba, reduced from austere individualist to milquetoast reactionary,\nallows Menzel plenty of high belting, but few dramatic opportunities to\nsteal the show away from the insuperable Chenoweth. (Menzel feels like a\nsupporting actress, and it wouldn't be surprising if the awards reflect this\ncome spring.) Norbert Leo Butz has pepped up dying shows in the past (Thou\nShalt Not, anyone?) but is lost in the depths of Elphaba's heroically\nunderwritten love interest, Fiyero. As a result, Menzel and Butz have no\nchemistry, and their scenes together are among the show's most trying.\n\nVisually, Wicked is a wonder to behold - is this where Mantello's attention\nwas the whole time? Susan Hilferty has designed scores of distinctive and\ncharacterful costumes for Munchkins, flying monkeys, and Emerald City\ndenizens (the first scene there, with the entire stage is swathed in green,\nis an impressive sight). Kenneth Posner's lighting designs are expansive in\nnumber, hue, and range of activity. Lee's colorful, industrial sets\nincorporate all manner of theatrical devices to suggest a wealth of\nlocations, and do it with an invigorating style missing most other places in\nthe production.\n\nLee's work at least helps you get the full value for your theatregoing\ndollar that the show's other elements deny, but so did the sets for last\nseason's megaflop Dance of the Vampires. Whatever else that show may\nhave been, it was never boring; it's harder to say that about Wicked , the\nultimate whitewashed example of how a musical written to pander can even\nfail at that when it has no centralized guiding force.",
