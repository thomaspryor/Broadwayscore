Buy tickets to Wicked here.\nWicked on Broadway: Review\nWhen it opened on October 30, 2003, Wicked was unique among Broadway shows. Sure, L. Frank Baum's The Wizard of Oz had been adapted for the stage a century ago, but a musical prequel that explained how the Wicked Witch of the West got that way, and explored her true relationship to Glinda the Good Witch? It seemed like a stretch. And yet, so did dancing and singing cats, and we know how that story ended. Truth is, Wicked was a combination of outstanding elements. It had a fantastical and catchy pop-inflected score by Stephen Schwartz (Pippin, Godspell), a smart and ironic book by Winnie Holzman, and dynamite direction by Joe Mantello. For a Broadway show set in the whimsical and delightfully oddball world of Oz, the set and costume designs were appropriately outlandish. But when it opened on Broadway, Wicked also had two secret weapons: Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth as Elphaba and Galinda, respectively. The green-skinned outcast Elphaba meets the blond and popular Galinda in school, and they go from instant animosity to close friends. When the two girls meet the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, however, everything changes and they're forced to take sides. Today,Wicked is one the hottest Broadway tickets, with productions constantly on tour and around the world. In short, it's never going to stop \"Defying Gravity.\"—David Cote\n\nBeen there, done that?

Let the diva wars begin!\n\nRecommendedPhotograph: Beth LevendisWhile tourists bumble into Sbarro looking for a New York slice, pizza aficionados have been busy colonizing this pedigreed newcomer—a collaboration between Kesté’s talented Roberto Caporuscio and his decorated Naples mentor, Antonio Starita. Start with tasty bites like the frittatine (a deep-fried spaghetti cake oozing prosciutto cotto and béchamel sauce), before digging into the stellar wood-fired pies, which range from standards such as the Margherita to more creative constructions like the Rachetta, a racket-shaped pizza with a “handle” made of ricotta-stuffed dough. The main event, however, should be the habit-forming Montanara Starita, which gets a quick dip in the deep fryer before hitting the oven to develop its puffy, golden crust. Topped with tomato sauce, basil and intensely smoky buffalo mozzarella, it’s a worthy new addition to the pantheon of classic New York pies.Read moreDanjiKoreanHell's Kitchenprice 2 of 4RecommendedWith butcher-block tables, inventive Korean-inspired small plates and a Michelin star to boot, this diminutive eatery is of the rare breed that would likely be just as packed downtown as it is on West 52nd Street. Chef Hooni Kim (Daniel, Masa) brings his haute French training to bear on the food of his homeland, splitting the menu between traditional dishes and modernist riffs. His flavors are bright and fresh, with a great balance of sweet, spicy and funky elements. The classics seem, for the most part, like upgrades on their source material—scallion pancakes are exceptionally fat and crispy, while chili-slicked buckwheat noodles are paired with a beer-friendly salad of spicy vegetables and chewy, briny whelks. The updated stuff is equally appealing. Sliders may be passé, but you won’t want to miss Kim’s addictive bulgogi beef variety, served on pillowy grilled buns with spicy pickles and scallion salsa.Read moreBook onlineAdvertisingEscaItalianHell's Kitchenprice 3 of 4Esca is the area’s slickest and most creative choice. Part of the Mario Batali–Joe Bastianich empire, the menu takes a whirl through Southern Italian seaside cooking (spaghetti with lobster). Start with the signature raw antipasti, called crudi, then move on to excellent, shareable pastas such as superfresh grilled fish, lavish Sicilian-style seafood stew, or succulent square-cut maccheroni alla chitarra with sea urchin and crab.Read moreBook onlineShake ShackHamburgersUpper West Sideprice 1 of 4RecommendedPhotograph: Roxana MarroquinPerennial burger mecca Shake Shack continues to be one of the most coveted postmuseum pit stops for its nostalgic beef patties, crinkle fries and frozen custard. Thankfully, the usually long queue moves fairly fast.Read moreAdvertisingTotto RamenJapaneseHell's Kitchenprice 2 of 4Photograph: Alex StradaLike a traditional Japanese ramen-ya, this narrow, below-street-level noodle joint is designed for quick meals. Most seats are along a counter, behind which the chefs crisp pork slices with a propane torch and tend to bubbling stockpots. The specialty here is paitan ramen, a creamy soup that’s a chicken-based variation on Hakata, Japan’s famous tonkotsu (pork) broth. The most basic version, the Totto chicken, is a flavorful, opaque soup bobbing with thin, straight noodles and slow-cooked pork ridged with satiny fat. The real winner, however, is the miso ramen, enriched with a scoop of nutty fermented soybean paste and wavy egg noodles. Ramen is generally\na feast unto itself, but you can bulk up a meal with sides like char siu mayo don—a mound of rice heaped with more unctuous pork, yuzu-accented mayonnaise and raw sliced scallions.Read moreEnter email addressDéjà vu!
