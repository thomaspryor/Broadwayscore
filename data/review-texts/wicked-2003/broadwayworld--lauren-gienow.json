  "bwwExcerpt": "Lauren Samuels brings a sort of quiet strength to the role of Elphaba that I haven’t quite seen before. We see Elphaba’s hopes get dashed a few times early in the play and she brushes herself off and handles it with a stiff upper lip in a way that we get the sense that she has dealt with this for her entire life. As the stakes get higher, and her cause becomes bigger than herself, so do her reactions. This slow burn into an absolutely epic, and quite frankly, terrifying (in the best way) perform",
