  "bwwExcerpt": "Admittedly, this was my first time seeing Wicked (a sensitive subject for a theatre-goer). They had me hooked with the flying monkeys before the curtain even opened but, when it did, I was immediately transported to another world. A world of magical steampunk-meets-Beetlejuice-meets Sweeney Todd costumes, wondrous characters, and settings that inspired open-mouthed awe. If I had thought that was enough (I did!), they had much more in store! Orpheum Theater - Omaha, NE Courtney Brummer-Clark, Oma",
