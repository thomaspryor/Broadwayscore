  "bwwExcerpt": "From what I saw, the people were left totally thrilled by this touring production, leaping to their feet with thunderous applause at the final curtain call. And it was earned. This Wicked ticks all the necessary boxes: fantastic leads, swoony Fiyero, lush costumes, seamless practical effects. It’s all here, just like we’ve come to expect since Wicked’s 2003 debut. Shea's Performing Arts Center - Buffalo, NY",
