'Wicked' is the story of a gifted woman in the fictitious Land of Oz with an unfavorable physical condition, who is driven to public service, fighting for minority rights against a regime who wants to silence and imprison minority members of its own society...I’m in love with this show; I’m in love with the message it sends and the lesson that there is perhaps wickedness thrust upon good people at times.\"\n\nRead more",
