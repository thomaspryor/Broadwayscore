  "bwwExcerpt": "Like the twister that brings Dorothy to Oz, there are unexpected twists and turns in this wondrous tale told through song. Stephen Schwartz’s musical genius is evident. He crafts a cohesive, overarching story through music, while each character’s songs reveal much about them individually. Glinda’s songs are light and airy, while Elphaba’s resonate at a more serious level. The tone and timbre of the music guide our feelings about each character.",
