  "fullText": "Starring: Kristin Chenoweth, Idina Menzel; Director: Joe Mantello\n\nPosted November 21 2003 — 12:00 AM EST\n\nWhat if the Wicked Witch of the West was just misunderstood? So  posits this lavishly designed reimagining of the cackling baddie  from ”The Wizard of Oz.” From the novel by Gregory Maguire, the  musical follows the green-hued Elphaba (a pull-out-the-stops  Idina Menzel) from her social-outcast school days to her fateful  encounter with that girl from Kansas. A few other familiar faces  turn up along the way, including the bitchy blond Glinda (a  glittering Kristin Chenoweth), Elphaba’s nemesis – turned – bestest  friend. Written by Winnie Holzman (”My So-Called Life”), ”Wicked”’s  at its cleverest with the girl stuff; the streamlining of  Maguire’s story – reducing a totalitarian allegory to an  animal-rights flap – weakens the narrative logic. Catchy Stephen  Schwartz songs (Chenoweth steals the show with ”Popular”; Menzel  takes it back with ”I’m Not That Girl”) compensate for a dreary  opening number, but it’s the ”Wicked” witches who really make  magic.",
