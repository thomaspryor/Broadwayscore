  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"To begin with, it looks like a million dollars - or, to be more precise, like every dime of the $14 million that has been spent on it. Dare we say it? Here's a Broadway show where the ticket price doesn't seem inflated. You will actually feel that you got $100 worth of entertainment - and then some... The show and its many parts do coalesce to create a believable, and extremely thought-provoking, alternate universe, with music, sets, costumes and performances that simply take your breath away.\"",
