The map of the Emerald City sets the stage before the show begins. Elphie's Green Elixir: vodka, green apple syrup, lemon juice and apple juice for $12. Because of “Wicked,” I have been changed for good — and you could be too. This brilliant reimagining of a classic tale offers a new perspective on the story we think we know, showing the untold side of those we’ve been taught to see as “wicked.” The two-hour and 45-minute Tony Award-winning production serves as a prequel to “The Wizard of Oz,” exploring the untold story of the green Elphaba, the misunderstood Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda, the bubbly Good Witch of the South. The story centers on themes of friendship, love, power and societal expectations, revealing how these two women form an unlikely bond, only to ultimately follow divergent paths. Currently running at the Morrison Center through Sunday, April 13, “Wicked” features a book by Winnie Holzman, music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and the direction by Joe Mantello. The story of “Wicked” has been making headlines over the past year — whether it be on screen, stage, or somewhere in-between. Unlike many, I had never seen or read any version of the adaptation, going into this performance completely blind. It was everything I didn’t know I was hoping for — and so much more. Accompanied by a live orchestra, every musical number is mesmerizing, and the special effects and costumes are so stunning they left me completely speechless. This cast was absolutely captivating, with each member contributing something essential that made the performance come to life. Glinda (Austen Danielle Bohmer) and Elphaba (Lauren Samuels) shared a magnetic connection that radiated in every shared moment. Bohmer’s natural comedic flare makes her the perfect person for the role, and during the duo’s performance of “For Good,” sniffles echoed through the audience. At times, Samuels stood alone on stage — no props or dramatic lighting — yet she held the space completely, consumed by the role. Samuels, from the United Kingdom, impressively masks her accent during the boisterous music numbers, and fully embodies the character with confidence and skill. The beloved Boq (Alex Vinh) was another standout, who did an exceptional job of playing the character arc of love, sacrifice and consequences. However none of the characters quite hit me like the monkeys did. The monkeys, who doubled as students, Emerald City residents, palace guards, and more, truly stole the show. Their costumes, expressive mannerisms, and the constant thrill of wire-flying elevated the experience beyond just a play — it became a breathtaking display of talent and artistry. From the moment you enter the theater, the stage setting immerses you into a whimsical world that feels both familiar and fantastically new at the same time. Dominating over the stage is a massive Time Dragon Clock, with its wings and gears twitching and smoke pouring out of its mouth as the curtain rises. The props and set pieces glide in and out with precision — from Glinda’s shimmering bubble to Elphaba’s dramatic airborne moments — creating a visually rich stage that’s as magical as the story itself. There were many moments throughout the play I thought to myself, \"how in the world are they doing that?\" Special shoutout to Susan Hilfery (costumes), Kenneth Posner (lighting) and Elaine J. McCarthy (projections) — I have never seen a performance use fractaling lights, bedazzling costumes and more to transform the stage into pure magic. Act one closes with a performance of “Defying Gravity,” and all I have to say is I was so impressed I had to push my mouth closed when the lights turned on. There was not one slip up or mispronunciation — this cast is a group of true professionals. And as the final curtain dropped, a standing ovation was give from the crowd. For all the fans, the Morrison Center offers a variety of merchandise for purchase, along with two-themed drinks: Elphie’s Green Elixir and Glinda’s Popular Punch. I tried the Green Elixir — it was absolutely delicious and, thankfully, didn’t turn me green. This is one performance you won’t want to miss whether you're a long time fan or new to the story.
