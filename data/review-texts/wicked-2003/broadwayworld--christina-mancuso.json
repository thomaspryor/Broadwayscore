  "bwwExcerpt": "Lissa deGuzman is fairly new to the Wicked world, landing her dream role of Elphaba and joining the tour in late March after playing Jasmine in the touring production of ALADDIN. While very technically precise vocally and endearingly awkward, deGuzman really got her rhythm going in the second Act. She showed her tenderness and vulnerability with Jordan Litz (Fiyero) in \"As Long as You're Mine,\" and belted out a triumphant \"No Good Deed,\" officially claiming her title as Wicked Witch of the West.",
