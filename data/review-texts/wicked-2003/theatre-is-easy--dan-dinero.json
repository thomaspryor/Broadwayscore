  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"This musical is full of glitz and is a big Broadway spectacular; it is also a charming story with a wonderfully catchy score. 'Wicked' is satisfying in a sparkly way, and also in a storytelling way...The popularity of 'Wicked' can be explained by the last minute or so of the first act. It is an incredibly successful merging of dramatic spectacle and character development - and is one of the few truly unforgettable moments I have seen in a Broadway musical.\"",
