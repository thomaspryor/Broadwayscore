  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'Wicked's' at its cleverest with the girl stuff; the streamlining of Maguire’s story – reducing a totalitarian allegory to an animal-rights flap – weakens the narrative logic. Catchy Stephen Schwartz songs compensate for a dreary opening number, but it’s the 'Wicked' witches who really make magic.\""
