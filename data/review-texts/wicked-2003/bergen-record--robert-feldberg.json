  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"'Wicked' tries, in its ambition, to do so much that it's inevitable that it fails to be a smooth, cohesive show. It's too long - two-hours-45- minutes - and it often has a lumbering quality. But its reach, its attempt to be meaty and relevant and theatrical, is not only admirable, it's stimulating. This is a musical that offers many pleasures as you watch it, and - this is rare - also stays with you.\"",
