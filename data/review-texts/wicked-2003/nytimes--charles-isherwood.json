When “The Producers” first opened, the box office frenzy seemed to augur a run for the ages. But once Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick left their roles, the show lost some of its essential DNA.\n\n“Wicked” might have seemed primed to face a similar fate. The reviews for this Stephen Schwartz-Winnie Holzman show skewed mixed to negative. But the notices for the stars, Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel, were rapturous. Both were nominated for Tonys, and Ms. Menzel won. (The musical itself lost the big prize to a littler production, “Avenue Q.”)\n\nWhat would happen when these two magnetic performers left the show? A decade later, the answer is clear: Nothing much. “Wicked” passed the 10-year mark last fall, and evinces little sign of box office fatigue.\n\nA return visit reveals that the producers have been careful, not to say monomaniacal, about replicating the experience they gave audiences in the opening months. Remarkably, they continue to secure performers who can both fill the (hefty) vocal and (less taxing) acting demands of the central roles, the “good” witch Glinda and the “wicked” one, Elphaba, as well as evoke the distinctive styles of the stars who put their imprint on them.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.",
