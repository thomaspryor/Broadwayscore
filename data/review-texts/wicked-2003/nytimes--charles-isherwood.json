When “The Producers” first opened, the box office frenzy seemed to augur a run for the ages. But once Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick left their roles, the show lost some of its essential DNA.\n\n“Wicked” might have seemed primed to face a similar fate. The reviews for this Stephen Schwartz-Winnie Holzman show skewed mixed to negative. But the notices for the stars, Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel, were rapturous. Both were nominated for Tonys, and Ms. Menzel won. (The musical itself lost the big prize to a littler production, “Avenue Q.”)\n\nWhat would happen when these two magnetic performers left the show? A decade later, the answer is clear: Nothing much. “Wicked” passed the 10-year mark last fall, and evinces little sign of box office fatigue.\n\nA return visit reveals that the producers have been careful, not to say monomaniacal, about replicating the experience they gave audiences in the opening months. Remarkably, they continue to secure performers who can both fill the (hefty) vocal and (less taxing) acting demands of the central roles, the “good” witch Glinda and the “wicked” one, Elphaba, as well as evoke the distinctive styles of the stars who put their imprint on them.\n\nAs Glinda, Jenni Barber sings with pure tone that mimics, to a degree, the blend of pop and operetta that Ms. Chenoweth specialized in. She shows, too, a perky comic flair in the role of the pertly entitled Glinda, playing her as a cross between the dithery Billie Burke and the calculating Reese Witherspoon (in “Legally Blonde” mode). Ms. Barber even brings fresh flourishes to her performance, inflecting some dialogue with mock-urban intonations that actually make the show seem more contemporary.\n\nElphaba, who grows up battling bigotry toward her lurid skin tone, is the less flashy and more earnest role, but Christine Dwyer belts her way through it with an urgency that matches my recollections of Ms. Menzel. At times, she seems a veritable clone, right down to the sharp jaw line and acres of teeth, but then again, if you slapped neon-green makeup and a pointy black hat on me, I might pass for Ms. Menzel’s Elphaba.\n\nDoing her determined best to put even these capable performers in the shade is Mary Testa, a comic actress of big voice and bigger presence, now in the role of the meddling Madame Morrible. With a tornado of blond curls teetering on her head, and ghoulish white makeup turning her into a smiling gargoyle, Ms. Testa seems to be auditioning for the role of Mrs. Lovett in “Sweeney Todd.” (To which I say, bring it on.) How she manages to move across the stage in her heavily upholstered costumes, which make her look like an animated couch with throw pillows attached, is hard to fathom.\n\nWhich brings me to the bad news: Not messing with success also means not tinkering with the less felicitous aspects of your show. “Wicked” boasts ugly costumes, ugly choreography and an ugly set by Eugene Lee.\n\nThat oppressive set, however, now strikes me as a potentially significant contributor to the production’s success. It seems to swallow up half the space in the Gershwin Theater, which normally itself does the swallowing, making big musicals look puny. Here the equation is reversed, so that this big show retains enough emotional intimacy that even the tween girls in the cheaper seats can feel Elphaba’s pain.\n\nMy return visit also confirmed how significant those young fans remain to the show’s success. The audience at the evening performance I attended teemed with bopping tweens and their families. Many of the girls clearly knew the show’s score already, greeting Mr. Schwartz’s polished Broadway-pop confections and throat-searing ballads with the physical equivalent of a half-dozen smiley-face emoticons.\n\nIn retrospect, “Wicked” seems an early sign of the cultural clout — which is to say buying power — of a generation of girls (and now women) whose desire to see, and read, and sing along with stories about female empowerment has become a snowballing trend. “The Hunger Games” came along in 2008, and became one of the biggest media phenomena of the past decade. And, of course, “Frozen,” Disney’s animated blockbuster movie about two royal sisters with a complicated relationship, surely owes a significant debt to “Wicked,” and not just because Ms. Menzel gave voice to the heroine Elsa, with her snow-blowing superpowers and her megahit “Let It Go.”\n\nWhen “Wicked” at last ceases to defy gravity at the box office — and that still seems a good way off — it’s a safe bet that a Broadway musical of “Frozen” will be primed to take its place.\n\nCritics take another look at long-running Broadway shows.",
