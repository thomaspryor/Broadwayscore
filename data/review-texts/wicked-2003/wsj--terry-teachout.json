Kristin Chenoweth finally\nhas a full-fledged star part that's worthy of her. Stephen Schwartz has\nwritten a ballad with legs. And Joel Grey, God bless him, is back on stage.\nSo what's not to like? Not much, really. \"Wicked,\" which opened last night at the Gershwin Theatre,\nisn't perfect, but it's more than good enough to run for a decade or two.\nIf it doesn't please you, you're too tough to please.\n\nCopyright ©2024 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
