    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Rave | Claude: The critic's own rating of 88 places this firmly in rave territory, and the language 'smart, resilient show that does honor' indicates strong positive assessment. | GPT-4o: The original rating of 88, combined with the positive language in the review, indicates a strong recommendation. The critic praises the show as smart and resilient, suggesting a high level of approval. | Gemini: The review is positive, highlighting the show's intelligence and resilience. While the critic's original rating is 88, the language used suggests a strong positive rather than a rave, so I slightly lowered the score.",
