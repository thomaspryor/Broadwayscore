  "fullText": "Starring: Kristin Chenoweth, Idina Menzel; Director: Joe Mantello\n\nPosted November 21 2003 — 12:00 AM EST\n\nWhat if the Wicked Witch of the West was just misunderstood? So  posits this lavishly designed reimagining of the cackling baddie  from ”The Wizard of Oz.” From the novel by Gregory Maguire, the  musical follows the green-hued Elphaba (a pull-out-the-stops  Idina Menzel) from her social-outcast school days to her fateful  encounter with that girl from Kansas. A few other familiar faces  turn up along the way, including the bitchy blond Glinda (a  glittering Kristin Chenoweth), Elphaba’s nemesis – turned – bestest  friend. Written by Winnie Holzman (”My So-Called Life”), ”Wicked”’s  at its cleverest with the girl stuff; the streamlining of  Maguire’s story – reducing a totalitarian allegory to an  animal-rights flap – weakens the narrative logic. Catchy Stephen  Schwartz songs (Chenoweth steals the show with ”Popular”; Menzel  takes it back with ”I’m Not That Girl”) compensate for a dreary  opening number, but it’s the ”Wicked” witches who really make  magic.",

  "dtliExcerpt": "I'm a peculiar blend of the Pragmatist and the Romanticist and the crocodile. The Monster,” Tennessee Williams said. After the triumph in 1947 of “A Streetcar Named Desire,” he dedicated himself to his own greatness; the result was a moral and emotional attrition, which his plays increasingly registered. “I grow less integrated,” Williams wrote to a friend in 1950. “I am more alone and more lost than I ever was, and know hundreds more people!” By the time he began to write his masterpiece of the mid-fifties, “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,” now in a superb revival at the Music Box, his tally of losses included three consecutive critical failures—“Summer and Smoke,” “The Rose Tattoo,” and “Camino Real.” Williams’s embattled situation—his compulsion to lay claim to his literary legacy at all costs—found a fierce and funny reflection in the struggle of Maggie, “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” ’s heroine, to seize her own sexual and financial inheritance. “My hat is still in the ring, and I am determined to win!” Maggie says. For her, endurance is everything. “Life has got to be allowed to continue even after the dream of life is—all—over,” she says. But her appetite for vindictive triumph has turned her, like Williams, into a monster—a fact that she recognizes but can’t change. To her aptly named husband, Brick, a frozen and aloof alcoholic, Maggie admits, “I’ve gone through this—hideous!—transformation, become—hard! Frantic!—cruel!!” In Maggie, “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” offers us the first glimpse of the tortured and torturous inner terrain into which Williams had wandered (he called it “the beanstalk country”): a hell of his own making.",
