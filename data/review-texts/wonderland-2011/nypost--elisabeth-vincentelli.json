  "bwwExcerpt": "At first, the Queen seems faithful to Carroll's creation, albeit with nods to 'Evita' and Momma Rose. Then she turns out to be downright grandmotherly. What a cop-out: It's hard to care for Alice's safety if there's no real danger. This is also typical of the work's misguided approach. Who is a musical about a grown-up Alice for? This show clearly casts a wide net, but it also takes family-friendliness as a license to be simplistic. Come on, 'Wonderland,' test us -- we're smarter than you think.",
