    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative assessment calling it 'busy, overstuffed' with only 'a few inspired moments'. The critic finds fundamental problems with the production's identity and execution. | GPT-4o: The review highlights a lack of coherence and balance, with only a few inspired moments, indicating a negative overall assessment. | Gemini: The review acknowledges some positive aspects (\"inspired moments\") but ultimately describes the production as \"busy, overstuffed\" and failing to find its footing, indicating a mixed or neutral overall assessment. | Kimi: While the critic notes a few inspired moments, the overall verdict is that the production is mostly busy and overstuffed, failing to successfully navigate its target audience or tone, which indicates a recommendation against seeing the show.",
