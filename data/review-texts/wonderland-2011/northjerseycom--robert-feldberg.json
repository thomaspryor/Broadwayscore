  "bwwExcerpt": "\"Wonderland\" is the kind of musical Stephen Sondheim would write - in his worst nightmare. If Sondheim has demonstrated the wit, sophistication and dramatic artistry to which musical theater can rise, \"Wonderland,\" which recklessly opened Sunday at the Marquis Theatre, reveals the appalling depths to which it can fall. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the show is awful in every way.",
