  "bwwExcerpt": "Mr. Wildhorn's absence from Broadway since his 2004 adaptation of 'Dracula' has not exactly occasioned widespread hand-wringing, and his competent rendering of various pop styles in 'Wonderland' probably won't win him a host of converts. Mr. Murphy's lyrics are of a matching blandness, with Alice's earnest ballads of self-discovery amply stocked in cliché. ('I remember every moment when my heart was young and free,' she sings upon meeting - literally - her inner child, 'and to my surprise I look through your eyes and once more I can see.')... But Alice's adventures are perhaps most subversively appealing for their blithe indifference to the kind of tidy moralizing that had been a staple of Victorian children's literature. 'Wonderland' thoroughly nullifies this aspect. Instead of transporting us back to an anarchic childhood world where right and wrong are just words like any others, to be tossed about at merry whim, the show drearily suggests that even grown-ups have to keep doing their homework, working doggedly toward self-improvement day after endless day.",
