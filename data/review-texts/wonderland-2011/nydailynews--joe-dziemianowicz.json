  "bwwExcerpt": "Something resembling a plot doesn't arrive until late in Act I, as Alice's journey clarifies. It's about reclaiming deferred joy and the powers of dreams and self-invention lost and locked inside her. It's like a John Mayer song: your body - and mind - is a Wonderland. Performances are a mixed bag. Ritchie brings breezy zest to Jack, while young Sonenclar impresses with a remarkably mature voice she sometimes overworks 'American Idol'-style. Swallowed up by her cubist playing-card costume, Mason could be funnier as the royal. The big-lunged Shindle appears stiff as the villainous Mad Hatter, but the role is written that way. Dacal ('In the Heights') displays a pretty voice and presence in her star turn. Alice's best number is her opening duet with Chloe, 'Worst Day of My Life.' It comes before they hit the rabbit hole. It is, alas, downward from there.",
