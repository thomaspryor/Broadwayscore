  "bwwExcerpt": "To be sure, Wonderland has a lot going for it, as I've said in other reviews. The production at the Marquis Theatre is visually striking, highlighted by Susan Hilferty's wildly inventive costume design. Wildhorn's pop score is chock full of exhilarating numbers, such as the salsa-flavored Go With the Flow, featuring Jose Llana as El Gato, a Latino Cheshire Cat, and Karen Mason's vaudeville turn as the daffy Queen of Hearts, Off With Their Heads (Mason also plays the mother-in-law).
