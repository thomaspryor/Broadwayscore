    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic describes the show as 'perfect' which is strong positive language, though the dessert metaphor suggests light entertainment rather than profound theater. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the show as 'a perfect holiday snickerdoodle,' which suggests a positive, light-hearted, and enjoyable experience. Given the lack of full context, the single positive excerpt leads to a higher score within the Positive bucket. | Gemini: The single excerpt uses the phrase \"perfect holiday snickerdoodle,\" which indicates a strong positive sentiment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as 'perfect' holiday entertainment using an affectionate metaphor, indicating a clear recommendation to see it, though the single curated quote provides limited context for the full review's assessment.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Then I actually saw All In, and count me among the Rich converts. Directed by the ever nimble Alex Timbers and performed by a rotating cast of four actors – I was lucky to get the truly excellent John Mulaney, Fred Armisen, Renée Elise Goldsberry, and Richard Kind – the 90-minute All In is a perfect holiday snickerdoodle, a light and tasty snack no less funny for its brevity and lack of splashy production values.",
