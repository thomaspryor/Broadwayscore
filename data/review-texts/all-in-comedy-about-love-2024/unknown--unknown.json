    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests some enjoyment ('silly cap-off') but also implies a desire for more substance or content, indicating a mixed response. The lack of full context and single excerpt warning further reduce confidence. | Gemini: The single excerpt expresses a desire for more, suggesting some enjoyment but ultimately leaving the reviewer wanting. Given the limited text, a mixed score seems appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt expresses clear enjoyment of the show's comedic climax and a desire for additional content, indicating a positive reception. However, as a single truncated quote, confidence is reduced.",
