    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed sentiment, expressing a desire for more from the show. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a low confidence in the score. | Gemini: The phrase \"I wished for more\" suggests the reviewer found some enjoyment but ultimately wanted more from the show. Given the single excerpt, it's hard to determine the overall sentiment, but it leans towards mixed. | Kimi: With only one curated excerpt available, the verdict is unclear; 'wished for more' suggests the production felt incomplete or left the critic wanting, while 'silly' could indicate either dismissiveness or playful charm, warranting a middle-range Mixed score.",
