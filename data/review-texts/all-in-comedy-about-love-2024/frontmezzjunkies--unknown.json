  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "What ultimately makes Two Strangers such a winning Broadway arrival is its belief that tenderness is still theatrical currency. Jackson's direction keeps the show surefooted, even at its most delicate, allowing Tutty and Pitts, and the entire creative team, to craft something that sneaks up on you. As we saw with Maybe Happy Ending, audiences are hungry for productions that treat emotion as serious craft, and hopefully, with these delightfully engaging Two Strangers, the much-needed emotional connection will deliver the Tony Award goods once again.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('winning Broadway arrival', 'delightfully engaging') with praise for direction and craft. Single excerpt warning suggests using upper end of Positive range given clear enthusiasm. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as a 'winning Broadway arrival' and highlights its emotional engagement, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full review text reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review uses positive language like \"winning Broadway arrival\", \"delightfully engaging\", and praises the direction and creative team. The excerpt suggests a strong recommendation, so I placed it in the upper range of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as a 'winning Broadway arrival' with 'surefooted' direction and 'delightfully engaging' performances, even suggesting Tony Award potential. While clearly positive, confidence is low due to the single-excerpt limitation.",
