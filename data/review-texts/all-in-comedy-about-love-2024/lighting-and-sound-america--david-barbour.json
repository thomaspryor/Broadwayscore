    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with qualified positive recommendation - suggests worth seeing but with lowered expectations and caveats. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed experience, advising caution in expectations for a 'reasonably good time'. The lack of full text and single excerpt warning lowers confidence. | Gemini: The phrase \"reasonably good time\" indicates a positive but not enthusiastic recommendation. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers a mildly positive verdict with significant caveats; 'reasonably good time' is faint praise suggesting conditional enjoyment rather than enthusiastic endorsement.",
