However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, describing the show as uneventful and lacking a satisfying climax. However, with only one excerpt, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is negative, suggesting a disappointing and anticlimactic experience. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single available excerpt offers a definitive negative verdict, describing the show as tedious and ultimately pointless, though the limited context warrants low confidence.",
