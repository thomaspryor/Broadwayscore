Let's hope they don't stay strangers to the Broadway stage.",

However, confidence is low due to limited text available. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the simplicity and honesty of the show and highlights the performances of the leads as a strong point. The tone is positive, but the limited text and lack of a full review warrant a cautious approach. | Gemini: The review calls the musical \"delightful\" and praises the leads, but also notes that \"there isn't a lot to unpack here.\" Given the single excerpt and the slightly qualified praise, a score in the middle of the positive range seems appropriate. | Kimi: Despite noting the show's simplicity, the critic calls it 'delightful' and 'honest' while praising the lead performances, indicating a clear recommendation.",
