    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic dismisses the work as not even qualifying as a proper play, suggesting fundamental structural problems. However, this is only one excerpt and may not reflect the full review sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view of the production, implying it lacks cohesion or depth expected of a play. However, the single excerpt may not fully represent the review, leading to low confidence. | Gemini: The single excerpt available is negative, suggesting the show is disjointed and not a cohesive play. Given the limited information, I'm placing it in the negative bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the show for lacking theatrical cohesion, describing it as more of a reading than a fully realized play. Given only one curated excerpt is available, the full review context is uncertain, warranting low confidence.",
