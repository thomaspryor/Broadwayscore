  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "As for the stage itself, the design (also by Gilmour) consists of two towers of silver painted luggage of various sizes on a turntable. It's not the most visually exciting backdrop, but the suitcases do prove inventive, opening at various points to reveal props, a closet, a bed, a vanity, and even a noodle shop. The turntable also leads to lots of dramatic walking in place. Not highly original, but effective enough. The same could probably be said of the entire romantic comedy genre, but when you have the right stars and the right songs, it doesn't really matter. If it works, it works. And Two Strangers (Carry a Cake Across New York) definitely works.",

However, with only one curated excerpt available, the full review's tone remains uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt concludes with a positive assessment, stating that the show 'definitely works.' However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low and the score is at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The review acknowledges some shortcomings in the design but ultimately concludes that \"Two Strangers (Carry a Cake Across New York) definitely works,\" indicating a positive, albeit qualified, recommendation. | Kimi: The critic notes the design and rom-com genre elements are not highly original but finds them 'effective enough,' delivering a clear verdict that the show 'definitely works' and justifies itself through its stars and songs.",
