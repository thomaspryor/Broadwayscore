    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests an amusing and entertaining production, but lacks strong praise or detailed evaluation. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is set at the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a mildly positive assessment. Given the limited information, I've assigned a score at the lower end of the 'Positive' bucket. | Kimi: Single curated excerpt uses the mildly positive descriptor 'amusingly,' suggesting light recommendation but limited evidence. Following excerpt guidelines for mildly positive single quotes, score sits at lower end of Positive bucket (70-74) with low confidence due to truncation and lack of full verdict context.",
