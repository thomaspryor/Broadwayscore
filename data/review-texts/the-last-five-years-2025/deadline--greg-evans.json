  "bwwExcerpt": "the problem with The Last Five Years, even with White’s sensitive direction, splendid orchestrations that lean heavy on piano, percussion, guitar and some gorgeous cello, and an impressionistic New York streetscape set, is the play itself, too confusing to offer clarity when clarity is needed – is Cathy a good actress or just a pipe-dreamer? Is Jamie a narcissist or just a writer who wants to write? Given that the musical is written by Jamie, er, Jason Robert Brown who, like his onstage stand-in had just had his commercial breakthrough – Brown’s Parade on Broadway to Jamie’s bestselling novel – when their actress wives allegedly began their cycles of depression and failure – The Last Five Years can’t help but feel a little skewed toward the dudes.",
