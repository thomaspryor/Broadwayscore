  "bwwExcerpt": "If everything else about this revival were perfect, it might somehow overcome the wrongness of its Jamie. But aside from Warren and the band—expanded from six to nine pieces in Brown’s new orchestrations, and music-directed once again by Tom Murray, who has been with this show from the start—White’s staging looks a mess. Model buildings crop up like Monopoly hotels on David Zinn’s unprepossessing set, and Stacey Derosier’s lighting nearly drowns the characters in pools of blue and red; even the costumes, by the normally faultless Dede Ayite, often miss their marks. Brown’s show deserves better than the serial missteps of this 85-minute faux pas de deux.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The fault of this version of The Last Five Years is not in itself, but in its stars... The problem is not that Jonas can’t sing the part, though he doesn’t sing it especially well. (He’s fine in his middle range but wobbly at the bottom and strained at the top.) It’s that the persona he has crafted over time and the performance habits that go with it... are at a polar distance from what he is asked to play in The Last Five Years.\"\n\nRead more",
