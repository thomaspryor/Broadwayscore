  "bwwExcerpt": "Even more than its distillation of a failed relationship, the reason to see this full-length duet of a show is for the singing, and on that account, The Last Five Years delivers. Warren may blow Jonas out of the water, at least in terms of vocal prowess, but both have a solid grasp of their characters in isolation, if not together. In a season of overhyped shows, the evident sincerity, the effort, the fervent belief in character – and Warren’s occasional transcendence – feels refreshing.",
