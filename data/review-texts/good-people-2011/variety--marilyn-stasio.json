  "bwwExcerpt": "If 'Good People' isn't a hit for Manhattan Theater Club, there is no justice in the land. David Lindsay-Abaire pays his respects to his old South Boston neighborhood with this tough and tender play about the insurmountable class divide between those who make it out of this blue-collar Irish neighborhood and those who find themselves left behind. The scrappy characters have tremendous appeal, and the moral dilemma they grapple with -- is it strength of character or just a few lucky breaks that determines a person's fate? -- holds special significance in today's harsh economic climate.",
