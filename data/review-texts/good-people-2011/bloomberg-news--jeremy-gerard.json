  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Daniel Sullivan can’t finesse the play’s contrivances. Chief among them is the familiar setup of a confrontation between a proud denizen of the old neighborhood and the successful striver who escaped while clinging to a highly selective, even romanticized, version of his rough-and- tumble childhood. But John Lee Beatty’s evocative sets and Pat Collins’s pale verismo lighting lift the show above the norm.",
