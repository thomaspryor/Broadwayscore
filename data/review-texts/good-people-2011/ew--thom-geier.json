  "bwwExcerpt": "Memorably played by Frances McDormand with a potent mix of prickly aggression and bruised-feeling withdrawal, Margaret is a middle-aged woman in South Boston's Lower End. At the start of the play, she is fired from the dollar store where she works due to her perpetual tardiness — she's usually late because of a grown daughter with serious development issues still living at home. This is a woman who has made serious sacrifices in her life — as the events of this remarkable and timely new play make clear.",
