  "bwwExcerpt": "The excellent cast is rounded out by a few Southie denizens. Margie's money-grubbing landlady and so-called friend, Dottie, is played with a steely-eyed twinkle by the inimitable Estelle Parsons. Becky Ann Baker plays Margie's equally belligerent but supportive friend, Jean, and Patrick Carroll is sweetly sensitive as Stevie, a decent younger man who tries to help Margie despite her rudeness toward him.",
