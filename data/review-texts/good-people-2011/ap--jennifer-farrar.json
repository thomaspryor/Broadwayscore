  "bwwExcerpt": "The excellent cast is rounded out by a few Southie denizens. Margie's money-grubbing landlady and so-called friend, Dottie, is played with a steely-eyed twinkle by the inimitable Estelle Parsons. Becky Ann Baker plays Margie's equally belligerent but supportive friend, Jean, and Patrick Carroll is sweetly sensitive as Stevie, a decent younger man who tries to help Margie despite her rudeness toward him.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Positive | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast, highlighting strong performances. However, without a full review or clear verdict, the positive sentiment is mild, suggesting a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the strength of the supporting cast, but lacks an overall assessment of the play itself. This suggests a mixed or neutral stance, praising elements without a clear recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt provides enthusiastic praise for the cast ('excellent', 'inimitable', 'sweetly sensitive'), indicating a strong positive assessment, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the full verdict.",
