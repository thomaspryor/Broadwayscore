  "bwwExcerpt": "Following up on his masterful work earlier this season on The Merchant of Venice, Sullivan connects to the heart of each of the play's six pithy scenes in his brisk, no-nonsense direction. His scene changes are a marvel of economy, accompanied by bursts of Pogues-style Irish jigs as the masking shrinks into an iris and reopens on a new setting. One such transition -- in which designer John Lee Beatty's chic, spacious living room for Mike and Kate gives way to the shabby walls and overhead crucifix of a church hall on bingo night -- is a gorgeous stroke of stage magic that speaks volumes. The same goes for every aspect of this terrific play in what must surely be its ideal production.",
