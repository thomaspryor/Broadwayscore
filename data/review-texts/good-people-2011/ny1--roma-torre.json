  "bwwExcerpt": "The pitch perfect cast paints a reality that bristles with edgy truth. The brilliant Estelle Parsons is dead-on, supplying comic relief as Margie’s low-class landlady. Tate Donovan is sensational, oozing conflicted impulses as a man desperate to shed his Southie skin. His liberal wife, far more comfortable in her skin, is nicely played by Renee Elise Goldsberry with both passion and restraint. And Frances McDormand finds nuances in every syllable, delivering a mesmerizing performance as a plucky casualty of the culture wars.",
