    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Strong superlative language ('towering achievement', 'greatest living actresses') indicates enthusiastic recommendation, but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict representation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for Jackson's performance, calling it a 'towering achievement.' However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low as the full review sentiment is unclear. | Gemini: The excerpt contains very high praise for the lead performance, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the praise pushes the score to the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single excerpt contains superlative praise for the lead performance using phrases like 'towering achievement' and 'greatest living actresses,' indicating a strong positive recommendation, though the limited context prevents a higher confidence rating. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
