    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for Jackson's performance with emotionally impactful language ('heartbreaking and terrifying'), but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict. Scored in upper Positive range due to clear enthusiasm. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performance as 'heartbreaking and terrifying,' suggesting a strong positive impression. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a powerful and moving performance, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence due to the limited context. | Kimi: The excerpt provides strong praise for the lead performance using evocative superlatives ('heartbreaking and terrifying'), indicating a clear recommendation despite the limited single-excerpt context.",
