Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on a strong performance, describing it as \"heartbreaking and terrifying.\" While a single excerpt, the positive tone suggests a recommendation, placing it in the positive bucket. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the lead performance using strong positive descriptors ('heartbreaking,' 'terrifying'). Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, this scores in the upper Positive range, though confidence is low due to limited text availability.",
