  "showScoreExcerpt": "“I can only advise going to see the current production of 'King Lear'...if you really want to see Glenda Jackson in the title role. She’s very good, but it’s a muddle of a production because Sam Gold, the director, seems to have thrown every idea he’s ever had at it and then left the room. Leaving all the actors to do their own version. It doesn’t make for a cohesive or particularly coherent presentation. If you’ve never been to a Shakespeare play before, don’t make this one your first.”\n\nRead more",
