  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"While Gold's direction doesn't always serve his actors, Jackson's performance in the nominal role is sublime...She gives us a Lear who when the play opens wields absolute authority by a mere raising of an eyebrow...The versatile Wilson gives an alert, canny interpretation to her Cordelia and a sassy vaudevillian spin to her Fool...Honors for the best Shakespearian chops in the support cast go to John Douglas Thompson.\" \n\nRead more",
