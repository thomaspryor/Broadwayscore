However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses the word \"magnificent,\" which indicates a strong positive sentiment. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('magnificent') for the lead performance, indicating a positive view of the production, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
