  "bwwExcerpt": "Gold's production is full of interesting directorial choices that do not quite cohere into a shared universe for King Lear's characters to inhabit. The subtle Ruth Wilson plays Cordelia with soulful, depressive interiority-in a wise stroke of casting, she doubles as the Fool-while the hyperintense Aisling O'Sullivan, as Regan, looks at every moment like lasers are about to shoot from her eyes. Jayne Houdyshell, John Douglas Thompson and Dion Johnstone offer conventional turns as the play's Lear ",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt uses strong evaluative language ('compelling study') and praises the lead performance with vivid, appreciative description. Given the critic's 80 rating and positive language, this falls in the upper Positive range, but confidence is medium due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Jackson's performance as 'compelling,' suggesting a positive view of the production. The original rating of 80 supports a positive classification, aligning with the critic's likely overall sentiment. | Gemini: The single excerpt praises the lead performance as \"compelling,\" suggesting a positive, but potentially qualified, recommendation. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The original rating of 80 falls within the Positive bucket and aligns with the excerpt's clear praise for Jackson's 'compelling' performance. Confidence is low due to reliance on a single curated quote that may not represent the full review's balance.",
