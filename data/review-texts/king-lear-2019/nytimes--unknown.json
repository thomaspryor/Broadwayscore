But much of what surrounds her in this glittery, haphazard production seems to be working overtime to divert attention from that performance...By and large, the performances seem to have been blown into uneasy coexistence by random winds from different directions.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic praises Jackson's performance as 'powerful and deeply perceptive' but criticizes the production as 'haphazard' with performances in 'uneasy coexistence.' Single excerpt warning applies - this mixed assessment could be part of a more positive or negative overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review praises Ms. Jackson's performance but criticizes the overall production as 'glittery, haphazard' with performances in 'uneasy coexistence'. The mixed assessment of the production suggests a score in the Mixed range. | Gemini: The review praises Ms. Jackson's performance but criticizes the surrounding production as \"haphazard\" and the other performances as being in \"uneasy coexistence.\" This suggests a mixed experience, leaning slightly positive due to the praise for the lead performance. | Kimi: While the critic offers high praise for Glenda Jackson's lead performance, the review describes the production as haphazard and the supporting elements as actively undermining her work, with the overall assessment focused on the production's failure to cohere.",
