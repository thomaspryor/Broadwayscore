  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It gives me no joy to report that Jackson and the production are both superficial, incoherent and emotionally dead. Worst of all, the whole affair’s boring...The actors are a transatlantic hodge-podge...The music is nice but inconsequential...at key moments distracting, and the presence of musicians onstage is awkward at best...Gold’s aloof, anemic direction leeches momentum and passion from each scene...This is the most hateful and unredeemed Lear I’ve ever seen.”\n\nRead more",
