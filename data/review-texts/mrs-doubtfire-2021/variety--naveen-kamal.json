  "bwwExcerpt": "The Kirkpatricks' score seems bent on making up for its lack of distinct point of view with at least some measure of variety - a bit of rock 'n' roll (benign), a couple of beatboxing puppets (impressive) and a lot of genre non-specific songs in the style of contemporary musical theater (inoffensive). If the score has a unifying principle, it's duly resisting catchiness or memorability.",
