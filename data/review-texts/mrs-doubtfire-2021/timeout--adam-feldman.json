This pleasant and forgettable show at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre is the epitome of what Sondheim (citing his friend Mary Rodgers) called a \"Why\" musical: \"a perfectly respectable show, based on a perfectly respectable source, that has no reason for being.\" Mrs. Doubtfire hopes to draw on audiences' residual affection for the 1993 Ro",

The text describes the show as competent but lacking in theatrical magic, indicating a neutral stance. | Gemini: The review states it delivers what you'd expect, no more, no less, indicating a mixed reaction. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the mixed bucket. | Kimi: The review describes the show as competent and meeting expectations but lacking theatrical magic or distinction, indicating a middling reception consistent with the 60/100 rating.",
