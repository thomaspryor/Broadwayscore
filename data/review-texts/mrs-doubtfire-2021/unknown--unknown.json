  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"But the director Jerry Zaks’s ambivalent production tries to have it both ways: The story of a playful man-child with whom we empathize but whose good intentions can’t excuse his machinations. The film pulled it off at the time, primarily thanks to Williams’s charms. McClure’s Daniel, though, is more irritating than entertaining, and his antics — which include hacking into his wife’s email account to sabotage her nanny search — are more creepy than kooky.\"\n\nRead more",

However, this is only one excerpt, so confidence is low as the full verdict may be different. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the lead performance and describes the character's actions negatively. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the lead performance as irritating and the character's actions as creepy, suggesting a negative overall assessment. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic finds the lead performance irritating rather than charming and the production's tone creepy rather than funny, indicating it fails to capture the appeal of the source material.",
