  "bwwExcerpt": "New York gangsters sing and dance successfully in \"Guys and Dolls,\" and uptown street punks do the same in \"West Side Story.\" \"A Bronx Tale\" recalls both if only to illuminate its comparative limitations. Palminteri's semi-autobiographical story at the heart of this show remains compelling, but \"A Bronx Tale\" is ultimately much better (and more inexpensively experienced) as a movie.",
