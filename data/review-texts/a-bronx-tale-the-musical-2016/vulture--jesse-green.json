Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds like a mixed-to-negative verdict being cut off mid-sentence. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges reasonable performances but criticizes the musical for lacking subtlety and not seriously raising its thematic questions.

The excerpt ends abruptly, but the overall tone leans towards mixed, with positive aspects offset by shortcomings. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the production values and performances ('handsome', 'reasonably well performed') but delivers significant criticism regarding the show's lack of subtlety in dramatizing its themes, ending on a truncated negative clause ('very nearly a...').",
