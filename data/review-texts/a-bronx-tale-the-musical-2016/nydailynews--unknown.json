  "bwwExcerpt": "The main takeaway of the new Broadway musical \"A Bronx Tale\" is that talent is a terrible thing to waste. The show's makers and shapers, including Chazz Palminteri, who adapted his 1989 play, and Robert De Niro, who starred in and helmed the '93 film version and now shares directing credit with theater veteran Jerry Zaks, haven't squandered their gifts.",
