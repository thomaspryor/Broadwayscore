    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt acknowledges compelling source material but explicitly states the show has 'comparative limitations' versus established classics. The truncated nature and single excerpt warning require low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the show has limitations compared to classics like 'Guys and Dolls' and 'West Side Story', but acknowledges the compelling nature of the story. The single excerpt and lack of full context lead to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt notes the show's \"comparative limitations\" despite a compelling story, suggesting a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and truncated nature lower confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges the source material remains compelling but emphasizes the show's 'comparative limitations' against classics like Guys and Dolls and West Side Story. The text cuts off after 'but,' leaving the final verdict ambiguous, and a single excerpt may not represent the full review.",
