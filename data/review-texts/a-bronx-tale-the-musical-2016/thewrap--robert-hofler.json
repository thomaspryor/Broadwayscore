  "bwwExcerpt": "Cordero is good and sleazy enough so that we never miss the original too much. He lacks Palminteri's heavy elegance, but his is an understated performance that gives the musical a solid foundation. Also very fine is the delectable Ariana Debose, who plays the love interest, and a gifted child actor named Hudson Loverro. The huge obstacle to overcome in putting \"A Bronx Tale\" on stage is finding the right kid for the early scenes. Problem solved: Loverro brings real street edge to the young Calog",

  "fullText": "The less Chazz Palminteri appears in “A Bronx Tale” the softer his show grows. What began as a tough one-man play written and performed by Palminteri, in 1990, soon spawned a film in which the actor essayed just one role: Sonny, a street-corner mobster who wrestles for the soul of a young boy against the best wishes and deep fears of his bus-driver father.",

Overall positive assessment of cast and production. | Gemini: The review praises Cordero's performance and highlights other strong performances, indicating a positive experience despite some reservations about missing the original. | Kimi: While the critic notes the musical is softer than Palminteri's original one-man play, the review praises the principal cast (Cordero, DeBose, and Loverro) as solid, understated, and gifted, suggesting the performances provide a worthy foundation despite the show's diluted toughness.",
