    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic's own 60 rating places this squarely in Mixed territory (55-69). 'Pleasant but unexceptional' indicates neither recommendation nor discouragement - exactly what Mixed represents. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a Mixed review. The text describes the show as 'pleasant but unexceptional,' indicating a lukewarm recommendation. | Gemini: The review states that the show has heart but is otherwise unexceptional, indicating a mixed reaction. The critic's rating of 60 aligns with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show has 'heart' but ultimately deems it 'unexceptional' and lacking substance, matching the provided 60/100 rating which falls squarely in the Mixed range.",
