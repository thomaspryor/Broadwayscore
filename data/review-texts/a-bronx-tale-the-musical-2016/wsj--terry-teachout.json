  "bwwExcerpt": "Everything unfolds with predictably smooth Times Square professionalism, and I can imagine the results appealing to fans of \"Jersey Boys\" (including the dances, which were choreographed by Sergio Trujillo, who worked on that show as well). But for all its slickness, \"A Bronx Tale\" is nothing more than a weightless comic-book adaptation of the movie on which it's based, stripped of the understated yet ever-present sense of threat that gave the film so much of its dramatic force. Here, by contrast",

That’s why I had low hopes for “A Bronx Tale,” the new stage version of the 1993 coming-of-age movie directed by Robert De Niro, who has also co-directed the musical in collaboration with Jerry Zaks. It’s a fine little film, by turns sweetly poignant and tough-minded—so fine, in fact, that it’s hard to see how it could be improved by adding songs and dances. And that’s what’s wrong with the musical: It takes everything that was good about “A Bronx Tale” and waters it down until it’s as tasteless as a fast-food milkshake.\n\nResume Subscription\n We are delighted that you'd like to resume your subscription.\n\nYou will be charged\n $ + tax\n (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.\n You may change your billing preferences at any time in the Customer Center or call\n Customer Service.\n You will be notified in advance of any changes in rate or terms.\n You may cancel your subscription at anytime by calling\n Customer Service.\n\nPlease click confirm to resume now.\n\nArticle viewed iconAn icon to mark the viewed articles\nRead7 hours ago | Holman W.
