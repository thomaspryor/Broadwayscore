However, with only one truncated excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may be cut off. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed sentiment, highlighting a theme of wasted talent, which implies some level of disappointment. However, without more context, it's unclear if the review leans more positive or negative, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the show isn't utilizing its talent effectively, implying a mixed or slightly negative assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic implies that the production wastes the abilities of its high-profile creators and cast (Palminteri and De Niro), indicating a disappointing outcome despite strong ingredients. Score is mid-range Negative due to single-excerpt truncation limiting full context. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
