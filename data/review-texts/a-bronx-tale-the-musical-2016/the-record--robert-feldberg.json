  "bwwExcerpt": "\"A Bronx Tale,\" which opened on Thursday night at the Longacre Theatre, isn't a bad musical. It just doesn't seem a necessary one. The story, about a boy's coming of age in an Italian neighborhood in the Bronx in the 1960s, has had a long, chameleon-like existence. Created by actor Chazz Palminteri as a one-man show, he performed it off-Broadway in 1989. It was turned into a film, starring Palminteri, in 1993, and then, in 2007, Palminteri brought the semiautobiographical solo production to Broa",
