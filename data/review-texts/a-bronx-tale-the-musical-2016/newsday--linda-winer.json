However, with only one excerpt available, this could be setup rather than final verdict, requiring lower confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative sentiment, indicating that the show feels overly familiar and not in a positive manner. However, due to the single excerpt warning, there's low confidence in the overall verdict. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses a negative sentiment about the show being overdone and not in a positive way, suggesting a lack of originality or freshness. | Kimi: The single excerpt explicitly criticizes the show for feeling ritualized and overdone, stating this is 'not in a good way,' which indicates the critic does not recommend this production.",
