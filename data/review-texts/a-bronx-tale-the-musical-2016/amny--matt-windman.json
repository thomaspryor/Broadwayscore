Given the single excerpt limitation and truncation, scoring conservatively in Negative range with low confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show for being derivative and overly sentimental, suggesting a negative view. However, with only one excerpt available, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt describes the show as derivative, excessively sentimental, and solemn, indicating a negative assessment. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt lists substantial criticisms (derivative plot, excessively sentimental tone) but cuts off after 'But,' suggesting a potential pivot to positive qualities. Given the truncation warning and single-excerpt caution, scored in Mixed range to account for the unclear final verdict.",
