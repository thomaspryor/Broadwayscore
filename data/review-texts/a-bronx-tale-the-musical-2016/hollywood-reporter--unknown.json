    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt acknowledges familiarity concerns but concludes the musical is 'entertaining' with 'new freshness.' However, this is a single curated quote that appears truncated mid-sentence, limiting confidence in the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production for achieving 'new freshness' and being 'entertaining', indicating a positive reception. The mention of a 'tuneful score' by renowned composers further supports a positive assessment. However, due to the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses the word \"entertaining\" and praises the score, indicating a positive, though possibly qualified, recommendation. Confidence is low due to the limited text available. | Kimi: The critic praises the show as 'entertaining' with a 'tuneful score' and 'freshness,' indicating a solid recommendation that overcomes the familiar source material. However, given this is a single curated excerpt with truncated text, confidence is reduced.",
