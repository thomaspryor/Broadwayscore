  "bwwExcerpt": "A Bronx Tale is unlikely to work without a strong performance in the central role of the gangster Sonny. (Palminteri played all the roles in the one-man show; he was Sonny in the film version.) Fortunately, Nick Cordero carries the musical with aplomb. This is the actor who appeared out of nowhere in 2014 and practically nabbed a Tony in the Woody Allen-Susan Stroman Bullets on Broadway, as the bodyguard Cheech. (Not incidentally, this role was created in Allen's 1994 film version by: Chazz Palm",

With only one curated quote available, this represents limited evidence of the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Nick Cordero's performance as crucial to the musical's success, suggesting a positive view. However, the single excerpt and lack of a full review text limit confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on a strong performance by Nick Cordero, suggesting a positive aspect of the show, but the limited text and lack of overall verdict lead to a lower confidence score. | Kimi: The excerpt strongly praises the central performance as carrying the show, implying a recommendation despite the caveat that the musical depends on this strength. Single excerpt limits confidence.",
