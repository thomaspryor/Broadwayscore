  "fullText": "We can only wait for such new revisionist plays as “Blanche DuBois Is the Drag Queen” and “Mama Rose Is the Real Feminist.”\n\nKimberly Belflower’s play “John Proctor Is the Villain” opened Monday at the Booth Theatre after recent productions in D.C. and Boston. Belflower teaches playwrighting at Atlanta’s Emory College, and before the pandemic, her play had been workshopped at a few colleges.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "“John Proctor” is written in short snippets of scenes, often the crutch of a novice playwright. Danya Taymor’s direction looks to punch up all these scene changes with flashy interludes that offer blinding shots of lightning (by Natasha Katz), ominous “Carmina Burana”-esque music (by Palmer Hefferan) and a black-lit classroom set (by Amp and Teresa L. Williams) that jiggles. It’s all about as subtle as Taymor’s direction of her cast, Ebert excluded.",

However, the review lacks a clear overall verdict, leading to medium confidence. | Gemini: The review criticizes the playwrighting as novice and the direction as unsubtle, indicating a negative overall assessment despite mentioning one positive performance. | Kimi: The critic dismisses the play's structure as the work of a novice and criticizes the direction as unsubtle and overly flashy, indicating a clear negative assessment despite the truncated text.",
