The language suggests a highly positive view, but the lack of full context requires a cautious approach. | Gemini: The quote suggests a positive view of the play, highlighting its impact and relatable characters. However, due to the limited text, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the play's emotional impact and contemporary relevance, describing it as hitting hard and featuring necessary heroes, though the limited excerpt prevents higher confidence.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Along with a dexterity for shaping character out of the casual contours of contemporary speech, Belflower also has a keen sense of balance: She hangs just enough of her play on The Crucible but not too much. This isn’t a riff or a rewrite. Miller’s text functions as a kind of flint — a surface on which Belflower’s characters, especially Shelby, can create sparks, but the fire that grows belongs to them. They are the living, wrestling souls, contending with more than any teenager should have to and just as much as many do.",
