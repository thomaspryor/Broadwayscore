    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('truly a most engaging', 'terrific ensemble', 'thoroughly engrossing') suggests clear recommendation. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise for the play, highlighting its engaging nature and the effectiveness of the ensemble cast. Despite the limitations of a single excerpt, the positive language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt is very positive, praising the play and the cast. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence due to the limited information. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('truly a most engaging', 'terrific', 'thoroughly engrossing') indicating a clear recommendation in the upper Positive range. Confidence is low due to the single-excerpt format, which may not represent the full review.",
