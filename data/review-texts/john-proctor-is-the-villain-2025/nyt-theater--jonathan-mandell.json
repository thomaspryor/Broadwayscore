    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show as 'entertainment' and educational value, suggesting mild recommendation, but extremely limited text makes assessment uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive view, highlighting educational value, but lacks strong enthusiasm. Given the single excerpt and text quality warning, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The single excerpt suggests a positive, educational experience, but the lack of full text warrants a lower confidence and score within the positive range. | Kimi: Single curated excerpt indicates mild approval by describing the show as entertaining and educational, placing it at the lower end of the Positive range per scoring guidelines for limited excerpts.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Central to the appeal of the production are the five actors who portray the female students. Their frank conversations about sex and celebrities, their shifting enmities and alliances, are funny but also feel spot-on. Their extended moments of laughing and crying and dancing together, even shrieking together, are infectious.",
