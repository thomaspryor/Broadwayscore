Algebra and chemistry really can’t compete with the complexities of friendships, the multi-layered interactions –good and bad – with adults, and the first stirrings of lust and love that provide the most valuable lessons. This message– and more – comes through loudly in Kimberly Belflower’s complex comedy, “John Proctor is the Villain,” making its Broadway bow now at the Booth Theatre under the assured direction of recent Tony Award winner Danya Taymor.\n\nHaving received award-winning regional productions in 2002 (in Washington D.C) and 2024 (in Boston), this crowd-pleasing and thought-provoking play -- set in 2018 in a high school in a teeny tiny town in Georgia -- has finally arrived in New York due in part to the participation of “Stranger Things” star Saide Sink, who impresses as school “bad girl” Shelby Holbrook. (Technically, this is not her Broadway debut as she appeared both in the revival of “Annie” and “The Audience.”)\n\nIntriguingly, Shelby is absent – although talked about – for the play’s first 20 minutes or so, as her character has mysteriously left town and gone to live with her family in Atlanta. As we learn, she did not explain her sudden departure to anyone, most especially beloved literature theater Carter Smith (a superb Gabriel Ebert), who happens to be teaching his class his favorite play, Arthur Miller “The Crucible,” about the Salem witch trials. (Helpful hint, this is no accident on Bellflower’s part, so read that play – or its Cliff Notes – first if you can in order to get the play’s full effect.)\n\nNo one appears to be in the know, especially her ex-best friend Raelynn (an excellent Amila Yoo), but her classmates suspect it may have to do with Shelby’s brief affair with Raelynn’s now-apologetic boyfriend Lee (a fine Hagan Oliveras in teenage jerk mode). Nor is any explanation given by school counselor Betsey Gallagher (a lovely Molly Griggs) or Shelby’s classmates, busybody Beth (a brilliantly hilarious Fina Strazza), the nerdy Mason (Nihar Duvvuri), sweet-natured Ivy (Maggie Kuntz) and new girl in town Nell (an excellent Morgan Scott).\n\nHowever, new theories soon emerge when Ivy’s dentist father -- a man the other girls say was both nice and a little too handsy -- is caught up in a me-too scandal involving his former secretary. Was Shelby involved with him? Did she get pregnant? Or is this just a modern-day witch hunt?\n\nThe full answer arrives when Shelby suddenly reappears, superbly embodied by a volatile yet vulnerable Sink. Shelby is a bit of a human hurricane, prone to outbursts and occasionally outrageous behavior, but clearly nursing unseen wounds and possessing extraordinary intelligence. And yes, Shelby finally confesses the reason she left – and the person behind it – which Bellflower presents a shocking surprise.\n\nTaymor does an excellent job in creating the atmosphere of a high school class, with its cliques, misunderstandings and defiance of the rules. (The show’s final scene, part of a class project for “The Crucible,” is especially impressive.) She also balances the show’s comic and dramatic elements with expertise. Finally, Belflower also deserves kudos for giving true multidimensionality to all her characters, especially the two adults.\n\nJust as people may not be who they originally seem, “John Proctor is the Villain” reveals more layers throughout its 100-minute running time as it hurtles to its conclusion. Even if some parts of the play fail to achieve its desired effect, there’s definitely an A for effort on everyone’s part.\n By Brian Scott Lipton\n\nVisit the Sitehttps://johnproctoristhevillain.com/Open/Close DatesOpening 4/14/2025Closing 9/7/2025\nTheatre Info\nBooth Theatre222 West 45th StreetNew York, NY 10036 Map\n\nCititour.com is your guide to interesting places throughout New York City.
