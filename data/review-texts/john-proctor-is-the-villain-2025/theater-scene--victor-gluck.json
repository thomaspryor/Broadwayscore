    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt uses clearly negative language ('contrived and manipulative') to criticize the show's handling of its themes. However, this is only one excerpt and may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is strongly negative, describing the show as 'contrived and manipulative.' However, the single excerpt warning suggests this may not represent the entire review, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as \"contrived and manipulative,\" which indicates a negative assessment. Given it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strongly negative language ('contrived and manipulative') to criticize the show's construction and thematic overload, indicating a recommendation against seeing it, though the single-excerpt limitation warrants cautious confidence.",
