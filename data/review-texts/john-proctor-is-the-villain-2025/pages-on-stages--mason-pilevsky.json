    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt describes show as 'engaging' which is positive language, but extremely limited text (only 8 words plus 'Read more') makes full assessment impossible. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive impression with the word 'engaging,' but the lack of a full review or additional context limits confidence in the overall sentiment. The single quote indicates a mildly positive view. | Gemini: The phrase \"engaging struggle\" suggests a positive experience, but the lack of context and the truncated nature of the text lowers confidence. I am scoring it as positive but with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt employs the positive evaluative term 'engaging,' indicating a favorable view, but the extreme brevity and truncation warrant a conservative score at the lower end of the Positive bucket.",
