Single excerpt limits confidence but tone is clearly enthusiastic. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language ('cannot overpraise', 'snappy production', 'shivers down your spine'), indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. However, confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The critic uses very strong positive language, such as \"cannot overpraise,\" \"moves like a bullet train,\" and \"sends shivers down your spine and tears down your cheeks,\" indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt features superlative praise ('cannot overpraise') and describes a visceral emotional impact, indicating strong enthusiasm. As a single curated excerpt, confidence is reduced per scoring guidelines.",
