  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "Combined, John Proctor Is the Villain not only serves as a modern day recontextualization of the original play, but also a laugh-out-loud funny and deeply affecting examination of girlhood, feminism, the #MeToo movement, and the unstoppable power of female friendship. It is pure, heartbreaking perfection.",

This is clear rave territory. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise with phrases like 'laugh-out-loud funny', 'deeply affecting', and 'pure, heartbreaking perfection', indicating a highly enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"laugh-out-loud funny,\" \"deeply affecting,\" and \"pure, heartbreaking perfection,\" indicating a rave review. | Kimi: While the excerpt offers superlative praise ('perfection'), the single-quote warning requires conservative scoring at the upper end of the Positive range given the risk of cherry-picking.",
