    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic uses strong positive language ('engage and electrify') and recommends it for both young and adult audiences. However, confidence is low due to having only a single excerpt that may not represent the full review verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a strong positive reaction, emphasizing the show's ability to engage and electrify audiences. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive reception, particularly highlighting the show's ability to engage and electrify audiences. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt uses strong positive evaluative language ('electrify') to recommend the show for its audience impact, though the single-quote limitation reduces confidence in the overall verdict.",
