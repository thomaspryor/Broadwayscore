However, the confidence is low due to the lack of full review text. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses superlatives like \"best play of the season\" and \"feminist masterpiece,\" indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives ('best play of the season', 'masterpiece', 'defining works of art') indicating the highest level of enthusiasm and recommendation, placing it at the top of the Rave bucket despite limited text availability.",
