The recommendation to 'remember her name' implies a standout success. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language indicates a rave review. | Gemini: The review excerpt is highly positive, calling the play a \"galvanizing accomplishment\" and recommending that the reader remember the playwright's name. This indicates a strong recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('galvanizing accomplishment') and encouragement to discover this new playwright's work, indicating a solid recommendation despite limited context.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "John Proctor Is the Villain has had multiple regional productions since its 2022 premiere, but it's hard to imagine a better mounting than its fast-paced and riveting Broadway incarnation, directed with clear-eyed compassion by Danya Taymor (who also directed The Outsiders, and knows her way around adolescent rebellion). Belflower has a supernatural gift for teenage vernacular and pop-culture touchstones, and the pitch-perfect cast makes you believe in these promising young women as they navigate puberty and the pitfalls of the patriarchy.",
