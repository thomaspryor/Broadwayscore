  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "There's a moment in the play featuring a song by Lorde that elicited in me a dizzy gasp, then an eye-roll, then gave way to a moment of catharsis. In one gesture, it brilliantly tied up the play's themes, aesthetics and narratives in a genuinely thrilling way, while getting me to consider a long-beloved favorite in a new light. John Proctor Is the Villain is much like that: a heady rush of glee, shock and understanding that takes you by surprise, and leaves you happy you came.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong positive language ('thrilling', 'heady rush of glee', 'leaves you happy you came') with enthusiastic tone, but single excerpt warning requires caution about overall verdict scope. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as a 'heady rush' and 'genuinely thrilling,' leaving the critic 'happy you came,' indicating a strong, positive reaction. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a rave review. | Gemini: The review describes a moment of catharsis and calls the play a \"heady rush of glee, shock and understanding\" that leaves the reviewer \"happy you came,\" indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt describes the show as 'brilliant' and 'genuinely thrilling' with a 'heady rush of glee' that leaves audiences satisfied, indicating a strong positive recommendation, though confidence is reduced due to the availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
