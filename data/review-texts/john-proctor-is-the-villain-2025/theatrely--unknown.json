  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "There's a moment in the play featuring a song by Lorde that elicited in me a dizzy gasp, then an eye-roll, then gave way to a moment of catharsis. In one gesture, it brilliantly tied up the play's themes, aesthetics and narratives in a genuinely thrilling way, while getting me to consider a long-beloved favorite in a new light. John Proctor Is the Villain is much like that: a heady rush of glee, shock and understanding that takes you by surprise, and leaves you happy you came.",

Single excerpt warning applies - using upper end of Positive range due to enthusiastic tone. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the play as a 'heady rush of glee, shock and understanding,' and concludes with 'leaves you happy you came,' indicating a strong, enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, describing the play as a \"heady rush of glee, shock and understanding\" and stating that it \"leaves you happy you came.\" | Kimi: The excerpt uses enthusiastically positive language ('brilliantly', 'genuinely thrilling', 'happy you came') indicating a strong recommendation, though the single-excerpt format warrants caution about the full review's tone.",
