Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed at the upper end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt describes a scene as \"deeply satisfying\", indicating a positive experience. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is placed on the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for a specific scene as among the season's most satisfying, indicating strong approval, though limited context prevents Rave classification or higher confidence.",
