  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "There's a moment in the play featuring a song by Lorde that elicited in me a dizzy gasp, then an eye-roll, then gave way to a moment of catharsis. In one gesture, it brilliantly tied up the play's themes, aesthetics and narratives in a genuinely thrilling way, while getting me to consider a long-beloved favorite in a new light. John Proctor Is the Villain is much like that: a heady rush of glee, shock and understanding that takes you by surprise, and leaves you happy you came."
