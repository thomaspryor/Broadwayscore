  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"It’s an admirable but disconcertingly disjointed effort...The score is a mixed bag. It captures the driving tempos of the era’s big band music, well realized in a plenitude of strong orchestrations. What’s missing are the beguiling melodies and the deceptive simplicity of lyrics that transformed so many of the songs from that era into standards...Despite the uneven material, the cast scores its points...For Blankenbuehler, the show is a further validation of his skills.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review acknowledges admirable qualities (strong orchestrations, cast performances, director's skills) but finds significant flaws (disjointed, score is mixed bag, missing key elements). The language suggests neither recommendation nor discouragement. Single excerpt warning noted - this could represent a larger mixed or even positive review. | GPT-4o: The review describes the show as 'admirable but disconcertingly disjointed' and notes a 'mixed bag' score. While the cast is praised, the overall tone suggests a mixed reception. The single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review uses mixed language, praising some aspects (orchestrations, cast, Blankenbuehler's skills) while criticizing others (disjointed effort, uneven score, missing melodies). This suggests a mixed recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt contains explicit mixed signals: 'mixed bag' score, 'disjointed' structure, and 'uneven material' are balanced against praise for orchestrations, cast performances, and direction. Without the full review context, this appears to be a middle-of-the-road assessment.",
