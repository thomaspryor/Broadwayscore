    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows consistent praise for lead performance, choreography, and music with specific superlatives like 'astonishingly effective' and 'ingeniously visualized'. However, confidence is low due to limited text and potential cherry-picking of positive quotes. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the emotional impact and choreography, with positive mentions of the music and performances. The tone is clearly positive, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses positive language such as \"affecting,\" \"generously allows,\" \"astonishingly effective,\" and \"toe-tappingly swing-inflected music.\" Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I'm scoring it at the higher end of the positive range, but with low confidence. | Kimi: Despite noting the show is 'sentimental,' the excerpt offers strong praise for the lead performance, direction ('ingeniously,' 'astonishingly effective'), and music, indicating a clear recommendation.",
