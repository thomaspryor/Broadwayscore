    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt expresses clear appreciation for the show's emotional authenticity and healing themes. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed overall review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt conveys a strong positive sentiment with phrases like 'genuine affection' and 'heart beats,' indicating an enthusiastic recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a positive sentiment, praising the show's heart and affection. However, as it is a single excerpt, the confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt expresses genuine warmth and appreciation for the show's emotional core and thematic execution. 'Genuine affection' and the healing framing suggest sincere recommendation. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence must remain low—this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. Score reflects solid positive sentiment while acknowledging uncertainty about full verdict.",
