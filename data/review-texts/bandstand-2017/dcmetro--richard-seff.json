However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'refreshing and imaginative' with 'youthful invention' and highlights a 'true star turn' by the lead. Despite the limited text, the tone is clearly positive, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language like \"most refreshing and imaginative\" and \"true star turn,\" indicating a strong recommendation. The concluding sentence further reinforces this positive assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise ('most refreshing,' 'true star turn,' 'youthful invention everywhere'), indicating a clear recommendation. However, confidence is reduced to 'low' per instructions regarding single curated excerpts that may not represent the full review.",
