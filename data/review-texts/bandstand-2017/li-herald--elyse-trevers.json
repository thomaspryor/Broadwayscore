What started out so promising in 'Bandstand' gets clichéd in the end.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Review praises individual elements (musicians, choreography, creative staging) but criticizes pacing and finds the overall result clichéd and disappointing. The arc from 'promising premise' to 'clichéd in the end' suggests mixed-to-negative assessment. | GPT-4o: The review praises the musicians and choreography but criticizes the show for becoming clichéd and overly long. The single excerpt suggests a mixed impression, with both positive and negative elements. | Gemini: The review starts with praise for the premise and musicians, but then states the show goes on too long and becomes clichéd. Due to the limited excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the musicians, swing dancing, and creative staging but criticizes the show's excessive length and disappointing, clichéd conclusion. With only one curated excerpt available that ends on a negative note, the overall recommendation is ambiguous but leans mixed.",
