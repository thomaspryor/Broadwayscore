  "showScoreExcerpt": "“I think it’s certainly the best musical of the season, and Richard Oberacker and Robert Taylor’s score definitely one of my favorites…What could have so easily been nostalgic hooey is deeply humane, always engaging and even moving. With ‘Bandstand,’ Blankenbuehler joins the ranks of the truly great director-choreographers…Both Cott and Laura Osnes tend to get cast as stereotypical ingenues, but here they give riveting performances as full, conflicted human beings.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Calls it 'best musical of the season' with superlative praise for score, direction, and performances. However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides strong praise, calling it the best musical of the season and highlighting the score as a favorite. The language suggests a highly positive verdict, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review excerpt contains strong positive language, calling it the 'best musical of the season' and praising the score, direction, and performances. The overall tone is enthusiastic. | Kimi: Single curated excerpt contains enthusiastic superlatives including 'best musical of the season' and praise for the 'truly great' direction and 'riveting' performances, warranting upper Positive range despite limited context. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
