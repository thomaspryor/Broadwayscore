The overall tone suggests a mixed experience with notable strengths and weaknesses. | Gemini: The review highlights both positive aspects (spectacular dancing, serviceable score, moments of freshness) and negative aspects (narrative flow issues, lack of depth). The overall assessment is mixed. | Kimi: The critic explicitly balances criticisms (narrative flow issues, 'serviceable' score, lack of depth) against praises (spectacular dancing, visual pleasures), resulting in a verdict that acknowledges both strengths and weaknesses without clear recommendation.",
