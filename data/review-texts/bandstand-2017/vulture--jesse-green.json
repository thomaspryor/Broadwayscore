  "bwwExcerpt": "Bandstand, on the other hand, has the courage of its convictions. It is really about what it's really about, which broadly speaking is the damage war does to combatants and the further damage sometimes done by peace. Yes, it's the first PTSD musical. I'm not saying it's perfectly carried out, or even especially profound, but as directed and choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler, who created the musical staging for Hamilton, it remains almost compulsively faithful to its vision and never asks you to choose between what it's showing you and what you know to be true. Unlike too many musicals, it matches itself.",
