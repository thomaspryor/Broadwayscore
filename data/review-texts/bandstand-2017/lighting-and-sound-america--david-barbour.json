The tone is clearly positive, suggesting a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the staging, vocals, and performances, highlighting the show's ability to surprise despite formulaic moments. The concluding statement about the show's central point being steadfast further supports a positive assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the staging ('tightly coiled,' 'jittery with energy'), performances ('galvanic vocals'), and emotional impact, with only minor reservations about formulaic elements.",
