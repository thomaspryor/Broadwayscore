  "showScoreExcerpt": "“A sincere, upbeat, but overly sudsy and clichéd musical…They deserve a chutzpah Tony for creating a show in which the central characters are musicians who play, not the actual big band swing of 1945, when the show is set, but pastiches…While 'Bandstand' never overcomes the impediment of its ersatz tunes, exciting director-choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler keeps our eyes and ears glued to his inventive staging, jitterbugging, and boogie-woogieing.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic finds significant flaws (overly sudsy, clichéd, ersatz tunes that never overcome impediments) but praises the direction and staging. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show's sincerity and upbeat nature but criticizes it for being clichéd and having ersatz tunes. The praise for the director-choreographer's staging suggests some redeeming qualities, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review acknowledges flaws in the music but praises the staging and choreography, resulting in a mixed assessment. The truncated text lowers confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt contains significant criticism of the show's core material ('ersatz tunes,' 'sudsy and clichéd') balanced against praise for the staging and choreography. With only one excerpt available, the overall verdict appears mixed.",
