    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Rave | Claude: Despite being a single excerpt, the language is unambiguously rapturous with multiple superlatives: 'unqualified triumph', 'masterpiece', 'beautifully written', 'superbly directed', 'immaculately performed'. The critic explicitly states it 'succeeds on all' levels. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses superlatives and unqualified praise, calling it a 'masterpiece' and 'an unqualified triumph in every way'. The tone is enthusiastic and strongly recommends the show. | Gemini: The review uses extremely positive language such as \"unqualified triumph\", \"masterpiece\", and \"first rate in every respect\", indicating a rave review. | Kimi: The excerpt employs the strongest possible superlatives including 'masterpiece' and 'unqualified triumph' with comprehensive praise for all production elements, though the single-excerpt format necessitates low confidence.",
