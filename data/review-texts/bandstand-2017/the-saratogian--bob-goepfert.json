  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"An impressive work as it takes what might sound like a cliché and turns it into a meaningful work that is fun without being frothy, and serious without being somber...The entire cast is terrific as each band member is able to etch a character who rises above stereotype...Director-choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler keeps the dances vibrant and exciting. More importantly, he tells an emotionally complex story with clarity. 'Bandstand' is a delight that is compassionate, entertaining and truthful.\"\n\nRead more",
