  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"An impressive work as it takes what might sound like a cliché and turns it into a meaningful work that is fun without being frothy, and serious without being somber...The entire cast is terrific as each band member is able to etch a character who rises above stereotype...Director-choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler keeps the dances vibrant and exciting. More importantly, he tells an emotionally complex story with clarity. 'Bandstand' is a delight that is compassionate, entertaining and truthful.\"\n\nRead more",

The critic appreciates both artistic merit and entertainment value, calling it meaningful without being heavy-handed. Single excerpt warning acknowledged but tone is clearly positive. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show as 'impressive', 'fun', 'serious', and 'a delight', with strong commendations for the cast and direction. The positive language and lack of reservations suggest a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review uses strong positive language such as \"impressive work,\" \"meaningful work,\" \"fun without being frothy,\" \"terrific cast,\" and \"vibrant and exciting.\" The overall tone is enthusiastic, indicating a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unambiguous praise throughout: 'impressive work,' 'terrific' cast, 'vibrant and exciting' dances, and a direct verdict calling it 'a delight.' However, confidence is low due to single-excerpt warning and lack of full context.",
