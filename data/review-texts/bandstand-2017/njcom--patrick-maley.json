However, confidence is low due to truncated text and single excerpt warning. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the direction and choreography as a key highlight, indicating a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning suggests the possibility of cherry-picking, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the direction and choreography, calling the story \"wonderful.\" Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the positive bucket with high end score. | Kimi: The excerpt clearly praises the show's 'wonderful' story and 'dazzling' choreography, recommending it on the strength of Blankenbuehler's seamless direction, though the single-excerpt format limits confidence.",
