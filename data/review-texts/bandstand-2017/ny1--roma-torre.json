  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Taylor and Oberacker did a fine job turning the story into a deeply engaging and moving work. With high intensity and just the right touch of humor, they deal sensitively with the emotional issues plaguing each of the characters, while director/choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler put it into exhilarating motion…The music is appealingly catchy...With nary a false note in this production, 'Bandstand' creates sweet harmony from the dissonance of war.\"\n\nRead more",
