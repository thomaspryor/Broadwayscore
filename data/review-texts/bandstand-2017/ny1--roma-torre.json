The excerpt shows consistent enthusiasm despite being a single curated quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the production as 'deeply engaging and moving' with 'exhilarating motion' and 'appealingly catchy' music, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, the single excerpt warning indicates potential cherry-picking, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review uses very positive language such as \"deeply engaging and moving work\", \"high intensity\", \"exhilarating motion\", and \"appealingly catchy\". The phrase \"with nary a false note\" indicates a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the writing, direction, and music, describing the show as 'deeply engaging,' 'moving,' and 'exhilarating' with 'nary a false note.' While clearly positive, the single curated excerpt warrants reduced confidence regarding the full review's verdict.",
