  "bwwExcerpt": "The resonant original musical Bandstand dances a delicate line between nostalgia and disillusion. What it seems to promise, and often delivers, is Broadway escapism: a tale of soldiers returning from World War II into a lively world of big-band music, boogie-woogie dancing and a booming American economy. Donny (the very engaging Corey Cott) assembles a music combo composed entirely of fellow veterans, hoping to win a competition in New York and earn a shot at Hollywood. Sounds like a happy old movie, right? But these soldiers, we soon learn, have trouble getting into the swing of things. Try though they may-through work, repression, copious drinking-they can't shake off the horror of war.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt shows measured praise - 'often delivers' suggests qualified success, and calling Cott 'very engaging' is positive. However, this is a single curated excerpt that may not reflect the full verdict, requiring caution in scoring. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the musical as delivering 'Broadway escapism' while acknowledging the underlying themes of nostalgia and disillusion. The tone suggests a positive view with some complexity, but without the full review, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review highlights both the escapism and the underlying struggles of the characters, suggesting a positive experience with some reservations. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt uses clearly positive evaluative language ('resonant', 'very engaging', 'delivers') praising both the production's emotional depth and performances, suggesting a firm recommendation despite the single-excerpt limitation.",
