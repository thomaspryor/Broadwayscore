  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Osnes and Cott are fine singers and good actors…One wishes them better luck next time. Muddy arrangements of music that lacks not only 1940s flavor but actual melody conflict with unoriginal lyrics which neither sync nor sing…The book is the best thing about this piece. It has grit, wit and sincerity. While Blankenbuehler works well with his actors, overall action is often a mess…In different hands, this might’ve been a genial, vivacious show with a future in national touring.”\n\nRead more",
