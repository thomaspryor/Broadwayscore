    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The review acknowledges positive elements (heart in right place, admirable craftsmanship) but identifies a fundamental flaw in emotional connection. The 'but' signals the key limitation that prevents recommendation. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges positive aspects such as the show's heart and craftsmanship but ultimately finds it lacking in emotional impact. The single excerpt suggests a mixed verdict, and the lack of full context lowers confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects like heart and craftsmanship, but ultimately finds the show lacking a crucial emotional connection, resulting in a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt acknowledges the show's good intentions and technical craftsmanship but criticizes its failure to achieve the emotional resonance necessary for its subject matter, resulting in a neither-here-nor-there assessment.",
