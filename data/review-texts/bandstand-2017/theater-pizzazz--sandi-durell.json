    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises the talented cast, lead performance, and production values with terms like 'crackerjack' and 'ace dancers.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast and music, suggesting a positive experience for fans of the genre. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context lower confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests a positive experience, especially for fans of the era, with praise for the cast and music. However, the mention of a \"deeper and darker side\" suggests some reservations, placing it in the positive range but not a rave. | Kimi: The excerpt is clearly positive with praise for cast, dancing, and lead performance, though the 'Read more' truncation and single-excerpt warning limit confidence. The 'good match' language suggests targeted rather than universal enthusiasm, placing this in the upper Positive range but not a full Rave.",
