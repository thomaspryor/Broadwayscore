  "bwwExcerpt": "The title 'Bandstand' is a curveball. So is the subtitle, 'The New American Musical.' For audiences of a certain age, the name of the season's final musical suggests those dopey and adored teen dance shows that began on '50s TV. To audiences of a different certain age, the '40s look of the publicity photos implies a happy story of the bands that entertained the troops in World War II and moviegoers forevermore. Once inside the theater, however, we discover that we are meant to take the word apart and take it seriously. This is a musical - really, more of a musical drama - about a band of damaged war veterans who take a stand while competing in a national radio contest in 1945. The concept is more ambitious, darker and more sophisticated than its name invites theatergoers to enjoy. It is also more than a little shapeless and overly long.",
