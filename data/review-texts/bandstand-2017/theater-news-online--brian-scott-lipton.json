    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows positive elements (charismatic performances, tuneful score, great choreography) but acknowledges 'unfortunate missteps.' The 'far more cheers than jeers' phrasing suggests qualified recommendation. Low confidence due to single excerpt limitation. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong performances, a tuneful score, and dynamic choreography, indicating a positive reception. However, it acknowledges some issues with the book and execution. Given the single excerpt and the positive tone, a score in the upper range of Positive is appropriate. | Gemini: The review highlights strong performances, a tuneful score, and impressive choreography, but acknowledges \"unfortunate missteps,\" suggesting a positive but not rave review. | Kimi: Single excerpt with clear positive verdict ('far more cheers than jeers') and enthusiastic praise for performances, score, and choreography, though qualified by 'unfortunate missteps.' The 'despite' construction indicates a solid but not unreserved recommendation, placing this in mid-Positive range given single-excerpt uncertainty.",
