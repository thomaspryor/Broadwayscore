    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Rave/Positive) - using median score | Claude: Multiple superlatives ('exhilarating', 'immensely moving') with unqualified praise for writing, acting, and direction. However, confidence is medium due to single excerpt warning - this could be cherry-picked from a more mixed review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt uses strong positive language such as 'exhilarating', 'adventurous', and 'immensely moving', indicating a highly favorable view. The lack of full context suggests a low confidence, but the language supports a Rave classification. | Gemini: The excerpt is filled with positive adjectives and phrases, such as \"exhilarating,\" \"adventurous,\" \"immensely moving,\" and \"perfectly on pitch,\" indicating a strong recommendation. | Kimi: Single excerpt contains superlative praise ('exhilarating,' 'slam-bang,' 'ingeniously') indicating strong recommendation, though limited context requires caution. | Buckets: claude=Rave, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Positive",
