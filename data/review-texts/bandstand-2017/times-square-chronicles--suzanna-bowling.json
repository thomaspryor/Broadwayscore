Part of the problem with 'Bandstand' is that their stories are not fleshed out and we really do want to know them…Blankenbuehler’s direction is too dark and he chopped his choreography to shreds…I left the theatre wondering how a show that I was rooting for went so wrong.\"\n\nRead more",

The overall sentiment is negative, but the excerpt may not fully represent the review's tone, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review expresses disappointment and questions how the show went wrong, despite acknowledging the cast's talent. The overall tone suggests a negative experience. | Kimi: While the critic praises the cast as 'winning' and 'terrific,' the overall verdict is clearly negative, citing 'chopped' choreography, underdeveloped stories, and direction that is 'too dark,' concluding that the production 'went so wrong.'",
