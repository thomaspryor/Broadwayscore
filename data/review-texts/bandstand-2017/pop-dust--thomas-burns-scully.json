Despite flirting with cliche, the verdict is clearly positive. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but tone is enthusiastic enough for upper Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong praise for the music and overall impact, despite acknowledging some cliches. The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, highlighting the heartfelt story, energetic cast, and perfect music. Despite mentioning it flirts with cliche, the overall tone is enthusiastic, suggesting a strong positive recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the music ('nothing short of perfect'), cast energy, and emotional impact, acknowledging minor flaws but delivering a clear recommendation to see the show.",
