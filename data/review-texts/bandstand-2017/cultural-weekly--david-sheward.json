    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Final verdict is positive ('arresting arrangements') despite acknowledging cliches. Single excerpt warning requires caution - this sounds mildly positive so scored at lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the cliched plot but praises the depth of character exploration and clever use of music. The positive elements are highlighted, suggesting a recommendation despite some reservations. | Gemini: The review acknowledges cliches but praises the score and exploration of trauma, suggesting a qualified recommendation. The limited excerpt and 'read more' link reduce confidence. | Kimi: While the critic notes the plot follows a 'cliched track,' they praise the creative staging ('shattered hall-of-mirrors vision'), emotional depth, and clever use of period music, concluding that the show offers 'new and arresting arrangements' despite familiar material.",
