And 'Bandstand’ has the talent that delivers on his creativity.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The review acknowledges the show would be 'ho-hum' without the choreography but praises the cast as 'excellent' and Blankenbuehler's work as having 'undeniable distinction.' Single excerpt warning applies - this appears mildly positive but could misrepresent the full review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the choreography and cast, particularly Laura Osnes, but acknowledges weaknesses in the book. The positive elements are enough to recommend it, but reservations about the book suggest a lower score within the Positive range. | Gemini: The review praises the cast, especially Laura Osnes, and highlights the choreography as a saving grace. While acknowledging weak links in the book, the overall tone suggests a positive, albeit qualified, recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the cast as excellent and highlights choreography that elevates the material beyond 'ho-hum,' though it acknowledges the book has weak links. This indicates a solid positive recommendation focused on production strengths.",
