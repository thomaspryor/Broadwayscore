  "showScoreExcerpt": "“‘Bandstand’ explores the undeniable power that art has to change the world…It also benefits from first-rate direction and choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler…In terms of style, 'Bandstand' is refreshingly old-fashioned…Osnes performs her two big numbers with a blistering intensity that is thrilling to behold. While not all of the songs fit comfortably in Cott's range, his work is as alive as it gets. It's an exhilarating, star-making turn.\"\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for direction, choreography, and lead performances with words like 'exhilarating' and 'thrilling.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt limitation and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights strong praise for the direction, choreography, and performances, particularly noting the 'exhilarating' and 'star-making' turn. Despite the warning about a single excerpt, the language used suggests a strong positive recommendation. | Gemini: The excerpt contains strong positive language such as \"first-rate direction\", \"refreshingly old-fashioned\", \"blistering intensity\", and \"exhilarating, star-making turn\", indicating a positive review. Due to the truncated text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt contains enthusiastic praise ('first-rate direction', 'blistering intensity', 'thrilling', 'exhilarating') and a clear positive verdict. However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low that this represents the full review sentiment. The score reflects strong positive language while accounting for potential cherry-picking.",
