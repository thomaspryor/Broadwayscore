  "showScoreExcerpt": "“‘Bandstand’ raises the stakes on a storied cliché…Oberacker and Taylor bring an innocence and vitality to a story every boy and girl imagines, and which the show’s creators run with to the heights…What a pleasure it is to hear Oberacker’s compositions…Laura Osnes does a remarkable acting job…‘Bandstand’ is a laudable work steeped in classical American music and dance styles, with a nostalgic sense of storytelling that still requires attention.”\n\nRead more",
