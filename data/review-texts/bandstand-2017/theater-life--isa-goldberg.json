  "showScoreExcerpt": "“‘Bandstand’ raises the stakes on a storied cliché…Oberacker and Taylor bring an innocence and vitality to a story every boy and girl imagines, and which the show’s creators run with to the heights…What a pleasure it is to hear Oberacker’s compositions…Laura Osnes does a remarkable acting job…‘Bandstand’ is a laudable work steeped in classical American music and dance styles, with a nostalgic sense of storytelling that still requires attention.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Consistent praise throughout - 'raises the stakes,' 'pleasure to hear,' 'remarkable acting,' 'laudable work.' However, confidence is low due to single excerpt warning and potential cherry-picking. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the show's vitality, music, and performances, suggesting a strong positive impression. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt contains strong positive language like \"pleasure,\" \"remarkable,\" and \"laudable,\" suggesting a positive recommendation. Given that it's a single excerpt, I'm scoring it on the higher end of the positive range but with low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the compositions ('What a pleasure'), performances ('remarkable acting job'), and overall production ('laudable work'), indicating a strong recommendation despite the limitation of having only a single curated quote.",
