    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with consistent praise including 'thrilling', 'magnificent', 'expertly handled', and strong cast commendations. However, confidence is low due to cherry-picked nature of single curated quote. | GPT-4o: The excerpt is filled with superlatives and strong praise for the story, performances, and execution. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests an enthusiastic recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, using words like \"thrilling\", \"magnificent\", \"effervescent\", and \"expertly handled\". Given the single excerpt warning, I'm scoring at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The single excerpt contains strong praise for performances, book, and staging with words like 'magnificent' and 'thrilling,' indicating clear approval despite limited context.",
