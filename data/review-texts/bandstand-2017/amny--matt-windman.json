    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Rave) - using median score | Claude: Strong praise for score, script integration, and direction/choreography with words like 'stunning' and 'unusually powerful,' but confidence is medium due to excerpt-only format. | GPT-4o: The review excerpts use strong positive language, praising the score, integration of music, and direction/choreography. The tone suggests a highly positive verdict, but the lack of full text limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses strong positive language such as \"urgent testimonial\", \"healing and restorative power\", \"swinging original score\", and \"stunning job\", indicating a positive recommendation. Given the truncated nature, confidence is medium. | Kimi: The excerpt contains unqualified superlatives including 'unusually powerful musical theater,' 'stunning job,' and 'urgent testimonial,' indicating the highest level of enthusiasm despite the limited text available. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Rave, gemini=Positive, kimi=Rave",
