  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"The musical’s angry climax is quite effective. What precedes it is scarcely so thrilling. The script and score are competently crafted but greater musical variety and certainly a richer infusion of humor are needed...Andy Blankenbuehler, who directs and choreographs, gives the production plenty of kinetic energy, but there tends to be a sameness to his post-jitterbug dances...The 21-member company never fails to animate this obviously sincerely meant yet curiously flat musical.\"\n\nRead more",

  "wrongFullText": "Semi-fresh may be the best term to describe two new shows that are currently running in New Jersey. The first is a comedy that is rooted in an earlier work. The second is a new musical that embraces the dark side of a bygone era.\n\nConsiderable laughter can be found in Princeton, where the McCarter Theater Center is presenting Ken Ludwig’s “A Comedy of Tenors” in a premiere coproduction with the Cleveland Playhouse.\n\nWhether or not one is acquainted with Mr. Ludwig’s “Lend Me a Tenor,” this sequel to that popular hotel room farce packs a good deal of amusement.\n\nThe characters from the original who reappear here in a deluxe hotel suite in Paris in 1936 are Saunders (Ron Orbach), a cranky impresario from Cleveland; Max (Rob McClure), his trusty assistant who not so incidentally also sings; Tito (Bradley Dean), the temperamental Italian opera star; and Maria (Antoinette LaVecchia), Tito’s spitfire wife.\n\nSaunders is backing a sold-out concert headlined by Tito, Max and — after the tenor Jussi Bjorling unexpectedly cancels — Carlo (Bobby Conte Thornton), a rising luminary who is secretly romancing Tito’s daughter Mimi (Kristen Martin). The moody Tito’s jealousy over Carlo’s popularity and his mistaken belief that Maria and Carlo are enjoying an affair soon send him storming out.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access."
