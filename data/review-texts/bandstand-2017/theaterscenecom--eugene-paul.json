    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise with superlatives ('peak', 'never falters', 'head-shakingly amazing') and clear high recommendation. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but language is consistently enthusiastic throughout. | GPT-4o: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the production, highlighting the high level of artistry and performance. The language used is enthusiastic and suggests a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt contains very strong praise for all aspects of the show, including the choreography, direction, performers, and overall entertainment value. Given the single excerpt warning, I am scoring it at the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt contains effusive praise with superlatives like 'head-shakingly amazing' and 'stands very high,' but as a single curated quote it may be cherry-picked and not fully representative of the overall verdict.",
