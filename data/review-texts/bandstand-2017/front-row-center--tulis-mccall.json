  "showScoreExcerpt": "“What saves this from death by saccharine is the raw nerves of these veterans…It is their story that trails after you when you leave...It is too bad that the authors were not able to take a pair of clippers to the book, and the stunning lack of a resolution doesn’t help…Cott and Osnes positively crackle and the ensemble work is spectacular in every way. But the basics of ‘beginning, middle and end’ got left behind at the train depot. And all the big band music doesn’t quite make up for that.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Review praises performances ('positively crackle', 'spectacular') but criticizes fundamental story structure ('lack of resolution', 'beginning, middle and end got left behind'). Single excerpt warning applies - this balances strong praise with significant structural concerns. | GPT-4o: The review praises the performances and ensemble work but criticizes the book and lack of resolution. The mixed elements suggest a balanced view with significant reservations. | Gemini: The review praises the performances but criticizes the book and lack of resolution, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The critic praises the lead performances and emotional resonance but heavily criticizes the bloated book, lack of resolution, and structural incoherence, concluding that the music and acting cannot compensate for these narrative shortcomings.",
