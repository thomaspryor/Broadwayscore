  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Corey Cott (as Donny) is Broadway's newest superstar. Laura Osnes (Julia) is perfect in her leading role. We see brilliant performances from the quadrupally talented Joe Carroll on drums, Brandon James Ellis on bass, & James Nathan Hopkins on sax...The score is fun and catchy, led by two emotional show-stoppers ‘Love Will Come and Find Me Again’ and especially ‘Welcome Home.’ The latter has a haunting chorus while revealing the struggles our heroes face.”\n\nRead more",
