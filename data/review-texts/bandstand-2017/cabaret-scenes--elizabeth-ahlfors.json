    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Consistently positive language praising the score as 'fierce and athletic', performers as 'strong' and 'expressive', with an uplifting conclusion. Single excerpt warning requires caution, but tone is clearly positive throughout. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights positive elements such as the score, performances, and overall energy, indicating a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising the score, performers, and overall uplifting nature of the show. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I placed it at the higher end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for the score, performances, and overall production, describing it as 'life-affirming' and 'uplifted,' though the single-quote context limits confidence in the overall verdict.",
