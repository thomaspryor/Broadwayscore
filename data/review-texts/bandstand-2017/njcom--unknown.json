  "bwwExcerpt": "Wonderful story and performances notwithstanding, much of 'Bandstand's' dazzle finds root in Andy Blankenbuehler's direction and choreography. The Tony-winning choreographer of 'Hamilton' takes on double duty here, allowing the dancing and progression of the show to work in seamless tandem. Simple changes in David Korins's nimble set and Paloma Young's inventive costumes signal important scene changes, while the company fills the stage with high-voltage dance backed by the live band's energy. The spectacle is busy, yet precise, and a whole lot of fun to watch.",
