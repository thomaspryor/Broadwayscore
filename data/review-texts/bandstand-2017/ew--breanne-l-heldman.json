  "bwwExcerpt": "The music itself works, but for a show called 'Bandstand,' one might expect to keep humming a tune or two hours after leaving the theater. That doesn't happen here. Act one's big showstopper, 'Love Will Come and Find Me Again,' is as grand as you want it to be - and Osnes completely crushes it - but it also sounds like any other tune from the big band era. The big finale track, 'Welcome Home,' which is about how each band member handles his PTSD, is intentionally awkward and not exactly the kind of track you'll want to sing in the shower.",
