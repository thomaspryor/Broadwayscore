  "bwwExcerpt": "Absent high drama, the director, Moritz von Stuelpnagel (“Hand to God”), massages the play’s turning points effectively. An affecting and surprisingly funny passage finds Sam engaging in a solo game of Sorry!, with Mr. DeVito mustering his considerable arsenal of comic effects to depict a fiercely fought combat. A story about the provenance of an old guitar, formerly the property of a black Vietnam War veteran traumatized by his experience whom Sam once worked with, strikes another moving note.",
