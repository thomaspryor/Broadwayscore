  "fullText": "At the start of “I Need That,” Theresa Rebeck’s new three-character play about old age and the joy and tyranny of stuff, Danny DeVito is found crumpled up on the stage, his elderly but energetic character, Sam, fast asleep but bathed in helpful light from above.\n\nDeVito&#8217;s Sam raises a mittened hand, a gesture that serves both the play (he’s coming, he tells his visitor) and the presence of a star actor, since it’s a way for DeVito to both acknowledge and cut off the entrance applause.  “I Need That,” a star vehicle if ever there was one, sure needs DeVito to function on Broadway.  Even with him, the play struggles at times.\n\nIn fact, the play has the benefit of two DeVitos since Lucy DeVito, Danny’s daughter (a lively actress and a visual fusion of both her dad and her mom, Rhea Perlman), is playing Sam’s daughter, Amelia.\n\nAnd while the familial relationship is, of course, unspoken in Rebeck’s fictional world, it certainly lends a meta sensibility to a play of which the first half mostly consists of a daughter telling her dad that he really needs to get rid of all of his crap. As the younger DeVito gets lovingly all up in her dad’s face about his throwing some stuff away, you find yourself wondering how much of that is based in their actual relationship, an echo the show certainly encourages.\n\nUnderestimating the extent to which many in the Roundabout audience will identify with that experience is a mistake. Many of us have confronted the task of moving our parents out of somewhere and into what might euphemistically be called a smaller life, only to find that we have to wrestle every last item from their hands, and hearts.\n\nEven more of us are surrounded on a daily basis by our own detritus, all treasures to us and filled with echoes of the past, even if no auctioneer would ever raise a hammer on any of that junk.\n\nRebeck clearly wants Sam to be hoarder-adjacent rather than full-on &#8220;Hoarders&#8221; TV show candidate and, indeed, Alexander Dodge’s set surrounds the diminutive DeVito with all kinds of artfully displayed junk, but it’s far from some rat-invested sea of stuff, threatening to bury him alive.\n\nThe problem there is the stakes and dramatic tension in the play comes from Amelia warning her dad that unless he gets going with the garbage bags for those old magazines, he’ll get forced out of his own place due to a pain-in-the-neck neighbor and fire code regulations.\n\nThat’s a stretch, frankly; I kept thinking there are places on my block filled with more stuff than that belonging to Sam.  And I struggled similarly with believing Amelia’s lack of understanding about what these items mean to a dad she clearly adores. The play needs her to plead and push, but it becomes repetitive.\n\nThe other character here is a Mr. Foster (Ray Anthony Thomas), Sam’s best pal and a figure who seems to be there to allow for some sentimental “Grumpy Old Men” interactions, alternating with edgier “American Buffalo”-type interactions, as the pair constantly navigates and negotiates their late-in-life friendship. It’s charming, if forced at times. But then this production, directed by Moritz von Stuelnagel, has many sudden and drastic changes of mood.\n\nMany will be present to see DeVito, who has taken on a big role at the age of 78, was still wrestling with its demands on the night I caught the show, and yet already is big fun to watch.\n\nDeVito is just funny, period (he once cracked me up for several minutes, merely by sitting in a theater seat and watching his wife perform). In “I Need That,” his solo game of “Sorry” (feeling the emotions of all the colors) is a little crowd-pleasing tour-de-force, a generous gift for this old-school comic actor from Rebeck.\n\nOverall, this piece doesn’t land at the top of Rebeck’s impressively diverse oeuvre, and I’d wager you’ll see some things coming far faster than any fire department. But I’m partial to plays that deal with experiences almost everyone shares and throwing stuff out is far higher on the list of life traumas than you might think.\n\nWe all need less than we think, of course, but it also feels like throwing out our stuff is throwing out our past life. The people who can do that without reflection aren’t people worth knowing.\n\n“It’s not your job to take care of me! It’s my job to take care of you!,” DeVito’s Sam says to his daughter, the actor’s real daughter, toward the end of the 100-minute show.\n\nBoth their eyes twinkle with recognition.",
