It just seems false to suggest such an unhealthy mental condition as somehow romantic.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic finds the play's treatment of hoarding as 'false' and criticizes it as 'sitcom-adjacent throwback' that fails to properly acknowledge mental health issues, indicating disappointment with the production's approach. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show for its unrealistic portrayal of hoarding, suggesting that the show's attempt to romanticize a serious mental health issue is unconvincing. This indicates a negative view of the production's handling of its subject matter. | Gemini: The review excerpt points out a significant flaw in the play's portrayal of hoarding, suggesting a lack of depth and a romanticized view of a serious mental health issue. This indicates a mixed assessment, as it acknowledges the playwright's intentions but criticizes the execution.",
