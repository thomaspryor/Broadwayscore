  "showScoreExcerpt": "“The view of hoarding as a serious mental health affliction never gets much acknowledgment in this 100-minute, sitcom-adjacent throwback...Rebeck’s desire, for us to empathize with Sam’s grief, manifested as an embrace of any thing that prompts a memory of his wife, is nice enough.

The lack of acknowledgment of hoarding as a serious issue is noted negatively. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses reservations about the play's portrayal of hoarding, suggesting it's not entirely successful in its aims. This indicates a mixed assessment rather than a positive or negative one.",
