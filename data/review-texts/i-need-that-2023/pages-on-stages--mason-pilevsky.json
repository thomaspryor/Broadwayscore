  "showScoreExcerpt": "Despite the brilliance of Danny DeVito and the cleverness of the concept of a story about hoarders who keep items for emotional significance, I had difficulty getting into this production. It felt to me like watching a sitcom being filmed. The emotional highs weren’t that high, the lows weren’t that low, and the character development was minimal. Had I watched this play in 20 minute increments once a week, I would have looked forward to each character’s lovable familiarity and role in the story.\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Negative/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Despite praising DeVito's performance and the concept, the critic finds fundamental flaws in execution, comparing it unfavorably to a sitcom and citing minimal character development and emotional impact. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges positive elements like DeVito's performance and the concept but expresses difficulty engaging with the production. The comparison to a sitcom suggests a lack of depth, leading to a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review expresses mixed feelings, praising the concept and Danny DeVito but criticizing the lack of emotional depth and character development. The sitcom comparison suggests a lack of theatrical impact. | Kimi: While praising Danny DeVito's brilliance and the clever concept, the critic ultimately rejects the production for lacking emotional depth and theatrical impact, comparing it unfavorably to a sitcom. Single excerpt limits confidence. | Buckets: claude=Negative, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Negative",
