That is something we need from every actor who steps upon a Broadway (or Off-Broadway stage). Let’s hope DeVito returns soon!”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for DeVito's performance calling him 'an American treasure' and hoping he 'returns soon' suggests positive recommendation, but single excerpt limits confidence in overall show assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Danny DeVito's performance highly, suggesting a positive view of the show, at least in terms of his contribution. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, praising Danny DeVito's performance and calling him an \"American treasure.\" Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as positive but with low confidence. | Kimi: Single excerpt offers strong praise for DeVito's performance, calling him an 'American treasure' who delivers 'complete honesty' in every moment, but limited context about the production as a whole warrants reduced confidence and placement in the upper Positive range per excerpt guidelines.",
