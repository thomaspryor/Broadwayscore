  "showScoreExcerpt": "A repetitively thin outlook on grief, \"I Need That\" ostensibly concludes with an image of healing, but I'm not sure why, or if it actually does. It's possible the famously prolific Rebeck had another play to write and figured DeVito would leave the audience feeling better no matter what she put on the page. That wasn't a bad bet, I suppose, but not everyone has the privilege of casting DeVito to pull attention away from writing that ultimately falls prey to a cheaply metaphoric sunrise (no knock on lighting designer Yi Zhao who was just doing his job). \n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Critic finds the play 'repetitively thin' and criticizes the writing as falling prey to cheap metaphor, suggesting DeVito's casting masks weak material. However, single excerpt limits confidence in full verdict. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the writing as 'repetitively thin' and questions the conclusion's effectiveness, suggesting a negative view. The mention of DeVito as a distraction implies reliance on star power over substance. | Gemini: The review is negative, criticizing the writing as \"thin\" and relying on DeVito's presence to distract from the weak script. The critic questions the play's conclusion and overall effectiveness. | Kimi: The critic describes the writing as 'thin' and 'cheaply metaphoric,' questioning whether the play's conclusion actually achieves its intended emotional effect. While acknowledging that Danny DeVito's presence might distract from the weak material, the overall verdict criticizes the playwright's reliance on star power to compensate for underdeveloped substance.",
