  "showScoreExcerpt": "“If you want to experience the very definition of a star vehicle, Roundabout has a show for you. Before you bite, however, consider the star: It's unclear if Theresa Rebeck wrote I Need That for Danny DeVito or if she reworked it once he agreed to appear in it. In any case, the lead role fits him like a custom-made glove, giving the popular television and film star a prime opportunity to exercise his comic specialties. Indeed, it often seems to be the reason that I Need That exists.”\n\nRead more",

The phrase 'Before you bite, however, consider' suggests caution, and questioning why the show exists indicates mixed-to-negative sentiment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the show as a star vehicle for Danny DeVito, suggesting it is worth seeing for his performance. However, the text also implies the show may primarily exist to showcase him, which suggests some reservations. | Gemini: The review highlights the play as a star vehicle for Danny DeVito, suggesting it's worth seeing for his performance, but also implies the play's primary purpose is to showcase him, which could be a reservation. | Kimi: While praising DeVito's perfect fit for the role, the excerpt questions whether the play exists for any reason beyond showcasing the star, calling it the 'very definition of a star vehicle' with a cautionary 'before you bite.' | Buckets: claude=Mixed, openai=Positive, gemini=Positive, kimi=Mixed",
