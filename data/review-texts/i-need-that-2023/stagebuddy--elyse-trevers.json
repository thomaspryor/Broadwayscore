However, the single excerpt warning means the full review might contain more context, so confidence is low. | Gemini: The review states the play was disappointing and missed its mark, indicating a negative assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly describes the show as disappointing and failing to achieve its goals, indicating a clear thumbs-down verdict, though confidence is reduced due to the single curated excerpt limitation.",
