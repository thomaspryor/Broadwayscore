  "fullText": "Let's face it: No one's going to hire Danny DeVito to play Lear. Or Willy Loman. Or even George to Albee's Martha. In the eyes of the world, DeVito is a clown, just short of having a Bozo nose. If he stood onstage reading the obituary page, people would die laughing.\n\nSo it doesn't really matter that playwright Theresa Rebeck's \"I Need That\" — written for DeVito and his daughter, Lucy DeVito, and playing at the Roundabout Theatre Company's American Airlines Theatre on Broadway — is basically a 90-minute sitcom episode, full of sentimentality. TV is what DeVito does best, and he's good at this. He's easy, relaxed and sparking with grumpy mirth.",
  "bwwExcerpt": "There is an attempt, near the end of the show, to add meaning and depth to the story’s otherwise surface-level emotions. Eventually we’re told that the things we’re attached to from the past keep us from living in the present, but the notion isn’t woven into the text or explored throughout the play. It arrives way too late, with the impact of a Hallmark card. Still, “I Need That” will prove satisfying for those looking to be entertained by DeVito and his daughter. He brings real joy and laughter",
