  "bwwExcerpt": "The cast, directed by Moritz von Stuelpnagel, hugs the tonal contours skillfully. From the get-go, it’s a safe bet that Sam and his home will transform. Thanks to a late-in-the-game twist, he also gets a shot to step up as a dad. In the end, I Need That is pleasant but leaves you wanting. “Things don’t give your life meaning.
