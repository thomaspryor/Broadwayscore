    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Mixed | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests that the play feels longer than its runtime, indicating a pacing issue. Without more context, this implies a mixed reception, as the critic points out a significant flaw. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates the play feels padded, suggesting a negative experience. Given the single excerpt and truncated nature, confidence is low, but the negative sentiment is clear enough to place it in the negative bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt criticizes the play's pacing as feeling padded despite its brevity, suggesting dramaturgical issues. However, with only a single truncated excerpt available, the overall verdict is unclear and the positive assessment may have been cut off.",
