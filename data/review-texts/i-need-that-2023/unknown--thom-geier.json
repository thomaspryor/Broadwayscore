  "showScoreExcerpt": "Theresa Rebeck’s I Need That is a three-hander that you can imagine as an extended pilot for a CBS dramedy. Rebeck doesn’t dig too deep into the psychology of her characters, but the surface charms are more than enough to sustain a dramedy that runs about 100 minutes. After all, this is the kind of old-fashioned entertainment where it’s best not to question too deeply why these characters have waited so long to express themselves as openly as they do here.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified praise ('surface charms are more than enough') but notes shallow character development and describes it as 'old-fashioned entertainment' with caveats about not questioning too deeply. The truncated nature and lukewarm tone suggest lower end of Positive range. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mildly positive view, noting 'surface charms' and 'old-fashioned entertainment' as positives, but also hints at a lack of depth. The single excerpt and text quality warning suggest caution, so a lower positive score is appropriate. | Gemini: The review suggests the play is charming and entertaining, but not particularly deep. Given the limited excerpt, I'm scoring it as a slightly positive review with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise acknowledging the show is shallow but charming, recommending it as pleasant 'old-fashioned entertainment' despite lack of psychological depth. Single-excerpt limitation and truncated text warrant low confidence and a lower-end Positive score.",
