That’s not the play’s mission and it succeeds in its limited goals. Director Moritz von Stuelpnagel delivers a tight, precise staging, as neat as Sam’s house is cluttered.”\n\nRead more",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show succeeds but within 'limited goals,' suggesting modest achievement. Single excerpt warning applies - this could be cherry-picked from a more negative or positive full review. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the play's limited goals and praises the direction, but notes it lacks the depth of real-life experiences. The single excerpt suggests a mixed verdict with some positive elements. | Gemini: The review states the show succeeds in its limited goals, but lacks the aching pain of real-life hoarders. This suggests a mixed reaction, not strongly positive or negative. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the show lacks depth ('lacks the aching pain') but explicitly states it succeeds in its aims and praises the director's 'tight, precise staging.' This constitutes a qualified positive recommendation, though the single excerpt warrants low confidence.",
