    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Critic explicitly states it's 'not necessarily a bad play' but calls it 'lightweight' and 'draggy' - classic mixed verdict language that neither recommends nor discourages. Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt describes the play as 'lightweight' and 'draggy' with reliance on sentimentality and nostalgia, suggesting a lack of strong recommendation. The presence of DeVito is noted positively, but overall, the tone is mixed. | Gemini: The review excerpt states the play is \"lightweight, draggy\" and relies on simple elements. This suggests a negative assessment, despite the qualification that it's \"not necessarily a bad play.\" | Kimi: The critic offers faint praise ('not necessarily bad') while criticizing the play as 'lightweight' and 'draggy' with overreliance on sentimentality, suggesting a mediocre experience only partially redeemed by DeVito's performance.",
