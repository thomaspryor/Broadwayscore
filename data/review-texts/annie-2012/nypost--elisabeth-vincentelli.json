  "bwwExcerpt": "Nick Payne's family drama has garnered a lot of attention because it marks Jake Gyllenhaal's New York theater debut. Spoiler alert: He and his English accent are perfectly fine…but the actors can't conceal the fact that they're playing clichés thrown into overly familiar situations. You can over-direct this Family Dysfunction 101 class all you want, but it just looks like someone wearing clothes three sizes too big.",
