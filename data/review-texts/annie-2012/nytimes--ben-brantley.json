Broadway has long been familiar with the phenomenon of entrance applause, but the entrance “awww” is rare.\n\nStill, if any show seems guaranteed to elicit that response, it is “Annie,” the 1977 musical that opened on Thursday night in a serviceable revival. It would be churlish to begrudge all that “awww”-ing for the fetching Sunny, who has bravely taken on both a male role and a part whose name would seem to be anathema to New Yorkers at this moment.\n\nSunny, who has four legs, plays the role of Sandy. Not Sandy the evil hurricane, of course, but Sandy the dog, a creature both docile and heroic. The chorus of approval that greeted this Sandy was succeeded by the voice of a toddler in the audience, cooing the words, “A pup-py.” And everybody went “awww” all over again, before Sunny was taken into the arms of an equally fetching little girl who then delivered a tuneful anthem of optimism.\n\nAt such moments, the constant theatergoer may feel one of two different, equally strong urges: to mist up or throw up. I am not exactly proud to say that I misted up, but I’m not ashamed, either.\n\nIt has been, after all, a dark and confusing period in storm-struck, waterlogged New York, and it is reassuring to be in the company of a Sandy you want to cuddle instead of flee. And to listen to a runaway orphan (played by the gleamingly confident Lilla Crawford), who battles the Great Depression blues by singing loudly to herself that things will get better real soon — and in an honest-to-gosh New Yawk accent, to boot.\n\nSay what you will about the current version of “Annie,” which is directed with a slightly tremulous hand by James Lapine and features the virtuosic Katie Finneran as the villainous Miss Hannigan, you can’t fault the timing of its return to Broadway. When this singing adaptation of the venerable comic strip “Little Orphan Annie” originally opened 35 years ago, New York was a shabby and embattled city, reeling from the threat of bankruptcy.\n\nAs directed by its lyricist, Martin Charnin — with a book by Thomas Meehan and music by Charles Strouse — “Annie” dared to be a smiley-faced, old-fashioned love song to a city’s gumption and resilience. That production won a slew of Tonys and went on to figure prominently in the image-rehabilitating “I Love New York” ad campaign that began the same year.\n\nNow, as the city recovers from the crippling onslaught of Hurricane Sandy, and the country wrestles with financial woes not so unlike those of the Great Depression, here comes “Annie” once again, encouraging us to stick out our chins and grin.\n\nOf course, Annie has been around the block many times since she first chirped that advice in the deathlessly cheerful song “Tomorrow.” There was the lumbering 1982 movie version, a couple of misfired sequels, a little-loved 1997 revival and too many school and community theater productions to count. Heck, even the dewiest, pluckiest ingénue would have a hard time staying fresh once she became an endlessly re-marketable brand name.\n\nThat’s the challenge faced by Mr. Lapine and company, and it is met a tad uneasily. Mr. Lapine is best known for his collaborations with Stephen Sondheim (“Sunday in the Park With George,” “Passion”), a composer whose brooding musicals are as introspective and idiosyncratic as “Annie” is extroverted and generic.\n\nIt would seem that Mr. Lapine is hoping to introduce at least a tincture of psychological shading to a show that is only, and unapologetically, a singing comic strip. In its first incarnation “Annie” was an unstoppable sunshine steamroller. This version, which flirts with shadows, moves more shakily.\n\nThe show’s scenic design (by David Korins), which relies largely on two-dimensional cutouts, and choreography (by Andy Blankenbuehler) can come across as sketchy and unfocused. The dance routines and visual jokes are sometimes presented hesitantly and register only peripherally. And adults in the audience may occasionally feel unsettled by some of the reimagined characterizations on display.\n\nPalace Theatre\n \n 1564 Broadway\n New York , NY 10036 Map &raquo;\n\nClosing\n January 5, 2014\n\nTicket Information\n $49-$139\n Ticketmaster: 877-250-2929; http://www.ticketmaster.com\n Buy Tickets\n\nBillions of dollars have poured into the continent to fight killer diseases.

It's a mixed assessment, not strongly recommending or discouraging. | Kimi: Brantley praises the cast (particularly Lilla Crawford and Katie Finneran) and the timely post-Hurricane Sandy resonance, but finds James Lapine's direction tremulous and the production design sketchy and unfocused, ultimately deeming the revival merely serviceable rather than inspired.",
