The original rating of 60 aligns with the 'Mixed' bucket. | Kimi: The critic's own 60/100 rating combined with the qualified assessment—that the revival 'could use more warmth' yet has 'enough charm and energy'—places this squarely in the Mixed bucket, suggesting competent but unexceptional entertainment value.",
