  "bwwExcerpt": "More than thematic fatigue, however, the trouble with Michael Longhurst's production for Roundabout Theatre Company is that it's been directed to death…Funke's emotional nakedness and Gyllenhaal's warmth and immediacy make their scenes together the production's best. But none of the four actors onstage is consistently able to mine the wry humor beneath the domestic discomfort.",
