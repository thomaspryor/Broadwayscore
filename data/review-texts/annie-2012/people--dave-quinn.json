  "bwwExcerpt": "But Goldberg, with her perfect timing, takes things up a notch and finds new moments for Miss Hannigan to steal focus. She moves from the character's many mood swings — bitter, batty, sweet, sarcastic, flirty, funny — with ease, so quickly sometimes that the pivot induces its own laughs. And in Annie's climax, delivers one of the biggest comedic moments in the show with an off-handed remark to Mark Woodard's FDR.",

The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on Whoopi Goldberg's performance and praises her comedic timing and ability to embody the character's mood swings, suggesting a positive experience, but it's hard to determine the overall recommendation due to the limited text. | Kimi: Single curated excerpt offers enthusiastic praise for Whoopi Goldberg's comedic performance and timing, but focuses solely on one performer without assessing the overall production, limiting confidence in the full verdict.",
