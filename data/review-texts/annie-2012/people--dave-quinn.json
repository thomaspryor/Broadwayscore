  "bwwExcerpt": "But Goldberg, with her perfect timing, takes things up a notch and finds new moments for Miss Hannigan to steal focus. She moves from the character's many mood swings — bitter, batty, sweet, sarcastic, flirty, funny — with ease, so quickly sometimes that the pivot induces its own laughs. And in Annie's climax, delivers one of the biggest comedic moments in the show with an off-handed remark to Mark Woodard's FDR.",
