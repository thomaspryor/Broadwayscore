  "bwwExcerpt": "This strange family drama lacks a cohesive plot and lingers on endlessly for about 90 minutes. Its unusual crew of characters includes an academic (Brian F. O'Byrne), a tough teacher (Michelle Gomez), an overweight bullied teen (Annie Funke) and her heartfelt but idiotic uncle (Gyllenhaal)…Gyllenhaal easily blends into his heartbroken, thick-accented character, while Funke presents an often harrowing portrait of a lonely and emotionally abused girl.

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic describes the show as lacking cohesive plot and 'lingering endlessly,' while acknowledging strong individual performances. The truncated ending suggests the critic couldn't find the show's point, indicating a negative overall assessment despite performer praise. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the show for lacking a cohesive plot and dragging on, which indicates a negative view. However, there is some praise for individual performances, which prevents it from being a full pan. | Gemini: The review states that the play lacks a cohesive plot and lingers endlessly. While it praises some performances, the overall sentiment is negative due to the plot issues. | Kimi: The critic praises Gyllenhaal and Funke's performances but strongly criticizes the play's structure and pacing; the truncated ending suggests reservations about the show's overall purpose. Single excerpt and truncation warrant low confidence.",
