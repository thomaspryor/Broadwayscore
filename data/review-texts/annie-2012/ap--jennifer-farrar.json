  "bwwExcerpt": "The despair of being bullied is one theme of Nick Payne's clever, edgy domestic drama, \"If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet,\" about a British family that knows it's falling apart but can't seem to take action to stop it. Kudos to Beowulf Boritt for set design, and to the whole production crew for creating major watery magic. Whether this family can pull themselves out of their troubled waters is another matter, but they're worth rooting for in this complex, compelling drama.",
