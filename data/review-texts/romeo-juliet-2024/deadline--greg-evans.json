However, with only one curated excerpt available, the overall sentiment may not be fully captured, leading to a lower confidence level. | Gemini: The single excerpt praises the cast as \"engaging from beginning to end,\" which suggests a positive, but not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, recommendation. The confidence is low due to the limited text available. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the cast as 'engaging from beginning to end,' indicating a clearly positive verdict, though the single curated quote warrants reduced confidence.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Without tinkering with Shakespeare’s language, this R+J is full of youthful energy – and, what’s more, contemporary youthful energy. Watch how the young cast gestures, maneuvers, gets their bodies from one place to another – courtesy of movement direction and choreography by Sonya Tayeh – and the effect is entirely fresh. A small example: Connor doesn’t climb up a balcony or a trellis – he jumps up and grabs ahold Juliet’s bed platform hovering high over the stage, then does a very impressive chin-up to get his lips where they need to be. It’s a charming touch, and R+J is full of them.",
