  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"This production seems intent on appealing to TikTok audiences who don't know much about the play going in, which is a laudable goal, and I think it will succeed. But those newcomers may be surprised to find that what they thought was a tragedy about young people crushed by societal constraints is actually the sad tale of two nice kids who died from a lack of adult supervision.\"",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic acknowledges the production will succeed with its target audience (positive) but implies it misrepresents the play's essence for traditionalists (negative). Single excerpt limits full verdict assessment. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests the production may succeed with a specific audience but implies a disconnect with the play's traditional interpretation. The tone is mixed, acknowledging potential success but with reservations about its approach. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the production is geared towards a specific audience and may not fully capture the tragic essence of the play, indicating a mixed reception. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges the production will successfully attract younger audiences, the core criticism that it reduces a societal tragedy to a simple story of bad parenting suggests significant artistic shortcomings. The faint praise ('laudable goal') is outweighed by the implication that the production fundamentally misunderstands its source material.",
