This suggests a negative view of the production. | Gemini: The review criticizes the performances of the leads, stating they feel too polished and aware, which detracts from the characters' supposed discovery of love. This indicates a negative assessment of a key aspect of the show. | Kimi: The review acknowledges the performers' talent but levels significant criticism at their acting choices, finding them too polished and lacking the vulnerability required for characters experiencing first love. With only this excerpt available, the overall verdict is unclear, but the emphasis on the criticism via 'but' suggests a mixed assessment.",
