    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic acknowledges the production has energy ('rave-like, nihilistic drive') but ultimately finds it lacking in fundamental ways ('lack of clarity or a pulse'). The word 'Unfortunately' signals disappointment. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be from a mixed review with more positive elements elsewhere. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the production's lack of clarity and energy, suggesting disappointment and a lack of recommendation. The tone is negative, indicating a recommendation to skip the show. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a negative assessment due to a lack of clarity and pulse, despite the production's drive. Given the single excerpt and negative language, I've classified it as negative with low confidence. | Kimi: The critic acknowledges the production has some 'rave-like' drive but explicitly states this fails to compensate for fatal flaws including lack of clarity and vitality (pulse), indicating a clear recommendation against seeing the show.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Audiences of different ages crave different spins on love and death, and judging by the stage-door stampede following the buzzy Broadway revamp of “Romeo and Juliet,” young people are in a frenzy for tragedy. Or at least eager to catch a glimpse of stars Kit Connor and Rachel Zegler on the street. The enthusiasm is thrilling, even when it almost flattens you under foot. Unfortunately, the production’s rave-like, nihilistic drive does little to make up for its lack of clarity or a pulse.",
