    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The excerpt is clearly negative, criticizing the production for lacking 'clarity' and 'a pulse' despite its energy. However, with only one curated excerpt available, the full review verdict is uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt criticizes the production for lacking clarity and a pulse, suggesting a negative impression. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt indicates a negative assessment due to a lack of clarity and pulse, despite the production's drive. | Kimi: While the critic acknowledges some energetic elements in the production, the verdict is explicitly negative, stating these qualities fail to compensate for fundamental deficiencies in clarity and dramatic life ('lack of a pulse').",
