    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The critic explicitly states the show 'irks more often than not' and compares it to a straining theater teacher using desperate tactics. However, with only one excerpt available, the full verdict may be more nuanced. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, describing the show as irksome and trying too hard with various elements. However, due to the single excerpt warning, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses negative language such as \"irks\" and compares the show to an overly enthusiastic teacher, suggesting a negative experience. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as irritating and overly reliant on gimmicks like TikTok references and pop songs, comparing it to a teacher straining too hard to engage students.",
