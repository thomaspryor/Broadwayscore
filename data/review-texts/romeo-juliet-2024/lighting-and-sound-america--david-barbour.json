    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Negative | Claude: The phrase 'I'm afraid' signals disappointment, and describing it as 'largely one-sided' suggests significant problems with balance or execution. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as the full verdict may differ. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a negative view, describing the production as 'one-sided,' which implies a lack of balance or depth. However, with only one excerpt, confidence is low. | Gemini: The single quote available is negative, suggesting the production is unbalanced. Given it's the only evidence, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic describes the production as 'largely one-sided,' indicating a lack of balance or cohesion, and uses the apologetic framing 'I'm afraid' to deliver this disappointment. With only one excerpt available, confidence is reduced.",
