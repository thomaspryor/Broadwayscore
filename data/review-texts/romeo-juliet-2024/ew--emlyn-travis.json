  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"The stellar production  which sees many of its cast, including its two leads, making their Broadway debut  succeeds in threading the needle between two nearly impossible tasks that come with putting on Romeo + Juliet: retaining the play's original language and message while simultaneously putting one's own stamp on the material, and, perhaps most importantly, making a more than 420-year-old play both accessible and enticing for the teens it is representing onstage.\""
