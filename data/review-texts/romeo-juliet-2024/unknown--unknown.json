    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 2/3 models agree: Negative | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a shift in tone from terrifying to 'teenifying', implying a change that might not fully satisfy expectations. Without more context, it reads as a neutral observation rather than a strong recommendation or disapproval. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the play is not as terrifying as it should be, which leans towards a negative assessment. Given it's a single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The single excerpt indicates the play fails to deliver on its intended terror, coming across as juvenile ('teenifying') instead. With only one curated sentence available, the overall sentiment could vary, but this critique suggests a disappointing execution.",
