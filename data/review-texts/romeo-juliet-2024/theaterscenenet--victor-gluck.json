    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt suggests demographic split appeal rather than broad recommendation. 'Will please Gen Z more than their parents' implies limited appeal and generational divide, indicating mixed reception rather than enthusiastic endorsement. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a generational divide in appeal, indicating that the production may not have broad appeal. The lack of a clear recommendation or discouragement places it in the Mixed bucket. Due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests a mixed reception, appealing more to a younger audience. This indicates a conditional recommendation, placing it in the Mixed bucket. | Kimi: Single curated excerpt indicates the production has demographic-specific appeal that will please younger viewers more than older ones; mildly positive tone warrants lower Positive range score per handling instructions for single excerpts.",
