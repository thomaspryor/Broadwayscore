    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt focuses on strong lead performances and describes the revival as 'fresh and immediate,' indicating positive assessment. However, confidence is low due to limited text from what may be a longer review. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the leads for their chemistry and emotional performance, suggesting a strong recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt focuses on the positive performances of the leads and the freshness of the revival. Due to the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the content is clearly positive. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear praise for the lead performances and the revival's freshness, indicating a solid recommendation. Per the single-excerpt warning, the clearly positive tone places this in the upper range of the Positive bucket, though limited context prevents higher confidence or Rave classification.",
