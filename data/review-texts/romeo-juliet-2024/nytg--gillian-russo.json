    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The critic praises the casting choice and its thematic effectiveness but delivers a significant negative verdict about the production's core emotional impact. The phrase 'hasn't quite found its heartbeat' suggests fundamental problems despite positive elements. | GPT-4o: The excerpt acknowledges a successful aspect of the production with the young cast but ultimately suggests it lacks a crucial element, indicating a mixed review. | Gemini: The review notes a successful aspect of the production but concludes it \"hasn't quite found its heartbeat,\" indicating a mixed assessment. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified praise for the casting concept while delivering a significant criticism about the production's emotional heartbeat, suggesting an evenly mixed assessment. Confidence is low due to availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
