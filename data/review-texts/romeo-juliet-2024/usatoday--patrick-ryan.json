Mixed signals with no clear recommendation either way. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the chemistry of the leads but suggests the show may be exhausting for some audiences. The lack of a clear recommendation and the mixed signals in the excerpt lead to a mixed classification. | Gemini: The review acknowledges moments of beauty and strong chemistry between the leads, but also suggests exhaustion for older audiences, indicating a mixed experience. The single excerpt and lack of a clear recommendation lead to low confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the lead chemistry and occasional beauty but ultimately warns audiences will feel 'exhausted,' creating a balanced mixed verdict without clear recommendation. Single excerpt limits confidence.",
