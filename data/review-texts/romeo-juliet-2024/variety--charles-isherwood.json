  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Although the production has a heartbeat, it's missing a heart... When he kills Tybalt in revenge, the moment is empty of real feeling. In the moments after that  when he's exiled and so must leave his love; when he discovers Juliet is dead; etc.  there is no heartbreak at all. There's not a wet eye in the house.\"",
