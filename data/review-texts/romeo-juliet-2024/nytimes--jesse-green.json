  "nycTheatreExcerpt": "\"Is that a reasonable response to aim for when staging the world's most famous weepie? For me, seeing so many young people engaged, it is. Perhaps, as Shakespeare commands in the play's closing speech, they will \"Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\" And so what if the production achieves that goal by protecting them from too much unruly feeling, just as the Capulets aimed to protect Juliet? Probably, the Capulets were right.\"",

However, this is only one excerpt and may not represent the full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a positive outcome by engaging young audiences, despite some reservations about the emotional impact. However, the single excerpt and lack of full context reduce confidence. | Gemini: The critic seems to be saying that the production is successful in engaging young people, even if it does so by protecting them from too much emotion. This suggests a qualified recommendation. | Kimi: The excerpt offers qualified approval of the production's restrained approach, finding value in its ability to engage young audiences despite protecting them from intense emotion. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "It’s a little slick, though, at least for seen-that adults. The play’s twisty language, expressive of twisty thoughts, is largely untangled but, in the process, flattened. (Gold’s edit brings the running time, not counting intermission, to “the two hours’ traffic of the stage” Shakespeare mentions, but some of that traffic is stop-and-go.) I smiled a lot but never came close to crying.",
