  "fullText": "“Every single exclamation mark stays,” says the riled-up Dr. Thomas Stockmann in the new Broadway staging of “An Enemy of the People,” Ibsen’s 1882 drama about a man’s lonely battle for truth against the arrayed forces of a society bent on self-protection. “If in doubt,” he continues, “add more.”\n\nAn Enemy of the People Boyd Gaines stars in a new version of Ibsen’s 1882 drama, at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater.\n\nFollow @NYTimestheater for theater news and reviews from Broadway and beyond.\n\nBoyd Gaines, left, as a lone man who sticks to his convictions in the face of public scorn. Richard Thomas plays his brother.\n\nThe good doctor’s fiery admonition might stand as the epigraph for this high-intensity, high-volume production, which opened on Thursday night at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, presented by Manhattan Theater Club. As directed by Doug Hughes, with a fervent Boyd Gaines in the role of the embattled Dr. Stockmann and a silky-sinister Richard Thomas as his brother and staunch foe, Ibsen’s potent play reaches a rapid boil in the seething confrontation between the brothers that concludes the first act. It rarely simmers down for the rest of the evening.\n\nThe pedal-to-the-metal approach has its advantages. With voices clamoring from the stage at top volume for much of the evening, your attention is rarely likely to stray from the finely spun web of ideas animating Ibsen’s play, about the ruckus raised in a Norwegian spa town when the local doctor discovers that the waters are poisoned. At a time when America’s political discourse is reaching fever pitch in advance of the presidential election, the play’s heated discussion of just who should control the levers of power in a society, and whether the intellectually superior, forward-thinking individual or the mindless majority should dictate public policy, makes for savory meat to chew on after the curtain has fallen.\n\nWhile the shouting sometimes threatens to leave the actors nowhere to go but to a skilled ear, nose and throat doctor, it’s also true that Ibsen’s play is hardly his most nuanced drama of an individual at odds with the social order of his time. “An Enemy of the People” lends itself to inflammatory theatrics, particularly in the climactic scene in which poor Dr. Stockmann is assailed by a chorus of townspeople viciously taunting him with the epithet of the title. This rousing set-to would fall pretty flat if voices were not raised beyond a gentle murmur.\n\nIt’s gratifying to see Mr. Gaines, a Broadway veteran with four Tony awards to his name (for “The Heidi Chronicles,” “She Loves Me,” “Contact” and “Gypsy”) get the opportunity to dig into such a rewarding classical role. (Dr. Stockmann was a favorite part of no less a theater god than Stanislavsky.) Productions of Ibsen are rare on Broadway, where the approved list of revivals seems to be shrinking down to a handful of market-tested, star-spangled 20th-century American classics.\n\nMr. Gaines takes confident advantage of this prized chance, giving a sterling performance that allows us to see Dr. Stockmann from all the perspectives Ibsen intended. A once-struggling doctor who now freely rejoices in the financial rewards that his status as the staff physician at the spa have brought, he brims with good will in the play’s opening scenes. Mr. Gaines scampers around the stage with almost boyish high spirits, in amusing contrast to the prim, buttoned-up rectitude of the brother, Peter (Mr. Thomas), the town’s mayor and the chairman of the spa that promises to bring untold trickle-down prosperity to the citizenry.\n\nThe brothers part ways violently when Thomas reveals that he has conducted a series of tests that prove his grave suspicion: Far from being salubrious, the town’s spa waters are actually harmful, thanks to the decision taken by its leaders (namely Peter) to go against Thomas’s recommendation about where to lay the pipes.\n\nThomas is galvanized by the discovery, at first assured that he will be hailed as the town’s hero when his report is published in the newspaper, with all those exclamation points in place. But even as he preens, he is driven above all by the belief that the truth must be brought forth: for him the public good and right conduct dictated by reason are indistinguishable. Mr. Gaines’s forceful performance makes us see how deeply held these beliefs are, and how shaken he is by the discovery that his view puts him in a lonely minority of one.\n\nBillions of dollars have poured into the continent to fight killer diseases. But the most basic killer, injury, is neglected.\n\nIn Room for Debate: Even for students who can afford a semester overseas, there may be better uses for that time and money.",
