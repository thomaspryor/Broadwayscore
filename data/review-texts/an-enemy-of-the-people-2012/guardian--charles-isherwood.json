    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt praising lead performance with 'compelling intensity' suggests positive assessment, but extremely limited text from curated quote makes full verdict unclear. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises Boyd Gaines' performance, indicating a positive view of his role. However, without more context, it's unclear if the overall production is recommended, leading to a cautious low-end Positive score. | Gemini: The excerpt praises Boyd Gaines' performance, suggesting a positive aspect of the production. Given the limited text, a cautious positive score is appropriate. | Kimi: The excerpt offers clear, unqualified praise for the lead performance ('compelling intensity'), placing it in the Positive bucket. Following the single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes, the score falls in the 80-84 range, though confidence is low due to limited context.",
