    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Strong praise for lead performances ('marvelous') and supporting cast ('terrific turns'), plus positive assessment of direction ('paces it like a thriller'). Single excerpt warning applied - this sounds clearly positive, so scored in upper end of Positive bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the performances and direction, describing it as thrilling and engaging. The positive language suggests a strong recommendation, but the single excerpt limits confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt praises the performances of multiple actors and the director's pacing, suggesting a positive experience. Given the single excerpt and lack of full context, confidence is low, but the enthusiastic tone warrants a score on the higher end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the cast ('marvelous', 'terrific turns') and direction ('paces it like a thriller'), indicating an enthusiastic recommendation. However, confidence is low because only a single curated excerpt is available, which may not represent the full review's verdict.",
