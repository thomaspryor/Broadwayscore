    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows appreciation for the play's contemporary relevance and political urgency ('spitting-mad screed'), suggesting positive engagement, but limited text prevents higher confidence or score. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the relevance of the play's themes to contemporary issues, suggesting a positive view of its engagement with political topics. However, the single excerpt warning and lack of a clear rating reduce confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the play is relevant and engaging, but it's a single quote, so confidence is low. I am assuming the critic recommends seeing it. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the play's contemporary relevance and passionate political stance, suggesting it resonates with current election-year tensions, though it focuses on thematic content rather than production specifics.",
