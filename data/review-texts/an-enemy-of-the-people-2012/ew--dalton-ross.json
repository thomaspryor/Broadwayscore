Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the actors and suggests that fans will not be disappointed, indicating a strong recommendation. The 'A–' rating supports a high Positive score. | Gemini: The review states that fans of popular shows will not be disappointed and praises the actors as tremendous, indicating a strong positive recommendation. The A- grade further supports this. | Kimi: The critic awards an A- grade and assures audiences they 'will not be disappointed,' praising the lead performances as 'tremendous.' While noting the challenging themes, the overall verdict is enthusiastic. Confidence is low due to availability of only a single excerpt.",
