    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt with measured praise for performers ('solid Gaines', 'Thomas is good') suggests positive but not enthusiastic assessment. Low confidence due to limited text that may not represent full verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises individual performances but lacks a clear overall recommendation for the show. The single excerpt warning suggests caution, leading to a mixed classification with low confidence. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the performances of Gaines and Thomas, but the overall context is limited. Given the single excerpt and positive tone, I'm placing it in the lower end of the Positive bucket. | Kimi: The excerpt offers mild praise for the performances using words like 'solid' and 'good', suggesting a qualified recommendation rather than an enthusiastic endorsement. Given this is a single curated excerpt that may not represent the full review, confidence is low.",
