  "bwwExcerpt": "Richard Thomas does everything but twirl his mustache as the bogeyman in the Broadway revival of “An Enemy of the People.” That’s because he doesn’t have a mustache to twirl. The other accouterments of villainy -- black top hat and bowtie framing a lip-curling sneer, cape and cane wielded with menacing flourishes -- are all accounted for in Doug Hughes’s clipped vaudeville of a production.",
