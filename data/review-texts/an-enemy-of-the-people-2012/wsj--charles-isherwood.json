  "bwwExcerpt": "Purists may question Ms. Herzog’s fresh interpretation of Thomas, who in this version is less ornery and scorching in his denunciation of those who oppose him; even in his celebrated speech excoriating the disapproving townsfolk (audience members are recruited to represent them), Mr. Strong, taking his cue from Ms. Herzog, seems befuddled by his rejection, and afterward his designation as an “enemy of the people.” Thomas is notably less contemptuous, and less an advocate for a rigid meritocracy, than Ibsen’s original.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: This excerpt provides analytical comparison to the source material but offers no evaluative verdict or recommendation. The tone is scholarly rather than clearly positive or negative, discussing interpretation choices without endorsing or condemning them. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a departure from the original character's intensity, which may not satisfy purists. The tone is evaluative but lacks strong positive or negative language, indicating a mixed reception. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on the differences between this production and the original Ibsen play, without a clear recommendation for or against seeing it. The tone is neutral, suggesting a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The excerpt analyzes significant deviations from the source material without clearly endorsing them, noting that 'purists may question' the interpretation and describing the protagonist as 'befuddled' rather than commanding. With only one curated excerpt available, the overall verdict remains ambiguous between appreciating the fresh take and questioning its dramatic impact.",
