  "bwwExcerpt": "Rebecca Lenkiewicz's \"new version\" of \"An Enemy of the People\" is yet another attempt to update Henrik Ibsen's smug 1882 satire about a visionary doctor (Boyd Gaines) who becomes a pariah when he makes a discovery that threatens to gut the economy of the hypocriticAl Small town in which he lives. (Yes, the doctor is a self-portrait of the playwright as genius.)",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows balanced assessment - praises production for making classic feel 'immediate and urgent' but notes significant limitation in overcoming the play's didacticism. This suggests neither clear recommendation nor discouragement. | GPT-4o: The excerpt indicates a positive view on the production's ability to make the drama feel relevant, but notes a limitation in overcoming the play's didactic nature. The single excerpt suggests a mildly positive review. | Gemini: The review states the production \"succeeds\" but also notes it \"can't quite overcome\" a flaw. Given the single excerpt, I'm placing it in the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt offers mild praise for the production's success in modernizing the drama while explicitly noting its limitations regarding the source material's didacticism, suggesting a lukewarm but genuine recommendation.",
