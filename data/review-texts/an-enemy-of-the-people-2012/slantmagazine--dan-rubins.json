  "bwwExcerpt": "Gold’s sharply accelerating production reveals the horror of hypocrisy, but, without outside assistance, it doesn’t quite challenge the audience’s own complicity. By the time the third Extinction Rebellion protestor arose, most of the crowd met him with vehement boos. Minutes later, Dr. Stockmann was back on his own soapbox demanding that he himself be heard: “Ask yourselves—Is what I’m saying dangerous? Or is ignorance dangerous? You don’t have to agree with me, I just ask that you listen, because I don’t have any reason to be up here, ruining my career, making my family suffer, except that I care about this place.”",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: The excerpt praises the production's ability to reveal themes but identifies a significant limitation - it 'doesn't quite challenge' the audience. This suggests admiration for craft but notes the show falls short of its full potential. Single excerpt warning applies - assessment is necessarily limited. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a mixed assessment, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of the production. The lack of a clear recommendation or discouragement places it in the Mixed bucket. Confidence is low due to the single excerpt warning. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the production has some merit in revealing hypocrisy, but falls short in challenging the audience's complicity. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt offers strong praise for the production's pacing and thematic impact ('sharply accelerating,' 'reveals the horror') but includes a significant reservation about its failure to fully challenge audience complicity. Given the single-excerpt limitation, this qualifies as a mildly positive, qualified recommendation.",
