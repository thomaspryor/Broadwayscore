    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: Single excerpt describes the show's dramatic arc in neutral-to-positive terms, suggesting thoughtful construction, but extremely limited text makes confidence assessment difficult. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a complex tone with elements of satire and tragedy, but lacks clear evaluative language indicating a strong recommendation or dissuasion. The single excerpt and lack of a clear verdict contribute to low confidence. | Gemini: The excerpt describes the show as a \"bitter satire\" and a \"slow-boil tragedy,\" suggesting a complex and potentially thought-provoking experience, but without a clear recommendation. Given the limited text, a mixed score seems appropriate. | Kimi: Single excerpt describes effective dramatic structure ('slow-boil tragedy') and genre ('bitter satire') without explicit praise or criticism. Lacks enthusiastic endorsement language, suggesting mild approval. Confidence is low due to limited context. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Mixed, kimi=Positive",
