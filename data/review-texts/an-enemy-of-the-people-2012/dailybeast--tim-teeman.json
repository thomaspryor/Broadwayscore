  "bwwExcerpt": "For one, both Succession and this adaptation, directed by Sam Gold (who is married to Herzog) know how to crunchily position drama and wit, profundity and comedy, alongside one another. This brilliant Enemy of the People is notably funny in both its smarts and pacing, and even its later gathering darkness—when Stockmann is viciously trounced and isolated by his townsfolk—is studded with light, and the certainty of his self-preservation.",

Single excerpt warning requires caution, but 'brilliant' suggests strong positive territory within the bucket. | GPT-4o: The excerpt describes the adaptation as 'brilliant' and praises its balance of drama, wit, and comedy. Despite the single excerpt warning, the language suggests a strong recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt uses positive language such as \"brilliant\" and \"notably funny,\" suggesting a positive recommendation. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low, but the strength of the language suggests the upper end of the positive bucket. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
