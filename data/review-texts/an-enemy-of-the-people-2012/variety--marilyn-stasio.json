More to the point is how Henrik Ibsen might cast his ballot, since his 1882 political drama, “An Enemy of the People,” argues both sides of an ideological conundrum that has tripped up both presidential candidates. Purists may flinch at Rebecca Lenkiewicz’s bare-bones adaptation, which diminishes all the secondary characters and strips all the (admittedly repetitive) subplots of their nuance. But when Boyd Gaines and Richard Thomas square off for the Cain-and-Abel power play between brothers, we could be on the hustings.\n\nHelmer Doug Hughes has smartly staged that climactic showdown in the orchestra of the theater. Although Ibsen makes it quite clear that Dr. Thomas Stockmann (Boyd Gaines) keeps a modest home and struggling medical practice in the seaside Norwegian town where the play is set, the cramped rooms and low ceilings of John Lee Beatty’s submarine-scaled set feel so confining that it’s a release to see the actors stride down the aisle and take their places both on stage and in the front rows of the auditorium.\n\nBut before we get to the fireworks, there’s a little thing called a plot that has to be set up. In this austere version, it’s quickly established that Stockmann, a man of science, has amassed incontrovertible evidence that the local tannery owned by his rich father-in-law has contaminated the medicinal public baths that are expected to bring immediate prosperity to his economically depressed and slowly recovering town.\n\nLast seen on Broadway in “The Columnist,” Gaines is a protean performer (he sings! he dances! he does drama!) adept at physically insinuating himself into a role while playing beyond type. Eyes ablaze with idealistic fervor, the thesp perfectly captures the messianic fervor with which Stockmann triumphantly commits his findings to an incendiary expose to be published in the local liberal newspaper.\n\nWithout missing a beat, Gaines also plays the colossal arrogance of the “pure” idealist who naively expects the citizens of the town to declare him a hero for plunging them back into economic ruin. Gaines even taps into the lack of self-awareness that makes Stockmann so touching in his childish yearning to exchange the anonymity of his dull life for a taste of fame and fortune and good times. “It was pretty grim,” he admits, in Lenkiewicz’s overly idiomatic treatment of the colloquial language Ibsen chose for this play.\n\nGoing into the public forum to justify his findings to the townspeople, Stockmann looks like a fatted fly waiting to be gobbled up by his evil spider of a brother, the town Mayor underplayed to chilling effect by Richard Thomas. Subtle villain that he is, Thomas keeps the Mayor’s self-serving manipulations literally hidden under the slouch hat and oversized black overcoat designed by Catherine Zuber. His soft voice and reserved manner a menacing contrast to his brother’s bombastic truth-telling, the Mayor quietly stirs the ignorant populace into a violent mob.\n\nFalling into his brother’s trap, Stockmann opens his defense in classic Romney mode, exposing the voters (that is, his fellow citizens) as the uneducated ignoramuses they are. After denouncing the town politicians for their cynicism, greed and hypocrisy, he identifies the “deadliest enemies of freedom and truth.” And who, pray tell, would that be?\n\n“The most dangerous public enemy is the majority!” rants Stockmann, who is shocked — shocked! — that the “common man” should refuse to acknowledge the intellectually superior specimens of his own species. How can the unwashed and uneducated masses deny that they perpetuate their own ignorance by violently suppressing anything nobler than their own selfishly conservative values?\n\nBy the time that Stockmann recovers himself and takes a more democratic position — explaining that he is not referring to the false superiority of personal wealth or social class or political power, but the genuine superiority of a noble character — the damage has been done.\n\nClearly, MTC has lucked out with its timing of this classic drama, its Victorian-era polemics ordinarily a bit simplistic — but given the peculiar insanity of election politics, right on the money.",

Only vaguely similar, plot-wise, to the pleasant same-named 1966 trifle showcasing Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine, this Coen brothers-scripted curio, helmed by Michael Hoffman (“The Last Station“), stars Colin Firth as an art curator deploying Cameron Diaz in a sting set mostly in Blighty, where the pic opens wide Nov. 21. Stateside release details are still pending, and B.O. prospects look tricky despite the names attached, but the pic should filch some coin in ancillary.\n\nRelated Stories \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Jennifer Lawrence Playfully Trolls White Men: 'Oh My God! If I Could Just Be Their Champion. They Are So Misunderstood' \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n Jennifer Lawrence Says 'I Turned Down' Tarantino's 'Hateful Eight' Offer and Then Lost 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' Role After the 'Internet Went Out of Its Way to Call Me Ugly'\n\n“Gambit” is truly the sort of film best viewed on the back seat of a plane, where thin recycled air and poor-quality headphones could at least excuse its inability to elicit laughs. Although all the trappings of a comedy are present — an insistently jocular soundtrack, setpieces involving farting, hoity-toity types and missing trousers, and near-racist depictions of gurning Asian characters — it’s as if someone sucked nearly all the humorous oxygen out of the project, leaving nothing but inert, punchline-free setups.\n\nAdvance word has made much of the fact that this is the first film the Coens have written but not directed themselves since 1985’s “Crimewave.” However, auds drawn by the siblings’ name (touted prominently in the U.K. publicity materials) will be hard-pressed to discern their authorial signature here, apart from the script’s fondness for wackily exotic names, a few stretches of showily overwritten dialogue and a slightly misanthropic streak that’s been displayed with more sharpness and flair in their other films.\n\nFrom the animated credits sequence onward, this long-gestating passion project for producer Mike Lobell feels much more rooted in the sensibility of those affably flyweight Euro-set crime movies of the 1960s, such as Ronald Neame‘s original “Gambit,” the first “Pink Panther” (1963) pic, “The Italian Job” (1969), or indeed nearly anything with Herbert Lom. The national stereotypes are so ludicrously broad, they almost cheerfully evoke an earlier, less PC era when Brits were nearly always stuffy, prissy or overbearing, Americans were practical-minded vulgarian louts, and the Japanese were duplicitous cheats hiding behind polite smiles and lost-in-translation insults. If this was the Coens’ idea of funny, either they’re playing a much slyer metatextual game than appears on the surface, or something went very wrong along the way.\n\nThe plot revolves around a scheme hatched by mild-mannered art expert Harry Deane (Firth), who, with the help of a forger known only as the Major (Tom Courtenay), plans to con his ferociously rude billionaire boss, Shabandar (Alan Rickman), into buying a forged Monet painting. In order to pull off the grift, Deane must recruit PJ Puznowski (Cameron Diaz), a Texan chicken-plucker and part-time rodeo star whose grandfather had a possible connection to the painting’s last known whereabouts. Naturally, things don’t go according to the plan Deane has in his head, shown in a fantasy sequence that keeps PJ from uttering a word of dialogue for roughly 10 minutes after she’s introduced, a strange device stolen straight from the 1966 version.\n\nAt least that earlier film, for all its daftness, had a certain tautness of structure. This one, whose plot is quite different despite also involving Englishmen with art-fraud ambitions, is all over the place, internally illogical above and beyond the call of slapstick farce, and willfully flat in execution. Only one scene generates real yuks, a fine bit of nonsense in which Deane and PJ argue in front of two desk clerks at the Savoy, their every line misunderstood to have a smuttier meaning than they actually intend. It’s almost as if everything else had been built around that one scene, but never thought through with as much care.\n\nIt’s certainly Firth and Diaz’s finest moment in a film that neither stretches their talents nor flatters their reputations, and their lack of chemistry (Diaz sparks much more satisfyingly with Rickman) drains what little rooting interest the characters’ putative romance might have generated. Helming and tech credits are likewise lackluster, if serviceable.",
