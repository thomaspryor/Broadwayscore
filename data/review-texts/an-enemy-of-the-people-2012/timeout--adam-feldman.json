  "bwwExcerpt": "In this regard, Gold’s An Enemy of the People—notwithstanding its 19th-century costumes (by David Zinn) and sets (by the design collective dots) and elaborate period business (the loading of pipes, the heating of drinks, the lighting and snuffing of lamps)—feels pointedly modern, a quality that is brought to the fore in the production’s pivotal scene: a public meeting at which Stockmann tries to share his findings directly with the populace. The scene takes place after a short intermission during which members of the audience go onstage for free shots of aquavit at a shiny modern bar stamped with the logo of the brand providing the liquor. Breaking from the cozy naturalism of the production’s first half, Gold introduces elements of environmental theater: He brings up the house lights and treats the audience as part of the meeting; the characters address us directly, and a few spectators are even seated onstage to pad out the crowd. Circle in the Square’s in-the-round seating plan is ideal for this scene, a public square within a circle of observers.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt focuses on praising directorial choices and staging innovation ('pointedly modern', 'ideal for this scene'). However, with only one curated excerpt available, confidence is low as the full review verdict is unknown. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights innovative staging and a modern feel, suggesting a positive take on the production. However, without a full verdict or rating, the confidence is low. | Gemini: The review describes the production's staging and choices, but doesn't offer a clear recommendation for or against seeing it. It highlights the modern feel and environmental theater elements, suggesting a mixed or neutral assessment. | Kimi: The single excerpt offers mild appreciation for the environmental staging and modern directorial approach, but lacks clear recommendation language or overall assessment of the production's quality, warranting caution per the single-excerpt warning.",
