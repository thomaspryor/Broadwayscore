And, in an evening marked by performativity on both sides of the limelight, how unbelievably corny of the production to make Strong angrily toss leftover shot glasses into a trash pile after the town hall scene, as if to implicate and condemn the audience for having drank during his trials.",

However, with only one excerpt, the full sentiment is unclear, leading to a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt expresses disappointment with a specific production choice, calling it \"unbelievably corny.\" Given the single excerpt and negative tone, I'm placing it in the negative bucket with low confidence. | Kimi: Extracted from malformed response",
