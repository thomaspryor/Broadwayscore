  "bwwExcerpt": "Rebecca Lenkiewicz has transformed Henrik Ibsen’s 1882 play “An Enemy of the People,” an insightful work about the cost of free expression, into a coherent, topical, and thrilling piece that pokes and prods at our own moral fiber. Expertly realized by director Doug Hughes, the production succeeds on merit instead of flashiness or celebrity—with an outstanding cast of theater veterans led by Richard Thomas and Boyd Gaines—and causes us to question just how far we are willing to go to stand up for",
