However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The excerpt uses negative language like \"lacking restraint\" and \"amped-up\" to describe the production, suggesting a negative review. Given the single excerpt, confidence is low. | Kimi: The excerpt explicitly criticizes the production for lacking restraint and being excessively broad, indicating disappointment with the revival's amped-up approach. With only one excerpt available, the confidence is low, but the sentiment is clearly negative.",
