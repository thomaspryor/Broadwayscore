  "bwwExcerpt": "While Gold’s revivals of the classics have tended to be less consistent than his incisive work on new plays — the ensembles of his King Lear and Hamlet both seemed at times to be all acting in different productions — his uniformly excellent cast here is very much on the same page, many of them doubling as singers and musicians in the scene transitions.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows clear praise for the cast as 'uniformly excellent' and notes the production's cohesion, but with only one curated quote available, the full review sentiment remains uncertain. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the cast as 'uniformly excellent' and highlights their cohesive performance, indicating a strong positive recommendation. However, due to the single excerpt warning, confidence is low. | Gemini: The review excerpt praises the cast as \"uniformly excellent,\" which suggests a positive recommendation. However, the limited text and mention of inconsistencies in previous revivals suggest some reservations, so I'm scoring it as positive but with lower confidence. | Kimi: The excerpt offers unqualified praise for the cast as 'uniformly excellent' and well-coordinated, suggesting a strong positive assessment of this revival production despite the critic's reservations about the director's previous work.",
