But then he claims, self-servingly, that “the majority is the most insidious enemy to freedom.” So much for democracy.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Mixed | Claude: Single excerpt shows nuanced view - praises actor's use of sympathy capital and acknowledges noble character intentions, but ends critically questioning the character's anti-democratic stance. With only one curated quote available, this appears mixed rather than clearly positive or negative. | GPT-4o: The excerpt provides a mixed view of the character's portrayal, initially sympathetic but ultimately self-serving. The lack of a clear positive or negative recommendation suggests a mixed verdict. | Gemini: The review excerpt focuses on a single actor's performance and a specific line from the play, offering a somewhat neutral assessment. It doesn't provide a clear recommendation for or against seeing the show, suggesting a mixed reaction. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the actor's ability to generate audience sympathy and portrays complex character work, but criticizes the character's philosophical stance ('self-servingly,' 'So much for democracy'), suggesting the show's political handling may be problematic. With only one excerpt available, the overall verdict remains unclear.",
