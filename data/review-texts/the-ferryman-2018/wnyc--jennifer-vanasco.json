  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Butterworth's new family drama is an explosive, immersive experience that manages to be both mythic in scope and yet completely grounded in the everyday. It's a finely crafted piece of writing and an extraordinarily well-realized production...A warm, funny and poignant set of overlapping and interwoven tales that combine into a bountiful tapestry...Mendes creates an almost cinematic realism here, despite a few supernatural elements...This production is extraordinary — don't miss it.\"\n\nRead more",
