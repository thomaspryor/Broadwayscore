  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Raucous shenanigans aside, lurking behind every plot twist and poetic monologue are fresh and fermented Irish Republican issues...Characters range from infant to elderly, the latter a trio of diverse siblings...Brilliantly directed by Sam Mendes, daybreak comes on an intimate scene between Quinn and his sister-in-law Caitlin...The interaction morphs into a trickle of family and others until the stage bursts with food, music, whiskey, dance, lust, fury, sadness, and danger.”\n\nRead more",
