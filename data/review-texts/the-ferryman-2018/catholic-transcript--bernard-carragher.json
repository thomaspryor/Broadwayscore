  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Butterworth’s ‘The Ferryman’ is the most important drama to emerge on Broadway in many seasons, not merely because of its innate theatrical excitement, but it is also a major work for its talented author...What makes ‘The Ferryman’ crackle are the tough tensions Butterworth imposes on his play. Scene after scene, the play never abates and it has brilliantly detailed staging...Magnificently acted by a flawless ensemble...One of the stunning dramas of our time.”\n\nRead more",
