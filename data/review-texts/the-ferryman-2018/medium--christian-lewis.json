  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"While the cast size, run time, and setting of the play may feel new, just about everything else feels perhaps too familiar...Despite the play’s potentially formulaic nature and stereotypical characters, it is still quite a gripping drama. The play includes an almost never-ending exposition , but it has some pay off of emotional drama in the third act, not to mention a very sudden climax...Although the play serves a large heap of drama, it does not feel new, nor does it justify its size or length.\" \n\nRead more",
