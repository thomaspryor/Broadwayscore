  "showScoreExcerpt": "“A raucous family comedy, a melodrama of forbidden love, a political thriller, and a classic tragedy lamenting the sins of fathers, all in one...Donnelly is just one member of the strongest large cast in a Broadway production in years...Considine has perhaps the largest challenge in playing Quinn...But the fault lies with Butterworth, not with Considine who is electric...A truly universal tragedy, grounded in a thousand brilliantly observed details...Intensely gutsy and vital.”\n\nRead more",
