  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"For those who relish enormously satisfying plays stuffed with full-blooded characters, the successor to the throne has arrived. The Ferryman...should be on your must-see list...Monologues, from comedic to tragic, occasionally mystical and often jarringly intense, are riveting throughout...Directed by Sam Mendes, the production is first-rate. The acting is uniformly superb...It will touch your heart, stimulate your brain and maybe even provide a mirror for societal reflection.\"\n\nRead more",
