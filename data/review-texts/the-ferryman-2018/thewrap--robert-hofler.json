  "bwwExcerpt": "'The Ferryman' moves like an express, in part because we see its oars churning, even those that are borrowed. There's nothing subtle about it, and that includes most of the big, broad and often very busy performances that the Tony Awards like to honor. Where 'The Ferryman' enters a totally original space is its thrilling third act, when those Corcoran nephews take center stage to recall attending Bobby Sands' funeral and falling under the influence the IRA.",
