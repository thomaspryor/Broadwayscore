The cast...is impeccable...The actor’s movements are choreographed in perfect harmony capturing the bucolic life of a rural Irish family...A monumental piece of theater...A thrilling drama of crime and passion...The humor is dark, the sentiment is light, and the suffering runs deep within the characters souls...One of the must-see productions of season.”\n\nRead more",
