  "showScoreExcerpt": "“’Ferryman’ is a well laid out story. The play takes the audience on an emotional rollercoaster...Butterworth does a masterful job in giving us each and every character throughout the show. The play is as funny as it is poignant; confrontational as it is enlightening...It is well written, directed, and acted, it stands high above the rest. The story's plot line is the conflict of the Carney family and the IRA, but it is more then that, much more...A gripping masterpiece.”\n\nRead more",
