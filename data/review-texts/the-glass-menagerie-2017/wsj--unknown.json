  "bwwExcerpt": "The director of a new production of Tennessee Williams's \"The Glass Menagerie,\" Sam Gold, might be considered a dramaturgical counterpart to Laura Wingfield, the slight, limping dreamer of the play who spends her days playing with glass figurines. The playwright writes of Laura: \"She is like a piece of her own glass collection, too exquisitely fragile to move from the shelf.\" She lives with her illusions because reality is too painful.",
