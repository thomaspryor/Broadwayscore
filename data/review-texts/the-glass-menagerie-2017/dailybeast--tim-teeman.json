  "bwwExcerpt": "Every immaculately crafted moment of Sam Gold's staging of Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie rings as clear as it does true. There is no reason to close your eyes, but you could, and the actors' beautiful enunciation and encapsulation of Williams's words would be as pleasurable as the best radio play...When characters are not in scenes directly they observe them or sit a little away from them. The psychologically astute implication is that they are present in spirit, or will be affected by whatever is unfolding. This is Williams as seen at his most pared-back. The comedy, and there is much-Field revels in her baiting as much as Mantello in his curdling distaste for her-is hearty rather than camp, like bitter but delectable dregs of cold coffee.",
