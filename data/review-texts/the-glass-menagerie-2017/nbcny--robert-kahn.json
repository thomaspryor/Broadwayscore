  "bwwExcerpt": "The sad St. Louis clan is back again, in a production starring Sally Field as its faded matriarch. This newest 'Menagerie,' helmed by director Sam Gold ('Fun Home') and now open at the Belasco Theatre, could not be more different from the one we last saw...Gold puts his stamp on 'Menagerie' with both hyper-realistic elements and a minimalist set so barren it can only leave us to focus on the actors-the juxtaposition of styles makes this 'Menagerie' as interesting as any I've seen.",
