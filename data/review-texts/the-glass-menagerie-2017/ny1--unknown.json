  "bwwExcerpt": "...what Gold has devised is quite confounding. Part of the problem is that his directorial decisions are so radical in some cases they take the audience out of the play's poetic reverie. The decision to cast a young disabled actress to play the painfully shy Laura puts the emphasis on the character's physical handicap, when in fact it's Laura's extreme insecurities that make her life tragic. And the play's text refers to her 'walking,' but that makes no sense as presented here.",
