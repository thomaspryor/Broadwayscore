  "bwwExcerpt": "If it's more of an inquest than a definitive statement, it's an inquest at a very high level; Sally Field, who plays Amanda, does not appear in basement black-box theaters. So Gold is performing a tricky balancing act: narrowing the scope of the representation and maintaining his cutting-edge cred while selling the story to an audience of 1,000. One of the casualties of this approach is what Tom calls 'the social background' of the play. We lose not just the particular St. Louisness of it (the accents are nearly nil) but also the world-on-edge tension that Tom describes at the start: Guernica exploding in Europe, and, in America, 'the fiery braille alphabet of a dissolving economy.' Instead Gold focuses on a novel and largely convincing interpretation of the family's warfare as a symptom of the powerful but constraining love they share, and on the way both things shape Tom's character deep into the future from which he narrates.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The critic describes the production as having 'distortion and intensity' in a fever dream comparison, which suggests a bold, impactful interpretation rather than criticism. However, with only one excerpt available, confidence is low as this could be setup rather than verdict. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests a unique interpretation of the play, described as a 'fever dream' with 'distortion and intensity.' This indicates a departure from the traditional, which could be seen as either a positive or negative, leading to a mixed verdict. The lack of additional context or clear recommendation results in a low confidence score. | Gemini: The excerpt uses evocative language (\"fever dream\", \"distortion\", \"intensity\") suggesting a positive, albeit potentially unsettling, experience. Given the limited text, I'm placing it in the lower end of the Positive range. | Kimi: The excerpt describes stylistic choices (fever dream aesthetic, distortion) that depart from the play's traditional form without clear evaluative language indicating approval or disapproval, making the overall verdict ambiguous given only this single curated quote. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Mixed",
