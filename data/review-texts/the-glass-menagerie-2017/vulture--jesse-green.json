    "reasoning": "[ensemble-no-consensus] | Adjacent bucket split (Positive/Mixed) - using median score | Claude: The excerpt describes the production as having 'distortion and intensity' in a way that suggests intentional artistic vision rather than criticism. The 'fever dream' comparison implies heightened theatrical experience, which is typically positive for drama criticism. | GPT-4o: The excerpt suggests an intense and possibly unconventional take on the play, which could be interpreted as either a positive or negative depending on execution. Without more context, it seems to imply a mixed experience. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests an intense and distorted production, which leans towards a positive, albeit potentially unsettling, experience. Given the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: Single curated excerpt describes the production as a 'fever dream' with 'distortion and intensity'—language that suggests a bold, surreal approach but lacks clear evaluative markers of success or failure. Without additional context to determine if this transformation is praised or criticized, the verdict remains uncertain. | Buckets: claude=Positive, openai=Mixed, gemini=Positive, kimi=Mixed",
