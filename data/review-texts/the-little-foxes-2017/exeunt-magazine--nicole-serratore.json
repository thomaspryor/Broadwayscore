  "showScoreExcerpt": "“With Cynthia Nixon and Laura Linney swapping the central roles in repertory, Hellman’s play still has much to show us about ourselves…With just enough exposition and the carefully drawn performances of Linney and Nixon, these women are vividly complex…Nixon plays Regina smooth and steely. No histrionics or even raised voices…The cast is strong across the board, providing all the ballast the play needs to keep the tension between the family members taut.”\n\nRead more",
