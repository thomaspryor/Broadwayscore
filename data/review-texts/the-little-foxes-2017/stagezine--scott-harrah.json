  "showScoreExcerpt": "“It is so intricately constructed, timeless, and a classic…An outstanding revival…The true beauty of the show is how Ms. Hellman’s story holds up nearly 80 years after it was first mounted…The show is flawlessly directed, designed and acted. Laura Linney as Regina is evil incarnate, and Cynthia as Birdie Huddard, Regina’s sister-in-law, is the charm that was the South…Richard Thomas is simply wonderful…One of the year’s best revivals.”\n\nRead more",
