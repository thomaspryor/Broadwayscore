  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Daniel Sullivan directs a strong cast with actors that let their characters build, especially in a sizzling second half. Richard Thomas is outstanding...While Laura Linney and Cynthia Nixon both shine in their roles, it is easy to imagine them alternating as Regina and Birdie. 'The Little Foxes' is a well-crafted thriller by Lillian Hellman and beautifully delivered at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre. It is a show that is tempting to see again.\" \n\nRead more",
