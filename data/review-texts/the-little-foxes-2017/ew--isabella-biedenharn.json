  "bwwExcerpt": "An interesting thing is happening at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre: all-stars Laura Linney (The Big C) and Cynthia Nixon (Sex and the City) are alternating the roles of headstrong, conniving Regina Giddens and meek, abused Birdie Hubbard in the Manhattan Theater Club's revival of Lillian Hellman's 1939 play The Little Foxes. In theory, it's a fascinating experiment-especially for theatergoers who have the resources to see both versions of the show, as I was able to. But in practice, one pairing has just a bit more magic in it than the other.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"Linney shines in the role of Regina, her deep voice and deceptive dimples perfectly suited for the character’s commanding presence...Perhaps Nixon seems like the lesser Regina only because she is so brilliant as Birdie...Of course, this repertory-style casting demands comparison of the two stars, and Nixon’s Regina and Linney’s Birdie are in no way disappointing. It’s still a treat to watch these masters at play, along with the rest of the vibrant cast.\"\n\nRead more"
