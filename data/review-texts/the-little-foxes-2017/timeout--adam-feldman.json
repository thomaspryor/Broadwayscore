    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic's own 80 rating clearly indicates positive recommendation territory. The text praises 'powerhouse performances' but appears heavily truncated with no full critical assessment. | Gemini: The review is short, but the phrase \"powerhouse performances\" and the original rating of 80 suggest a positive, but not rave, review. Confidence is low due to the brevity of the review. | Kimi: The provided original rating of 80 falls squarely in the Positive range (70-84), and the available text offers strong praise for the lead performances. However, confidence is low as this appears to be a truncated excerpt or blurb rather than a complete review.",
