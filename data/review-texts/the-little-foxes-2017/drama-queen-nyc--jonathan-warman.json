  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Easily the most entertaining serious play I’ve seen so far this Broadway season…The night I saw it, Linney was a steely marvel as Regina, and Nixon heartbreakingly vulnerable and sincere as Birdie...Sullivan has crafted a production so rock-solid, and intelligently observed in its details, that any skilled actor would feel secure and supported…The supporting cast is every bit as potent as the leads…A ripping yarn and this production gives that full play. Highly recommended.”\n\nRead more",
