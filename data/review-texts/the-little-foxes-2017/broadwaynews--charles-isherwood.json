  "bwwExcerpt": "The director Daniel Sullivan's succulent new Broadway revival of the play, a Manhattan Theatre Club production at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre, cannot erase its tints of both moralizing and melodrama. But it proves once again that Hellman's 1939 drama is also redoubtably enduring entertainment, a theatrically effective indictment of human greed and its destructive power.",
