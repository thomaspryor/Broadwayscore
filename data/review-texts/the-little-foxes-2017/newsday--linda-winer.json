  "bwwExcerpt": "The next time anyone challenges the need to have nonprofit Broadway houses alongside the commercial theaters, I'm going to shout out, 'The Little Foxes.' It's possible to imagine a profit-motivated producer deciding to stage Lillian Hellman's 1939 drama about a greedy Southern family these days if a megastar - recall Elizabeth Taylor in 1981 - wanted to claw her way through the carnivorous role of Regina Giddens, the Cruella of small-town 1900 society. But the nonprofit Manhattan Theatre Club has not merely dared to cast Laura Linney and Cynthia Nixon - sublimely intelligent actors, but hardly summer tourist-bait - to play grasping, glamorous Regina and her mousy, quietly alcoholic sister-in-law Birdie Hubbard in the company's Broadway venue. To complicate matters deliciously, the two are alternating roles equally through the run.",
