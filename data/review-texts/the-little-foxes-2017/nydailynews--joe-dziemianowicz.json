  "bwwExcerpt": "Under Daniel Sullivan's sure-handed direction, the show satisfies no matter who's playing Regina - more or less. The production's good-looking - costumes, lighting and the set, which underscores this prickly family. Notice there's no comfy couch that invites getting close, just chairs and a chaise. Supporting actors more than ably step up, including Richard Thomas as Regina's ill husband, Michael McKean and Darren Goldstein as her greedy brothers, Francesca Carpanini as her dutiful daughter, and Michael Benz as her creepy nephew.",
