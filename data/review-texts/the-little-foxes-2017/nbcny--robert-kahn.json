  "bwwExcerpt": "Both prove to be equally effective in either role - a sign of each actress' talent and the production's overall perfection. Regina's is the meatier part with the most stage time, storing through all three acts. Birdie's one truly memorable appearance occurs at the start of the third act, with a touching speech about how rarely she's experienced happiness. As they change, so do the supporting characters around them. Richard Thomas delivers a particularly physical performance as Horace, who sees the world with the clarity of a dying man. His moves to punish Regina's ambition read more vengeful with Linney, and more controlling with Nixon.",
