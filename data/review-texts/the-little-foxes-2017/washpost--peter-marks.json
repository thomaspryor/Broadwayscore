  "bwwExcerpt": "For both of these actresses, that would be the suppleness of Regina's mind. Her survivor's gift for staying one diabolical step ahead of the men - who would cheat her in a lucrative deal over a cotton mill - makes her more than a cardboard evildoer. That impression is encouraged in the performances of the men, who also include Oscar and Birdie's sniveling son, Leo (Michael Benz, wearing entitlement like a fitted shirt). McKean's Ben is a subtle demon, Goldstein's Oscar a more transparently brutish one. Thomas, as the mortally ill family truthteller, contributes a grand turn as the requisite voice of rectitude.",
