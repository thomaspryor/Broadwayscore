  "showScoreExcerpt": "“Laura Linney’s Regina makes Southern gentility organic without losing the character’s edge. Imperiousness fits like a bespoke glove, avarice is palpable. So much emotion is internalized, however, one misses flashes…Cynthia Nixon inhabits Birdie from the moment she enthusiastically flutters onstage...Altogether splendid. Director Daniel Sullivan excels at this kind of solid drama. His characters exist naturally and, for the most part, distinctively.”\n\nRead more",
