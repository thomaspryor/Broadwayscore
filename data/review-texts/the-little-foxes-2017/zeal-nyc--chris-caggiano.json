  "showScoreExcerpt": "“‘The Little Foxes’ is a bit of a guilty pleasure. It’s a preachy, creaky, potboiler of a play, with starkly drawn two-dimensional characters, bald-faced moralizing, and not a single note of subtlety. But it’s just so much fun to watch…The current production plays as if director Daniel Sullivan was trying for realism, when the play benefits from more of a melodramatic tone. The production has too many soft edges, and the scenes are often under-energized.”\n\nRead more",
