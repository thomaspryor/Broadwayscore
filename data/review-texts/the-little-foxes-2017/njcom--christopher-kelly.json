  "bwwExcerpt": "For the most part, Linney resists the high-camp dudgeon that Davis brought to the movie, opting for a more psychologically grounded Regina. But while that's a laudable choice, it also drains the proceedings of some potential electricity -- a matter compounded by Sullivan's steady, but restrained pacing. This 'Little Foxes,' with its predictably handsome set and costume design (by Scott Pask and Jane Greenwood, respectively) evoking a sense of faded Southern glory, never quite gets the pulse racing.",
