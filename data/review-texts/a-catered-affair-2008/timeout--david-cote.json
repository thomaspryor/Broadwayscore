Language is balanced - 'solid' and 'admirable work' are positive, but 'predictable' and 'unmemorable' are clear limitations. | GPT-4o: The critic's original rating of 60 aligns with a mixed review, as does the text which describes the book as 'solid, if predictable' and the score as 'pleasant but unmemorable'. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (solid book, admirable cast) but tempers it with criticism (predictable, unmemorable score), leading to a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The review offers qualified praise for the book and cast but criticizes the score as unmemorable, aligning with the critic's own 60/100 rating that indicates a mixed, middle-of-the-road assessment.",
