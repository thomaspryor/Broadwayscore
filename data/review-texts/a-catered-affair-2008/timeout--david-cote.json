Language is carefully neutral - 'solid' but 'predictable,' 'admirable work' but 'unmemorable score' - indicating neither recommendation nor discouragement. | GPT-4o: The review describes the book as 'solid, if predictable' and the score as 'pleasant but unmemorable', indicating a balanced view without strong recommendation or discouragement. | Gemini: The review acknowledges positive aspects (solid book, admirable cast) but tempers it with criticism (predictable, unmemorable score), leading to a mixed assessment. | Kimi: The review acknowledges competent execution but criticizes the score as unmemorable and the book as predictable, indicating a middling assessment consistent with the 60/100 rating provided.",
