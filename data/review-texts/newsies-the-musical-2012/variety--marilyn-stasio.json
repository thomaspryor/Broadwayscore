However, the lack of superlatives or a strong must-see endorsement suggests some reservations. | Gemini: The review is positive, calling the show \"spirited\" and saying it has enough \"pizzazz\" to charm audiences. The phrase \"old-fashioned\" implies some reservations, but the overall tone is positive. | Kimi: The critic offers a clear recommendation highlighting the show's energy and charm, specifically noting it will appeal to families and tourists, though the praise is solid rather than ecstatic.",
