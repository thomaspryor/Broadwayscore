  "dtliExcerpt": "Time was, when a dreamy kid felt oppressed, the allure of running away to join the circus would fire the imagination. An American myth, or sentimental lore, probably. But in the new musical “Water for Elephants,” ostensibly set in a seedy, second-rate circus, running off to join the crew would seem to be little more rebellious than joining an unusually boisterous Boy Scout troop.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "Still, the largely pasteurized manner in which the musical depicts the often-sordid lives of circus folk of the period lends “Water for Elephants” an anodyne weightlessness, at least until the denouement. I’m not sure if a more faithful adaptation of the book would make for a better musical—although John Kander and Fred Ebb, in their heyday, might have taken a good crack at it—but it certainly would have made for a more provocative and adventurous one.",
