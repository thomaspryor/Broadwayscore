  "dtliExcerpt": "Time was, when a dreamy kid felt oppressed, the allure of running away to join the circus would fire the imagination. An American myth, or sentimental lore, probably. But in the new musical “Water for Elephants,” ostensibly set in a seedy, second-rate circus, running off to join the crew would seem to be little more rebellious than joining an unusually boisterous Boy Scout troop.",

  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"this musical adaptation of the hit novel loses much of its sourceâs pungency and grit.\"",
  "bwwExcerpt": "Still, the largely pasteurized manner in which the musical depicts the often-sordid lives of circus folk of the period lends “Water for Elephants” an anodyne weightlessness, at least until the denouement. I’m not sure if a more faithful adaptation of the book would make for a better musical—although John Kander and Fred Ebb, in their heyday, might have taken a good crack at it—but it certainly would have made for a more provocative and adventurous one.",

While not outright negative, the tone suggests disappointment with missed opportunities for a more provocative adaptation. | Gemini: The review states that the musical \"loses much of its source’s pungency and grit\" and describes it as having \"anodyne weightlessness.\" This indicates a negative assessment. | Kimi: The critic finds the musical loses the novel's 'pungency and grit' and criticizes its 'anodyne weightlessness,' but the heavily truncated text may omit redeeming qualities or a final recommendation.",
