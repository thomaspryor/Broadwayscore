  "bwwExcerpt": "Still, the largely pasteurized manner in which the musical depicts the often-sordid lives of circus folk of the period lends “Water for Elephants” an anodyne weightlessness, at least until the denouement. I’m not sure if a more faithful adaptation of the book would make for a better musical—although John Kander and Fred Ebb, in their heyday, might have taken a good crack at it—but it certainly would have made for a more provocative and adventurous one.",
  "showScoreExcerpt": "\"this musical adaptation of the hit novel loses much of its sourceâs pungency and grit.\"",
