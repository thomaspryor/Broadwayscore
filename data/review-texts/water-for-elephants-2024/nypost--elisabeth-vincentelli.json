  "bwwExcerpt": "Not everything works in Jessica Stone’s production — there’s a reason the words “dream sequence” tend to set off alarm bells — but at least it summons a coherent theatrical universe. And more often than not, the show (whose world premiere was this past June in Atlanta) captures the unabashed mix of romance and pathos that made its source material, a bestseller by Sara Gruen, so wildly popular.",

The aggregator's 'flat' verdict supports a mixed classification. | Gemini: The review excerpt suggests the show has some positive qualities (exuberance) but is lacking in others (wit, character).
