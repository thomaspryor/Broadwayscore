  "bwwExcerpt": "Post-War Horse, large-scale puppetry on Broadway is expected to wow. When the titular elephant makes her entrance at the end of the first act, she appears undersized, and there’s no life in her blank eyes. The circus and the theatre may have a lot in common, but there’s little of the thrill of either here.",

However, this is only one excerpt so scoring conservatively within negative range. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the production's key element, the puppetry, as underwhelming and lacking excitement, leading to a negative recommendation. | Gemini: The review excerpt expresses disappointment with a key element of the show, the elephant puppet, and states that the production lacks the thrill of both circus and theatre. This suggests a negative overall assessment.",
