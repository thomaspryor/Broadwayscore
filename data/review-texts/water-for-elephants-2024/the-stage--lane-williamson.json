  "bwwExcerpt": "Post-War Horse, large-scale puppetry on Broadway is expected to wow. When the titular elephant makes her entrance at the end of the first act, she appears undersized, and there’s no life in her blank eyes. The circus and the theatre may have a lot in common, but there’s little of the thrill of either here.",
