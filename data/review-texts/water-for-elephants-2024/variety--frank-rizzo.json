  "fullText": "Ever feel like running away from home to join a musical? Then \"Water for Elephants\" would be the show of choice that offers escapism, enchantment and heart — and thrills, too.\n\nBased on Sara Green's 2006 bestseller, the show premiered last year at Atlanta's Alliance Theatre and elevates the musical to new and literal heights with its seamless integration of theatrical and cirque artistry.",
  "bwwExcerpt": "For followers of the book and film, the climactic moment on stage remains equally thrilling — and the most creative stampede since the wildebeest run in “The Lion King” (whose co-producer Peter Schneider is also top-lined here). This underdog circus troupe may promote its entertainment as “Benzini Brothers’ Most Spectacular Show on Earth,” but for this rube’s nickels, “Water for Elephants” could be the greatest show on Broadway.",
