Clear pan despite brevity. | GPT-4o: The review uses strong negative language ('hot holy mess') and implies a very poor experience ('not in a good way'), indicating a strongly negative verdict. | Gemini: The review describes the show as a \"hot holy mess\" and says it makes you want to \"speak in tongues — and not in a good way.\" This is a strongly negative assessment, placing it in the Pan bucket. | Kimi: The critic delivers a devastatingly negative verdict using the phrase 'hot holy mess' and explicitly states the experience is 'not in a good way,' offering no redeeming qualities.",
