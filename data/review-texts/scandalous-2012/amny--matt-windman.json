  "bwwExcerpt": "The Tony Award for fearless determination - if such a thing actually existed, ought to go to Kathie Lee Gifford. She has been developing and promoting her musical 'Scandalous: The Life and Trials of Aimee Semple McPherson' - for which she wrote the lyrics, book and even some of the music - for more than a decade…'Scandalous' is like a combination of 'Leap of Faith,' another musical about an evangelist, which flopped last spring, and 'Chaplin,' also a bland bio musical...The score - the work of no less than three composers - mainly consists of generic samplings from various genres: Irish jig, beer hall anthem, tambourine-shaking prayer and so on…Carolee Carmello, who has spent the past few years alternating between the tryouts of 'Scandalous' and stints in 'Mamma Mia!,' throws all of her dramatic and vocal intensity into the role, but it is an off-putting, aggressive performance.",
