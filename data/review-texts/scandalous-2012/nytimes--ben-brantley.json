No recommendation implied. | GPT-4o: The review criticizes the show for lacking coherence and not being satisfying, indicating a negative recommendation. | Gemini: The review states that the show doesn't add up to a satisfying whole, but it also mentions flashy moments, indicating a mixed experience. | Kimi: The critic describes the show as incoherent and unsatisfying, comparing it to a 'grab bag' of disconnected flashy moments.
