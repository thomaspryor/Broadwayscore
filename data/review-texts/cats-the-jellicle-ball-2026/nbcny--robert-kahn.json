  "bwwExcerpt": "'Cats' is full of catchy pop tunes many of us have known for decades. Webber's songs don't have the tightest of melodies, but I'll take 'Cats' over 'School of Rock' any day. As a wistful recollection, 'Cats' is guaranteed to leave you feline groovy-it's here now, though I wouldn't bet on it lasting forever.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Single excerpt shows qualified positive recommendation ('guaranteed to leave you feline groovy') with reservations about melody and longevity. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The review excerpt expresses a positive sentiment with phrases like 'feline groovy,' but also includes reservations about the show's longevity and melody tightness. The single excerpt and lack of a full review limit confidence. | Gemini: The review is generally positive, highlighting the catchy tunes and nostalgic appeal. However, the comment about its limited run suggests a reservation, placing it in the lower end of the positive range. | Kimi: The critic offers a qualified recommendation, praising the catchy tunes and guaranteeing a groovy experience while noting the melodies aren't the tightest and questioning the show's longevity. The preference over 'School of Rock' indicates a clear, if tempered, endorsement.",
