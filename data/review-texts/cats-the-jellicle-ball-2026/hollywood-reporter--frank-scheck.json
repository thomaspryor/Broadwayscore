  "bwwExcerpt": "Although it remains to be seen whether this revival will live up to the original production's tagline of 'Now and Forever,' enough time has passed for a new generation of theatergoers to embrace the show, while those who saw the original (and liked it) will probably want to return for a blast of nostalgia. And with the dramatic upturn in tourists to the Big Apple in recent years, there's no reason to think that this Cats won't be purring on Broadway for a very long time.",
