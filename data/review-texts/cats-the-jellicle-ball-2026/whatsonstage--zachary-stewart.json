  "bwwExcerpt": "It’s unexpectedly poignant, yes. But more importantly, it’s so much fun. We feel that from the moment the cats vogue down the runway (authentic and death-droppingly athletic choreography by Omari Wiles and Arturo Lyons). The crowd goes nuts, cheering, clapping, and clacking fans in appreciation, making this event feel like a real ball.",

Single excerpt warning applies - using upper end of Positive bucket due to unqualified praise, but low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt highlights the show's fun and engaging atmosphere, with enthusiastic audience reactions. The positive tone suggests a strong recommendation, despite the limited context. | Gemini: The review excerpt is overwhelmingly positive, describing the show as \"unexpectedly poignant\" and \"so much fun\". The audience reaction is also described as enthusiastic, indicating a highly enjoyable experience. | Kimi: The excerpt offers enthusiastic praise ('so much fun', 'death-droppingly athletic') and describes strong audience engagement, indicating a clear recommendation, though confidence is reduced due to availability of only a single curated excerpt.",
