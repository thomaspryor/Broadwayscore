  "bwwExcerpt": "It's kitschy and fun, sometimes quite touching, and marvelously well done. It'll likely be very nostalgic for anyone who saw the show before, and, I'm guessing, a treat for people who haven't, and don't go expecting a profound theatrical experience. 'Cats' is a one-of-a-kind entertainment, and I can't imagine a young, budding theater-lover, in particular, not being entranced.",
