    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Pan | Claude: This is a scathing dismissal that mocks both the show and its audience. The critic offers no redeeming qualities and frames the revival's existence as proof of universally bad taste. | GPT-4o: The review is strongly negative, mocking the show's enduring popularity and implying poor taste in music. There are no redeeming qualities mentioned. | Gemini: The review is clearly negative, suggesting that the new production is just as bad as the original. The tone is sarcastic and critical. | Kimi: The critic uses sarcasm to condemn both the original and this revival as exercises in 'bad taste,' offering no redeeming qualities about the production. The extreme brevity suggests this may be an excerpt, but the available text delivers an unambiguous negative verdict.",

  "bwwExcerpt": "“Appropriate” is the dirtiest word in the arts today, and one might feel sorry for Lloyd Webber for having his material spayed in this way by directors Zhailon Levingston and Bill Rauch. In fact, the only thing that makes this “Cats” worth watching is the ballroom environment of high and low drag that has been dropped like a bottle of Pooph odor eliminator onto Lloyd Webber’s litter box of a musical.
