  "bwwExcerpt": "Directed by Trevor Nunn, and choreographed by the great Gillian Lynne, this Cats remains an evening of fluff and nonsense, really, with leg-warmers and cutesy costumes that should be risible to a cynic's eyes. Yet such is the innate confidence and innocent zest of this bizarre, feline spectacle that all cynicism just moults away.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic acknowledges the show's flaws ('fluff and nonsense', 'cutesy costumes that should be risible') but ultimately finds it charming and effective ('all cynicism just moults away'). Single excerpt limits confidence. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges the show as 'fluff and nonsense' but ultimately describes it positively, noting its 'innate confidence and innocent zest' that dispels cynicism. The single excerpt suggests a mildly positive view, but the lack of full context lowers confidence. | Gemini: The review acknowledges the show's flaws but ultimately suggests that its charm and energy overcome them, leading to a positive, albeit qualified, recommendation. | Kimi: While acknowledging the show is 'fluff and nonsense' that 'should be risible,' the critic's verdict is that the production's confidence and zest completely overcome skepticism ('all cynicism just moults away'), constituting a clear recommendation. Score reflects upper Positive range per single-excerpt guidance for clearly positive quotes.",
