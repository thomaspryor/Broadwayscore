    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 3 models agree: Positive | Claude: The critic calls the play 'clever' which is positive evaluative language, but this appears to be a very brief excerpt with limited evaluative content about the production itself. | Gemini: The review calls the play \"clever\", which is a positive assessment. The phrase \"proves that racial tensions in America remain as fraught as ever\" suggests the play is thought-provoking and relevant, further supporting a positive classification. | Kimi: Brief excerpt offers clear praise ('clever') and validates the play's thematic impact, indicating a solid recommendation despite limited detail.",
