  "bwwExcerpt": "Director Pam McKinnon keeps things crackling with her sharp direction, and the top-notch cast has further refined its comic timing. The standout remains Frank Wood, who makes the seething Russ into the play’s sole multidimensional character and has found a way to register Dan with greater force than before...Ultimately, “Clybourne Park” entertains without ever unsettling.",

    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: Praises direction and cast performances but concludes the show 'entertains without ever unsettling,' suggesting it's enjoyable but doesn't fully achieve its dramatic potential. Single excerpt limits confidence in overall verdict. | GPT-4o: The review praises the direction and cast, particularly Frank Wood, but notes the play entertains without being unsettling. The single excerpt suggests a positive but not strongly enthusiastic verdict. | Gemini: The review praises the direction, cast, and a specific performance, but notes that the play \"entertains without ever unsettling,\" suggesting a lack of deeper impact. Given the single excerpt, I'm scoring it as a positive with reservations. | Kimi: The excerpt praises the sharp direction and top-notch performances but qualifies the recommendation with the final verdict that the production entertains without achieving the play's intended unsettling impact, suggesting a mildly positive assessment based on this single curated excerpt.",
