    "reasoning": "[ensemble-unanimous] | All 4 models agree: Positive | Claude: The excerpt clearly recommends the play despite content warnings, calling it 'about as smart as they come.' Single excerpt warning applies - this sounds like strong praise, so scoring at upper end of Positive bucket. Low confidence due to limited text. | GPT-4o: The excerpt praises the play's intelligence, suggesting a positive view. However, the caution about it not being for the squeamish indicates some reservations. Given the single excerpt warning, the score is on the lower end of the Positive range. | Gemini: The excerpt suggests the play is intelligent and worth seeing, but with a caveat about its potentially disturbing content. Due to the limited text, confidence is low. | Kimi: The critic offers strong praise for the play's intelligence ('about as smart as they come') while acknowledging its intense content, indicating a solid recommendation despite reservations about its suitability for sensitive viewers.",
