This indicates a negative assessment of the production. | Gemini: The critic states that \"too many\" minutes of stage time don't earn their keep, indicating a negative assessment of the show. | Kimi: The critic praises the structural discipline as admirable but implies the show fails to deliver sufficient content ('Too many don't'), suggesting uneven quality without issuing a clear recommendation for or against attendance. The extreme brevity indicates this is likely an excerpt, warranting low confidence.",
