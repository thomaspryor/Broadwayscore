  "bwwExcerpt": "Sometimes, what happens in Williamstown really oughtta stay in Williamstown...Vito is played by Douglas Sills with everything you'd expect of a comic Italian stereotype: malaprops galore, a leering gaze, peripatetic hands, flaring nostrils, animated hair, etc...DiPietro's script is so inside in its opera references and jokes, sonic and visual, that you may find yourself gasping for air, though probably not from the laughs that director Kathleen Marshall works overtime extracting. The great Fleming is a trouper but she's slumming here. It's possible to imagine this as the perfect diversion for a summer evening on sabbatical from Tanglewood. But on Broadway, it's piffle, forgotten by the time you reach the corner to hail a cab.",
