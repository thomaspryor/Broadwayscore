    "reasoning": "[ensemble-majority] | 3/4 models agree: Negative | Claude: Clear negative verdict calling the show 'creaky and old-fashioned' despite praising the lead performance. Individual performer praise does not redeem an overall negative assessment. | GPT-4o: The review acknowledges a strong performance by Fleming but criticizes the show as outdated and unappealing, leading to a negative overall recommendation. | Gemini: The review praises the performance but criticizes the show itself, resulting in a mixed assessment. | Kimi: Although the critic praises the lead performer's charm and skill, the 'but' construction signals a negative verdict on the production itself, which is dismissed as dated and irrelevant ('creaky,' 'old-fashioned,' 'relic'), constituting a recommendation against seeing the show.",
