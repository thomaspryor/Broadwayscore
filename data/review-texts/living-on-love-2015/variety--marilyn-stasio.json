  "bwwExcerpt": "Kathleen Marshall helms this lightweight material with a properly playful touch...Sills...has Maestro's bravura moves down cold...Fleming's fans should be thrilled to hear that their idol is a natural, completely at her ease in the most ridiculously farcical situations and so personable she confirms her reputation as 'The People's Diva'...Chlumsky...knows the drills and executes them with flair. But O'Connell isn't playing in the same league, and his discomfort repeatedly throws off the comic rhythms...It's all very charming until the ill-advised saccharine payoff which has half the audience cheering and the other half wondering how long we have to put up with yet more shameless pandering to the social zeitgeist.",

The positive performer praise does not redeem the negative overall assessment. | GPT-4o: While the critic praises Fleming's performance, the overall assessment of the show is negative, describing it as 'creaky and old-fashioned'. | Gemini: The review praises the performance but criticizes the show itself, indicating a mixed opinion. | Kimi: While the critic praises the lead performance as 'charming and accomplished,' the overall verdict on the show is negative, describing it as 'creaky,' 'old-fashioned,' and a 'relic'—clearly not recommending the production despite the star's efforts.",
