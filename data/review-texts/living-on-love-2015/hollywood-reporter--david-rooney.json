  "bwwExcerpt": "...there's nothing contemporary and too little that's consistently funny about playwright Joe DiPietro's refried serving of Peccadillo...the new version does have a thoroughbred casting coup in its favor, which is the sporting turn of celebrated lyric soprano Renée Fleming as fading opera diva Raquel De Angelis. But when Raquel is not onstage trilling with vainglorious self-adulation and encroaching terror of her professional decline, the fizz quickly evaporates...while DiPietro and director Kathleen Marshall...treat the material like farce, it lacks accelerating mayhem...Anyone who has seen Chlumsky's fine work on Veep knows how skillfully she can underplay comedy. But her role here is written with too little dimension or consistency...And there's minimal chemistry between the actress and O'Connell, who is hopelessly miscast...O'Connell has a way of sucking the comic energy out of the room...Sills is a wily old pro who sails through the proceedings with brio in a one-note role...[Fleming's] performance is broad and campy, as the material dictates, but there's also a delightful airiness to it.",

This indicates a negative assessment without any redeeming praise. | Gemini: The review explicitly states that the execution is labored, making the play feel sluggish, which leads to a negative assessment. | Kimi: Single-sentence excerpt criticizes the production as sluggish and labored, suggesting failed execution despite potential in the material. Limited context prevents higher confidence.",
