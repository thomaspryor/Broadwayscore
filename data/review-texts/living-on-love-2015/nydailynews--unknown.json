  "bwwExcerpt": "Mixed-up romantic couples and larger-than-life eccentrics are meant to ignite bright comic fireworks. But too many lame jokes and broad-as-a-barn performances extinguish any chance of that, in a production directed by Kathleen Marshall. I laughed twice. One good moment came from Fleming, who's not half bad in her Broadway debut. 'How much longer can I play the young virgin?' middle-aged Raquel asks. 'Ten, twenty years?'...That's not much for two hours at Broadway prices. But at this point, there's nothing anyone can do about it.",
