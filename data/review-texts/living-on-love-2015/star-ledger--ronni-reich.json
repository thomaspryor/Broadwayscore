  "bwwExcerpt": "'Living With Love' flies by, with nearly as many jokes as there are sparkles on a 'La Bohème' costume Raquel sports...It's not exactly full of surprises, but the light comedic throwback is well executed by the cast and creative team. DiPietro's script takes a kernel of an idea from Garson Kanin's 1985 'Peccadillo' and spins it into something completely different and quite entertaining. Director Kathleen Marshall has a knack for the piece's scale and the quick rhythms of its banter. As Vito De Angelis, Douglas Sills gives a skillful, rangy performance. He's highly entertaining as he lashes out at Robert, primps for Iris or lounges amiably and with the playfulness of someone who knows just how to lead a scherzo...The role is written in such a way that it could be foolproof for Fleming - Raquel is always playing the diva, ready with a song, her speech even taking on a half-sung quality as though it were recitative...But she's a joy to watch when she gets to stick it to diva stereotypes. There's a wonderful self-mocking quality when she walks center stage and talks through the process of one of her famous scenes, telling her costar, 'no one is looking at you, you're the tenor.'",
