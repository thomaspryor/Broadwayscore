  "bwwExcerpt": "As expected, Fleming sounds great when she sings. She's also very funny when she speaks, which is not to be expected after her awkward performance earlier this year at the Metropolitan Opera in 'The Merry Widow,' under the direction of Broadway's Susan Stroman. Musical-comedy veteran Kathleen Marshall directs 'Living on Love,' and you'd never know it's her Broadway debut, too, as the director of a play. No small part of Fleming's success must go to Marshall...With all due respect to the diva of the hour, the real revelation of 'Living on Love' is Sills, whose divo Vito enters the Broadway pantheon of great, inspired, and completely over the-top comic creations.",
