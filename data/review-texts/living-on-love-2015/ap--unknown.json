  "bwwExcerpt": "The four time Grammy Award winner [Fleming] is a delight...able to lovingly goof on her refined world with an insider's grin...DiPietro...has a knack for writing for daffy characters and this play has a half-dozen of them. It feels comforting, like an old black-and-white film, and yet there's a newness here, too...the play centers on an aging soprano, played by a bejeweled Fleming, and her lothario Italian conductor husband...A fantastic Douglas Sills plays him like an impish boy beneath an exterior of shocking slicked-back arrogance and heavily accented English...One of the play's joys is the performances of two stuffy servants...who sing along to arias as they elegantly change the props between scenes or answer bells perfectly in sync...The play is directed with comedic aplomb by three-time Tony Award winner Kathleen Marshall...The material could be accelerated and made into a farce, but Marshall never lets the comedic elements upstage the slightly looney characters themselves.",
