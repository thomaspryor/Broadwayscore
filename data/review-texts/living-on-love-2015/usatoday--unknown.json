  "bwwExcerpt": "How do you deliver a pitch-perfect performance when the writer keeps giving you flat notes? This is the conundrum faced by the cast of Living On Love (**½ out of four), the flimsy new comedy that marks the Broadway debut of opera star Renée Fleming...Playwright Joe DiPietro...provides a few sharper lines, but not enough to sustain nearly two hours of dialogue. Still, director Kathleen Marshall...keeps the pace brisk, and her actors are infectiously game. Fleming, in particular, plays her part with obvious relish, and reveals a real flair for screwball repartee. The soprano uses her earthy speaking voice to great effect -- lowering it when Raquel is trying to reprimand or seduce, then offering higher, brighter tones to affect delight or indignation. On occasion, Raquel will regale us with a brief excerpt from a classic aria, allowing Fleming to show off her enduring prowess.",
