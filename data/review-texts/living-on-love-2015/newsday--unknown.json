  "bwwExcerpt": "There is something almost daring about Broadway's inexplicable insistence on throwback fluff-ball comedies this spring. Daring, perversely, but not encouraging. Into the 1950s time warp comes 'Living on Love,' another example of a well-crafted triviality without subtext or a thought in its head beyond trying too hard to entertain. Joe DiPietro's play...will be remembered, if at all, as the vehicle for Renée Fleming's altogether honorable Broadway debut...Douglas Sills expertly throws himself into the histrionics as the ridiculous libidinous maestro with the atsa-spicy-meatball Italian accent and an insane head of hair...Fleming, who dots her performance with lustrous fragments from opera's greatest hits, doesn't speak as effortlessly as she sings. But she knows about comic timing and stage presence, self-mocking all the grand-opera caricatures...Not surprisingly, the production...has the broad, exaggerated physicality of a comic musical -- albeit, perhaps, one most comfortable as larky summer theater.",
