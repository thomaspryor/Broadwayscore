  "bwwExcerpt": "Being is not the same as acting, and this lesson is illustrated by Fleming herself throughout Joe DiPietro's lousy new comedy, Living on Love. She's a great star giving a mediocre performance as a great star...The canned corn of DiPietro's writing -- 'This dog was petted by more Italians than Sophia Loren!' -- is pressed into mush by Kathleen Marshall's clunky direction; the younger actors, who spend most of the play in a panic, are nearly unwatchable. Living on Love is meant to be hammy, but it's not even that. It's a bland, synthetic dud: a ham-flavored turkey.",
