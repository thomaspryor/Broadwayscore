  "bwwExcerpt": "The play certainly looks good. The De Angelis apartment, designed by Derek McLane, is properly luxurious. And Michael Krass' costumes are perfect: dazzling, 1950s-inspired outfits for Raquel and blindingly bright pajamas with matching robes for Vito. For Fleming, the fine work she does in 'Living on Love' could lead to a second career as a stage actress. That would make any descent into mezzo territory totally irrelevant.",
