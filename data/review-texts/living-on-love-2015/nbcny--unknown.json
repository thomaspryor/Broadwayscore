  "bwwExcerpt": "A little knowledge of opera helps, but it's not key to admiring the frothy and fizzy 'Living on Love,' in which soprano Renée Fleming makes her Broadway debut -- you're apt to enjoy the celebrated diva in this send-up of celebrated divas, even if the in-jokes about Maria Callas pass you by...Fleming, with her silk caftans and gorgeous arias (she has ample opportunity to break into song, and it gave me goosebumps each time) throws herself into all the diva cliches as she tries to outdo her philandering husband...Sills...is a comic marvel as the out-of-tune conductor who thinks he still has a way with the ladies...Most of the time, Fleming is boozy and Sills is flamboyant. It's not until the end of the two-act confection (you won't be blamed for wishing director Kathleen Marshall had made things just a bit tighter), that they have to do anything bittersweet. When Vito and Raquel finally drop their schtick and connect with each other, it makes for an impressive conclusion, especially considering the abrupt change in tone.",
