**Reasoning:** Claude: The critic dismisses the musical as shallow and manipulative 'muzak' that lacks authentic emotional depth, with predominantly negative language despite acknowledging it might be 'comforting' to some. | GPT-4o-mini: The review expresses strong negative sentiments about the show's lack of depth and originality, indicating a clear rejection of the production. | Note: Models differed by 13 points.

**Text excerpt:**
> Based on Nicholas Sparks’ 1996 bestseller about a young – then older, then much older – couple who survive a lifetime of tribulations (until they don’t), the musical opening tonight at the Schoenfeld Theatre is the theatrical equivalent of muzak, comforting in its unapologetically manipulative way a...
