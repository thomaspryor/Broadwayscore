## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $7.5 million. The Jamie Lloyd-directed Broadway revival (starring Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter) raised approximately $7.5 million in capital.

**Recoupment:** Yes. The production recouped its entire $7.5 million investment in just 8 weeks on Broadway. This was an exceptionally fast recoupment for a play, aided by star casting and sellout crowds.

**Recoupment Date:** Mid-November 2025. (Opened in September 2025, it had earned back its costs by the week ending Nov. 19, 2025, roughly eight weeks into the run.)

**Weekly Running Cost:** Not published. The play's grosses peaked near $1.9 million in a week thanks to premium pricing and full capacity. While exact running expenses were not disclosed, the sustained high grosses well above typical play costs ensured profitability after recoupment.

**SVOG Grant:** None. (No SVOG; this production was launched well after theaters reopened and was privately financed, though it undoubtedly benefited from the standard state tax credit as well.)

**Notable Investor/Lawsuit/Deal:** No notable disputes or unusual structures. The key draw was celebrity casting -- reuniting the Bill & Ted duo in a classic play -- which led to the fastest recoupment of the season's plays. There were no reported investor lawsuits or unique profit-sharing deals beyond standard arrangements for star compensation.
