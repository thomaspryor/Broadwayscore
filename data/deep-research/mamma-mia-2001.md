## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $10 million (approx.; funded by Judy Craymer and partners via Broadway debut)
**Recoupment:** Yes. (Recouped in 8 months -- by June 2002 -- thanks to tourist-packed houses and ABBA's popular appeal)
**Recoupment Date:** June 2002 (producers confirmed it had paid back by the summer following opening)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$400K (Moderate cast and band; in 2001-02 it grossed ~$600-700K/week at near-capacity, yielding solid weekly profits. It ran 14 years in NYC, generating massive cumulative profit)
**SVOG Grant:** No. (Mamma Mia! closed in 2015, well before COVID)
**Investor Caveats:** Royalties to ABBA. (Music by ABBA required a significant royalty to songwriters Benny Andersson & Bjorn Ulvaeus -- who were also lead producers. Essentially, the ABBA members double-dipped: they collected song royalties and a producer profit share. This was by design and not unusual for jukebox musicals controlled by songwriters. Otherwise, investor terms were standard.)
