## GPT Deep Research Output (Batch 3)

**Capitalization:** $10M confirmed (Playbill / Judy Craymer interviews).

**Recoupment:** Yes. Recouped late May 2002 (May 29, 2002 per production records), approximately 27.5 weeks (~7 months) from October 18, 2001 opening. Previously listed as "June 2002" — corrected to May based on GPT DR findings.

**Recoupment Date:** May 29, 2002 (~27.5 weeks)

**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$550K (in 2001 dollars). Previous $400K estimate was too low. Large ensemble cast + live orchestra drove costs higher than a typical jukebox musical.

**SVOG Grant:** N/A (pre-pandemic production)

**Notable:** Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus (ABBA) served as both songwriters AND lead producers — an unusual dual role that maximized their financial participation. They essentially earned from both the creative and producing sides. Judy Craymer conceived the show and produced through Littlestar Services. Phyllida Lloyd directed the original production.

**Global Impact:** $7B+ grossed across 40+ global productions worldwide. One of the most commercially successful musicals in history. The 2008 film adaptation (with Meryl Streep) further boosted brand recognition and ticket sales for stage productions.

**2025 Tour Stop:** 25th Anniversary national tour returned to Broadway Aug 2025 - Feb 2026 at the Broadhurst Theatre. See `mamma-mia` (tour stop entry) for that engagement's data.
