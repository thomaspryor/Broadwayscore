## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** ~$19 million (reported high budget for Shaina Taub's large-cast suffragette musical)
**Recoupment:** No. (Suffs closed Jan 5, 2025 after ~9 months, failing to earn back its hefty capitalization)
**Recoupment Date:** N/A (never recouped; production shuttered due to insufficient grosses despite 2 Tony wins)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$1.2-1.3 million (Needed ~$1.4M/week to recoup in a year; averaged ~$1.0M/week gross at best, which was not enough to sustain a profit)
**SVOG Grant:** No (opened 2024; no SVOG)
**Investor Caveats:** High-profile backers. (Had Hillary Clinton as a co-producer; massive ensemble of 30+ women drove costs up. Despite critical acclaim, Suffs struggled at the box office and ended its run without returning investor capital. No special investor deals disclosed; losses were mitigated somewhat by a planned tour/transfer which is uncertain)
