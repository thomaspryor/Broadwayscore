## GPT Deep Research Output

**Initial Capitalization (Budget):** $20+ million (reported) -- This lavish stage prequel to the Netflix series opened in spring 2025 with an estimated budget above $20 million, featuring some of the most "jaw-dropping" stage tech in recent memory. (Note: Some industry rumors put the total cost much higher -- even $40M+ -- though Netflix hasn't disclosed official figures.)

**Weekly Running Costs:** High (approx. $0.8-1.0 million) -- As a technically complex, special-effects-heavy play in a large theater, Stranger Things likely incurs operating costs on par with a big musical. (For context, other star-driven plays have run ~$1M/week.) The exact weekly nut isn't public, but it is presumably among Broadway's highest for a play.

**Recoupment Percentage (to date):** 100% (Fully Recouped) -- The production recouped its entire investment by December 2025 after a string of record-breaking grosses. Over the holidays it grossed as high as $2.51 million in one week, a house record for the Marquis Theatre. This rapid payoff reflects both the huge built-in fanbase and premium pricing during peak seasons.

**Likelihood to Recoup:** Already Achieved -- Recoupment has been achieved just months into the run. Looking forward, the show is now earning profits. Sustained demand (especially with the TV series' finale driving interest) suggests a continued strong run. The main question is how long it can maintain momentum once the initial fan surge abates, but financially it has already succeeded in paying back its capitalization.

**Break-Even Gross (Weekly):** ~$1.0-1.1 million -- Likely in the low $1M range. If weekly costs are around $800k-$900k, a gross just over $1M would cover expenses. In reality, First Shadow has been grossing well above this level (often $1.5-$2M+ per week), meaning it routinely clears its break-even point by a wide margin.

**Tax Credit Status:** Approved -- The production was eligible for and is estimated to receive the full $3 million NY state production tax credit. (Even though backed by Netflix, it qualified as a commercial production.) This rebate effectively increases net profits after recoupment.
