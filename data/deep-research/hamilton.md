## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $12.5 million
**Recoupment:** Yes. (This megahit recouped in just ~8 months on Broadway -- confirmed by 2016)
**Recoupment Date:** Mid-2016 (officially announced roughly 11 months after opening, though it likely earned back earlier)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$600K (Original production cost ~$600K/week; with demand far exceeding supply, it grossed $1.5-$3M weekly, making it enormously profitable)
**SVOG Grant:** Yes -- $10 million. (The Broadway production, plus its tours, collectively received $50M in SVOG relief -- Broadway's share was about $10M)

**Investor Caveats:** Profit-sharing with cast & creators. Hamilton instituted an unprecedented profit pool for original cast members and stage managers (they split a 1% net profit share). Additionally, composer-star Lin-Manuel Miranda and lead producer Jeffrey Seller each draw tens of millions annually via royalties and profit splits. In effect, Miranda earns author royalties and a producer's share, while the original cast's negotiated pool set a new precedent for investor-talent profit allocation. Despite these carve-outs, Hamilton's massive revenue has handsomely rewarded investors many times over.
