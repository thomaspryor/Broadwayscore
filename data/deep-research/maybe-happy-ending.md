## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $16 million (Broadway production cost; producers Jeffrey Richards & Hunter Arnold confirmed a $16M raise)
**Note:** Current data has $18.25M from SEC/Broadway Journal. The $18.25M may include the $2M survival loan mentioned below, plus reserves. Keeping $18.25M as the total obligation to recoup.

**Recoupment:** Not yet. (As of mid-2025, the show had not fully recouped; still building on Tony momentum)
**Recoupment Date:** Unconfirmed (Tony Award wins in June 2025 drove grosses up, but by that point roughly $18M including a $2M survival loan still to recoup)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$820K break-even (Pre-Tony, show needed ~$820K gross/week to break even. Post-Tony, it hit $1.1M/week gross, enabling operating profit)
**SVOG Grant:** No (opened late 2024; no SVOG -- though an SBA loan was taken during its early rough weeks)
**Investor Caveats:** Mid-run cash infusion. (Producers took a $2 million loan to keep the show afloat during slow months. Tony wins turned it into a hit, but recoupment of ~$18M total cost remains slow-going. No unusual profit skims aside from standard creative royalties)
