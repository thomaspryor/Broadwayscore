## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $7 million. The production's entire $7 million capitalization was confirmed by the producers.

**Recoupment:** Yes. The show recouped its full $7 million investment during its limited 20-week run.

**Recoupment Date:** February 16, 2025 (recouped by the end of its run, which concluded on Feb. 16, 2025). The recoupment announcement was made just before closing.

**Weekly Running Cost:** Not reported. (Given it was a play in an in-the-round venue, costs were presumably moderate; no official weekly "nut" was published in trade sources.)

**SVOG Grant:** None. (No SVOG funding -- this was a post-shutdown production funded privately.)

**Notable Investor/Lawsuit/Deal:** No notable investor disputes or special deals reported. The revival's selling point was its young stars and audience -- it drew the youngest audience on record and broke box-office records at Circle in the Square, but there were no unusual profit-sharing structures publicly disclosed.
