## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $25 million
**Recoupment:** No. (This spectacle-heavy musical did not recoup; it consistently grossed below its needed level)
**Recoupment Date:** N/A (unlikely to ever be reached at Broadway grosses -- production closed with investors in the red)
**Weekly Running Cost:** >$1.3-1.4 million (Needed to gross >= $1.4M/week to recoup in a year, but hovered around $1.0M/week -- only covering running costs, not payback)
**SVOG Grant:** No (post-pandemic new musical; not SVOG-funded)
**Investor Caveats:** High risk spectacle. (Featured circus effects and a large company, making it costly. Despite decent sales, producers acknowledged it "won't ever recoup" at current grosses. Benefited from NY State $3M musical tax credit, but that only offsets some costs. No unusual deals aside from heavy front-end capital and typical royalties to creative team)
