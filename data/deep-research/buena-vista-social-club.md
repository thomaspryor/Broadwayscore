## GPT Deep Research Output

### Capitalization
**Amount:** $17 million
**Source:** SEC Form D filing (reported via Al Dia News) confirms a $17 million production budget.
**Confidence:** High (SEC-reported figure).
**Notes:** Relatively modest for a new Broadway musical in 2025 (average new musical ~$20M). Producer Orin Wolf noted "Buena Vista Social Club only cost $17 million" -- a lean budget partly due to its development off-Broadway at Atlantic Theater (reusing some sets/props) and a cast composed largely of actor-musicians.

### Weekly Running Costs
**Amount:** ~$700,000 per week
**Source:** Broadway financial analysis (insider estimate from Jan 2026) put weekly operating costs around $0.7M.
**Confidence:** Medium (not officially disclosed; aligns with a mid-sized musical).
**Components:** Live Cuban band and ensemble cast salaries, Broadway theater rental (Schoenfeld Theatre ~1,079 seats), standard crew/marketing costs. The off-Broadway roots likely kept running costs in check. No major above-the-line stars on payroll.

### Recoupment Status
**Status:** Not Recouped (Profitable)
**Estimated % recouped:** ~10-30% by Jan 2026. After ~10 months on Broadway, it is making slow but positive progress toward recoupment.
**Outlook:** The show is earning small operating profits now, but not enough for quick payback. At an estimated ~$50-$100K weekly profit in good weeks, recoupment would likely take 18-24 months. Likelihood to recoup: Moderate. BroadwayWorld noted that if it can avoid steep fall-off in its second year, it "may also recoup in the next 12-18 months".

### Financial Performance
- **Total gross to date:** ~$30-35 million (as of Jan 2026)
- **Typical weekly gross:** ~$0.85-$1.0 million. E.g., $994,608 week of 1/18/26 and $862,468 week of 1/25/26.
- **Capacity %:** ~85-95%. Hovered around high-80s to low-90s on average.
- **Break-even weekly gross:** ~$0.75-$0.80 million.

### Tax Credits
**NY Musical Tax Credit:** Likely $3 million (anticipated). Opened within the eligibility window (first preview Feb 2025). Given a $17M budget, would qualify for the full $3M rebate (~18% of capitalization).
