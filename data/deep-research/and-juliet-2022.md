## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $17 million (initial Broadway capitalization).

**Recoupment:** Yes -- the jukebox musical made back its entire $17M investment. It was heralded as a hit and marked one of the few new shows of the 2022-2023 season to recoup.

**Recoupment Date:** Announced on June 11, 2024. (& Juliet began previews in Oct. 2022 and officially opened Nov. 17, 2022, so it achieved recoupment in about 19 months of playing time.)

**Weekly Running Cost:** Not publicly reported in detail. (The show's financial success suggests that its weekly grosses -- which totaled around $1 million or more in many weeks -- comfortably exceeded its running costs. While exact weekly expenses weren't given in press, & Juliet likely had a moderate cost structure for a musical of its size, given its single set and pop-concert style production.)

**SVOG Grant:** None. (& Juliet opened after the pandemic shutdown and was not a revival of a pre-COVID production, so it did not receive a Shuttered Venue Operators Grant.)

**Insider/Investor Notes:** No noteworthy investor disputes or unusual profit allocations have been reported. As a jukebox musical built on the Max Martin song catalogue, one might expect high music licensing fees; however, Max Martin himself was a lead producer of the show, which likely helped secure favorable terms for song usage. The result is that & Juliet operated under standard Broadway economics -- once it recouped, profits flow to investors and producers in the usual splits. There have been no investor lawsuits or claims of hidden deals associated with & Juliet. By all accounts, it's a straightforward success story: the production grossed over $93 million by mid-2024 and entered profitability for its backers.
