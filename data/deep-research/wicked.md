## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $14 million (estimated original budget)
**Recoupment:** Yes. (Recouped after ~14 months, by end of 2004 -- a relatively quick payback given its scale)
**Recoupment Date:** December 2004 (approx.; not widely trumpeted at the time, but confirmed in interviews by 2005)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$800K (Large cast, major special effects; however, Wicked has averaged $1.8-$2.5M in weekly grosses for decades, far exceeding its costs.)
**SVOG Grant:** Likely No. (No public record of Wicked claiming SVOG; as a partially Universal Pictures-backed show with robust reserves, it may have foregone government aid in 2021)
**Investor Caveats:** Original stars profit share. (The original Glinda/Elphaba (Kristin Chenoweth & Idina Menzel) famously did not negotiate a cast profit pool -- a fact often contrasted with Hamilton's later arrangement -- so Wicked's enormous profits flow to its investors and producers. Lead producer David Stone has noted Wicked's "economic footprint" is massive. Composer Stephen Schwartz receives a royalty plus a cut of profits as a producer.)
