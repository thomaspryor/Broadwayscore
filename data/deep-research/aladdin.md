## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $15 million (approximate; Disney Theatrical's budget for Broadway staging)
**Recoupment:** Yes. (The show recouped after about 2 years on Broadway -- not publicly heralded, but industry consensus is it paid back during its long run)
**Recoupment Date:** 2016 (est.) (Disney did not formally announce, but Aladdin had grossed ~$200M by 2016, implying full recoupment by then)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$700K (Big production with elaborate sets/costumes; generally grossed $1.0-$1.3M weekly in peak years, leaving a solid profit margin)
**SVOG Grant:** Unclear. (Disney may have foregone SVOG funds; however, Aladdin is listed among shows "benefiting" from SVOG in industry summaries)
**Investor Caveats:** In-house financing. (Disney Theatrical funded Aladdin largely internally -- no outside producers sharing profits. Thus, all recoupment and profit flowed to Disney. Creatives (Menken, etc.) receive standard royalties. No unconventional investor deals, as Disney does not use traditional investing/raising -- effectively making this a corporate production with no public investor risk beyond Disney itself.)
