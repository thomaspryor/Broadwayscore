## GPT Deep Research Output (Batch 3)

**Capitalization:** ~$15-17M (consensus estimate). Disney does not publicly disclose production budgets. LA Times reported $12-15M; some insiders estimated ~$20M. GPT DR Batch 3 consensus settled on $15-17M range (midpoint $16M used).

**Recoupment:** Yes. Likely recouped late 2014 (~9 months from March 2014 opening). Disney never formally announces recoupments — per insider: "recoupment is not a concept that makes sense in the Disney model" since they handle many services in-house (marketing, ticketing, merchandise, etc.).

**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$800-900K (midpoint $850K used). Large cast + elaborate Genie effects (flying carpet, Cave of Wonders) + full orchestra drive costs. Previous $750K estimate was too low.

**2% Gross-as-Rent Lease:** CONFIRMED. Disney's unique New Amsterdam Theatre lease structure pays 2% of weekly gross as rent (vs standard fixed rent of $50-100K/week). At ~$1.5M average weekly gross, this means ~$30K/week in rent — a significant cost advantage over most Broadway shows.

**NY Tax Credit:** $3M received in 2022-2023 fiscal year.

**SVOG Grant:** NOT eligible. Disney is a publicly traded company (per Variety, Mar 2021, Disney and other publicly traded companies were not eligible for SVOG grants).

**Notable:** Disney sole-funded production — no outside investors. Disney handles marketing, ticketing, and merchandise in-house, which means these costs don't appear as separate line items in the way they would for an independent producer. By May 2023: $561M+ grossed, 3,100+ performances. Multiple international productions. One of the most profitable Broadway shows of the 2010s.
