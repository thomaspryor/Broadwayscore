## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $22.5 million
**Recoupment:** Yes. (The Michael Jackson bio-musical recouped its entire initial investment -- announced by late 2023)
**Recoupment Date:** November 2023 (approx.; by its second year MJ had grossed over $200M globally and fully paid back Broadway investors)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$1.3M (A large-scale musical with many hits -- it grossed $1.3M in its first full week and often around $1.5-$1.8M at 100% capacity, suggesting ~$1.2-1.3M break-even)
**SVOG Grant:** Yes -- $10 million. (MJ received a maximum $10M Shuttered Venue Operators Grant, bolstering its finances in 2021)

**Investor Caveats:** Unprecedented profit carve-outs. The Jackson Estate, as lead producer, negotiated that 100% of lead-producer net profits go to the Estate (unlike the usual 50/50 producer-investor split). Additionally, once recouped+10%, 13% of net profits "off the top" are paid out to the Estate, bookwriter Lynn Nottage, director Christopher Wheeldon, and key managers -- an unusually high off-the-top share that dilutes investor profit. Co-producers were not granted any share of the Estate's profits (despite raising money). The Estate also controls all creative decisions and earns separate royalties for Jackson's music. In short, investors recouped and earn ongoing profits, but the Jackson Estate captures an outsized portion of MJ's upside.
