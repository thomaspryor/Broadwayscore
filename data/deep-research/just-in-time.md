## GPT Deep Research Output

**Initial Capitalization (Budget):** $12.5 million -- This original musical (a biographical show about singer Bobby Darin) had a production budget of about $9.4M, with a total capitalization up to $12.5M including reserves. By new musical standards, it's a moderate budget (far below the mega-musicals).

**Weekly Running Costs:** ~$600,000 per week -- Running at the Circle in the Square, Just in Time's weekly operating cost is estimated around $0.6M. With an intimate venue and modest cast, it has comparatively lower overhead, allowing it to turn a profit on weekly grosses around $1.2M+.

**Recoupment Percentage (to date):** ~90+% -- As of Jan 2026, the show is on the verge of full recoupment. It has consistently grossed $1.2-1.4M weekly (often selling out at premium prices), yielding healthy profits. By late 2025 it was 80-100% recouped, and industry reports indicate the recoupment announcement is expected imminently.

**Likelihood to Recoup:** Excellent (imminent) -- Barring an unforeseen drop, Just in Time is virtually certain to recoup. In fact, producers projected that if it sustained ~$1.2M/week, it would recoup its $9.4M production cost by fall 2025 (a timeline extended slightly due to not yet receiving the tax credit). Given its continued strong sales -- buoyed by star Jonathan Groff's presence -- the show is set to announce recoupment in early 2026. Anything beyond that will be pure profit for investors.

**Break-Even Gross (Weekly):** ~$1.2 million -- $1.2M in weekly gross was the target to cover costs and recoup in the original financing plan. At that level (with ~$600k in costs), the show clears roughly $150k+ in weekly profit. In practice, it has often exceeded this -- e.g. grossing $1.3M+ in many weeks -- giving it a comfortable cushion above break-even.

**Tax Credit Status:** Approved (pending receipt) -- Just in Time qualified for the New York production tax credit and is slated for a $3 million rebate. This credit was factored into its recoupment schedule (shortening the timeline by about a few months). Note: Due to funding shortages in the program, the show had not yet actually received the funds as of late 2025, but it's expected in due course and will count toward recoupment.
