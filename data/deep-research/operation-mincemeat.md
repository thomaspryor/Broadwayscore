## GPT Deep Research Output

**Initial Capitalization (Budget):** $11.5 million (minimum) -- Producers raised at least $11.5M to bring this Olivier-winning British musical to Broadway. The official cap could be as high as $14.5M with reserves, but by Broadway standards it's a mid-sized musical (much cheaper than spectacle shows).

**Weekly Running Costs:** ~$500,000 per week -- Running in the intimate 800-seat Golden Theatre, Operation Mincemeat has relatively lean operating expenses. Estimates put the weekly nut around $0.5M. (Notably, the show is known for its small cast and minimalist, clever staging, which help contain costs.)

**Recoupment Percentage (to date):** ~10-20% -- After nearly one year on Broadway (opened Feb 2025), the show has recouped only a small portion of its investment so far. Strong word-of-mouth and steady ninety-percent-plus attendance have kept it out of the red weekly, but most of the initial $11.5M investment remains to be earned back.

**Likelihood to Recoup:** Possible, but long-term -- Operation Mincemeat is turning a profit week-to-week (often ~$100-200k/week in recent grosses), which bodes well. However, given the modest absolute grosses (usually $700-800k/week) it would take several years to fully recoup at this pace. One analysis projected that, even though it isn't losing money, it might not recoup until around 2028 if current trends hold. Its future will depend on sustaining momentum as the original cast departs and whether U.S. audiences continue to embrace its "too British" humor.

**Break-Even Gross (Weekly):** ~$600,000 -- With a $500k weekly cost, the show likely breaks even around $0.55-$0.6M in gross (after typical ticket fees). For example, a $742k gross at 99% capacity translated to ~$701k net and ~$201k profit -- implying roughly mid-$500Ks is the breakeven point.

**Tax Credit Status:** Approved -- Operation Mincemeat is slated to receive the full $3 million production tax credit from New York State. This subsidy (25% of qualified costs) significantly improves the recoupment calculus, effectively reducing the amount producers must recover from ticket sales.
