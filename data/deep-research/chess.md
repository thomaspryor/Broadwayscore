## GPT Deep Research Output (Session 2 - preferred figures)

### Capitalization
**Amount:** ~$15 million
**Source:** Industry forum discussion (BroadwayWorld) with insider info. Direct quote: "Total production capitalization is 15 million."
**Confidence:** Medium (unofficial but plausible; no SEC filing found). Forum source noted a "full physical production budget" of about $4M within this total.
**Notes:** Revival production with star casting (Lea Michele, Aaron Tveit). Original 1988 production was capitalized at $6 million for comparison.

### Weekly Running Costs
**Amount:** ~$900k per week (estimated "nut")
**Source:** Industry forum estimate and gross analysis on Reddit. Forum explicitly said the "weekly nut is just shy of $1 million".
**Confidence:** Medium (informed estimate; not officially published).
**Components:** High above-the-title star salaries (Michele, etc.), a sizable ensemble and orchestra (for the pop/rock score), and a large physical production.

### Recoupment Status
**Status:** Not Recouped (as of Jan 2026)
**Estimated % recouped:** ~0-5% (opening phase). Show began previews Oct 2025.
**Outlook:** "Chess is doing very, very well" in grosses. With sustained ~$100k+ weekly profits, a multi-year run could pay back the $15M. Likelihood: High if strong sales continue. The run is limited through June 14, 2026, so recoupment by closing is plausible.

### Financial Performance
- **Total gross to date:** ~$20 million (Oct 2025-Jan 2026)
- **Typical weekly gross:** $1.4-$1.8 million in normal weeks, with holiday peaks ~$2.0M. Hit $2.01 million in an 8-show week.
- **Capacity %:** ~90-100% on average (consistently near sell-out in initial months)
- **Break-even weekly gross:** ~$1.1M (implied by $900k costs + ~10-15% fees)

### Tax Credits
**NY Musical Tax Credit:** Eligible for $3 million rebate (25% of production costs). First preview Oct 15, 2025, qualifying under the extended program (deadline Oct 20, 2025).

## Earlier Research (Session 1 - Accio blog source)
An earlier analysis cited a $12.5M figure from an Accio business blog, but the BWW forum insider figure of $15M is considered more reliable given the direct quote.
