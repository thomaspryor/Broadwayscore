## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $5.5 million (estimated for star-studded revival starring Jim Parsons)
**MAJOR CORRECTION:** Prior data had $20M from "NY Times / Broadway Stars". Research says $5.5M. $20M is implausible for a straight play -- likely a data entry error or confusion with another show.

**Recoupment:** Yes (reportedly). (This limited-engagement revival played to ~95% capacity and is believed to have recouped, though not formally announced)
**MAJOR CORRECTION:** Prior data had recouped: false. Research indicates it DID recoup.

**Recoupment Date:** January 2025 (the run ended Jan 19, 2025, having grossed over $1 million in its final week -- indications point to full recoupment by closing)
**Weekly Running Cost:** <$500K. (Small-cast play; final week gross $1.084M at 95% capacity implies a low break-even, likely met or exceeded weekly)
**SVOG Grant:** No (commercial production in 2024; no grant involved)
**Investor Caveats:** Celebrity draw. (Featured Jim Parsons, Annaleigh Ashford, etc.; sold strongly on star power. No unusual investor terms -- production achieved success within limited run)
