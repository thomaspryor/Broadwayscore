## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $15 million. According to producer J.J. Powell, the revival's total investment was about $15 million.

**Recoupment:** No. Despite strong ticket sales (often full houses), the production did not recoup. It closed having lost roughly 40% of its investment.

**Recoupment Date:** Not applicable (the show never fully recouped its costs).

**Weekly Running Cost:** Not officially disclosed. The show's running expenses were very high (on the order of nearly $1 million per week, given the large-scale production and star salary), which contributed to the inability to turn a profit.

**SVOG Grant:** None. (No federal SVOG relief was reported for this production; it likely utilized the New York State theatre tax credit, but no direct grant.)

**Notable Investor/Lawsuit/Deal:** Notably, director Jamie Lloyd himself had a $4 million stake in the show's capitalization -- an unusual insider investment. No investor lawsuits were reported, but producers publicly highlighted Broadway's cost structure as a broader issue when discussing the show's losses.
