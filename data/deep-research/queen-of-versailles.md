## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** High-budget (estimated $20+ million jukebox musical)
**Recoupment:** No. (Closed early Dec 21, 2025 without recovering its investment)
**Recoupment Date:** N/A (show announced premature closing before New Year's)
**Weekly Running Cost:** Very high (required "sustained enthusiasm" to cover "scale and capitalization" -- grosses fell short at ~$700K/week vs. ~$1M+ breakeven)
**SVOG Grant:** No (post-pandemic new musical; not SVOG-funded)
**Investor Caveats:** Star salary & royalty heavy. (Featured Kristin Chenoweth and F. Murray Abraham; Stephen Schwartz score. An "open-ended, high-budget star vehicle" that struggled to sell tickets. Closed early, leaving investors with losses)
