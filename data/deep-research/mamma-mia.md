## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** Moderate (~$6-8 million for limited 6-month Broadway return)
**Recoupment:** Unconfirmed. (The 2025 Broadway encore engagement likely broke even due to strong sales, but no formal recoupment announcement)
**Recoupment Date:** N/A (limited run closed Feb 1, 2026; producers then launched a new US tour)
**Weekly Running Cost:** High (Grossed ~$1.4M/week in Dec 2025 at 93% capacity, implying weekly costs in the high six-figures, likely met by ticket sales)
**SVOG Grant:** No (new 2025 production; SVOG applied to earlier shutdown-era shows, not this limited revival)
**Investor Caveats:** Tour tie-in. (The Broadway run was essentially a pre-tour engagement -- "extended stop" on a 25th Anniversary tour. Investors anticipated profits from subsequent tour bookings rather than the short NYC run alone)
