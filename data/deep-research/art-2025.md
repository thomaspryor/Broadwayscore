## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $6.9 million
**Recoupment:** Yes. (The 16-week revival recouped its entire $6.9M investment just before closing)
**Recoupment Date:** December 14, 2025 (producers announced recoupment during the final week of its run)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$400K (3-person cast but high above-the-title star salaries -- Cannavale, Corden, Harris -- drove costs up. Nonetheless, Art averaged $1.2-1.8M grosses at ~99% capacity, far exceeding its weekly nut. It hit $1.8M in peak week.)
**SVOG Grant:** No (limited run in 2025; not applicable)
**Investor Caveats:** All-star vehicle. (Backed by lead producer David Mirvish, this revival's marquee trio commanded big salaries, but also ensured sold-out houses. It "propelled this comedy...into the black" -- meaning fully paid back before closing. No unusual investor issues -- profit split followed standard play model.)
