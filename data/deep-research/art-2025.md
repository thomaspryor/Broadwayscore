## GPT Deep Research Output (Batch 3)

**Capitalization:** $6.75M (Broadway News confirmed). SEC filing under "White Canvas Broadway LP" shows $6.9M max offering amount.

**Recoupment:** Yes. Recouped week ending December 14, 2025 (~13 weeks into 16-week run).

**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$725-750K. MAJOR correction from previous $400K estimate. Higher than expected for a 3-actor play due to:
- Star salaries: Bobby Cannavale, James Corden, Jesse Tyler Ferguson combined ~$350K/week
- Premium Broadway Journal ad spend
- Broadway-standard crew/theater costs at the Helen Hayes Theatre

Broadway Journal confirmed running costs "north of $700K."

**SVOG Grant:** No (new 2025 production)

**Notable:** Matthew Warchus directed (also directed the original 1996 production). Eligible for $3M NY theater tax credit. The show averaged $1.2-1.8M gross at ~99% capacity. The high weekly nut ($750K) for just 3 actors illustrates how star salaries dominate Broadway economics for plays.
