## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $11.5 million (initial Broadway investment).

**Recoupment:** Yes -- the Tony-winning musical recouped its entire $11.5M capitalization. It was the first musical of the 2018-2019 season to do so.

**Recoupment Date:** November 2019 (about 6 months after opening). The show began Broadway performances in March 2019 and had recouped by mid-November 2019 -- roughly 30 weeks of performances to break even.

**Weekly Running Cost:** Not disclosed in trade press. (Hadestown consistently played to near-full houses and strong grosses, which enabled its quick recoupment. Precise weekly operating costs weren't published, but its "windfall" status indicates it generated substantial weekly profits after recouping.)

**SVOG Grant:** Yes. During the pandemic shutdown, Hadestown received a $10 million Shuttered Venue Operators Grant to support its reopening. (It was one of at least 15 Broadway productions to receive the maximum $10M federal grant, according to Sen. Schumer's office.)

**Insider/Investor Notes:** No unusual profit-sharing structures were reported. As an original musical developed through non-profit and international runs, Hadestown did not face the kind of outsized royalty or profit participation demands that some franchise-based shows do. Its lead producers and creative team operated under standard industry arrangements, and there have been no investor lawsuits or public controversies about its finances. Notably, even after the massive COVID disruption, Hadestown returned and has continued to run profitably (a testament to its efficient cost structure and sustained audience demand).
