**Recoupment:** No. (Closed Jan 5, 2025 after 17 months and $80M+ ticket sales, without recouping)
**Recoupment Date:** N/A
**Weekly Running Cost:** $980,000 weekly breakeven (Broadway Journal, Nov 6, 2023: "must gross at least $980,000 to break even each week, according to a recoupment chart from the production")
**SVOG Grant:** NOT ELIGIBLE (was a London production during the 2020-2021 eligibility period; not a US production)
**Investor Caveats:** Brand recognition != success. Despite the famous title, BTTF underperformed on Broadway at ~$1M/week avg gross vs $1.3M needed. Touring productions planned to recoup outside Broadway. Received $3M NY state theater tax credit. Standard royalty to Bob Gale & Alan Silvestri.
