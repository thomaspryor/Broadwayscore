## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $23.5 million
**Recoupment:** No. (The Broadway production will end Jan 5, 2025 after only 17 months, without recouping its sizable investment)
**Recoupment Date:** N/A (show closing early 2025, short of recoupment)
**Weekly Running Cost:** High (Spectacle-driven musical in a large house -- required near-capacity grosses to break even. It grossed ~$1M/week on average, below the ~$1.3M needed for profit, leading to closure)
**SVOG Grant:** No (opened mid-2023; not eligible for 2021 grants)
**Investor Caveats:** Brand recognition != success. (Despite the famous title, BTTF underperformed on Broadway. Investors had anticipated London-level success; instead the show will close having "struggled to recoup" the large capitalization. No special profit deals reported -- standard royalty to creators Bob Gale & Alan Silvestri. Touring productions are planned, which producers hope will eventually turn a profit outside Broadway)
