## GPT Deep Research Output (Batch 3)

**Capitalization:** $23.5M confirmed (NYT / SEC filing Oct 2024).

**Recoupment:** No. Closed January 2025 without recouping despite $80M+ total ticket sales and 500+ performances.

**Weekly Running Cost:** IMPORTANT CORRECTION — Broadway Journal's $980K figure was the BREAKEVEN number (operating cost + recoupment amortization), NOT the pure operating nut.

- **$980K = breakeven** (includes ~$155K/week recoupment amortization over ~150-week projected run)
- **~$825K = pure operating nut** (the actual weekly cost to run the show)
- Previous data incorrectly treated $980K as weekly running cost

Even at the lower $825K nut, the show frequently grossed below breakeven — many weeks at $700-900K gross, meaning it couldn't even cover operating costs let alone repay investors.

**SVOG Grant:** NOT eligible. Back to the Future was a London production during the SVOG eligibility period (2020-2021). The West End production opened in 2021; the Broadway transfer didn't happen until 2023.

**NY Tax Credit:** Received $3M NY state theater tax credit.

**Notable:** West End production (opened Sept 2021) was more successful and is still running as of early 2026. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale retained significant underlying rights royalties as creators of the film franchise. The show's failure on Broadway despite strong IP illustrates the challenge of high-cost productions in large theaters (Winter Garden, 1,502 seats) that need $980K/week just to break even.
