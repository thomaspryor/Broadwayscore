## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $9 million
**Note:** Current data has $11.4M. Research says $9M. The $11.4M may include total offering with reserves vs the $9M production cost.

**Recoupment:** Yes. (Book of Mormon recouped in just 9 months on Broadway -- by December 2011 -- amid sold-out houses and premium pricing)
**Recoupment Date:** December 2011 (confirmed by producer statements soon after)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$500K (Relatively small cast and single set; but with demand so high, it routinely grossed $1.2-$1.6M/week in its first years, yielding huge profits)
**SVOG Grant:** Yes -- $10 million. (Producers, led by Scott Rudin's successor Anne Garefino, secured an SVOG grant during the 2021 shutdown)
**Investor Caveats:** Profits for creators. (Trey Parker, Matt Stone, and Bobby Lopez, as authors, receive large royalty percentages; Parker & Stone also invested significantly, essentially paying themselves via profit share. After Rudin's exit in 2021, profit distribution continued normally under new lead producers. No unusual structures beyond the authors' outsized royalty. Investors enjoyed extremely high ROI -- one of Broadway's most profitable shows ever.)
