## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $5.5 million
**Recoupment:** Yes. (The Ibsen revival starring Jeremy Strong recouped its $5.5M investment during its limited run)
**Recoupment Date:** June 2024 (announced by mid-June, ahead of its June 23 closing)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$400-500K (Circle in the Square production; broke house records in final week. Played to full houses at ~$800-900K/week gross, well above its cost, yielding profit)
**SVOG Grant:** No (opened 2024; no grant)
**Investor Caveats:** Star's sway. (Lead producer Scott Rudin withdrew, but star Jeremy Strong and co-star Michael Imperioli drew enough audience to make this drama a rare straight-play recoup. No unusual profit arrangements beyond standard royalty to adapter Amy Herzog; investors saw a return with a modest upside given the strictly limited engagement)
