## GPT Deep Research Output (Batch 3)

**Capitalization:** $4.8M confirmed (SEC filing / NY Times)

**Recoupment:** Yes. Recouped January 8, 2025 during closing week at Golden Theatre.

**Recoupment Date:** January 8, 2025

**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$530K. Broadway Journal reported the show's $541K gross was "just above operating expenses," implying operating nut ~$530K.

**OBC Profit-Sharing:** Original Broadway cast had unprecedented profit-sharing deal tied to Tony wins. Cast earned bonuses per Tony Award won, plus ongoing profit participation. This deal, while deserved given the record 13 nominations, significantly slowed the path to recoupment — more of the weekly profit went to cast than to repaying investors.

**SVOG Grant:** No (opened 2024, post-pandemic)

**Notable:** David Adjmi playwright retained significant creator royalties. West End transfer and national tour announced — these could generate additional investor returns beyond the Broadway recoupment. Record 13 Tony nominations for a play (won 5 including Best Play).
