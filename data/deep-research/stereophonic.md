## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $4 million
**Note:** Current data has $4.8M from "SEC filing / NY Times". Research says $4M. The $4.8M may include reserves beyond the production cost. Flagging discrepancy.

**Recoupment:** Yes. (Stereophonic -- 2024 Tony-winning Best Play -- recouped its original $4M investment by the end of its Broadway run)
**Recoupment Date:** January 8, 2025 (announced during closing week that the show had recouped)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$500K (Off-Broadway transfer played the Golden Theatre; pre-Tony it just covered ~$540K weekly costs. Post-Tony demand surged, with final week gross ~$1.0M ensuring profit)
**SVOG Grant:** No (opened 2024; not applicable)
**Investor Caveats:** Profit in extensions. (This David Adjmi rock-band drama had no stars, but earned a record 13 Tony nominations. Strong word-of-mouth led to multiple extensions and eventual recoupment. Standard investor terms -- no special royalty pools beyond usual creative royalties. Licensing rights quickly sold to Concord for future exploitation.)
