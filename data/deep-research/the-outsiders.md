## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $22 million (initial investment for the Broadway production).

**Recoupment:** Yes -- the show recouped its full $22M capitalization, an increasingly rare feat for a new musical of this size.

**Recoupment Date:** Achieved as of the week ending Dec. 28, 2025 (officially announced on Jan. 27, 2026). This means it took about 20 months from first preview to break even.

**Weekly Running Cost:** Not reported in press. (Independent analysts estimate a weekly operating "nut" in the mid-$700,000s, but no official figure has been published.)

**SVOG Grant:** None. (This show opened after the COVID shutdown period and did not receive a Shuttered Venue Operators Grant.)

**Insider/Investor Notes:** No reports of investor lawsuits or unconventional profit structures. The Outsiders was a standard commercial production. Its recoupment indicates investors have begun to see profits; producers have even announced plans for a West End production and tour, suggesting a healthy post-recoupment outlook. There were no known insider deals beyond typical royalty agreements (for example, author S.E. Hinton's underlying rights would warrant a royalty, but nothing extraordinary has been noted publicly).
