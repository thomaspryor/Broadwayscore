## GPT Deep Research Output

### Capitalization
**Amount:** $25 million
**Source:** Producer interview -- Chunsoo Shin (lead producer) confirmed the show is capitalized at $25 million. Reported via The Korea Times and Gordon Cox's industry newsletter.
**Confidence:** High (publicly reported by the production team).
**Notes:** Higher end for a new musical, reflecting the lavish production: onstage cars, elaborate 1920s sets, costumes, and a cast of 22. First Broadway musical led by a South Korean producer (OD Company).

### Weekly Running Costs
**Amount:** >$900,000 per week
**Source:** Producer/press info indicated weekly operating costs "ringing in at more than $900,000".
**Confidence:** High (directly cited in press; likely from the general management's estimates).
**Components:** Large ensemble of 22, full orchestra, Tony-winning period costumes, extensive projections and special effects. Broadway Theatre is high-capacity (~1,760 seats) with significant fixed costs.

### Recoupment Status
**Status:** Not Recouped (Unlikely)
**Estimated % recouped:** ~60% recovered as of Jan 2026. After ~1.5 years on Broadway (opened April 2024), over half recouped but momentum is slowing.
**Outlook:** Grosses have declined ~$250K/week in 2025 vs 2024. BroadwayWorld notes it "now appears unlikely" to recoup. Unless a major boost occurs, investors may settle for partial recoupment. Producer exploring international productions (Asia tour) which could eventually help.

### Financial Performance
- **Total gross to date:** ~$75-80 million (projected through Jan 2026)
- **Typical weekly gross:** $0.9-$1.2 million. Early run $1.1-$1.3M; by late 2025 closer to $900K.
- **Capacity %:** ~75-95%. Initially 90%+ (bolstered by student groups). Slipped to ~75-85% off-peak. Recent: 82%.
- **Break-even weekly gross:** ~$0.95-$1.0 million. Currently at ~$900K weeks, around break-even or slight loss.

### Tax Credits
**NY Musical Tax Credit:** Applied for 2024. Likely eligible for up to $3 million back. Began previews March 2024, well before the 2025 cut-off. If $3M is rebated, investors need only $22M from grosses to break even.

## Additional Research (Session 2)

A second research session provided additional context:
- Weekly running costs estimated at ~$800-850K (Reddit analysis) vs >$900K (Gordon Cox). The lower figure may exclude certain royalties.
- Recoupment estimated at 20-30% by a Jan 2026 Reddit analysis, vs ~60% from the first session. The discrepancy may reflect different calculation methodologies (gross profit vs net after all fees).
- Break-even weekly gross estimated at ~$0.95-1.0M. Many weeks just about breaking even or losing money.
- Grosses highly variable: $1.4M (95% cap) during holidays with Jeremy Jordan, down to $892K (82% cap) in Jan 2026 snowstorm.
- Producers have launched a national tour which could indirectly aid Broadway recoupment.
