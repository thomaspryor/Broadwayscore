## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $22-23 million (big-budget new musical with large design demands)
**MAJOR CORRECTION:** Current data has $14M. Research says $22-23M. The $14M may have been an earlier estimate or error.

**Recoupment:** No. (The Notebook struggled to find an audience and announced an early closing for Dec 15, 2024, without recouping)
**Recoupment Date:** N/A (show closed with investors incurring significant losses)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$1.2-1.3 million (Schoenfeld Theatre; required well over $1M/week to break even. Grosses remained below that -- one source called its run "struggling to find sufficient ticket buyers" -- hence it never hit profitable weeks)
**SVOG Grant:** No (opened spring 2024; no SVOG infusion)
**Investor Caveats:** Tour to salvage value. (Producers planned a post-Broadway tour to recoup some costs. Despite known IP from the novel/film, the musical did not catch on in NYC. No unique profit deals reported, aside from Nicholas Sparks's underlying rights and likely royalty. Ultimately investors faced a flop, hoping touring/licensing might recoup fractionally)
