## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $22 million (Broadway production budget, as reported).

**Recoupment:** No -- the show did not recoup its investment on Broadway. By its final performance (Feb. 22, 2026), the production had returned roughly 60% of the $22M capitalization to investors. In other words, investors incurred a loss of about 40% on the Broadway run (with hope that future licensing, tours or international productions might eventually make up the difference).

**Weekly Running Cost:** Approximately $750k-$775k per week (estimated). Industry analysts on the Broadway grosses indicated a weekly operating cost around $750,000 for Hell's Kitchen. (For example, in one mid-run week the show grossed about $911K with an estimated ~$775K "gross after fees," essentially breaking even that week.) This aligns with its large cast, live band, and elaborate production elements driving a high weekly "nut."

**SVOG Grant:** None. (Hell's Kitchen opened in 2024, well after theaters re-opened, so it was not eligible for the pandemic-era venue grant.)

**Insider/Investor Notes:** This production featured significant insider profit participation due to the involvement of Alicia Keys. Unusually, Keys was the sole above-the-title lead producer (a rare role for a celebrity) and also controlled underlying rights (her life story and song catalog). As such, Keys negotiated substantial royalties and profit shares: she earns fees for the use of her music and story, plus a bonus 10% of net profits once the show recoups, rising to 12.5% at 150% recoupment. Additionally, the operating agreement stipulates that at 200% recoupment, about 35% of net profits would be split among Keys and other insiders (the book writer, director, general manager, the Off-Broadway Public Theater, and even actors from the early workshop). These insider carve-outs mean that had the show been a hit, a large share of profits would go to creators/insiders before outside investors see returns. In Hell's Kitchen's case, the show never reached recoupment, so those profit-participation provisions never kicked in -- but the structure is notable. (For comparison, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on Broadway had a similarly outsized profit participation for rights holders/producers -- resulting in investors receiving only ~6% return on top of recoupment despite $456M grossed in NY.) No investor lawsuits have been reported for Hell's Kitchen; the investors' partial loss was a foreseeable risk given the high budget and running costs, and producers have signaled that tours and overseas productions may eventually improve the overall return.
