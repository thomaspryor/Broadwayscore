## GPT Deep Research Output

**Initial Capitalization (Budget):** $31.5 million -- This big-budget musical (produced by Universal Theatrical Group) is one of the most expensive Broadway productions in recent years.

**Weekly Running Costs:** $1.0-1.1 million per week (est.) -- Sources indicate the weekly "nut" (operating cost) exceeds $1 million, possibly around $900k-$1.05M depending on star salaries and premiums following award nominations.

**Recoupment Percentage (to date):** ~70-80% -- By October 2025, the show had grossed about $63M over 46 weeks, yielding roughly $21.6M (~70% of its $31.5M budget) in recouped investment. After strong holiday grosses and continued steady sales, industry chatter indicates it may be approaching ~80% recoupment as of early 2026.

**Likelihood to Recoup:** Uncertain / Long-Term -- Despite healthy grosses (averaging ~$1.3M weekly), fully recouping $31.5M will require an extended run. Analysts note it's "difficult to conceive" recoupment happening quickly (if at all) given the immense cost. The show is earning weekly profits, but at ~$150-450k per week it could need 1.5+ years of strong sales to break even.

**Break-Even Gross (Weekly):** ~$1.2 million -- Likely around the low-$1Millions. A weekly gross in the $1.1-1.2M range would roughly cover the production's running costs and royalty fees (e.g. a $1.35M gross yields an estimated ~$450k profit at a $900k nut).

**Tax Credit Status:** Approved -- Death Becomes Her applied for the New York City Musical and Theatrical Production Tax Credit and is estimated to receive the $3 million maximum rebate, providing a significant post-recoupment boost or cushion for investors.
