## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $6.5 million (SEC filings for Broadway transfer)
**Recoupment:** No (Not recouped as of closing. Limited run ended Feb 2026 without covering costs)
**Recoupment Date:** N/A (show did not recoup during its Broadway engagement)
**Weekly Running Cost:** Around $0.9-1.0 million (grosses hovered near $937K/week, roughly breakeven)
**SVOG Grant:** No (post-pandemic import; not eligible for 2021 grants)
**Investor Caveats:** None unusual. (Star-driven London transfer starring Mark Strong; standard profit-sharing. No recoupment means investors likely lost capital)
