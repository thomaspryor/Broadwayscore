## GPT Deep Research Output

### Capitalization
**Amount:** ~$8 million
**Source:** Forbes (Marc Hershberg) reported that producers raised only about $8M to bring this musical to Broadway.
**Confidence:** High (figure comes from a reputable business report).
**Notes:** Remarkably low capitalization for a Broadway musical in 2025. Reflects the show's small scale: a two-person romantic comedy that originated in Cambridge, UK. By comparison, the season's big musicals averaged ~$20M budgets.

### Weekly Running Costs
**Amount:** ~$480,000 per week
**Source:** Industry insider analysis (Broadway grosses forum) estimates a $0.48M weekly operating cost.
**Confidence:** Medium (not officially confirmed, but highly plausible given the show's minimal cast and production).
**Components:** Only 2 actors, small orchestra (a few onstage musicians doubling as cast), lighter crew needs. Sets and lighting imported from prior UK productions. Weekly nut under $500K -- on par with a play.

### Recoupment Status
**Status:** Not Recouped (Early Run)
**Estimated % recouped:** ~0% so far. Opened Nov 20, 2025, and as of late Jan 2026 has not returned any significant portion of its $8M investment.
**Outlook:** Grosses have been modest ($600-$700K range), barely breaking even. At that pace, recoupment would require well over a year of steady business. Likelihood to recoup: Low (as of now). The positive spin is that the downside risk is also smaller -- even a partial recoupment would not be as catastrophic as a $20M show flopping.

### Financial Performance
- **Total gross to date:** ~$6-7 million (through Jan 2026). Hit the $6 million mark by mid-January.
- **Typical weekly gross:** $0.6-$0.8 million. In its first full week of previews, ~$620K. By late January: $620,536 (79% capacity, $94 avg ticket).
- **Capacity %:** ~75-90%. Over 90% in early November, slipped to ~80% by January.
- **Break-even weekly gross:** ~$0.55-$0.60 million. At $620K gross, approximately at breakeven.

### Tax Credits
**NY Musical Tax Credit:** None (ineligible). First paid performance was Nov 1, 2025, which missed the Oct 20, 2025 cutoff. A $2M credit (25% of $8M) would have greatly improved recoupment odds.

## Additional Research (Session 2)

A second research session confirmed the same figures and added:
- Forbes explicitly cited ~$480K weekly running costs (high confidence, from producers).
- Described as "the most investor friendly new musical since the pandemic."
- Break-even ~$550-600K gross. Even in off weeks ($620K), the show is around breakeven.
- Producer Kevin McCollum known for lean, investor-friendly projects.
- Likelihood to recoup rated HIGH by industry observers due to extremely low cost structure.
- No NY tax credit (missed Oct 20, 2025 deadline). A $2M credit (25% of $8M) would have helped significantly.
