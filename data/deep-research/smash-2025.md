## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** Up to $23 million. An SEC Form D filing shows an offering of $23 million for Smash, with about $20 million actually raised from investors. (Trade press described it as "nearly $20 million" budgeted.)

**Recoupment:** No. The musical did not recoup. It had a brief run (April-June 2025) and underperformed financially. As industry commentary noted, with its hefty budget, Smash "would not come close to recouping" its costs.

**Recoupment Date:** Not applicable (closed without recouping).

**Weekly Running Cost:** Not officially reported. The show opened strong (grossing around $1 million in its early weeks) but later fell to about $650K/week in grosses, which was far below its break-even level. Given the large cast and production, insiders estimated its weekly operating "nut" to be in the high six figures (likely around $800K+). No formal figure was released.

**SVOG Grant:** None. (This was a new post-pandemic production; no SVOG grant received.)

**Notable Investor/Lawsuit/Deal:** No investor lawsuits surfaced publicly. The production had high-profile producers (including Steven Spielberg, Robert Greenblatt, and Neil Meron) and creative team, but its failure was attributed to the high costs and mixed reviews rather than any specific investor dispute. No unusual profit-sharing structures were reported -- in fact, the show closed early after a Tony Awards shutout, illustrating the financial risk even with a known IP.
