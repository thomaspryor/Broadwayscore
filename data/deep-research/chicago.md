## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $3 million (approx.; very low budget revival originated as Encores! concert)
**Recoupment:** Yes. (Recouped in just 19 weeks -- by Spring 1997 -- given its minimalist staging and strong sales)
**Recoupment Date:** March 1997 (roughly; the Weisslers likely recouped before the Tonys of that year)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$250K (Lean production with simple set and orchestra on stage; even in 1997 it was grossing ~$400-500K/week, hence immediate profitability. In recent years, Chicago grosses ~$600-800K weekly at ~90% capacity, still comfortably above costs.)
**SVOG Grant:** Yes -- $10 million. (Long-running Chicago received SVOG support in 2021 to help reopen)
**Investor Caveats:** Unique genesis, simple finances. (Chicago was transferred from City Center Encores with funding by Fran and Barry Weissler. It had no set and limited costumes, keeping running costs extremely low. The Weisslers did not involve outside above-the-title investors -- they and a small group financed it and thus enjoy its extraordinary long-term returns. No unusual profit pools beyond standard royalty to creators Kander & Ebb/Fosse estate.)
