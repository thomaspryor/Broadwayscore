## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** ~$5-6 million (relatively low-budget concert-style musical)
**Recoupment:** Yes. (Six swiftly recouped its investment; producers confirmed recoupment by its 600th performance in March 2023)
**Recoupment Date:** March 26, 2023 (announcement made just before that date)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$400K (Small cast of 6 + band; strong sales often $1M+ weekly meant a wide profit margin. E.g. in fall 2022, Six grossed ~$1.2M/week at 100% capacity, far above its modest weekly nut)
**SVOG Grant:** Yes -- $10 million. (Six received a full $10M SBA grant as a shutdown-impacted show)
**Investor Caveats:** Lean hit with grant boost. (Six's simple staging and short runtime kept costs low, aiding a fast recoup. The $10M SVOG infusion provided an extra cushion in 2021, effectively de-risking the production. Profit-sharing is standard; no unusual royalties beyond authors' share. Notably, Six was one of only a handful of new musicals to recoup post-pandemic.)
