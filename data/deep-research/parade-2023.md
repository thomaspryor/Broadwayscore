## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $7 million. The revival was capitalized at about $6.5-7 million. (Of that, roughly $5.7 million was production cost and the rest was reserved for bonds, fees, etc. per investor filings.)

**Recoupment:** Unconfirmed (likely partial). Parade had a limited engagement (March-August 2023). It was not officially announced as having recouped. Due to strong demand (especially after winning the Tony Award for Best Revival), the production likely earned back a substantial portion of its costs but did not run long enough to fully recoup the entire capitalization (especially the reserve portion).

**Recoupment Date:** Not applicable. (No full recoupment during its planned limited run; no date announced.)

**Weekly Running Cost:** Approx. $659K (base). The producers' budget indicated fixed weekly operating expenses of about $659,000 (before royalties) for the run. In practice, the show grossed around $1 million weekly on average, which, with a New York State tax credit, was nearly enough to cover its costs during the engagement.

**SVOG Grant:** None. (The revival opened after Broadway's shutdown period and did not receive a federal SVOG grant. It did, however, qualify for a $3 million NY state production tax credit which significantly offset costs.)

**Notable Investor/Lawsuit/Deal:** No investor lawsuits or unusual deals reported. The production was backed by Seaview/ATG and relied on the popularity of star Ben Platt. Financial planning for the show notably factored in the state tax credit to shorten the recoupment window, which reflects a common insider strategy but not a controversial one. No other insider arrangements were publicized.
