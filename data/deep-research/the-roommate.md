## Key Finding: Recoupment Was Incorrectly Listed

Our previous data had `recouped: true` based on circular reasoning ("Inferred from Easy Winner designation"). The deep research already flagged this as unconfirmed. This new analysis confirms the show did NOT recoup:
1. No trade press announcement (Deadline, Variety, Playbill, Broadway Journal all silent)
2. Other 2024-25 plays that recouped (Oh, Mary!, Romeo + Juliet) were explicitly reported
3. Weekly grosses (~$465K avg) barely covered estimated weekly nut (~$450K)
4. Only 15-week run — insufficient time to earn back $4.8M from marginal operating profit

## Detailed Research (Feb 2026)

### Capitalization

Broadway plays of this scale typically raise around $4-5 million in initial capital. The Roommate was reportedly capitalized in the vicinity of $4.8 million, a figure consistent with similar straight plays that season. For example, another 2024 play (All In: A Comedy About Love) had an initial capitalization of $4.8 million according to SEC filings. While a Form D for The Roommate was filed with the SEC (as is customary for Broadway offerings), the exact amount isn't publicly quoted in press; however, multiple industry sources indicate a roughly $5 million budget was raised for the production, aligning with the reported $4.8 million target.

### Recoupment Status

The Roommate did not recoup its investment during its limited Broadway run (August 29 - December 15, 2024). No credible trade outlet announced a recoupment, which almost certainly would have been publicized if the show had earned back its $4.8M capitalization. In fact, by closing, The Roommate had only run about 15 weeks - a relatively short timeframe to earn back a multi-million dollar investment - and there were no reports in Deadline, Variety, Playbill, or Broadway Journal confirming recoupment. (By contrast, other plays that did recoup in the 2024-25 season, such as Oh, Mary! and Romeo + Juliet, were explicitly reported as having done so.) The absence of any such announcement for The Roommate indicates that the show closed at a loss for its investors.

### Weekly Running Cost

The exact weekly operating cost (or "nut") for The Roommate has not been published, but it can be estimated from comparable productions. Industry chatter suggests the weekly break-even for this two-person star vehicle was on the order of a few hundred thousand dollars (mid-six figures). By way of comparison, small-cast plays can sometimes run with costs under $300k per week, though The Roommate likely had a higher nut due to its two above-the-title stars. For instance, The Play That Goes Wrong (another Broadway play, capitalized at $4M) had a weekly operating expense < $300,000. Given Patti LuPone and Mia Farrow's involvement (commanding high salaries) and a Tony-winning creative team, insiders estimated The Roommate's weekly expenses in roughly the $400-500k per week range. This means the play needed to gross around half a million dollars weekly to cover costs. In reality, the reported grosses often hovered in the high-$400k range (e.g. ~$487k in a November week), implying the show was barely breaking even or losing money most weeks.

### SVOG Grant

The Shuttered Venue Operators Grant (SVOG) was a federal COVID-relief program mainly benefitting shows and venues that were active (or in development) when the pandemic shut theaters in 2020-2021. The Roommate's Broadway run occurred in late 2024, well after theaters had reopened, so it did not receive an SVOG grant.

### Investor Caveats and Profit Participation

- **New York State Tax Credit:** The production was eligible for the New York City Musical and Theatrical Production Tax Credit, a one-time subsidy of up to $3 million for running shows. This credit (available to Broadway shows opening from 2021 through 2025) can refund a portion of production expenses, reducing the loss or enhancing profits for investors. In practice, many "modest" productions like The Roommate apply for this credit - but the payouts are slow and not guaranteed to the full $3M.
- **Profit Participation for Artists:** Both stars received sizable weekly salaries, and it's rumored they had profit participation deals (though the show never became profitable enough for this to kick in). The playwright (Jen Silverman) received a royalty on weekly gross receipts from day one - these are "carved out" as operating expenses, meaning they are paid even if the show hasn't recouped.
- **Producer Fees and Distributions:** The lead producer (Chris Harper) and managing producers collected standard fees (a weekly producer fee and an office/general management fee built into the operating costs).
- **No unusual accounting arrangements** were reported.
