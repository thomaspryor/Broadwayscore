## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** Approximately $4.8 million (reported budget for the Broadway run).

**Recoupment:** Unconfirmed. No official trade press announcement of recoupment was made by the time the show closed in January 2025. (Industry data aggregators list it as an "easy winner" that may have broken even during its limited engagement, but this has not been confirmed in the press.)

**Recoupment Date:** N/A -- no confirmed recoupment as of closing.

**Weekly Running Cost:** Not publicly reported. (As a two-hander play with star casting, its weekly operating costs were not disclosed in trade outlets.)

**SVOG Grant:** None. (Opened post-pandemic, so it was not eligible for Shuttered Venue Operators Grant relief.)

**Insider/Investor Notes:** No notable investor lawsuits or unusual profit-sharing arrangements were reported for this production. This was a limited 16-week run starring Patti LuPone and Mia Farrow, and its finances appear straightforward (standard royalty agreements to the playwright, etc., with no public indication of insider deals beyond typical star compensation).
