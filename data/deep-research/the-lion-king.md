## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $20 million (approx.; Disney's largest stage investment of the 90s)
**Note:** Current data has $25M. Research says $20M. Flagging discrepancy -- the $25M may include marketing/reserves.

**Recoupment:** Yes. (Recouped in under 9 months -- by summer 1998 -- thanks to packed houses and high ticket demand)
**Recoupment Date:** July 1998 (est.; Disney did not formally announce, but industry reports confirm it earned back roughly by its first anniversary)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$700-800K (Initially, Lion King grossed ~$1.0M/week at the New Amsterdam in 1998. In recent years it grosses $2M+ weekly. Its cost structure is high but long-run economies and constant sell-outs make it one of Broadway's top profit generators.)
**SVOG Grant:** No. (Disney did not publicly seek SVOG for Lion King; as a deep-pocketed corporate producer, it likely absorbed pandemic losses internally)
**Investor Caveats:** Royalties and corporate financing. (Director Julie Taymor initially had an unusually high royalty. Disney retains lion's share of profits. No outside investors -- Disney funded it wholly. Lion King stands as Broadway's most profitable show ever, with no unconventional investor structures.)
