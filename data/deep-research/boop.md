## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** Est. $18-20 million (new large-cast Betty Boop musical)
**Note:** Current data has $26M from NY Times. The research estimates $18-20M. This is a significant discrepancy -- the NYT figure may include reserves or total offering vs production cost. Keeping $26M as primary source (NYT higher confidence) but flagging the lower estimate.

**Recoupment:** No. (Boop! closed July 13, 2025 after 112 performances without recouping)
**Recoupment Date:** N/A (run ended short of breakeven)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$800K+ (Insiders estimated an $800K+ weekly operating cost versus only ~$500K weekly gross -- a significant shortfall)
**SVOG Grant:** No (post-COVID premiere; not eligible for 2021 grants)
**Investor Caveats:** Costly IP & poor sales. (Owned by Fleischer Studios, requiring hefty licensing royalties; struggled at ~60% attendance. Recoupment was unlikely as Boop! "has struggled to break even $500k week after week". No profit pools materialized for investors)
