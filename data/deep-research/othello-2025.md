## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $9 million
**Recoupment:** Yes. (Recouped in approx. 9-10 weeks on Broadway)
**Recoupment Date:** May 1, 2025 (producers announced recoupment as of that date)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$1.3-1.5 million gross (Grosses routinely hit $2.8M/week early in the run, far above the ~$900K break-even, ensuring rapid payback)
**SVOG Grant:** No (opened after pandemic shutdown; not SVOG-dependent)
**Investor Caveats:** Sky-high prices. (Starring Denzel Washington & Jake Gyllenhaal, with premium tickets nearing $900. Producers leveraged star power for box-office records, but no special profit-sharing beyond typical arrangements. Recoupment achieved before limited run ended)
