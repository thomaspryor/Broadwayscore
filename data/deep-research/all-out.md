## GPT Deep Research Output

**Initial Capitalization (Budget):** ~$6-8 million (estimated) -- All Out is a unique Broadway offering: a live comedy show consisting of star-studded short story readings (and a follow-up to last season's hit All In). While no official budget is published, its predecessor All In had a relatively low capitalization (on the order of ~$6M, inferred from a $1.47M tax credit award). All Out likely raised a similar mid-seven-figure sum, relying on a lean production (minimal set/tech, rotating celebrity cast).

**Weekly Running Costs:** Low (~$200-300k per week) -- As essentially a series of staged readings with a small company, All Out operates far more cheaply than a typical play or musical. The cast rotates in four-person sets, and the technical demands are modest (no elaborate sets or large chorus to pay). Theater rental and marketing are the main expenses. Anecdotally, its cost structure is comparable to a limited-engagement play; for context, All In's weekly nut was likely in this few-hundred-thousand range, given it turned a profit on sub-$1M grosses.

**Recoupment Percentage (to date):** High (on track to 100%) -- All Out opened in late 2025 and has been a sell-out hit, often grossing around $1.0-1.1M per week at ~95% capacity. With such strong revenue against low costs, it's generating significant weekly profit (possibly $600K+ per week). This means a large portion of its investment was recouped within the first couple of months. By early 2026, it's expected to have returned most, if not all, of its ~$6-8M capitalization to producers. (All In notably recouped in under 15 weeks last year, a feat All Out is poised to repeat.)

**Likelihood to Recoup:** Highly Likely -- Given its short planned run (limited engagement through March 8, 2026) and consistently high grosses, All Out is all but certain to recoup by closing. The show's model -- big-name comedians and actors in a low-cost format -- has proven profitable. Barring an abrupt drop in sales, investors will see their full return (and likely a tidy profit) by the end of the engagement.

**Break-Even Gross (Weekly):** ~$400-500k -- The break-even point is relatively low. A gross in the mid-$400K range would probably cover All Out's weekly expenses. In reality, the show has been doubling that threshold -- for example, one week it grossed $1.07M over 7 performances (95% capacity). This means it is operating far above its break-even, ensuring profitability each week.

**Tax Credit Status:** Not Applicable -- All Out began performances in late 2025, after the state's tax credit fund was temporarily depleted. Unlike many shows earlier in 2025, it did not secure a production tax credit (its timing missed the application window). However, its predecessor All In did receive a credit, and if the program is renewed in 2026, the producers might retroactively apply for All Out. For now, though, no tax rebate is factored into its recoupment.
