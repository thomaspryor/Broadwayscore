## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $4.525 million
**Recoupment:** Yes. (Oh, Mary! recouped its entire $4.525M investment -- the first show of the 2024-25 season to do so)
**Recoupment Date:** November 25, 2024 (producers announced recoupment after 5 months of sold-out performances)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$300K (Ran at the Lyceum; broke the house gross record 10 separate weeks, most recently $1.226M in a week -- far above its ~$300-350K weekly expense, indicating robust profits)
**SVOG Grant:** No (post-pandemic new play; no SVOG)
**Investor Caveats:** Extended hit. (Cole Escola's one-act cabaret comedy extended twice due to demand. With near-100% sellouts, it recouped quickly -- an outlier success. No unusual profit-sharing beyond standard royalties, though Escola as writer-star presumably took a creator royalty and profit share)
