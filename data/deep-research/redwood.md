## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $16 million (Broadway debut of Idina Menzel's passion project; "capitalized for up to $16M" per NYT)
**Recoupment:** No. (Redwood closed May 18, 2025 -- three months early -- without recouping)
**Recoupment Date:** N/A (never reached break-even; shut down after Tony shutout)
**Weekly Running Cost:** High. (Large-scale new musical with aerial choreography -- needed ~$1M/week to profit, but struggled at ~75-80% capacity; closing week gross only $554K)
**SVOG Grant:** No (post-shutdown premiere; not SVOG-funded)
**Investor Caveats:** Star co-productions. (Idina Menzel co-conceived and co-produced via her Loudmouth Media company, so she held an insider stake. Despite strong reviews, weak sales forced early closing, leaving investors with losses. No evidence of profit pool distribution due to non-recoupment)
