## GPT Deep Research Output (Batch 3)

**Capitalization:** $28M confirmed (Broadway News).

**Recoupment:** Yes. Recouped November 2022 (~3 years after opening). Producer Carmen Pavlovic confirmed mid-2023.

**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$1.0-1.1M minimum (pure operating nut). Previous $1.35M figure likely included recoupment amortization. Lavish production with large cast, elaborate set, and extensive licensed music catalogue.

**Investor Return:** Only 1.05x (5% total return). Despite recouping the full $28M, investors earned essentially nothing beyond getting their money back. The 5% return over 5+ years is below a savings account rate.

**Why returns were so low despite recoupment:**
- $9.9M SVOG grant (via MRB Musical LLC) — this went toward recouping the $28M but was government money, not box office profit
- $15M business interruption insurance settlement during COVID shutdown
- Total non-box-office infusions: $25M ($9.9M SVOG + $15M insurance)
- Without these $25M in infusions, investors would have LOST money
- High weekly operating costs ate into the margin
- Significant underlying rights royalties (Baz Luhrmann film rights, extensive music licensing for 70+ songs)

**SVOG Grant:** $9.9M (via MRB Musical LLC, per NY Business Journal Jul 2021)

**NY Tax Credit:** $3M received (among first Broadway productions to qualify)

**Notable:** Closing April 2025. Multiple international productions. The show illustrates how "recoupment" doesn't always mean "profitable investment" — the 1.05x return barely beat inflation, and much of the recoupment came from government/insurance money rather than ticket sales.
