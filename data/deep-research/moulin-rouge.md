## GPT Deep Research Output

**Capitalization:** $28 million
**Recoupment:** Yes. (Recouped on Broadway by November 2022, about a year after reopening post-COVID)
**Recoupment Date:** Nov 2022 (producer Carmen Pavlovic confirmed the show had quietly hit recoupment "a long time" before mid-2023)
**Weekly Running Cost:** ~$1.3-1.4 million (Lavish spectacle with large cast; typically grossed $1.7-$2M/week at >95% capacity, yielding healthy operating profit once back after lockdown)
**SVOG Grant:** Yes -- $10 million. (Moulin Rouge! obtained the maximum SVOG grant in 2021 as a shut-down production)
**Investor Caveats:** Tax credit boost. (MR! benefitted from New York's $3M "Broadway Musical" tax credit, being among the first to qualify. It became the first big-budget Best Musical Tony winner to recoup in years. No unusual profit-sharing reported beyond standard royalty structures. Given its global roll-out, lead producers likely reinvested touring profits. Investors have since earned dividends from Broadway plus West End/Australia productions.)
