   - URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/theater/operation-mincemeat-review.html
   - Rating: Mixed
   - Score: 62
   - Quote: "I enjoyed it well enough, but would have enjoyed it much more if the jokes landed harder. Whether 'Operation Mincemeat' works as well will depend a lot on your answer to that question: But is it funny?"

2. **Vulture** - Sara Holdren
   - URL: https://www.vulture.com/article/operation-mincemeat-broadway-review.html
   - Rating: Positive
   - Score: 78
   - Quote: "Operation Mincemeat isn't exactly blazingly clever—the jokes fly thick and fast, and they tend toward broad grin-crackers rather than breathless zingers—but it overflows with good humor and heartfelt commitment."

   - Rating: Negative
   - Score: 42
