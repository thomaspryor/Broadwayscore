### Tier 1 Reviews

1. **The New York Times** - Jesse Green
   - URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/01/theater/mj-musical-review.html
   - Rating: Mixed
   - Score: 65
   - Quote: "Michael Jackson was such a magnet for strange stories that they nearly obliterated his gift. Yet in defensively brushing off the ones that don't matter while pointedly ignoring the one that does, the new musical 'MJ' may be the strangest Michael Jackson story yet."

2. **Vulture** - Helen Shaw
   - URL: https://www.vulture.com/2022/02/theater-review-mj-michael-jackson-bio-musical-broadway-nyc.html
   - Rating: Negative
   - Score: 45
   - Quote: "Is it possible to make a show about a man whose memory dwells under deep shadow? Of course it is. But you do then have to make a good show. MJ is a Frankenstein's monster constantly tugging apologetically at its forelock."

3. **Variety** - Naveen Kumar
   - URL: https://variety.com/2022/legit/reviews/mj-review-michael-jackson-broadway-musical-1235168798/
   - Rating: Mixed
   - Score: 62
   - Quote: "In answer to the question of whether it's possible to separate the art from the artist, 'MJ' performs a slick, crotch-grabbing sidestep."

4. **Time Out New York** - Adam Feldman
   - URL: https://www.timeout.com/newyork/theater/mj-broadway-review-michael-jackson-musical
   - Rating: 3/5 stars
   - Score: 60
   - Quote: "The authorized biomusical MJ wants very much to freeze Michael Jackson in 1992: It's a King of Pop-sical."

5. **The Hollywood Reporter** - Lovia Gyarkye
   - URL: https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/arts/mj-broadway-review-lynn-nottage-1235085086/
   - Rating: Positive
   - Score: 80
   - Quote: "MJ, like its subject, is captivating and hard to shake. The musical takes audiences through Jackson's life and catalog with impressive ease."

6. **The Washington Post** - Peter Marks
   - URL: https://www.washingtonpost.com/theater-dance/2022/02/01/mj-michael-jackson-musical/
   - Rating: Positive
   - Score: 82
   - Quote: "Filled with exhilarating versions of the songs Jackson made into music videos and took on world tours, 'MJ' is a dance musical of the first rank."

7. **The Guardian**
   - URL: https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/01/mj-the-musical-review-broadway
   - Rating: Positive
   - Score: 80
   - Quote: "The 'Thriller' number is a carnival of MJ's psychological demons – the toll of perfectionism and the ghosts of bad ideologies – and brought the house down."

### Tier 2 Reviews

7. **Deadline** - Greg Evans
   - URL: https://deadline.com/2022/02/mj-broadway-review-michael-jackson-musical-1234922944/
   - Rating: Positive
   - Score: 85
   - Quote: "Director-choreographer Christopher Wheeldon and book writer Lynn Nottage bring to pulse-quickening life on the stage the undeniable talent becoming unavoidable genius."

8. **The Wrap** - Robert Hofler
   - URL: https://www.thewrap.com/mj-broadway-review-michael-jackson/
   - Rating: Negative
   - Score: 40
   - Quote: "'MJ' is a jukebox musical that is nothing but the late King of Pop's greatest hits. And that is only one of the minor offenses on display."

9. **New York Daily News** - Chris Jones
   - URL: https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/broadway/ny-broadway-mj-review-michael-jackson-20220201-qgfajhkotfdwlnwm5ert2umnzm-story.html
   - Rating: Positive
   - Score: 78
   - Quote: "The show is genuinely beautiful to experience throughout, which one almost never can say about jukebox musicals."

10. **New York Post** - Johnny Oleksinski
    - URL: https://nypost.com/2022/02/01/mj-review-michael-jackson-broadway-show-sanitizes-his-life/
    - Rating: Negative
    - Score: 42
    - Quote: "The troubles over at 'MJ: The Musical' are much bigger than the controversy surrounding its subject. The lifeless script feels as if it was co-authored by a lawyer for the Jackson estate."

11. **Associated Press** - Mark Kennedy
    - URL: https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-music-reviews-arts-and-entertainment-michael-jackson-46719c4c14753f3f01008318fe3c1057
    - Rating: Mixed
    - Score: 60
    - Quote: "The new, splashy Broadway musical about Michael Jackson begins with the King of Pop plotting an ambitious tour to reclaim his throne. But logic has little to do with 'MJ.'"

12. **Rolling Stone** - David Browne
    - URL: https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-live-reviews/micheal-jackson-musical-review-1292818/
    - Rating: Mixed
    - Score: 58
    - Quote: "MJ ends without any updates on Jackson's life after 1992, which is likely to gratify some and infuriate others."

13. **TheaterMania** - Zachary Stewart
    - URL: https://www.theatermania.com/broadway/reviews/review-mj-michael-jackson-musical-broadway_93307.html
    - Rating: Positive
    - Score: 78
    - Quote: "MJ is for the millions of Michael Jackson fans whose fealty to the King of Pop remains unbroken. I suspect it's going to be a big fat hit."

14. **Broadway News** - Charles Isherwood
    - URL: https://broadwaynews.com/2022/02/01/review-a-flashy-mj-dazzles-and-distracts-with-dance/
    - Rating: Negative
    - Score: 45
    - Quote: "For all its surface flash and stylish presentation, 'MJ' comes across as superficial fan-bait: a glossy but unrevelatory moonwalk through the ups and downs of Jackson's career."

15. **Theatrely** - Juan A. Ramirez
    - URL: https://www.theatrely.com/post/mj-the-musical-is-a-monument-to-misconduct-review
    - Rating: Negative
    - Score: 40
    - Quote: "The sharp, talented cast sold me on music Jackson himself often couldn't, but the show raises a defiant middle finger to anyone who dares bring up concerns about the late performer's conduct."

16. **The Daily Beast** - Tim Teeman
    - URL: https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/mj-broadway-review-michael-jackson-absolutely-loses-her-mind/
    - Rating: Negative
    - Score: 42

17. **New York Stage Review** - Elysa Gardner
    - URL: https://nystagereview.com/2022/02/01/mj-the-man-in-the-mire/
    - Rating: 3/5 stars
    - Score: 60
    - Quote: "MJ neither defends its subject from the most serious charges against him nor urges us to distinguish between the artist and his art. It's at its most winning when song and dance are in progress."

18. **New York Stage Review** - Jesse Oxfeld
    - URL: https://nystagereview.com/2022/02/01/mj-michael-jackson-jukebox-musical-is-very-smooth-somewhat-criminal/
    - Rating: 3/5 stars
    - Score: 60
    - Quote: "MJ is big and loud; it is joyful and joyous. The music grooves, the dancing glides, the crowd bops. A song-and-dance delight that asks you to forget the biography."

19. **New York Theatre Guide** - Ayanna Prescod
    - URL: https://www.newyorktheatreguide.com/reviews/mj-the-musical-broadway-review
    - Rating: 5/5 stars
    - Score: 95
    - Quote: "MJ is the platinum standard... the perfect salutation to the life of an imperfect but gifted icon."

### Tier 3 Reviews

20. **New York Theater** - Jonathan Mandell
    - URL: https://newyorktheater.me/2022/02/01/mj-the-musical-review/
    - Rating: Mixed
    - Score: 62
    - Quote: "Myles Frost nails Michael Jackson's gentle smile and his high-pitched speaking voice. What counts is how exciting he is when he's singing and, especially, dancing."
