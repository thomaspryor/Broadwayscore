It wants to blame everything sad and weird about Jackson on others (especially the press, who are equated with the zombies in âThrillerâ) but credit him alone for his every good deed and success.

Like Summer and The Cher Show before it, MJ uses three actors to play its central character at different ages. As the 1992 incarnation, Frost carries the bulk of the role, and not only nails Jacksonâs signature sound and movesâyes, of course thereâs a moonwalkâbut also his otherworldly affect: his diffident grandiosity, his mixture of grievance and mischief, his high and breathy way of talking (at once floaty and determined, like Diana Rossâs spoken-word section of âAinât No Mountain High Enoughâ).\"",

If this is the future, please send it back.”",

It cruises along in a low gear for almost three hours.”",
