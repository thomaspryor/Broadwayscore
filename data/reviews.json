Sure, that's retro, but it suits the light-hearted material as well as a Disney crowd who probably prefers familiar formats. Casey Nicholaw, an ace director-choreographer, maintains a slightly tongue-in-cheek quality throughout the fast-moving show, especially in his frisky dances that, with their sinuous arm gestures, synchronized moves and general acrobatics, often suggest Bollywood production numbers. A lively and good-looking ensemble expertly undulates through the sometimes zany choreography.",

That would be James Monroe Iglehart, in the role memorably voiced by Robin Williams in the 1992 animated hit. Every time this Genie's on stage, it's as if \"Aladdin\" were mainlining Red Bull. Iglehart works so hard during his big number, you fear for his health - that is, when you're not laughing your head off. And then there's the rest of the show...The whole vibe is like a throwback to those old Bob Hope/Bing Crosby movies: \"The Road to Agrabah.\" But the journey may be a short one - leaving the beautiful New Amsterdam Theatre free just in time for the \"Frozen\" musical to move in.",

Since a certain blockbuster feline arrived well over a decade ago, Broadway has been lapped by wave after wave of big, often gloppy songfests adapted from animated movies, mostly from the mother ship, Disney. So the prospect of Aladdin, promising another weary night in the presence of a spunky youngster and wisecracking animals, didn’t exactly set my heart racing. But this latest musical adapted from one of Disney’s popular movies, which opened on Thursday night at the New Amsterdam Theater, defied my dour expectations. As directed and choreographed (and choreographed, and choreographed) by Casey Nicholaw, and adapted by the book writer Chad Beguelin, Aladdin has an infectious and only mildly syrupy spirit. Not to mention enough baubles, bangles and beading to keep a whole season of RuPaul’s Drag Race contestants in runway attire.",

By Marilyn Stasio Plus Icon Marilyn Stasio Theater Critic Latest &#8216;Bob Fosse&#8217;s Dancin&#8221; Review: A Rapturous Broadway Homage to a Great Choreographer 3 years ago ‘Pictures From Home’ Review: Nathan Lane Leads Well-Acted but Dull Broadway Play 3 years ago ‘The Collaboration’ Review: Paul Bettany and Jeremy Pope Play Art-World Icons on Broadway 3 years ago See All The magic-carpet ride is magical. The Cave of Wonders is wonderful. And yes, you&#8217;ll hear the tunes you loved in the 1992 movie. But the notion that &#8220; Disney Aladdin &#8221; somehow resurrects the spirit of the late Howard Ashman, who had the original inspiration for the movie and contributed most of its clever lyrics, is a joke. Restoring a person&#8217;s work without respecting his artistic sensibility is no tribute at all. If this super-costly Disney extravaganza doesn&#8217;t really represent Ashman&#8217;s artistic vision, whose vision does it reflect? Chad Beguelin (&#8220;Elf,&#8221; &#8220;The Wedding Singer&#8221;), who wrote the book and contributed new lyrics, obviously plays a significant role, as does Alan Menken, who scored the film and wrote new songs for the show. Even more so does helmer-choreographer Casey Nicholaw (&#8220;The Book of Mormon&#8221;), who stylistically turns the film&#8217;s romantic fairy-tale adventure into shtick comedy. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-variety-article-mid-article-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\",\"mid-article\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[300,250],[2,2],[300,251],[2,4],[4,2],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Related Stories &#039;Euphoria&#039; Season 3 Trailer: Zendaya, Sydney Sweeney and Jacob Elordi Return as Rue Battles Drug Dealers, Cassie Becomes a Cam Girl and More",

      "pullQuote": "Allow Juliet to reintroduce herself. Or rather, let Anne Hathaway do it for her. No, not the Oscar-winning actress known for \"The Devil Wears Prada.\" The Anne Hathaway I'm referring to is William Shakespeare's wife, the presumed inspiration behind his most famous love story, \"Romeo & Juliet.\" In the new musical \"& Juliet,\" however, Hathaway insists on being more than a muse. Unsatisfied with her husband's affinity for tragedy, Hathaway steps up as co-auteur of a new version of the age-old story, one in which Juliet never takes a dagger to the heart, but rather, a trip to Paris with her besties. The confetti-laden chaos that ensues in David West Read's hyper new musical currently running at Broadway's Stephen Sondheim Theatre is part-pop music fantasia, part-failed feminist retelling, but all heart.\n\nIn tone, \"& Juliet\" strays further from the Elizabethan haughtiness of most Shakespearean adaptations. Nearly all of the musical's score is arranged from the biggest hits of prominent songwriter/producer Max Martin, but the script still flirts with the Shakes' signature stylings: the quadratic love story, for instance. As previously mentioned, Juliet (a flawless Lorna Courtney) ditches the streets of Verona for Paris. Her best friends May (Justin David Sullivan) and April (Betsy Wolfe) join the adventure. Wolfe primarily plays Anne Hathaway, but the new co-scribe's eagerness compels her to jump into her own remixed story, much to the chagrin of her Bard of a husband (Stark Sands). At a Parisian club, May (who is genderqueer) has a meet-cute with Francois (Philippe Arroyo), a charming young musician flailing under the pressure of his combatant French father, Lance (Paulo Szot). But suddenly, Francois' lips lock with Juliet's (they're more friends than lust-struck lovers, but each character sees the other as a means to escape the overbearing demands of their parents). Heartbreakingly, May witnesses Juliet and Francois kiss, but (in true twentysomething fashion) says nothing.\n\n            This post is for paying subscribers only\n            Subscribe now\n            Already have an account?

What if she had not let brash youthful narcissism deformed by the patriarchy and male violence overtake her better judgment and lived a full, happy, maybe even quiet life well into whatever passed for adulthood in 14th Century Verona. Directed by Luke Sheppard and choreographed by Jennifer Weber, & Juliet, the new jukebox musical of songs written by super-producer Max Martin (&#8220;and friends,&#8221; as the credits read), with a book by Schitt&#8217;s Creek writer David West Read, posits an answer to all those questions, though &#8220;quiet&#8221; never quite enters the equation. No, had Juliet lived, this musical, opening tonight on Broadway at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre, suggests she and her pals would spend a great deal of their time belting ballads of empowerment and lecturing all within earshot about pride, identity and other important takeaways of the 21st Century. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-dsk-tab-mid-article1-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid-article\",\"300x251\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[2,2],[300,250],[620,350],[300,251],[501,282],[3,3],[2,4],[4,2],[620,366]]) .exemptFromSleep() .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Related Stories Casting &#039;Just In Time&#039;: Jeremy Jordan To Succeed Jonathan Groff As Broadway&#039;s Bobby Darin",

While there is every reason to be skeptical of a Shakespearean jukebox musical, \"& Juliet\" makes it work remarkably well. It's the most fun you'll have in a Broadway theater right now. \"& Juliet\" features 32 songs by Max Martin and a rotating group of collaborators (officially credited as Max Martin and Friends), ranging from the 90s to today and including songs made popular by Robyn, the Backstreet Boys, Katy Perry, Demi Lovato, P!nk and more. The playbill includes a note that Martin has had more number one hits than any other artist this century, and boldly claims \"He's basically the Shakespeare of pop music.\" At the very least his catalog is unquestionably impressive &#8212; and his songs make for a surprisingly fantastic jukebox musical. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-variety-article-mid-article-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\",\"mid-article\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[300,250],[2,2],[300,251],[2,4],[4,2],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Related Stories &#039;Euphoria&#039; Season 3 Trailer: Zendaya, Sydney Sweeney and Jacob Elordi Return as Rue Battles Drug Dealers, Cassie Becomes a Cam Girl and More",

Charles McNulty, The LA Times: But for all its irreverence - and there's enough off-color insouciance to offend church ladies of every denomination - \"The Book of Mormon\" has the old-fashioned musical comedy heart of adults who spent much of their adolescence lip-syncing to original cast albums in their finished basements. Roma Torre, NY 1: It is meticulously cast and everyone shines. Nikki M. James as sweetly naive Nabalungi has a gorgeous voice. Andrew Rannells plays golden boy Elder Price with divine versatility; and as misfit Elder Cunningham, Josh Gad is truly blessed with outsize talent. Casey Nicholaw shares directing credit with Trey Parker. Along with Stone and Lopez, their \"Book of Mormon\" is an inspired collaboration made in theatre heaven.",

      "pullQuote": "It's easy to like a show that knows itself. Between the first words of the script — a stage direction, \"We begin with music\" — to the final bow — by the onstage band — the infectiously exuberant and joyous Buena Vista Social Club tells and shows exactly what it's about.\n\nThe subject here is the singular sound of old-school Cuban music and artists who made it, a sonic sensation that was captured on a milestone 1990s album recorded in Havana that shares its name with the musical. Songs — they're all sung in Spanish — from the Grammy-winning record including \"Candela,\" \"Dos Gardenias,\" and \"El Cuarto de Tula\" thread through the show, constantly making audience members' heads bob and bodies wriggle to the beat.\n\n\"A sound like this,\" a character teases early on, \"it tends to travel.\" And how. The album went on to become a global hit and inspired a documentary and the musical, which premiered off Broadway in 2023. Traveling to Broadway's Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, Marco Ramirez's script that mixes fact and imagination is slimmer. A gun-running subplot? Gone. A critique of colorism? Essentially reduced to a line.\n\nThe musical covers two time frames. In the '50s, singers Omara Portuondo and her sister Haydee face divergent futures and careers. In the '90s, an older Omara eventually finds her way back to the \"old songs\" and BVSC band members with whom she shares history: guitarist Compay Segundo, vocalist Ibrahim Ferrer, and pianist Rubén González.\n\nUnapologetically sentimental, the slender story gets the job done. Choreography by Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck is explosive. Director Saheem Ali's production mambos across time, all while showcasing the BVSC music.\n\nSince the musical takes place in Revolution-era Cuba as well as 40 years later, principal characters are played by two actors to depict when they are young and, as Ramirez's script amusingly puts it, \"less young.\"\n\nOmara, a featured singer on the album who here anchors the time-leaping plot of the musical, has the most intriguing arc. Isa Antonetti, a powerhouse vocalist, plays her as a hopeful young woman finding her own voice and path in Cuba.\n\nNatalie Venetia Belcon, who played Gary Coleman in Avenue Q, impresses as she shoulders the older Omara, who's haunted by past decisions tied to the BVSC and has turned away from performing. She finds a way to finally make peace with her past and herself. Her source of healing, of course, is the music.",

      "pullQuote": "To CBS Tony Award show producers, one word: “Candela.”\n\nThis brilliant number, a dazzling distillation of music and dance, is just one of a terrific series of musical set-pieces in the Broadway transfer of Buena Vista Social Club (Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, booking through Jan. 4, 2026). The show—unsurprisingly given its rousingly gorgeous aural and visual tableaux—is a bigger treat on a bigger stage, after its 2023/4 off-Broadway engagement at the Atlantic Theater downtown. \n\nDeveloped and directed by Saheem Ali, with a book by Marco Ramirez and music by the Buena Vista Social Club itself, the musical switches between Havana in the mid-1950s and mid-1990s, with us seeing the legendary Afro-Cuban band in its spry, radical infancy and then being reformed 40 years later to record the songs long left behind. That record would go on to become the best-selling world music album of all time, selling more than 8 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe musical features an anchoring, powerhouse performance by Natalie Venetia Belcon as the adult Omara Portuondo (Isa Antonetti plays her as a younger woman). Imperiously regal, with a gorgeous, theater-filling voice, every scene featuring her singing is bravura, and she’s also very funny—eyeing the presence of a flute with suspicion before happily conceding that it’s a great addition for a song, or simply announcing her presence when she enters a room.\n\nThe still-too-slight and vague book tells the story of her relationship with her sister Haydee (Ashley De La Rosa). In the mid-1950s, they were a popular singing duo at Havana’s Tropicana club. When revolution comes, Haydee decides to leave for the US, and Omara stays behind—the trauma of their separation and estrangement eventually leads her to stop singing. The musical maps her renaissance alongside the renaissance of the Buena Vista Social Club band many years later.\n\nThe musical is bounded at beginning and end in the mid-1990s, with a young producer, Juan de Marcos (Justin Cunningham), overseeing the making of the album that will become a record-breaking global phenomenon—and for that album Omara and singer Ibrahim Ferrer (Wesley Wray as a young man, Mel Semé, older) are poignantly reunited. \n\nEight Andrew Scotts Star in One of NYC’s Hottest TicketsSEEING DOUBLETim TeemanThe discrimination that Ibrahim experienced in the 1950s—his skin was deemed too dark, and he was forced to sing below the stage of one venue—has marked his entire life, denying him the trajectory of fame and approbation that Omara has received.\n\nThe musical assumes—maybe rightly, maybe wrongly—those coming to the show know the story of the band, Cuban history, and the real-life people represented on stage. If not, then it’s up to you to bone up through the 1997 album, Wim Wenders’ Oscar-nominated and award-laden 1999 film, or in reading generally about the era and figures like Portuondo, Compay Segundo (Da’Von T. Moody as a young man, Julio Monge as older), and pianist Rubén González (Leonardo Reyna as a young man, and Jainardo Batista Sterling as older). \n\nDo not disregard the best Playbill accessory of the season—de Marcos, the show’s music consultant, has written an excellent booklet explaining the meaning and genesis of the show’s stunning songs, including the romantic melodrama of “Dos Gardenias” (1945), “Veinte Años” (1935; the first song Portuondo recalls singing with her father as a precocious four-year-old), and Compay’s “Chan Chan” (1985), which became a global hit after the 1997 album was released.\n\nThe slightness of the book, and the understated historical context for what we are watching, does not undermine the musical—because the music is the thing. Arnulfo Maldonado’s triple-wow design—one of the most beautifully realized stages of the season so far, tangily redolent of Cuban musical venues of the 1950s—even has an upper raised platform, perfect to stage bruised sunsets along the Malecón.\n\nWhy ‘Purpose’ Is the Most Explosive Family Drama on BroadwayTRUTH BE TOLDTim TeemanThe choreography (Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck), costumes (Dede Ayite), and atmosphere-enhancing lighting (Tyler Micoleau) are all era-specific perfect for the thrilling stage-filling numbers Ali, Delgado, and Peck craft with the cast and ensemble (Angélica Beliard, Carlos Falú, Carlos Gonzalez, Héctor Juan Maisonet, Ilda Mason, Marielys Molina, Andrew Montgomery Coleman, Sophia Ramos, Anthony Santos, Martín Sola, and Tanairi Sade Vazquez).\n\nThe other stars of the show are the band: music supervisor Dean Sharenow, music director Marco Paguia (also conductor and on piano), associate music director David Oquendo (also on guitar), Renesito Avich (tres), Gustavo Schartz (bass), Javier Díaz, Román Diaz and Mauricio Herrera (percussion), Jesus Ricardo (trumpet), Eddie Venegas (trombone), Hery Paz (woodwinds), and Leonardo Reyna (piano). \n\nIt is a privilege and treat to hear these musicians play; the whole theater vibrates with their collective energy and mastery—sound design is by Jonathan Deans—and each are accorded individual moments to shine.\n\nIts too-vague narrative framing does not affect the brilliance of Buena Vista Social Club’s execution of music and dance. Thanks to its supreme ensemble of musicians and singers, we can all be grateful that, as de Marcos’ character says to the audience at the end, “a sound like this…tends to travel.”\n\nPaul Mescal Triumphs in a Stunning ‘Streetcar Named Desire’KINDNESS OF STRANGERSTim TeemanWe Had a WorldWe Had a World, an autobiographical play by the multi-award winning Joshua Harmon (Prayer for the French Republic, Skintight, Admissions, Significant Other, Bad Jews, The Bedwetter) distils the close and fractured relationships Harmon (Andrew Barth Feldman) shared in a dramatic, years-spanning triangle with his mother Renee (Joanna Gleason) and grandmother Ellen (Jeanine Serralles). \n\nThe play, staged by Manhattan Theatre Club at the compact Stage II theater at City Center (booking to April 27), is directed by Trip Cullman with an impressive, minimal conceptual design by John Lee Beatty. The intimate space accentuates the play’s humor, drama, and pathos as Harmon unpacks the wit, love, and trauma defining the familial relationships.\n\nAll three actors excel. Feldman’s impish charm conceals a deep, tested devotion he has for both women. Ellen’s arty eccentricity conceals a darker story around her own parenting of Renee, who as an adult possesses a sense of fierce love and duty to her son and mother—watch her briskly sort out a missing backpack from many miles away when he goes traveling—overlaying deeply buried pain.\n\nThe play is affecting (there was much sniffling among those attending when I attended), though a little too ranging and undercooked in explanation and evocation around various past demons and hurts—until an explosive domestic incident, as scarily staged as it must have been to experience in real life.",

      "pullQuote": "The Grammy Award-winning album of Cuban music is now a Broadway show.\n\nOmara Portuondo (a commanding Natalie Venetia Belcon) is elevated to the central role despite singing just one track on the album. She’s a living legend when Juan de Marcos (Justin Cunningham) attempts to recruit her with an aggressive sales pitch: “&#8230;one day, with the right record, this island might remind the world that Mozart’s got nothing on us,” he tells her with typical Cuban humility. And it works.\n\nShe enters the studio with Compay Segundo (a charming Julio Monge), Eliades Ochoa (a magnetic Renesito Avich), and “Picasso on the keys” Rubén González (Jainardo Batista Sterling), who is by now quite senile but is present as a “good luck charm.” Ever the diva, Omara initially bristles at de Marcos’s arrangement of “Candela,” which features a flute solo. “It’s not the right sound,” she scoffs. But, after crossing himself and going for it, the magnificent Hery Paz proves her wrong with the greatest flute interlude since Jethro Tull—to which Omara assents with a little ass shake (the multi-talented Paz also drew the lovely illustrations in the program insert).\n\nSuch recording studio squabbles have proven the stuff of\n\nSuddenly we are transported back to 1958, the eve of the revolution, when young Omara (the powerfully expressive Isa Antonetti) had an act at the Tropicana with her sister, Haydee (Ashley De La Rosa). Their accompanists, a young Compay (Da’Von T. Moody) and Rubén (Leonardo Reyna), entice Omara out to the Buena Vista Social Club, a Black-run establishment decidedly not on any tourist maps. That’s where she meets a honey-voiced busboy named Ibrahim Ferrer (Wesley Wray in the 50s, Mel Semé in the 90s) who seems like the perfect collaborator. But with the sisters on the verge of signing a record contract and taking the last flight out of Havana before the commies roll in, Omara has a choice to make.\n\nDirector Saheem Ali partially succeeds in distracting the audience from the actual play with top-notch production values, including a multi-level set by Arnulfo Maldonado that portrays the salt-eaten masonry of old Havana. Dede Ayite’s costumes artfully conjure two historical periods, the 50s and the 90s, and the color of the fabric explodes under Tyler Micoleau’s lighting, which feels directly connected to the percussive heartbeat of this music. So does the choreography by Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck, which references traditional Cuban forms without being hemmed in by them. Most importantly, Jonathan Deans delivers pristine sound design so that we don’t miss a note.\n\nThank goodness, because music director Marco Paguia is serving up a feast for the ears, breathing new life into a well-known album with his clever arrangements and resourceful orchestrations. Some of the best moments in the show feature Avich on tres and David Oquendo on guitar leading the band, like in the second act opener “El Cuarto de Tula,” which invites band members to improv both musically and lyrically with what contemporary drag queens might call\n\nAmong the many quaint artifacts of the American century is the expectation that absolutely every square peg story and musical style fit into the round hole of the book musical, a distinctively American form we treat as timeless but which really only\n\nThat thoroughly banal explanation still doesn’t justify the mediocre book musical before us—a gorgeous night of sound and color that really could have just been a concert.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.

      "pullQuote": "&#8216;Buena Vista Social Club&#8217; Broadway Review: Cuba Ignites Before and After the Revolution The historic album is now a thrilling stage musical Robert Hofler March 19, 2025 @ 7:00 PM Share on Social Media Share on Facebook Share on X (formerly Twitter) Share on LinkedIn Share on Email \"Buena Vista Social Club\" (Credit: Matthew Murphy) Last year, Justin Peck won the Tony Award for Best Choreography for “Illinoise.” There’s certainly more choreography in that Sufjan Stevens musical than “Buena Vista Social Club,” which opened the year before in December 2023 at the Atlantic Theater Company . But step for step, lift for lift, Peck’s work with Patricia Delgado for this slightly earlier show is the far more impressive achievement. “Buena Vista Social Club” opened Wednesday at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, where the splendid choreography continues to erupt in a chemical reaction where ballet, Afro-Cuban, contemporary and a variety of social dances both blend and slam into each other. Although other cast members occasionally join in to salsa, Delgado and Peck basically work their magic with only six dancers who are so good they need to be credited at the top of this review: Angelica Beliard, Carlos Falu, Hector Juan Maisonet, Ilda Mason, Marielys Molina and Anthony Santos. But “Buena Vista Social Club” is not a dance show, nor is it a jukebox musical &#8212; even though about half of the musical’s 18 songs come from the historic 1996 album of the same title. (The other songs are from the Buena Vista Social Club ensemble’s extended songbook.) Marco Ramirez’s multilayered book for “Buena Vista” tells the story of the making of the album in Havana, Cuba, which was a reunion of sorts for a number of singers and musicians who first performed together four decades earlier, in 1956. Delgado and Peck’s choreography often helps to bridge those two radically different time periods of 1996, when an impoverished Cuba continued to suffer from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the U.S. blockade, and 1956, when a far more prosperous country was on the verge of revolution. Fidel Castro and Che Guevara are never mentioned, but both the threat and the promise of a new way of life permeate Ramirez’s book. Most in danger of being lost are the social clubs that produced the music that ended up on the 1996 album, the dream project of an enterprising young producer, Juan de Marcos (Justin Cunningham, being very dogged and optimistic in his mission). Not featured in Ramirez’s loosely-based-on-the-facts story is the album’s official producer, American guitarist Ry Cooder. In the typical jukebox musical, preexisting songs are jammed into a plot. That’s not the case here. The songs don’t further or in any way explain the story. They set a mood, they capture emotions and they are performed as those songs would have been originally delivered in Havana’s social clubs, hotel ballrooms and recording studios. For this gringo reviewer, Ramirez’s story has shades of “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” and “A Star Is Born” without the easy contrivance of a murder or a suicide to goose up the narrative, but with a big dollop of “Dreamgirls” thrown into the mix. In 1956, the young singer Omara (Isa Antonetti) performs with her sister Haydee (Ashley de la Rosa) in Havana’s tourist hotels. Of course, Omara&#8217;s real passion is singing with her new boyfriend, Ibrahim (Wesley Wray), in the city’s social clubs, which are anathema to her far more ambitious sister. As fate would have it, the record producers from America and Cuba have no interest in Ibrahim, drawn as they are racially to the more conventionally glamorous Omara. Haydee eventually escapes to America. Ibrahim is forgotten and recedes into the Cuban countryside. Ramirez tells that story from the viewpoint of 1996 when the older Omara (Natalie Venetia Belcon) is engaged to make the “Buena Vista Social Club” album and she is treated to a reunion with the older Ibrahim (Mel Seme), now singing for small change on the streets of Havana. “Buena Vista Social Club” is the story of survival through the preservation of what artists do best, not only for them but a whole island and its culture. With her absolute command of the stage, Belcon galvanizes and grounds the production in a performance that fulfills all the demands of August Wilson’s greatest female role, Ma Rainey. Belcon instills that same fear and awe without ever pushing it. This actor’s achievement is even more remarkable in light of her having created the role of Gary Coleman in the original production of “Avenue Q” over 20 years ago. The two roles belong in different theatrical universes — and yet, Belcon has made both of them very much her own. Belcon and Seme repeat their performances from the Atlantic Theater production. Many of the younger actors have been recast, and while their vocals dazzle, their acting occasionally falters, especially when they are called upon to deliver a lot of exposition about the early days of the Cuban r...",

      "pullQuote": "theater review The Buena Vista Social Club Gets Bigger and Smaller on Broadway By Jackson McHenry , a Vulture critic covering theater, film, and TV Mar. 19, 2025 save d Save this article to read it later. Find this story in your account&#x2019;s &#x2018;Saved for Later&#x2019; section. Comment Photo: Matthew Murphy In musical theater, the book’s often the trickiest thing to get right and the easiest target for criticism. If you don’t believe that the characters have a reason to break into song, blame the book. If the night feels like it’s dragging, blame the book. And if the songs are already hits, and the dancers are already fantastic, but you’re not quite achieving liftoff? Well, there’s always one place to look. That’s what I have to assume happened in production meetings for Buena Vista Social Club somewhere between its Off Broadway run in 2023 and its arrival at the Schoenfeld Theatre this spring. Back when my colleague Sara Holdren reviewed the musical, very loosely based on the true-life stories of the sensational Cuban supergroup, she noted that “the play side of Buena Vista feels like it’s been carefully assembled by committee.” It had a convoluted, rushed, and generically inspirational narrative about how these players met, weathered the revolution, and returned to each other. You might expect that book writer Marco Ramirez and director Saheem Ali took feedback like that and deepened and extended the thing in rewrites. Instead, they’ve just hacked through Buena Vista ’s Gordian knot. Why not simply cut as much of the book as possible? The remarkable thing is how much that approach works. The Broadway Buena Vista clocks in a little shorter than its Off Broadway iteration — now, it’s just two hours with intermission — and breezes through its set-up with quick dashes of exposition. Juan de Marcos (Justin Cunningham) is a young record producer enamored with classic Cuban songs who’s come up with a plan to record “a love letter to Golden Age Cuban music,” but first he needs to convince the diva Omara Portuondo (Natalie Venetia Belcon, exuding confidence in a series of power shawls by Dede Ayite) to come to the studio. Juan’s already recruited the eager old hand Compay (Julio Monge, wry and foxy, able to land even the hoariest jokes) among a company of younger musicians, but as Compay tells Omara when she gets in the studio, “These old songs … they kick up old feelings.” Soon it flashes back to a younger Omara (Isa Antonetti) and her officious sister (Ashley De La Rosa) preparing for their performances at the Tropicana before the revolution and hiring a younger Compay (Da’Von T. Moody) and his pianist compatriot Rubén (Leonardo Reyna) as their accompanists. The two boys lure Omara off to their rowdier club on the bad side of town; she meets a busboy with a voice of gold named Ibrahim (Wesley Wray). Her sister would never approve! I remember the Off Broadway plot contorting itself into a few more curlicues — there was one confusing side plot about that club being a hub for weapon-smuggling, and a lot more of the characters talking around the politics of the revolution while saying little. Here, Ramirez’s script is more skeletal: It tends to hit the clichés then segue into music as quickly as possible. The younger Rubén was “Picasso on the keys.” The older Rubén (Jainardo Sterling Batista) can barely walk anymore, but when Juan puts on a recording of a classic song, he suddenly remembers the notes. After the young Omara and Ibrahim fall for each other and then are separated by circumstance, have no fear that she will eventually find an older Ibrahim (Mel Semé, movingly poised) and the two will sing together again. Thinning the book of Buena Vista , however, has left the other aspects of the production expand in its absence, and that’s where the show is on its surest feet. First, there is the music: Those standards from the original album, a grab bag of genres and styles from a Cuba several decades ago, no surprise, still kill. Belcon brings the house down with “Candela,” maybe the most famous entry in the album, with more than a little help from Buena Vista’s band — in character, Omara disproves of a flute solo, until she hears the show’s flautist Henry Paz wail away on the instrument (a moment that wows the audience, too). You get to know the players in the band through their riffing, their personalities just if not more vivid than the paper characters that surround them. The band, composed of musicians from around the globe, also gives the show its center of gravity. They’re almost always onstage, whether in a central platform that doubles as the actual space of Juan’s recording studio or watching the action from the sidelines. Downtown, that could cramp the action, with dancers trying to negotiate around a small space with a double bass. At the Schoenfeld, everything has more space to luxuriate. The musicians can wander and engage with the theater audience as they jam, while the choreography of husband...",

Anyone familiar with an earlier production or the William Friedkin film (which introduces some ambiguities to the story’s ending) might start to wonder if maybe Agnes and Peter are ultimately a little thin as characters – if they’re worth the intensity that Coon and Smallwood invest into this production. It’s probably not fair to compare a 100-minute early work from Letts to a towering masterpiece like August: Osage County, his Broadway debut from 2007. At the same time, Letts has clearly evolved as a writer since Bug, and it’s hard not to come away from this production wondering how he might address the contemporary version of this drug-addled psychological unmooring. It’s not so much that this production of Bug is outdated; more accurately, it’s got way too much competition, on stage and off.     Matthew Wexler, One-Minute Critic: Director David Cromer (Dead Outlaw, Meet the Cartozians) keeps the play’s focus tight and the performances brisk within the confines of scenic designer Takeshi Kata’s oppressive motel room-turned bunker.

The lightning, helmed by Heather Gilbert, and the sound, spearheaded by Josh Schmidt, also keep the play tightly grounded, though the production may have worked even better in a smaller theater. Additionally, midway through Act II, there is a shocking set change that reveals just how deep into their psychosis Agnes and Peter have sunk. Moreover, amid Agnes and Peter’s continued descent toward insanity, the story remains convincing because of the characters’ obvious affection and mutual obsession. It’s pretty apparent they are causing each other immense harm.

      "pullQuote": "Broadway Review | ‘Bug’ Crawls onto Broadway with craft but little bite By Matt Windman Posted on January 9, 2026 Carrie Coon as Agnes White in &#8220;Bug,&#8221; written by Tracy Letts, directed by David Cromer. Photo by Matthew Murphy There are plays that unfold politely, and then there’s “Bug,” which is supposed to get under your skin. Tracy Letts’ psychological thriller never leaves a rundown Oklahoma City motel room, yet it refuses to stay contained. Paranoia leaks into every corner of the space—and into the audience’s nerves—until reality itself begins to buckle. At its best, “Bug” doesn’t ask you to believe its central delusion. It asks you to feel it, to surrender to the momentum as two damaged people spiral together toward something terrifying and inescapable. “Bug” centers on Agnes White, a lonely waitress scarred by violence and loss, and Peter Evans, a drifter whose conspiratorial worldview slowly takes hold. Their tentative connection curdles into shared paranoia, intimacy and delusion collapsing into the same dangerous impulse. Close Get amNY in your inbox! News, events, culture and more — delivered to you. Thank you for subscribing! Email Sign Up The new Broadway revival, produced by Manhattan Theatre Club in association with Steppenwolf Theatre Company, marks the play’s Broadway premiere more than two decades after its Off-Broadway debut in 2004. It reunites Tony Award-winning director David Cromer with Carrie Coon and Namir Smallwood, who previously tackled the play together in Chicago. On paper, it’s an ideal alignment of material and talent that should feel volatile, immersive, and unnervingly alive. Instead, this “Bug” is intelligent, disciplined, and often absorbing—but rarely electrifying. Coon anchors the production with a performance of formidable control and emotional clarity. Her Agnes is guarded and brittle at first, a woman who has learned to survive by keeping the world at arm’s length. Gradually, Coon allows small fissures to appear—moments of openness and yearning. The disappearance of her character’s young son hangs over the performance like an unresolved ache. It’s deeply grounded work, recalling the emotional rigor of her turn on “The Leftovers.” As Peter, Smallwood resists playing the character as a full-throttle maniac. His Peter is soft-spoken, attentive, and initially disarming—a man whose intelligence and sensitivity make his worldview feel plausible rather than immediately alarming. That approach lends the early scenes an unsettling sincerity. But “Bug” depends on momentum: on the sense that Peter’s certainty is tightening its grip not just on Agnes, but on the room itself. Here, the paranoia creeps but rarely explodes. The descent is measured rather than feral. Carrie Coon as Agnes White, Jennifer Engstrom as R.C., Steve Key as Jerry Goss, Namir Smallwood as Peter Evans in Bug written by Tracy Letts, directed by David Cromer. Photo by Matthew Murphy Cromer’s direction mirrors that restraint. The staging is clean and controlled, privileging clarity over chaos. The scenic design places the shabby motel room inside a blacked-out surround, like a shoebox set within a larger void. The effect is less immersive than observational: the space feels studied, almost quarantined, as if the characters are specimens under glass. At times, the framing recalls watching a movie presented in letterbox format—technically precise, visually contained, and emotionally distancing. #placement_551839_0_i{width:100%;max-width:550px;margin:0 auto;} var rnd = Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6); var pid551839 = rnd; var plc551839 = window.plc551839 || 0; var abkw = window.abkw || ''; var absrc = 'https://ads.empowerlocal.co/adserve/;ID=181918;size=0x0;setID=551839;type=js;sw='+screen.width+';sh='+screen.height+';spr='+window.devicePixelRatio+';kw='+abkw+';pid='+pid551839+';place='+(plc551839++)+';rnd='+rnd+';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER'; var _absrc = absrc.split(\"type=js\"); absrc = _absrc[0] + 'type=js;referrer=' + encodeURIComponent(document.location.href) + _absrc[1]; document.write(' '); This approach begins to feel deliberate. In a cultural moment saturated with conspiracy theories—when paranoia no longer shocks but circulates freely—Cromer seems less interested in pulling the audience into the characters’ fever dream than in holding it up for inspection. The production frames “Bug” as a cautionary tale: a warning about how seductive, and how consuming, conspiratorial thinking can become. I vividly remember seeing “Bug” Off-Broadway in 2004 at the Barrow Street Playhouse, where the audience sat uncomfortably close to the action and the theater’s worn-in personality amplified the play’s intensity. Michael Shannon, who played Peter in that production and later in the 2006 film adaptation, helped define the character as volatile and unsettling. You didn’t have to believe the bugs were real. You only had to believe that the characters did. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('amny_co...",

In her final monologue, this all becomes clear: it's liberating to see a pattern in your pain, instead of a nightmare that makes no sense. Who among us wouldn't bite at the chance?     David Cote, 4Columns: A hardworking and very effective Coon is left to maintain dramatic tension. In her TV triumphs as plucky social climbers (The Gilded Age and The White Lotus), Coon’s fresh beauty and vivacious yet sensible vigor has elevated so-so scripts. She makes a smart and relatable protagonist either in nineteenth-century bustle or Thai resort muumuu. Adopting a Southern-Midwestern twang and artfully revealing the full depth of Agnes’s trauma and hunger for meaning, Coon relishes the scuzz and grace of Agnes, even if her dance partner’s limp.

At the same time, Letts has clearly evolved as a writer since Bug, and it’s hard not to come away from this production wondering how he might address the contemporary version of this drug-addled psychological unmooring. It’s not so much that this production of Bug is outdated; more accurately, it’s got way too much competition, on stage and off.\"     },           {       \"@type\":\"BlogPosting\",       \"headline\":\"One-Minute Critic - Review: Carrie Coon and Namir Smallwood scratch more than an itch in Tracy Letts’ ‘Bug’\",       \"datePublished\":\"2026-01-16T09:14:26-05:00\",         \"articleBody\": \"Director David Cromer (Dead Outlaw, Meet the Cartozians) keeps the play’s focus tight and the performances brisk within the confines of scenic designer Takeshi Kata’s oppressive motel room-turned bunker.

      "pullQuote": "Tracy Letts's grisly play receives its Broadway premiere via Steppenwolf and Manhattan Theatre Club.\n\nBeing a New Yorker and only in my late 30s, I've often said that my go-back-in-time shows would be from the early days of Chicago's Steppenwolf ensemble, when rising stars like Gary Sinise, John Malkovich, and Laurie Metcalf tore up the stage with volatile, brutally real acting choices that got your heart racing. I've been lucky enough to catch flashes of that electricity in the Big Apple—the thrillingly intense dinner scenes in\n\nA relic from Letts's angry-young-man era (the good old days of 1996),\n\nDirected by David Cromer, this revival opened at Steppenwolf just weeks before Covid shut the world down in 2020. Peter and Agnes were fringe figures way back then, strangers for us to collectively grimace at. In 2026, as we watch their fears gradually turn into convictions, as they find meaning in conspiracy because even their bodies can't be trusted anymore, it's impossible not to be personally devastated by the way they grasp for certainty in a world that offers none. They're not characters anymore; Peter and Agnes are our anti-vax uncle and birther grandma. Peter and Agnes are us.\n\nThat's one of the reasons Smallwood and Coon are so devastating to hang out with. Unassumingly dressed by Sarah Laux, they could be anyone you pass on the street. Playing a woman with a long-missing child living in constant fear of her ex's fist, Coon conveys with exacting precision how a lifetime spent asking \"why me\" can push someone to seek extravagant answers from whatever source seems most plausible, even if those answers are delusions. In her profoundly shattering turn, Coon makes Agnes's descent at the hands of Peter feel inevitable.\n\nSmallwood isn't the same kind of pistol as his stage-and-screen predecessor in the role, Michael Shannon, but his performance is no less fascinating, and for different reasons. Casting a Black actor in the part gives real credence to Peter's governmental paranoia, specifically when he invokes the country's\n\nThe authenticity extends to the supporting actors—live wires Engstrom, Key, and former Steppenwolf artistic director Randall Arney—and Cromer's creative team. Heather Gilbert's lighting and Josh Schmidt's especially unnerving soundscape are essential in conveying how things may truly go bump in the night, while Takeshi Kata creates a no-tell motel straight off the side of a country road, the kind you'd swear you'd pick up scabies just by staying in. Kata also provides a late-in-the-game, how'd-they-do-that scenic coup that's absolutely thrilling.\n\nThere are elements of Cromer’s staging that could be tightened—the opening scene could ignite more quickly, and the final moments would benefit from greater explosive sharpness. But that's just picking nits. Neither diminishes the way this production achieves\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.

      "pullQuote": "This Broadway revival of Tracy Letts' 1996 psychological thriller Bug explores how conspiracy theories take root in vulnerable minds. Set in an Oklahoma motel room, the play follows Agnes and Peter, two traumatized outcasts whose budding connection gradually transforms into shared paranoid delusion.\n\nThe production opens with Agnes fleeing her abusive ex-husband, where she meets Peter, a former soldier convinced of government experimentation. As their bond deepens, Agnes becomes drawn into Peter's obsession with bugs he believes infest everything around them—and eventually, inside their own bodies.\n\nCarrie Coon brings formidable intelligence and desperation to her role as Agnes, though her strength sometimes undermines the gradual descent into delusion. Namir Smallwood achieves a remarkable balance of vigor and vulnerability as Peter, infusing the character with unspoken complexity beyond the script. Randall Arney's mysterious Dr. Sweet arrives with almost otherworldly strangeness.\n\nDavid Cromer emphasizes psychological depth and empathy over sensationalism during Act One, creating a slow-burn romantic tension. The tonal shift to psychodrama in Act Two feels somewhat abrupt, though once that descent begins, it's a perverse thrill to the end. Aided by a masterful set change (the decaying scenery is by Takeshi Kata, spookily lit by Heather Gilbert), Cromer expertly turns the dial up to 11 as Agnes becomes fully consumed by Peter's conspiratorial mind. The late arrival of the mysterious Dr. Sweet elevates the proceedings to unnervingly heightened, wholly gripping heights. Even as his characters destroy their world and themselves, Letts never loses sight of the strange comfort in a good conspiracy theory.\n\nBug is at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre through February 8, 2026.",

Directed by Obie Award winner David Cormer, the disturbing psychological horror thriller is an intense and unnerving examination of paranoia, love and life-altering delusion. The play stars \"The Gilded Age's\" Carrie Coon (who also happens to be Letts' spouse) as Agnes, a lonely, drug-dependent waitress who spends most of her time sequestered away in the motel room she calls home. An unlikely encounter with Gulf War veteran, Peter ( Namir Smallwood ), strips her of her sanity. Manic, disturbing and relentless, \"Bug\" gets under the audience&#8217;s skin and remains there long after the final curtain drops. &#8203; \"Bug\" opens in a seedy motel in Oklahoma in the 1990s. Flickers of the time period are made plain through the musical choices wafting through the radio. Agnes is seen stumbling around the motel room in cut-off shorts and a tank top as she alternates between drinking wine and smoking crack cocaine out of a pipe. As her friend and fellow waitress R.C. (a stellar Jennifer Engstrom) looks on, Agnes screens calls from her ex-husband Jerry (Steve Key), who has recently been released from prison. On this particular evening, R.C. has brought along a new friend, Peter, whose unassuming demeanor but intriguing musings fascinate Agnes. &#8203; When R.C. is forced to leave early, Agnes invites Peter to stay. What begins as a low-stakes sexual encounter soon becomes a full-fledged relationship, one that devolves as Peter becomes increasingly obsessed with the bugs he claims are overtaking their room. The pair cling to each other over the coming weeks despite R.C's increasing mistrust of Peter and Jerry's determination to weasel his way back into Agnes&#8217; life. As the couple grows closer, the audience learns more about Peter's military past and paranoia as he slowly drags Agnes into his manic delusions. &#8203; \"Bug\" is as intimate as it is intense. The set, designed by Takeshi Kata, drops the audience right into this specific place and time. The lightning, helmed by Heather Gilbert, and the sound, spearheaded by Josh Schmidt, also keep the play tightly grounded, though the production may have worked even better in a smaller theater. Additionally, midway through Act II, there is a shocking set change that reveals just how deep into their psychosis Agnes and Peter have sunk. Moreover, amid Agnes and Peter's continued descent toward insanity, the story remains convincing because of the characters&#8217; obvious affection and mutual obsession. It's pretty apparent they are causing each other immense harm. However, their actions stem from a place of love, companionship, humor and understanding, which makes the tale especially heartbreaking. &#8203; The performances are also outstanding. From his initial introduction, it&#8217;s obvious Peter is off-center. Still, he isn't outwardly menacing. His musings can be bizarre, but he has a tenderness and earnestness that draw both the audience and Agnes toward him, especially in contrast to the volatile, cruel Jerry. Yet, Coon's performance as Agnes is \"Bug's\" lightning rod. Even though she has not appeared on a Broadway stage since 2012's \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,\" fans have gotten to know her as the shrewd and ambitious Bertha Russell in &#8220;Gilded\" as well as the emotionally vulnerable Laurie Duffy in \"The White Lotus.\" Coon&#8217;s Agnes is a broken woman desperately looking for companionship following the devastating loss of her son and the physical and emotional violence inflicted on her by her ex-husband. Agnes&#8217; longing is at the forefront of Coon's performance, making it all the more devastating to watch her trade one horror for another. &#8203; Despite having a runtime of just under two hours, there is so much packed into \"Bug&#8221; from isolation to mental illness and the human desire for connection. Though it's a story set 30 years ago, it shows how easily people succumb to cult-like behavior and conspiratorial thinking, especially when they are looking to fill a void. In the end, the play showcases how an infestation can spread and expand, quickly becoming something too terrifying and monstrous to contain.

They are shadows­ only, never claws and flesh. In such a production, the fantasy at the story’s center can’t become contagious. We bear witness to two sad, mad people.

Her performance is matched by Steven Skybell, as Herr Schultz, one of her boarders. The two older characters gently fall in love, accompanied by some lovely melodies, “It Couldn’t Please Me More,” and  “Married.”  In the most effective scene in which the Emcee participates:, he wraps a wine glass in a napkin and steps on it – central to the traditional Jewish marriage ritual – but it’s accompanied not by hurrahs, but by a loud boom, darkness,  the sound of glass shattering, and the lights up on a fluttering of what might literally be stage confetti, but hits like a preview of Kristallnacht.",

Redmayne sings the show’s signature tune, “Willkommen,” in brown leather culottes, long black gloves, and a bright-blue party hat (costumes by Tom Scutt, who also did the sets), and seems to have veered outside the normal human range, going instead for a Cirque du Soleil meets demented puppet effect that’s often weird for weird’s sake. Each time Redmayne appears, the costumes grow more outlandish, though vocally his best moment is when his Emcee is dressed conservatively as a Master Race type, standing still and smoothly singing the Nazi anthem “Tomorrow Belongs to Me” to creepy effect.

Bebe Neuwirth is exquisite as Fraulein Schneider, the landlady of the boarding house where Clifford rents a room; she brings attention to songs that are not normally among the most memorable in the musical – “So What” and “What Would You Do,” — which drive home the real-life despair and high stakes then facing people in Germany. Her performance is matched by Steven Skybell, as Herr Schultz, one of her boarders. The two older characters gently fall in love, accompanied by some lovely melodies, “It Couldn’t Please Me More,” and  “Married.”  In the most effective scene in which the Emcee participates:, he wraps a wine glass in a napkin and steps on it – central to the traditional Jewish marriage ritual – but it’s accompanied not by hurrahs, but by a loud boom, darkness,  the sound of glass shattering, and the lights up on a fluttering of what might literally be stage confetti, but hits like a preview of Kristallnacht.\"     },           {       \"@type\":\"BlogPosting\",       \"headline\":\"New York Post - ‘Cabaret’ Broadway review: Revival with Eddie Redmayne is luxe — and bleak\",       \"datePublished\":\"2024-05-09T05:25:57-05:00\",         \"articleBody\": \"Yet the pricey bells and whistles distract from what is a so-so, overly dreary staging that is often undermined by its own overwrought machinations.

And as the strung-out Kit Kat Club singer, Sally Bowles, Gayle Rankin is making every effort to leave her guts on the stage, but she’s not getting any help. Rankin has the ability to be wrenching and spectacular — I once watched her swim across a lake in the dark, climb out and play Nina’s devastating Act Four scene from The Seagull, get back in, and swim away again. But her delivery of “Maybe This Time” and of the show’s final drill to the stomach, its great title song, is hampered by extraneous gesture. She flickers between singing, talking, and half-singing in a way that feels like a misguided directorial attempt to make the songs new, but that ends up making Rankin seem nervous about her ability to deliver them.

Ever since, fans have clung to the score, while directors have tried—and consistently failed—to fix the show’s storytelling.\n\nThe new Broadway revival once again attempts the impossible, under the direction of Michael Mayer and book writer Danny Strong. On paper, their involvement suggested a clear-eyed rethink: Mayer excels with emotional pop-rock material (“Spring Awakening,” “American Idiot”), while Strong has a reputation for structuring complex political narratives (“Dopesick,” “Empire”). In reality, the production feels caught between apologizing for the musical and re-enacting it—all while relying on its three stars to deliver the songs that keep the evening afloat.\n\nThe most obvious sign that this isn’t a traditional “Chess” is the expanded Arbiter, now functioning as a full-blown emcee. Bryce Pinkham (“A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder”) plays him with manic sharpness, narrating, joking, editorializing, and constantly reminding the audience that this is a Cold War musical with a chaotic past. The sheer volume of commentary leaves little space for the characters themselves. Moments that should build tension instead stop cold so the Arbiter can explain (or mock) what we’re watching.\n\nMayer’s staging reinforces the quasi-concert vibe. The ensemble sits on benches along the sides, observing like backup singers. Chess matches aren’t dramatized; they’re announced into microphones, as if we’ve wandered into a radio broadcast. A neon square descends, projections flicker, the stage remains spare except for a few platforms, and the overall effect is that of a high-budget concert staging that never pretends otherwise.\n\nBut if “Chess” is going to function as a concert, it at least has the performers to deliver one. Christopher, who stood by for Sweeney Todd in the 2023 revival, brings a resonant voice and a steady, thoughtful presence to Anatoly, even though the character remains drawn in extremely broad strokes. Aaron Tveit, who also played Sweeney Todd in the same production, unleashes a soaring “Pity the Child” as Freddie. His performance isn’t deeply acted, but the power ballad lands with force.\n\nMichele, launched by “Spring Awakening,” elevated to pop-theater phenomenon through “Glee,” and credited with saving the recent “Funny Girl,” supplies star power and crystal-clear vocals. “Nobody’s Side,” “Heaven Help My Heart,” and her duet with Hannah Cruz on “I Know Him So Well” land not because Florence is richly rendered, but because Michele sings them with authority and focus.\n\nAfter the revelatory 2023 revival of “Merrily We Roll Along,” which finally clarified another difficult 80s musical, there was hope that “Chess” might enjoy a similar breakthrough. This isn’t that breakthrough. But when the commentary dies down and the music takes over, the show soars, proving again why people keep trying to resurrect it.\n\nAs drama, “Chess” remains a puzzle. As a concert, though, it can be thrilling—and in this production, that’s what ultimately wins.\nImperial Theatre, 249 West 45th St., chessbroadway.com. Through May 3.\n\n\t\t\t\tAbout the Author",

      "pullQuote": "&#8216;Chess&#8217; Broadway Review: It&#8217;s the Other ABBA Musical, the One That Never Works The songs by Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus return, strung together by a new, confusing book Robert Hofler November 16, 2025 @ 8:00 PM Share on Social Media Share on Facebook Share on X (formerly Twitter) Share on LinkedIn Share on Email \"Chess\" Over the years, “Chess” has acquired this reputation as a musical with a great score, by Tim Rice and ABBA’s Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus, that has been cursed by Rice’s problematic book. For the show’s 1988 Broadway premiere, Richard Nelson rewrote that story about an American chess champion who competes against a Russian chess champion during the Cold War. Nelson’s rewrites didn’t solve all the narrative problems, and the show closed after a couple of months on Broadway. Danny Strong has rewritten that book for the first Broadway revival of “Chess,” which opened Sunday at the Imperial Theatre. Lovers of ABBA may continue to think the score&#8217;s great. For the rest of us, the musical features a couple of treacly sweet love songs and a slew of ponderous anthems and percussive dirges driven by propulsive rhythms. Audial exhaustion sets in about halfway through act one. As for Strong’s new book, it’s even more confusing than Nelson’s rewrite, which never quite made sense of the story’s love triangle – or the show’s chess metaphor regarding the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. blowing each other up. Musicals are fueled by romance, and the most serious narrative problem with this newly retooled “Chess” is the love affair between American chess champ Freddie (Aaron Tveit) and his Hungarian immigrant girlfriend Florence (Lea Michele) who leaves him for Soviet chess champ Anatoly (Nicholas Christopher). In both Nelson’s book and Strong’s, Anatoly is a robot designed from childhood to be a chess genius. Apparently, Anatoly is attractive to Florence simply because he’s not her current boyfriend, Freddie, who’s beset with emotional problems. Nelson’s book envisioned him as a sort of pampered rock star who threw tantrums, especially at chess matches. During one such contest, he thinks the Soviets are sending Anatoly messages through his yogurt. Strong’s book gets rid of the Oikos reference. Now, Freddie freaks out simply because he&#8217;s bipolar and off his meds. Aaron Tveit does not play Freddie as a spoiled brat. He plays him as someone who’s very emotional disturbed and desperately needs help. Tveit, a Tony winner for “Moulin Rouge,” delivers his best stage performance to date and emerges here as the only sympathetic character. Lea Michele, on the other hand, exudes only defiance and resentment. She’s pissed off about something from the get-go and we never learn what’s making her so edgy – except for the fact that in today’s musicals female characters must show strength whatever the cost to the love story. Besides being Freddie’s girlfriend, she’s his “second,” someone who helps the chess player prepare for a match. Maybe Florence resents not being the star player, and Michele certainly makes the case for hogging the spotlight. As performed here, Florence’s leaving Freddie is less an escape from a bad relationship than an abandonment of someone in need. That’s quite a love story. To make Florence even less sympathetic, Anatoly has a wife and kids back in the Soviet Union. He says it was a politically arranged marriage; his spouse (Hannah Cruz) says otherwise. And it’s not entirely clear from Strong’s book, or the performances, which character we’re supposed to believe. But to take the wife’s side for a moment, Anatoly does have kids and no one can blame that on the KGB. Long before the end of act one, it doesn’t matter which man Florence loves or whether she’ll be deported back to Hungary or Siberia. For the record, Judy Kuhn in the original Broadway production made this character very appealing and vulnerable, a quality that today’s musical theater forbids its women to be. Even Tom Broecker’s costumes work to turn Michele&#8217;s Florence into an uncaring diva. For most of act two, she’s dons a white gown-caftan, the kind of outfit Maria Callas might have worn on an Onassis yacht. The very good news: the three leads are vocally super-strong. Sometimes too strong. Nicholas Christopher likes to hold a note until the audience breaks into applause. He should go into a Longest Held Note Contest with Joshua Henry over at “Ragtime.” There’s a metaphor running around in “Chess” that somehow the game of chess is the same game the U.S. and U.S.S.R. played with each other during the Cold War. This thematic comparison has no resonance, and it doesn’t help that Strong’s book often has the show’s narrator poking fun at it. This “arbiter” is played by Bryce Pinkham (wonderful in “The Gentlemen’s Guide to Love & Murder” and other shows), and as narrators go, there have been Emcees in “Cabaret” who have exhibited more charm, less sleaziness. Every line is shouted, every lame joke winked at. T...",

With music and lyrics by Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus (of ABBA ) and Tim Rice, and now with a new version of Rice's book by Danny Strong, \"Chess\" tells of the Cold War chess rivalry between Freddie Trumper ( Aaron Tveit ) of the US and Anatoly Sergievsky (Nicholas Christopher) of the USSR, as well as the woman, Florence Vassy ( Lea Michele ), who gets caught in the middle. While beloved by some, \"Chess\" is a famously messy musical, particularly due to Rice's confused book, which has been reworked too many times to count. Songs have been moved, added, cut, or reassigned. Settings (both locations and years) have been altered. Characters have been expanded, removed, or significantly tweaked. The ending (particularly for Florence) has gone through numerous versions, each with completely different meanings and messages. Even seemingly core and essential details, like who wins the chess matches, have been changed across productions. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-variety-article-mid-article-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\",\"mid-article\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[300,250],[2,2],[300,251],[2,4],[4,2],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Related Stories &#039;Euphoria&#039; Season 3 Trailer: Zendaya, Sydney Sweeney and Jacob Elordi Return as Rue Battles Drug Dealers, Cassie Becomes a Cam Girl and More",

      "pullQuote": "theater review The Winner Takes It All: Chess Returns to Broadway By Sara Holdren , a theater director and Pulitzer-finalist critic at New York Nov. 16, 2025 save d Save this article to read it later. Find this story in your account&#x2019;s &#x2018;Saved for Later&#x2019; section. Comment Photo: Matthew Murphy/Matthew Murphy Grab your sleeping bags and bug spray, people. It’s time for camp. Chess is back on Broadway after 37 years, as big and weird as ever, with as much late-’80s bombast as a Claude Montana runway show , as much cheese as a charcuterie board. Let’s get the Five Ws out of the way so we can get to all that delicious dairy: Who? Musical-theater prom court Lea Michele, Aaron Tveit, and Nicholas Chistopher as the cult hit’s absurdly brainy love triangle; Michael Mayer holding the bullhorn; and, of all people, Danny Strong behind the new book that’s attempting to give some kind of psychological/historical coherency to the stadium-size music by ABBA’s Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus and the barrage of histrionic lyrics by Tim Rice. (Because who better to take yet another swing at Chess ’s notoriously wonky book than the guy who co-wrote The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ?) What and when? Well, chess! And love, I guess. And the Cold War, definitely. The show starts off in 1979, as we are immediately informed by its super-caffeinated narrator, the Arbiter (Bryce Pinkham, having such a damn good time it feels like all his serious faces are on the edge of cracking into giggles). Despite this Arbiter’s proclivity for lobbing soft 2025 political jokes into the audience, the story is still very much a “Cold War musical.” In case we ever forget — despite the Boris-and-Natasha accents and the model nuclear warheads tucked in among the oversize chess pieces that frame David Rockwell’s unabashedly presentational set — the Arbiter reminds us more than once. But where? Various glitzy locales playing host to matches in the World Chess Championships, like Merano and — immortally, unforgettably — Bangkok. And … Why? Honestly, who knows? Strong’s efforts to zest the lemon of relevancy over this crazy cocktail aren’t exactly profound. (“These negotiations brought about the end of the Cold War,” says the Arbiter near the finale, catching us up on the talks between Reagan and Gorbachev. Then he gives the facial-expression equivalent of a dun-dun-DUN : “The first one, that is.”) But just as honestly: Who cares? For all the talk of SALT II and the Able Archer exercises — all the protestations that a single checkmate could cause nuclear armageddon — Chess is not a serious musical. Fine. Good , even! When the show is at its best, it hits levels of unironic ludicrousness that are more fun than most things on Broadway. Back in 1988 Frank Rich ripped Chess ’s American premiere a new one: “The characters,” he wrote in the New York Times , “yell at one another to rock music.” Yes, they absolutely do. And I had a great time. At the risk of sounding like an old fart, they don’t make musicals like they used to. That’s just a fact, often an exciting one — but every so often, a revival will bring the geist of its Zeit blasting back with irresistible force. Especially when that time-ghost is much more prone than ours is to strutting and yearning and feeling all the feelings at eleven. The Mountain Goats’ John Darnielle has a theory that the average beats-per-minute of any era’s pop music corresponds to whatever the drug of the moment was. So if it feels like all of Chess is on coke, well, snort up, buttercup. Storywise, we’ve got three prodigies trapped inside a big fat metaphor: While the volatile American genius Freddie Trumper (Tveit, and yes that’s really the character’s name, and yes, of course there’s a joke about it) and his second -and-lover, the “brilliant and beautiful” genius Florence Vassy (Michele), face off against the brooding Russian genius Anatoly Sergievsky (Christopher), they and their games and love affairs are also being manipulated by power players from both the U.S. and the Soviet Union — because apparently, between 1979 and 1983, the world’s narrow escapes from mutually assured destruction came down to backroom intrigue over openings and endgames. Wielding the human pawns, there’s Sergievsky’s coach Alexander Molokov (Bradley Dean), “who may or may not be KGB” (hmm), and the sardonic CIA agent Walter de Courcey (Sean Allan Krill), whose shelf of ice-blonde hair looks solid enough to support a hood ornament. It doesn’t take long for Freddie — never a nice guy and, to be fair to him, also bipolar — to blow things up with both Florence and Anatoly. He’s the reigning world champion, but in 1979 he forfeits the championship game to Anatoly after the Russians successfully get into his head. To paraphrase the old joke, just because Freddie is paranoid doesn’t mean the Soviets don’t have his room bugged and Florence isn’t in love with Anatoly. She is, and soon the new lovers are off to the U.K.: Anatoly defects, Flore...",

      "pullQuote": "&#8216;Death Becomes Her&#8217; Broadway Review: How to Resurrect an Embalmed Movie The outrageous new musical injects real comic life into Robert Zemeckis&#8217; dark fantasy Robert Hofler November 21, 2024 @ 6:00 PM Share on Social Media Share on Facebook Share on X (formerly Twitter) Share on LinkedIn Share on Email Megan Hilty, Jennifer Simard, Josh Lamon and Christopher Sieber in \"Death Becomes Her\" (Credit: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman) Classic novels don’t make for good movies. And classic movies don’t make for good stage musicals, “Some Like It Hot” being the most recent example. When something is great, it works because the material fits the chosen medium perfectly. Wrench it from that platform, and failure is sure to follow. Second- or third-rate material in one medium, however, can be improved by transferring it to another. Case in point is the new musical “Death Becomes Her,” which opened Thursday at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre. The premise of a youth potion that promises eternal life, if you don’t mind being dead, is a clever play on the vampire legend. David Koepp and Martin Donovan’s original screenplay has narrative drive, but director Robert Zemeckis dipped into his usual bag of CG and green-screen special effects to squeeze almost every drop of comedy from this dark fantasy. When Meryl Streep’s head is spun around or Goldie Hawn gets a big hole blown into her abdomen, it’s all too gruesome and real to be much fun. Directing the new musical, Christopher Gattelli gleefully embraces the material’s inherent tackiness. It helps that Derek McLane&#8217;s sets manage to be both grand and deliciously godawful. More important is the absurdity of the Grand Guignol special effects: When Megan Hilty’s Madeline Ashton (the Streep character) takes a shot-gun to her despised best friend, no attempt is made to make Jennifer Simard’s Helen Sharp (the Hawn character) look like anything but an H&M mannequin being thrown across the stage. When Helen pushes Madeline down the stairs, it’s obvious that a stunt double has taken over for Hilty in what has to be the best use of a grand staircase since Jerry Herman wrote “Hello, Dolly!” Read Next &#039;Babe&#039; Off Broadway Review: Marisa Tomei Gets Stuck Between Generations Speaking of the Pleistocene, back then Ethel Merman and Mary Martin performed together in a one-night benefit on Broadway. Walter Kerr in the New York Times wrote a rave to say that Merman was the fire to Martin’s smoke. In “Death Becomes Her,” Hilty is the rear-end to Simard’s poo-poo cushion. Marco Pennette’s book gives Hilty all the grand-dame one-liners, but it’s Simard who gets the more unexpected laughs with delightful line readings that take a second or two to register. The sharp dialogue is in perfect tune with Julia Mattison and Noel Carey’s lyrics, and that duo’s music, which is merely serviceable, manages not to get in the way of the characters and the story, which Pennette has made far less convoluted than its source material. Achieving much with little is Christopher Sieber as the star-pecked plastic-surgeon husband (Bruce Willis in the film). Michelle Williams, playing the keeper of the potion (Isabella Rossellini in the film), looks terrific in Paul Tazewell’s extravagant gowns. The show wisely uses the character, now named Viola, as a framing device and narrator, but Williams’ speaking and singing voice lacks the requisite authority. A nice addition to this story is the creation of a sassy gay assistant to Madeline, played by Josh Lamon, who, maybe, should have been cast as Viola. Given a throw-way exit line, Lamon has the power to turn fluff into a dagger. The only thing campier is watching Nicole Scherzinger go full drag queen in “Sunset Blvd.” The Zemeckis movie has one great moment. It never gets better than Streep traipsing on a hotel lobby’s circular divan in a disastrous musical version of “Sweet Bird of Youth.” On Broadway, that episode becomes a show within the show that is unimaginatively titled “Me! Me! Me!” That disappointment aside, the song “For the Gaze” delivers big time. And the timing could not be better. After this month’s major dud, “Tammy Faye,” where “the gays” are repeatedly pandered to, it’s fun to see a show that talks one on one to its core audience.

Her melodic savvy, if not entirely consistent over a run time of nearly two and a half hours with little spoken dialogue, is buttressed by an ear for piercing, haunting harmonies, abetted here by musical director and vocal arranger Liam Robinson. Moreover, Mitchell and, to her credit, Chavkin have mined a beautiful and theatrically resonant tale from their source material. If there are traces of the pretensions that marred Natasha in this heavily stylized production, the director and her lavishly talented design team remain in service to the story, which ties together the myths of Orpheus and Eurydice, respectively played by Reeve Carney and Eva Noblezada, and Hades and Persephone, played by Patrick Page and Amber Gray.",

Christopher Kelly, NJ.com : Still, if this is your first visit to \"Hadestown,\" it's likely to be a satisfying one. Mitchell and director Rachel Chavkin (\"Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812\") do an impressive job updating an oft-recounted myth; in this telling, Orpheus (Reeve Carney) falls in love with Eurydice (Eva Noblezada), who in turn flees to Hadestown after its ruler Hades (Patrick Page, whose basso profundo is the stuff of nightmares and/or action movie trailers) promises to end her hunger. The actors are all excellent, with one standing slightly above the rest: In the role of Hades' queen Persephone, the extraordinary Amber Grey (who originated the role off Broadway) gives us a kind of Hellenistic Age Real Housewife, both garishly funny and romantically yearning.

      "pullQuote": "There's rarely been a history lesson as entertaining as Lin-Manuel Miranda's new hip hop-infused musical about Alexander Hamilton, or, as the opening number puts it, \"The ten-dollar founding father without a father.\" Based on Ron Chernow's best-selling biography, Hamilton brings American history to musical-theater life in a style akin to the classic 1776, only with a hipper, more multi-cultural attitude. Currently enjoying a virtually sold-out off-Broadway premiere engagement at the Public Theater, where its run has already been extended twice before the official opening, the show seems inevitably destined for a Broadway transfer.Miranda, previously responsible for the 2008 Tony Award-winning musical In the Heights, is clearly enamored of his subject. In addition to writing the book, music and lyrics for the nearly three-hour show, he also plays the title role. And while he's had the audacity to cast Hispanic and black actors as the Founding Fathers commonly referred to as \"old dead white men,\" Miranda's work is remarkably faithful to the historical facts, imparting great amounts of information in such rollicking fashion that high school history teachers will find themselves profoundly grateful for the assist.",

      "pullQuote": "They’re brewing up a revolution down on Lafayette Street. And even theater reactionaries seem destined to be swept up in its doubt-defying ardor. Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s independent-minded new musical for the masses at the Public Theater, shot open like a streamlined cannon ball on Tuesday night. When one of the young rebels who populate this vibrant work says, “History is happening in Manhattan,” you can only nod in happy agreement. “Happening” qualifies as both an adjective and a verb in this instance. Adapted from Ron Chernow’s 2004 doorstop biography of Alexander Hamilton — “the 10-dollar founding father without a father,” as the show’s lyrics put it — this speeding bio-musical has become the most fashionable (and unobtainable) ticket in town. More important, Hamilton, which is directed with vigor and finesse by Thomas Kail and features the multifarious Mr. Miranda in the title role, persuasively transfers a thoroughly archived past into an unconditional present tense. Written and composed by Mr. Miranda, this work may reap the pattern-bestowing benefits of two centuries of hindsight. Yet it exudes the dizzying urgency of being caught up in momentous events as they occur. How Hamilton achieves this then-is-now effect could itself be said to qualify as historic, at least on the progress-challenged continuum of the American musical. In telling the story of Hamilton — and confreres that include George Washington, Aaron Burr and Thomas Jefferson — via rap and R&B ballads, this sung-through production sounds a lot like what you’d hear if you turned the radio to a mainstream pop station.",

Leah Greenblatt, Entertainment Weekly : Miranda's singular gift for storytelling and wordplay makes even the Federalist Papers sound sexy, but the play's intrigue come mostly from its potent stew of friendship and romance and outsize ambition; it's as if House of Cards were folded into a sort of Days of Our Colonial Lives fever dream, then filtered through the minds of Tupac and Sondheim.

In recent weeks, Hamilton (now making its world premiere at the Public Theater with book, music, and lyrics by the show's star, Lin-Manuel Miranda) has been compared favorably to Tony Kushner's Angels in America and William Shakespeare's Henriad. Many have called it a game-changer. TheaterMania even predicted a Pulitzer Prize for the hip-hop bio-musical before it began public performances. How could any theatrical production live up to such expectations? Well, like its extraordinary subject, Hamilton exceeds all expectations. Exceptionally smart and unexpectedly timely, this story of an American patriot is the best new American musical in years. Electricity pervades the air from the earliest moments, in which a chorus introduces us to the \"bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman,\" who would grow up to become Alexander Hamilton (Miranda), the \"ten-dollar founding father without a father.\" This prologue takes us from Hamilton's impoverished childhood in Nevis to his new life in New York City, all on the power of his brains and industry. The first person he meets off the boat: Aaron Burr (Leslie Odom Jr.), the man who is now mostly remembered for killing him.",

The conflict between independence and interdependence is not just the show’s subject but also its method: It brings the complexity of forming a union from disparate constituencies right to your ears. It may confuse your ears, too; Few are the theatergoers who will be familiar with all of Miranda’s touchstones. I caught the verbal references to Rodgers and Hammerstein, Gilbert and Sullivan, Sondheim, West Side Story, and 1776, but other people had to point out to me the frequent hat-tips to hip-hop: Biggie Smalls, the Fugees, “Blame It (On the Alcohol).” And I’m sure that historians in the audience (the show was “inspired by” Ron Chernow’s 800-page Hamilton biography) will catch references that the rest of us fail to notice. (“The world turned upside down,” a repeated phrase in a number about the Battle of Yorktown, is the name of the ballad supposedly played by Redcoat musicians upon Cornwallis’s surrender there, in 1781.)

Reprising their West End roles, both young men are formidable individually but meteoric together, specifically in their happy seizure of the central theme of this and Rowling's saga in general: friendship. Good friendship. The kind of friendship that trounces ostracization, that vanquishes evil, that draws power from the triumph of an inside joke as much as a shared tragedy. Boyle plays Scorpius, ostensibly Hogwarts' biggest outcast, with a ferocious nerve and mischievous wit; he's funny and heartbreaking and applies a vexing if effective quantity of outbursts to service his character's epiphanic moments. Clemmett, on the opposite hand, is an understated wonder; as the embittered but well-intentioned Albus, he has the less showy and perhaps more prohibitive role, but with a boyish charm Clemmett adroitly dodges pratfalls of teenage anguish and \"Ugh, dad!\" resentment to remain hugely likable and empathetic even as he creates disaster after disaster for himself. The sparks the two actors create together are so dynamic, their occasional absence onstage does not go unnoticed.",

Yes, you'll see fan-favorite characters like Dumbledore and Hagrid, but thankfully, no one is doing just their best impression of the movies. The play its own thing, and it's easy to see actors rotating into this work and making it their own for a solid run over the next decade or more. When my audience made its way toward the lobby after both parts, the overwhelming response to the most expensive non-musical play ever produced on Broadway seemed to be stunned wonder.

A detailed recap starting with the key prophecy that propelled the entire saga and continuing with a breakdown of each of the seven novels is provided in the program and will be helpful to the uninitiated. But there's also a universal dimension to the human drama here - the challenges of parenting, the conflict between fathers and teenage sons burdened by intimidating legacies, the sustaining force of love and friendship, the eternal grip of the past - that will prove poignant and meaningful even to audiences unversed in the wizarding wars. I'm by no means a Potter obsessive but I was amazed, watching the plays, at how vividly these characters are embedded in our cultural consciousness.

There's a giddy bravado to a lot of this stuff, but the play isn't showing off to show off. Tiffany smartly contextualizes the spectacle, figuring out how to make a live Harry Potter show feel magical in a way that's unique to the theater. The \"what are they going to do next, and how are they going to do it\" of it all becomes an integral part of the experience, as much of an adventure as the story itself. The special effects only overwhelm toward the end, when the play has exhausted most of its energy and all the flames and flying starts to feel like a Universal Studios stunt show rather than a full-bodied piece of theater. Mostly, though, The Cursed Child's wizardry is plucky, thrilling, and well-proportioned.",

Her artist “catalog” is more akin to a trove, spilling over with golden (and Gold and Platinum-status) treasure. The impulse to learn more about her — an action that the new musical “Hell’s Kitchen” with music, lyrics and new arrangements by Keys threadbaringly takes — is only natural. There are similarities to the crooner’s life present here — her upbringing in nefarious 1990s New York, her teenage turmoil under the surveillance of an overburdened single mother, her splintered relationship with her father — but make no mistake, this story belongs to Ali (Maleah Joi Moon), not Alicia. \n\n            This post is for paying subscribers only\n            Subscribe now\n            Already have an account?

Without affect, she effortlessly lives the part up on that stage. Shoshana Bean (Mr. Saturday Night) is a marvel as her overprotective mother, rooting the show’s dramatic conflict and singing so amazingly, she turns Jersey’s pain into showstopping moments. As her seemingly good for nothing musician ex (and Ali’s dad), Brandon Victor Dixon is perfection, always trying to be less absent, including on an impressionistic version of Fallin’ that he deliciously sings to Jersey in a last-ditch effort to win her back. And Kecia Lewis is terrific as Miss Liza Jane, though she has to emit some dialogue people would normally never say. (“Your rage is real. Your rage is earned. But I will not let it defeat you.”)      Roger Friedman, Showbiz411: “Hell’s Kitchen” is a very high end jukebox musical, Direction (Michael Greif), Choreography (Camille A. Brown) plus costumes, sets, lighting — they’re all top notch. What would have made this show something extra? A real book, more than cardboard cut outs of characters. Allie wants is a boyfriend, which she gets. Big deal. She stumbles into music but there’s no drama. Nothing is in her way. Her mother is doing a good job. Her father is not a bad guy.",

Dalton Ross, Entertainment Weekly: What is so remarkable about Hell’s Kitchen, however, is that a story so familiar can also somehow feel so fresh. Right from the outset, both the neighborhood and stage come alive — bursting with energy as characters bound about in their FUBU shirts and saggy, baggy jeans, popping poses and banging buckets. The Hell’s Kitchen ensemble is working hard, interpreting the music through motion that feels like the bustling city streets outside Ali’s Manhattan Plaza building. If modern, hyped-up dance is your thing, they got you, thanks to scene-stealing choreography by Camille A. Brown. Chris Jones, New York Daily News: The young actress Moon has a formidable task on her plate here and she’s a charming lead. But she doesn’t always sing in the middle of the notes",

Dixon, though, sounds just as spectacular as Bean and Lewis, embodying as he does the unreliable charmer — a stereotypical musician-dad for sure, and I had to fight some irritation there and elsewhere at the broadness of the narrative strokes.

She’s a moody teen, but out of her downturned lips emanates the most beautiful and joyous voice, with Moon delivering concert-ready renditions of “The River,” “Kaleidoscope,” and “Work On It.” It is a remarkably mature performance for such a young actor, and she absolutely keeps up with the seasoned pros around her.\n\nBean brings her signature vocal pyrotechnics to the party, stopping the show with “Pawn It All.” She has real chemistry with Dixon, who seduces everyone onstage and in the audience with his interpretations of “Not Even the King” and “If I Ain’t Got You.” We know exactly why Jersey fell in love with Davis, even if he loves his career more and is willing to break her heart again and again to prove it. We cannot control our feelings, but we can control how we respond to them.\n\n“Listen to that pain. Do something with it,” Miss Liza Jane commands Ali as she gestures toward the piano bench. Kecia Lewis gives a stunning performance as Ali’s wise and stern piano teacher, who keeps playing through her own pain and is determined to pass on her knowledge before it is too late. Listening to her performance of “Perfect Way to Die” is like hearing the alto voice of God.\n\nKeys’s music has never sounded better, with top-notch vocalists in the principal and supporting cast. I was particularly wowed by Jackie Leon, who radiates pure joy as she belts out “Girl on Fire.”\n\nEverything about Michael Greif’s production has been supersized for the trip uptown. Robert Brill’s moving scaffold set is taller, conveying both the vertical sprawl of the city and allowing Greif to have actors hanging out on balconies and fire escapes. Ali is just one of millions, living and loving in the city that never sleeps. It all seems to go on forever in Peter Nigrini’s skyline projections, which are so sharp during “Empire State of Mind” you feel like you’re in a helicopter flying over Manhattan.\n\nCostume designer Dede Ayite has collaborated closely with Nigrini and lighting designer Natasha Katz so that every stage picture erupts with color and specificity: autumnal for a flashback to Tompkins Square Park, an intimate teal for the Ellington room at Manhattan Plaza, an explosion of jewel tones during “Kaleidoscope.” It all comes together to create a fairytale version of New York in the 90s, in which music videos spontaneously materialize on the street.\n\nThe orchestrations (by Tom Kitt and Adam Blackstone) incorporate onstage bucket drums with the band (heroically led by Lily Ling), amazingly without screwing up the sound balance. I suspect that sound designer Gareth Owen might be a wizard. Several times a wave of bass passed through the audience, and I swear I felt my hair woosh back.\n\nCamille A. Brown’s energetic, genre-defying choreography explodes off the stage, with dancers regularly appearing as avatars of Ali’s emotions, expressing her feelings better than any words could. All of it comes together to tell the story of a restless city teeming with unfulfilled dreams, a place that will keep moving with or without her but is happy for her to join the dance.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.

      "pullQuote": "As its title suggests, Hell’s Kitchen extends its attention to the neighborhood beyond the central story. The fire escapes and signage of Robert Brills’s scenic design and Perter Nigrini’s projections, augmented by the dazzle of Natasha Katz’s lighting, help set the urban scene. But the most important factor is Brown’s outstanding choreography: Executed gorgeously by an ensemble that includes several dancers she has worked with in the past, the show’s bold and graceful movement summons a world of kinetic energy for Ali to tap into when she is finally able to organize her talent. When Hell’s Kitchen inevitably concludes with “Empire State of Mind,” the song doesn’t feel tacked on, because New York has been keenly felt throughout the show. It may touch on social issues of consequence, but Hell’s Kitchen is ultimately a celebration of the city—and the people who make it pop.      Jackson McHenry, Vulture: Moon, to her credit, grounds all this wherever she can. She’s a great discovery, a virtuoso who also appears surprised and delighted by her own talent. In Dede Ayite’s throwback ’90s costumes — so much Tommy Hilfiger, such giant pants — Moon has both swagger and that crucial touch of naïveté that makes Ali feel like a real and contradictory teenage girl, even when the plot swerves around her. Her voice, for all its power, has a sandpaper edge, a texture that makes her stand out when so many young singers sound cleanly uniform. If only the material written for her could be as distinctive.",

It also reflects the issues underlying New York City in the ’90s while demonstrating the impact of loss, absentee fathers and over-policing in communities of color. Since the play runs at a lengthy 2 hours and 30 minutes (including an intermission), these themes are often drawn out and sometimes feel cliché, bordering on corny.

The credits and copy have been updated to reflect any changes for the Broadway transfer. &#8220;Hell&#8217;s Kitchen,&#8221; playwright Kristoffer Diaz &#8216;s new musical with songs by Alicia Keys , begins at a dinner table. 17-year-old Ali (a magnetic Maleah Joi Moon, making her professional debut) has dinner with her mom, Jersey (Shoshana Bean), in their Hell&#8217;s Kitchen apartment every night at the same time. It&#8217;s a routine that Jersey insists on to keep Ali safe from the perils of New York City in the 1990s. But for Ali, their one-bedroom apartment on the 42nd floor feels like a cage. She longs to hang out with her friends, listen to music and flirt with an older drummer named Knuck (Chris Lee), who uses the courtyard of their Manhattan Plaza building as his stage. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-variety-article-mid-article-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\",\"mid-article\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[300,250],[2,2],[300,251],[2,4],[4,2],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Related Stories &#039;Euphoria&#039; Season 3 Trailer: Zendaya, Sydney Sweeney and Jacob Elordi Return as Rue Battles Drug Dealers, Cassie Becomes a Cam Girl and More",

Not until Bobby Darin came along to help.

It's a measure of how little in his biography there is to work with that the show holds off until nearly the end to reveal a big family secret, one that's easily available in the most cursory bio of Darin online.  But there is some drama in the relationship with Dee. For all his charm as a performer, Darin doesn't seem like a very nice man. He insists she go on the road with him, and show his fans and hers how much she appreciates his act. He soon tires of her. He sends his brother-in-law turned valet Charlie (Joe Barbara) to relay the message: \"He wants a divorce.\" There is a hint that his impatience is motivated by his knowledge that he will die young, but it's buried too deeply beneath an off-putting ambition.",

      "pullQuote": "The makers of any show based on a famous person's life must answer crucial questions: Is the figure well-known enough to draw audiences? If not, is the lead actor sufficiently famous to carry the show? Darin remains a recognizable name but not particularly well-remembered among general audiences. He died at 37 in 1973 and is primarily recalled for songs like Splish Splash, Dream Lover, Mack the Knife, and Beyond the Sea.\n\nJust in Time showcases these songs brilliantly with considerable pizzazz. It functions as a lovely concert rather than revealing biographical material about Darin's actual life. Darin lived with constant awareness that his weakened heart might claim him young—which it did. He discovered his presumed mother (Michele Pawk, exceptional) was actually his grandmother, and his supposed sister (Emily Bergl) was his biological mother.\n\nGroff opens with witty self-awareness, noting whether you're a fan of Bobby Darin, or one of the twelve people who watched Mindhunter—it doesn't matter. Director Alex Timbers and designer Derek McLane transform Circle in the Square into a nightclub environment. Supporting performances shine, with backing singers delivering shimmeringly and Lawrence and Henningsen performing impressively.\n\nHowever, momentum falters during the Darin-Dee marriage examination. The show hints at Darin's cruel side but doesn't explore it thoroughly. The relationship between Darin and his not-mother Polly resonates more effectively. Her appearance as a ghost later delivers what might be Broadway's funniest line this season.\n\nGroff makes clear the intention of Just in Time at its end: Doing this was when he felt the most alive. Honestly? Same. This can only happen in this room, right now, with you, and it'll never happen quite the same way again. The creators frame this as theater's transformative power, honoring performers who served that purpose.",

Both Darin and Groff understood the implicit contract of a performer: lend one’s time in exchange for entertainment. The retro style of show will appeal to some Broadway-heads more than others, but on that promise, at least, Groff more than delivers.",

      "pullQuote": "It seems every other year at this point we get a new bio-jukebox musical of some singer with a troubled past living in the 40s, 50s, or 60s, and Donnie Kirshner appears in some way. There is just one issue that all those other musicals have… they don't have Jonathan Groff in them.\n\nFresh off his Tony Award-winning performance as Franklin Shepard in last season's fantastic Merrily We Roll Along revival, Groff is back on Broadway this time at the intimate Circle In The Square where Just In Time officially opens tonight. Based on the life of Bobby Darin, and featuring all his greatest hits, this new musical takes everything we know about conventional bio-musicals and throws it out the window.\n\nGroff became enamored with Darin after performing his music at the 92nd Street Y back in 2018, and ever since then has been waiting for tonight. He enlisted the help of Alex Timbers who directs (and developed) the piece with a book by Warren Leight and Isaac Oliver. The show starts out in a nightclub in 2025 with Groff on stage and he effortlessly transforms right before our very eyes — it's an astonishing feat that has the audience enraptured at every point.\n\nDuring intermission, a very polite British tourist asked me if I had ever seen Groff perform on stage — it was her first time ever seeing him and she was gobsmacked by his talent. As well she should be, since Groff is delivering a career-defining highlight that is sure to be talked about for years to come.\n\nWhen we add in the cast of stunning supporting characters including the heartwrenching Michele Pawk (who should be in every musical ever) as Darin's mother Polly and the incredible Emily Bergl as his sister Nina, the performance really comes together. Timbers directs Groff and company to use up every inch of space around the theatre and immerses us in Darin's life. Pop icon Gracie Lawrence returns to Broadway as the vibrant Connie Francis — her belting is worth the price of admission alone. She's paired with the equally charming Sandra Dee who graciously takes over narration from Darin at points to give us her POV. Of course the highlight of the evening was the music (Andrew Resnick oversaw music supervision and orchestrations with Michael Thurber). That big band sound carries us away as if we were at the Copa. And boy are they moving! Shannon Lewis makes her Broadway debut as a choreographer, and what a lovely debut it is.\n\nWith a terrific full band right on stage the entire time, we are transported to the streets of East Harlem, Vegas, and even Portofino thanks to versatile nightclub scenic design by Derek McLane. I task you with finding a leading man today with half the charisma that Jonathan Groff possesses. He brings not just the story, but the very soul of Bobby Darin to life. If there is one musical to see this season, you might as well grab your bathing suit and come splash in the basement of Wicked - you won't be disappointed.\n\nJust In Time is now in performance at the Circle In The Square on West 50th Street in New York City.",

      "pullQuote": "Get ready to book the Palace, the Palladium, the Hollywood Bowl and the Baths of Caracalla! “Just in Time,” the new Bobby Darin bio-musical that opened Saturday at Circle in the Square, makes it clear that headliner Jonathan Groff is ready for his own solo show on any of the world’s most famous stages.\n\nGroff won a Tony last season for “Merrily We Roll Along,” and there were deserved Tony nominations for his earlier turns in “Hamilton” and “Spring Awakening.” All three are ensemble shows, and in each, Groff delivered a performance that fit beautifully into the story being told.\n\nBut never has he sounded this good. He begins the Darin songfest with “This Could Be the Start of Something Big” and follows it with “Just in Time.” It isn’t Bobby Darin, but it is Groff. And most important, it is great Groff. Having seen him in the three aforementioned Broadway musicals, I would not have expected Groff to command the stage the way he does here as a top-notch song-and-dance man.\n\nThen something very peculiar happens. I’m not sure I’ve ever experienced anything quite like it in the theater. Warren Leight and Isaac Oliver’s book for “Just in Time” has its star telling us, “I’m Jonathan. I’ll be your Bobby Darin tonight.”\n\nOK, so this is not Groff being Darin but rather his playing at being Darin? The “I’m Jonathan” remark brings to mind the recently opened Broadway musical “Smash”: Robyn Hurder isn’t playing Marilyn Monroe; rather, she’s playing an actress playing Marilyn in a Broadway musical.\n\nGot it.\n\nWhat I don’t get is Groff then telling the audience, “I never would’ve guessed I’d have anything in common with [Darin], the playboy crooner and me in Mom’s pumps, but it turns out I do.” As it turns out, Darin lived to entertain, and so does Groff. We’re not told if Darin ever sweat and spit a lot on stage, but apparently Groff does, because he tells us he sweats and spits a lot. Regarding Groff’s personal perspiration notice, “Just in Time” should come with an audience warning that Circle in the Square is the most refrigerated theater on Broadway, even colder than when Alec Baldwin last performed on stage.\n\nBut back to Darin and Groff playing on different teams. Sorry, that “Mom’s pumps” just kind of gobsmacks me. Bobby Darin today is not an icon on the level of Marilyn Monroe, and impersonations are not in order. With “Just in Time,” one might expect what Barbra Streisand did with Fanny Brice in “Funny Girl”; it’s more an evocation than a recreation.\n\nFrankly, Groff doesn’t even evoke Darin. He runs 180 degrees in the other direction from the slightly leering insouciance of someone born Walden Robert Cassotto who always appeared to have smoked one too many cigarettes, drank one too many martinis and screwed everything not bolted to the Copa stage. Darin’s charm wasn’t the flat-out debauchery of Dean Martin, but he was definitely an Italian bad boy from the rough streets of East Harlem. As “Just in Time” points out, there’s a reason why the father (Caesar Samayoa) of singer Connie Francis (Gracie Lawrence) and the mother (Emily Bergl) of teen idol Sandra Dee (Erika Henningsen) wanted nothing to do with the libidinous Darin.\n\nGroff, on the other hand, is the very white-bread boy-next-door from Pennsylvania Amish country, and it’s a testament to his enormous talent that he can project such a squeaky-clean persona and still entertain us in this age of rampant cynicism.\n\nGroff playing Groff playing Darin embodies what the two men share: the need to entertain, it’s when they’re most alive. But again, there’s a big difference. Darin’s vocals possess swagger. Groff’s vocals are almost ethereal. His head voice is gorgeous without having to resort to falsetto. It’s the difference between the streets and the angels.\n\nGroff needs a musical written to showcase his unique gifts, not someone else’s. He could have simply sung the Darin songbook, but why? It’s not a great collection of songs. Do we need to hear “Splish! Splash! I Was Taking a Bath” ever again? And even if Groff delivered a spot-on impersonation of Darin, “Just in Time” would be a substandard bio-musical. Leight and Oliver repeatedly stick Wikipedia details into the dialogue, right down to how many Golden Globe nominations somebody received. Let’s not forget that the Globes, back in the 1960s, were even more of a joke than they are today.\n\nA particularly smarmy moment arrives in Act 2 when Henningsen, being a most enchanting Sandra Dee, reveals, “There I was, doing a picture with Rock Hudson and I had no chemistry with him whatsoever.” This remark is the only reference to the dead gay movie legend in “Just in Time,” and it’s both absurd and loathsome.\n\nFirst of all, in “Come September,” Hudson romances Gina Lollobrigida, not the much younger Dee, who is Darin’s love interest in that film. And second, is this remark by Henningsen supposed to excuse her lack of chemistry with Groff? Frankly, I found them very charming together.\n\nGracie Lawrence’s Connie Francis is another story. Her shrill vocals will make you wonder why anyone ever bought a single copy of “Who’s Sorry Now?”\n\nAlex Timbers directs. He has had his share of bombs on Broadway, “Rocky” among them. On the plus side, he has also been at the helm of such simple delights as “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” and “Peter and the Starcatcher.” When Groff is singing and dancing (stunning choreography by Shannon Lewis), “Just in Time” absolutely dazzles. It doesn’t matter if what’s happening on stage ever makes you think of Bobby Darin. But Groff doesn’t always sing and dance, and when he or anybody else stops to recite dialogue from Leight and Oliver’s book, “Just in Time” simply deadens. Since Timbers also receives a “developed by” credit here, he should have developed a completely different book.\n\n\t\t\tRead Next\n\n\t\t\t&#039;Stranger Things: The First Shadow&#039; Broadway Review: Netflix Mashes Up With &#039;Grease&#039; and Stephen King",

      "pullQuote": "Will nostalgia and devotion translate to ringing cash tills? \n\nThe return of Mamma Mia! to Broadway, “for a limited six-month engagement,” is bargaining on ABBA fans’ eternal desire to hear their favorite songs again (and again). Judging by the man tapping his feet behind me, the many hands waving in the air, and the whooping that accompanied the show’s better-executed set pieces, its producers and the Winter Garden Theatre could be right in calculating on one of theater’s surer bets. \n\nThe show, directed by Phyllida Lloyd, certainly has a formidable financial act to follow. The last resident of the Winter Garden was George Clooney’s Good Night, and Good Luck, which broke multiple records—becoming the first play to surpass $4 million in ticket sales in a single week, as well as becoming the highest-grossing play in Broadway history.\n\nSo far Mamma Mia! has proved similarly all-conquering. The show, with its laughably flimsy plot, premiered in London in 1999 and New York in 2001 (beginning life at the Winter Garden), where it enjoyed a 14-year run and 5,773 performances. It never stopped running in the U.K. Its resolutely lo-fi presentation contrasts sharply with ABBA Voyage—the concert rendering the band-as-avatars in a feast of digital trickery and technical mastery playing in a specially constructed space in London.\n\nWith music and lyrics by ABBA’s Benny Andersson & Björn Ulvaeus, a book by Catherine Johnson, and choreography by Anthony Van Laast, Mamma Mia! is Broadway’s ninth-longest running show of all time, and has spawned two joy-drenched musical movies, starring Meryl Streep, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, and Amanda Seyfried (and Cher!) all executing collectively convincing impressions of having the wacked-out times of their lives.\n\nMany in the audience are likely in attendance because of those movies, alongside those who loved the stage show the first time around, and those for whom who still treasure ABBA’s music and the exquisite compendium that is ABBA Gold. \n\nThis history of pleasure is what Mamma Mia! aspires to mine, and yet—in this production—flails in the attempt. Done exuberantly right, Mamma Mia! should feel like soaring karaoke meets wild revels, a whole lot of song-and-dance unreality stuffed into a real-world setting. Yet the tone—come join the raucous party, bring your shiniest bellbottoms!—feels tinnier in this awkwardly mounted, haphazard jukebox show, hampered by poor sound and lackluster staging.\n\nAgainst a drab backdrop of white-washed walls, a young woman, Sophie (Amy Weaver), is about to get married to true love Sky (Grant Reynolds) on the Greek island where she and her hippy-dippy mother Donna (Christine Sherrill), have lived all their lives. Sophie invites the men she suspects of being her father—British, solid Harry (Rob Marnell), wild man Bill (Jim Newman), and easy-going American Sam (Victor Wallace)—to come to the wedding to give her away and find out which one is actually her father. \n\nDonna’s emotional freefall around the presence of the trio is accompanied by her reuniting with old friends Tanya (Jalynn Steele) and Rosie (Carly Sakolove) to re-form the band they once sang in. The best moments of the musical—on stage and screen—feature the older female friends singing, joking, hanging out, and remembering. In a youth-obsessed pop culture, Mamma Mia! proudly emphasizes that having fun, being loud, dressing up, acting outrageously, taking chances, and embracing desire are the provinces of those growing older too.\n\nSherrill nails her 11 ‘o’ clock “Winner Takes It All,” even if the arrangement feels oddly paced, and Steele and Sakolove play their characters with the right kind of broad-comic energy (Steele’s “Does Your Mother Know That You’re Out?” and Sakolove’s “Take a Chance on Me,” alongside Newman, are delightfully staged).\n\nHowever, over two-and-a-half hours, the show’s plot barely progresses, and is merely a rail on which to hang the Swedish supergroup’s greatest hits, all sung well (like “Voulez-Vous,” “Dancing Queen,” “The Winner Takes It All,” and “Super Trouper”). The characters sing these songs—that kind of go along with where the story is at—at each other in place of words. Sometimes the joins are smooth, quite often the song feels hammered clumsily into place. \n\nOnly sporadically does this production of Mamma Mia! flare into the kind of life that its wonderful songlist merits. Bar a few numbers and its get-up-and-dance finale, the show almost does ABBA down.\n\nThe pounding sound levels of the orchestra dominate and occasionally drown out the singing. Some arrangements bizarrely cut off the ends of songs and jerkily shove us back into the action, when the instinct of the audience is to applaud. A few characters look hopelessly frozen as they are sung at. \n\nThe show retains an eccentric charm—the dancing company and their flippers in “Lay All Your Love On Me” remain a moment of welcome silliness—but for significant stretches it also feels stilted and flat.\n\nIn 2001, opening in the wake of 9/11, Mamma Mia! found a vital role as a route or conduit for escapism. At its best it is wacky and nostalgic, heartfelt and ridiculous. 24 years later, in a world riven with different kinds of tension and alarm, it could perform the same function. But this Mamma Mia! doesn’t feel as fun and untethered as it should. \n\nFinally, after a muted final scene featuring theater’s most gigantic, scary moon, the show provides an opportunity for the audience to sing, whoop, and clap along to “Dancing Queen,” “Mamma Mia!,” and “Waterloo,” as the lead characters resplendently decked out in seventies-glam costumes give a mini-concert. Suddenly, Mamma Mia! becomes the delirious singalong and dance party it has wanted to be all along. In this production, it feels both welcome and far too late.",

But the dramaturgically shrewd setting of a wedding shows that there is an art to the jukebox musical. Few bands more successfully move both grandma and sullen teenagers to dance than ABBA, the secret weapon of all wedding DJs.\n\nThe three daddies also deliver memorable performances. Marnell captures a distinctively English awkwardness that is undeniably charming. Newman is the woofiest of the trio, making us viscerally understand Rosie’s breathless attraction. Wallace endows Sam with bedside eyes and a twinge of sadness in his singing voice. He’s like a Florida meteorologist brooding over a summer squall, a vibe that gives the second act number “SOS” a surprise emotional kick.\n\nBut no one does a better job of illuminating the real stakes in this slim plot than Sherrill, a veteran of the touring and Las Vegas productions who is making her Broadway debut.

      "pullQuote": "Walking into the Winter Garden Theatre this week to see the new revival of “Mamma Mia!,” I suddenly found myself back on Oct. 18, 2001. I was there at the Winter Garden then not as a critic but a theater reporter who had already written a lot about 9/11 and its devastating effect on the theater in New York City. Box office figures had plummeted and a few shows had closed. “Urinetown,” which opened that September, had to re-stage a scene where a character fell from the top of a tall building, and in early October, Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren opened in August Strindberg’s “Dance of Death,” a title that sent people rushing away from the box office. The money-losing revival clocked in just over 100 performances.\n\n“Mamma Mia!” was another story, having been a big hit in London. Here was a feel-good show that recycled a bunch of songs by ABBA's Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus, and asked nothing more of us than to be entertained and forget all our troubles, which continued to feel downright apocalyptic. The Broadway community needed a hit and even the critic at the New York Times had to comply by repeating his female date’s positive take on the show. What Ben Brantley really thought of “Mamma Mia!,” no one ever knew from that carefully crafted money review.",

The stage and screen legend is back home on Broadway, where she got her start in “Gypsy” opposite Ethel Merman in 1960, for the first time in eight years. In between being on the boards, she’s been hard at work making films, giving wonderful lead performances in “Thelma” and “Eleanor the Great.” At a spry 96 years old, Squibb is, at long last, in her title-character era.",

      "pullQuote": "First and most formidably brilliant, there is June Squibb.\n\nIn Marjorie Prime (2nd Stage at the Hayes Theater), Squibb is conducting nothing less than a supreme acting masterclass, playing two variations of her character Marjorie: an 85-year-old woman nearing the end of life with both a flickering grip and memory of times past, alongside a no-BS sharpness about that past and the present that surrounds her.\n\nAfter Marjorie dies, Squibb—herself 96—plays Marjorie's tech avatar, a so-called Prime (hence the title of the play), an AI, computer-programmed version of a human that lives on to ostensibly offer comfort and presence to loved ones after death. Finally, in Jordan Harrison's play, in a softly lit afterlife, Marjorie is reunited with other loved ones, all now transformed into Primes enjoying some downtime in a heavenly realm that looks very familiar on Lee Jellinek's very domestic set.\n\nIn a triumphant, surely award-worthy role, Squibb—who was Oscar-nominated for her role in Nebraska, and recently starred in the movie Thelma—not only shows that advanced age is no barrier to brilliance; her impressively composed performance is a sharp reminder to everyone younger not to shirk or sit around.\n\nSquibb's excellence is matched in the performances of Cynthia Nixon as Marjorie's daughter Tess, Danny Burstein as Tess' husband Jon (and husband of the year material at that!), and Christopher Lowell as the Prime younger version of her husband Walter.\n\nMarjorie's final chapter of life and later Prime incarnation serve as a means for the characters to explore grief, mortality, memory, responsibility, and, at its heart, what the substance and point of living a life—of being a parent, partner, or child—really mean.\n\nSquibb's Marjorie contains multitudes, and Squibb shows them all so tangibly and without airs that her character feels recognizably real right from the beginning of the play. She may be ailing, but in Squibb's compelling rendering—under Anne Kauffman's fine, sensitive direction—we see that Marjorie is not to be wrapped in cotton wool or patronized.\n\nIn this sense, she is like Thelma in Thelma; Squibb's skill is to make us see the characters she plays as people, rather than facsimile older people. We laugh at her dry wit (her first laugh line in Marjorie Prime is complaining about the peanut butter Tess buys), are moved by her memories, and listen intently to every word she says.\n\nIn the play's opening scene, she is talking to Lowell, a markedly younger-looking man called Walter. Initially, you worry: his arch tone and her warmth are jarring; is this an age-gap relationship with some element of exploitation?\n\nBut soon, past tenses and shared memories and Marjorie calling Tess their daughter point to something else: Is she imagining the younger spirit of her much-missed dead husband? And then, the existence of the Prime is revealed.\n\nThe Primes work in a simple way. \"The more you talk, the more human it gets,\" as Jon puts it. Much of the play looks at the intimacy the Primes offer; how a Prime converses equably to soften older pains (of family suicide and present-day child estrangement), or more jagged personal relationships.\n\nWalter's Prime is his youngest, most handsome self; Marjorie's is lovelier and kinder to Tess—they get on so much better—than in their real life.\n\nMarjorie's Prime gives space to Tess to say to her mother all the things she loved and recalled about her. As a Prime, Marjorie is transformed into a micro-chipped empath and listener. It is as seductive as it is plain weird.\n\nA later twist in the play, which will go unrevealed here, digs into the thorniness of this dead-and-alive dialogue—that, stripping away all the warmth of this reconfigured dead person, Primes are not real people; that they offer a semblance of family and intimacy, but they are not your loved one. And what they are offering is a kind of toxic balm, one that locks you in perpetually revolving doors of grief and nostalgia at the expense of moving forward.\n\nBurstein shows how even the endlessly supportive Jon has his limits, feeling increasingly desperate as Tess sinks further into a melancholic rabbit hole. Nixon has the toughest role on stage: a caring daughter becoming more careworn, as her silent resentments mount.\n\nTess is growingly convinced that aging is just a cycle with a known, bad end—losing control, going for dinner with friends, talking about the weather, over and over again until death. She cannot stand the idea.\n\nWhat Jon can stand, or what he will accept, is the play's final thicket of complication. He isn't sure he wants the demi-humanness of the Primes around him, and the final scene featuring a trio of them—so calm and gentle on the surface—speaks to a telling, if unspoken, absence on stage.\n\nMarjorie Prime asks why and how we should accept our passage through life and path to death—and it does so with a witty directness alongside a sense of wrenching inquiry and elegy. Is it all over when we die, asks the play? And even as it proffers the possibility of comfort provided by a tech-rejuvenated loved one, it quietly answers itself: Maybe it should be.\n\nAt the play's heart is the dazzlingly adept Squibb. Her Marjories (real and Prime) are measured, funny, vulnerable, and tough—two colorful, intriguing human portraits.",

But also some part of us does linger on in those who knew us, those who tell our stories, who reach fondly for us in moments of nostalgia. If tech can somehow aid in that, perhaps we should let it. Marjorie Prime is frustratingly ambivalent about that idea, tossing it around and wanly entertaining both sides of the argument before it ventures off into what perhaps interests Harrison more. With its tech conceit set aside, Marjorie Prime is mostly a story of trauma echoing through generations of a family, which is a quite common theme within the American theater canon.",

      "pullQuote": "At 96 years old, June Squibb delivers a remarkably sharp and emotionally nuanced performance in the Broadway premiere of Jordan Harrison's Marjorie Prime. Directed by Anne Kauffman and featuring Cynthia Nixon, Danny Burstein, and Christopher Lowell, this one-act drama explores what remains authentically human when technology offers comforting illusions.\n\nThe play centers on Marjorie, an elderly woman with Alzheimer's who forms an attachment to a humanoid robot modeled after her deceased husband Walter. Her daughter Tess struggles with the ethical implications of allowing her mother to retreat into false memories rather than face harsh realities. As Marjorie's cognition diminishes, the Prime's capabilities expand—a cruel irony at the heart of the story.\n\nHarrison's script addresses contemporary anxieties about artificial intelligence and human connection with remarkable prescience. Viewing this work today, amid widespread concerns about AI dependency, feels almost unbearably grim. A particularly poignant line captures Marjorie's desperation: I don't have to get better. Just keep me from getting worse.\n\nSquibb's performance stands out for its expressive range—shifting fluidly between joy and devastating heartbreak. The supporting cast excels as well, with Lowell balancing warmth and mechanical distance, and Nixon portraying a woman emotionally hardened by circumstance. Lee Jellinek's set design, Ben Stanton's lighting, and Daniel Kluger's sound work together to create an intimate, delicate production.\n\nMarjorie Prime is at the Hayes Theatre on West 44th Street in New York City.",

More rapt, more heartbroken, more rattled by the harrowing questions presented by the long, slow, terribly seductive suicide humanity seems bent on carrying out via technology. Harrison is a formidable craftsman and Marjorie Prime is built very well, but in a way it resembles one of its own artificial humans: It’s an extremely palatable version of the thing.

In the case of the original new musical “Maybe Happy Ending,” the best things. Will Aronson and Hue Park’s one-act romantic, robot comedy — a Broadway transfer from South Korea — brims with gooey performances from its four-person cast, tickling humor and pools of heart. It’s a production with gimmicks (commentary on our para-relationship with technology, a set design of industrial wonders, “Glee”’s best male actor), but miraculously and mercifully it doesn’t solely bank on them.\n\nThe show drops us into an unfamiliar time, 2064, an unnerving reality where human owners and humanoid helperbots, like Oliver (Darren Criss) and Claire (Helen J. Shen), live in tandem. Oliver is an earlier model, so Criss embraces staccato movements, like he’s full of tightly-wired joints. Shen, as the more advanced Claire, uses smoother gestures. The two subtly capture the differences in physicality and vocal inflection between their makings, but their connection when partnered in scenes — as they evolve from nuisance neighbors to chatty friends to honeyed lovers — is always in sync. These two even have chemistry with a prop: Oliver’s plant, HwaBoon, tags along for the musical’s adventure like an animal sidekick in a Disney film.\n\n            This post is for paying subscribers only\n            Subscribe now\n            Already have an account?

The book is\n\nWritten by Hue Park (book and lyrics) and Will Aronson (book, lyrics, and music),\n\nAfter 12 years, Oliver's quiet life is interrupted by a knock on the door from his across-the-hall neighbor Claire (Helen J Shen). Claire is a \"Helperbot 5,\" more aesthetically humanoid but less durable, and she needs to borrow Oliver's charger. Both Oliver and Claire are on the road to planned obsolescence, and that, of course, is when they inadvertently fall in love while on a journey to return Oliver to his former companion.\n\nYes, it's fairly predictable. The second Oliver starts talking about how James will eventually come pick him up, you know his dream will eventually be crushed, the same way that you know that Annie is never going to find her birth parents. But it's not the destination, it's the journey. And this journey is just very charming, thanks to two writers who've crafted a wholesome and believably human(oid) story and a pair of evenly matched stars who are impossible to hate.\n\nFrom his stiffly humorous movement (choreographed by Moni Yakim) to the unblinking sincerity in his delivery, Criss is immensely impressive as he captures the discreetly emotional essence of this outdated bot. His tightly coiffed hair (styled by Craig Franklin Miller) and shellacked makeup (Suki Tsujimoto) go a long way in helping him bring us to an uncanny valley that's legitimately freaky. Shen is effortlessly charming, infusing Claire with a shy humor that makes her utterly lovable. Together, they share such easy chemistry that you find yourself rooting for these two lonely robots to be together forever.\n\nMichael Arden's high-tech staging works its robot butt off to bring the futuristic setting to life. Dane Laffrey's gliding set pieces evoke the sleek but rundown atmosphere of Oliver and Claire's world, but they're so noisy you can always tell when they're coming.

      "pullQuote": "Is Broadway ready for a quiet musical? The timing is perfect. Recently, a mini-war broke out on Broadway when an actor in “The Roommate,” Patti LuPone, asked that something be done about the loud music seeping into her theater from the walls of the theater that’s home to “Hell’s Kitchen.” That’s when an actor in “Hell’s Kitchen,” Kecia Lewis, charged LuPone with a “micro-aggression” due to her use of the word &#8216;loud.' The problem is, all Broadway musicals are too loud.\n\nUntil now. “Maybe Happy Ending” opens Tuesday at the Belasco Theatre, and it is downright peaceful, as well as charming and beautiful and poignant. The irony of over-amplification is that while one can be swept away by the sheer sound, if not bludgeoned, that loudness makes it often impossible to decipher lyrics. The lyrics by Hue Park and Will Aronson for “Maybe Happy Ending” are both simple and very smart, and adding to their allure is that they’re written for two characters that are not people.\n\nOliver (Darren Criss) and Claire (Helen J Shen) are robots, servants of sorts, who have been retired to what is called “the Helperbot Yards outside of Seoul, Korea.” Park and Aronson also wrote the book, and a wonderful touch is how Oliver and Claire meet. It’s just how Mimi and Rodolfo meet in “La Bohème,” only set sometime in the future: Mimi’s candle has gone out and she needs a flame from Rodolfo’s stove to relight it; Claire’s body is about to stop functioning, and she knocks on Oliver’s door because she needs recharging.",

It examines what it means to be human, what makes us human, and what it is that separates us from robots — but instead of doing this from a human angle, it takes the robot perspective. The musical by Will Aronson and Hue Park is set in a near-future Seoul, and concerns Oliver ( Darren Criss of \"Glee\" and \"The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\") and Claire ( Helen J Shen in her Broadway debut), two human-like robot \"HelperBots\" who have now been \"retired.\" Just like an old iPhone, they are doomed to planned obsolescence, abandoned by former owners and left to toil in the \"HelperBot Yards,\" a sort of robot purgatory. They meet when Claire has to borrow a charger (her cable is faulty and her battery life is shrinking; sound familiar?) and they form an unexpected bond. blogherads.adq.push(function () { blogherads .defineSlot( 'medrec', 'gpt-variety-article-mid-article-uid0' ) .setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid-article1\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\",\"mid-article\"] ) .setTargeting( 'viewable', 'yes' ) .setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\/mid-article\") .addSize([[300,250],[2,2],[300,251],[2,4],[4,2],[320,480],[620,366]]) .setClsOptimization(\"minsize\") ; }); Related Stories &#039;Euphoria&#039; Season 3 Trailer: Zendaya, Sydney Sweeney and Jacob Elordi Return as Rue Battles Drug Dealers, Cassie Becomes a Cam Girl and More",

The final scenes, as Strong and Manville wrestle with the full ramifications of their unwitting actions, unspool with a furious inevitability that is difficult to watch and impossible to look away. Ickes and his cast have achieved something truly remarkable, producing a classic that doesn't feel like a revival at all. Oedipus may be the best play of the decade, and also the most contemporary.",

      "pullQuote": "Robert Icke’s modern take on Sophocles runs at Studio 54.\n\nAn ominous countdown clock ticks away the seconds in Robert Icke’s\n\nThat's because this production, which Icke also directs, has more going for it than a suspenseful timepiece. Mark Strong and Lesley Manville, giving two of this year's great performances, lead a brilliant cast that turns this millennia-old story of pride and familial dysfunction into a timely political thriller that resonates with uncomfortable questions.\n\nThe scene is a campaign office where populist politician Oedipus (Strong) and his family await election-night results (Hildegard Bechtler’s busy set is a fun house of pivot doors and hiding places). He looks like a shoo-in, even though there have been calls for him to produce a birth certificate to prove his eligibility. Not to worry, he says, his life is an open book. Oedipus’s wife, Jocasta (Manville), a dozen years his senior, isn’t so sure.\n\nThen, in comes a meddlesome prophet, Teiresias (Samuel Brewer), stirring things up with tedious riddles and vexing forecasts of doom. Suddenly, questions are being asked by his brother-in-law, Creon (a stellar John Carroll Lynch) about an accident that happened years ago when the former ruler, Laius, was killed in an auto accident. Might Laius’s driver (Teagle F. Bougere) somehow implicate Oedipus in the death? Jocasta thinks all these inquiries are irrelevant—the past should be left in the past. But, as if propelled by fate, Oedipus continues to ask questions, and with each answer he comes closer to a blinding revelation.\n\nYou can interpret the play's political implications and analogs anyway you like (have fun with that). What’s more important is that Icke has taken a story this old and made it feel fresh. Intact are the original names (with a couple of new characters) and the essence of Sophocles’ intent, even though some of the scenes might now seem far-fetched (how did that blind prophet get past security anyway?).\n\nBut Icke updates the plot and dialogue to bring things into the present (Wojciech Dziedzic has aptly costumed the cast in modern politico drag). The play begins with a pre-recorded video (designed by Tal Yarden) depicting Oedipus rallying a crowd of supporters, and later he chides his gay son, Polyneices (James Wilbraham), for hiding his homosexuality. Obviously, these are scenes Sophocles never imagined, but they effectively make the point that for Oedipus, the truth will become a double-edged sword—or in this version, something more haute couture.\n\nStrong is extraordinary as he shuttles back and forth between the poles of Oedipus’s mercurial nature, making you loathe him one minute for his overweening pride and arrogance, and admire him the next as he plumbs the depths of his past. He’s a cocky bastard with his family, accusing Creon of backstabbing him, and his daughter, Antigone (Olivia Reis, mesmerizing), of being too smart for her own good. But his face softens into the pained submission of a flagellant when he learns who Jocasta really is.\n\nHe's backed up by a terrific supporting cast, including Jordan Scowen as Oedipus’s son Eteocles, Ani Mesa-Perez as Lichas, and an endearing Bhasker Patel as Corin. Special mention must go to Anne Reid as Oedipus’s foster mother, Merope. She transfixes our gaze every moment she’s onstage, delivering the elderly woman’s world-weary wisdom with grandeur, severity, and hard-boiled eloquence.\n\nBut the show goes to Manville, who crushes us with an extraordinary performance as Oedipus’s aggressively truth-defying wife—and in the process makes a case for this play being renamed\n\nIcke’s pacing in this two-hour play is not always as brisk as one might like. There is no intermission, so, I will admit, I found myself now and then looking at the red numbers of the clock in anticipation of a bathroom break that would never come. But in the end, Icke succeeds in bringing this\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.

Any announcement of new work from the writer-director, known stateside lately for his incendiary updates of the Oresteia, Hamlet and The Doctor (from Schnitzler's Professor Bernhardi), are reason enough to immediately secure at least one round of tickets. So it's curious that he's hit a wall with Sophocles' Oedipus.\n\nThere's still the baseline level of competence for which he's come to be known—a sleek, glass-paneled modernist set by Hildegard Bechtler; laser-sharp performances, this time led by the phenomenal pairing of Mark Strong and Lesley Manville—that is leagues above most others' hopes for excellence. But without the profound insight (modern and timeless) he's excavated from those other works, there's little to generate the same theatrical electricity.\n\nIcke reimagines the story as unfolding on election night, with Oedipus as a charismatic candidate investigating his predecessor's murder. The production features Icke's usual whip-smart language and technical excellence. However, because audiences already know this story's surprises, the production needed either masterful pacing or fresh interpretive angles. Instead, each domino falls with complete earnestness, and without broader examination, resulting in minimal dramatic tension.\n\nDespite these critiques, there are far worse places to be than at a Robert Icke production—or watching Strong and Manville perform.\n\nOedipus runs through February 8, 2026 at Studio 54.",

You can throw in Shucked for good measure. Escola, low-key famous these last few years through YouTube videos, late night appearances and gigs for TV&#8217;s The Other Two and Difficult People , ups the career stakes immensely with Oh, Mary! , opening tonight at Broadway&#8217;s Lyceum Theatre.

I have a pretty low threshold for the coarseness of much low comedy, and plenty of the humor in “Oh, Mary!” is so low it qualifies as subterranean.

      "pullQuote": "Escola stars as Mary Todd Lincoln in this gut-busting revisionist history.\n\nShe enters snarling, thirst on her lips and murderous rage in her eyes. This is Mary Todd Lincoln, as played by actor-playwright Cole Escola in their Broadway debut,\n\nAbe conspires to distract Mary by hiring her a handsome young acting teacher (James Scully), but this only fuels her determination to return to the stage — especially when he seems to secure her an audition for\n\nA fixture of the downtown cabaret scene and a writer on the television series\n\nIt’s Escola’s razor-sharp instincts as an actor, however, that really seal the deal. With impeccable comic timing and expressions that could be read from space (the stank face is epic), Escola grabs hold of our attention from the first beat and refuses to let go.\n\nThe supporting performances rise to the high bar Escola sets. Ricamora’s Lincoln is equal parts pathetic and menacing, his cruelty derived from real and lingering insecurity about his carnal urges. The adorable Tony Macht plays Simon, the president’s assistant and object of the great emancipator’s lecherous gaze. It's a performance that tells a clear story about Washington courtiers: Degrading sexual acts are a small price to pay for a resume bump.\n\nHandsome and furtive, Scully artfully conceals several of the script’s biggest secrets, unleashing the fury of Medea as the play hurtles toward its fateful conclusion. And Leigh, of all the actors, most comfortably inhabits the 1860s world of courtly manners and sexual repression. She makes an ideal foil for Escola’s demon child of a first lady.\n\nDirector Sam Pinkleton’s production is delightfully analog. The set (by dots) looks like it belongs onstage at Ford’s Theatre circa 1865, its fakery proudly worn like costume jewelry to a drag ball. Holly Pierson’s costumes are similarly stagey in a way that really complements the performances (Escola is having so much fun abusing that hoop dress).\n\nCha See’s lighting accentuates the comic beats, reddening with the president’s face. Sound designers Daniel Kluger and Drew Levy subtly amplify the performers so that we don’t miss a single brilliant line. And Kluger’s stormy piano music during blackout scene transitions reinforces the Victorian feeling of a play that is an intoxicating cocktail of old and new sensibilities.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.

      "pullQuote": "Cole Escola's Broadway debut in Oh, Mary! is a triumph of absurdist comedy. The show centers on Mary Todd Lincoln in the weeks before Abraham Lincoln's assassination, reimagined as a former cabaret performer struggling with alcoholism.\n\nThe premise involves President Lincoln (portrayed as gay and conflicted) hiring an acting teacher to redirect his wife from drinking and performing cabaret into respectable theatre. The setup allows Escola to explore themes of identity and artistic legitimacy while delivering spectacular physical comedy.\n\nEscola's performance dominates the 80-minute production with feral hog energy—searching frantically for hidden alcohol, throwing furniture, and sustaining inventive slapstick. The supporting cast, including Conrad Ricamora as Lincoln and James Scully as the acting teacher, provides excellent comedic foils.\n\nDirector Sam Pinkleton orchestrates precise physicality, with a single mug generating audience laughter. The design elements—including Cha See's lighting and Holly Pierson's costumes—enhance the show's tonal flexibility between period and contemporary performance.\n\nThe show is also a piece of history. While transferring a peculiar Off-Broadway jewel to a commercial run is not unusual, Oh, Mary! does stand apart from its peers on Broadway. If one were inclined to look for a deeper meaning in Oh, Mary!, it is a rebuttal against the legitimacy, good taste, and straightness of most self-serious art. The fact that this piece of radically queer comedy has become the buzziest show of the season is a hopeful sign of work to come.\n\nOh, Mary! is at the Lyceum Theatre.",

There, Cole Escola’s riotous, extremely faux-historical farce, Oh, Mary!, has begun its Broadway run, and long may it reign. Oh, Mary! took the West Village deliriously captive in its big gay pirate ship back in the spring, and while the wickedly clever Escola — who made their name first on YouTube playing wonderfully unhinged characters, then as a scene-stealer on shows like Search Party and Difficult People — is on record calling the uptown transfer “a mistake,” they and director Sam Pinkleton have wisely left funny enough alone. Really, far more than enough — Oh, Mary! is hilarious and, underneath the mayhem, both structurally rock solid and sneakily moving. It may be playing the palace now, but it’s confident enough in its own skin to have resisted any sort of unnecessary makeover.",

      "pullQuote": "An early candidate for Broadway’s song of the season has announced itself. \n\n“Dear Bill” is sung by the actor Jak Malone playing the character of Hester Leggatt, an MI5 secretary during World War II, in the charming, funny, tonally scattered, and sporadically piercing musical Operation Mincemeat (Golden Theatre, currently booking to Aug. 10), freshly transferred to Broadway from an award-winning ongoing run in London’s West End.\n\nThe semi-sung, semi-spoken number is a sudden, dropped rock of seriousness in an otherwise frothing river of frivolity, underlining the musical’s core intention to memorialize wartime’s not-famous and unlauded.\n\nMalone does not belt, but rather navigates “Dear Bill” as if composing it in real time: a quiet, reticent confessional. A letter of yearning, separation, and devastation (with echoes of Flanders and Swann, Noel Coward, Mrs. Miniver, and Vera Lynn), “Dear Bill” is phrased around the most mundane things—a stream of consciousness, all concealing via the stiffest of stiff-upper-lips, those things you really want to say to a much-missed loved one.\n\nIts free verse, and precisely enunciated lyrics begin: “Dear Bill/I’m afraid I’ve not got long to write/I’m off to Mary’s/You know how she feels about Bridge night./It’s been a few days/I thought that I’d send a few lines/Next door’s Greyhound came into the garden this morning./I think he likes the roses/ They’re doing fine/I used some twine to tie them up and rein them in/I hope they’ll bloom next spring.”\n\nThe audience’s appreciative response to the song is intense. Malone’s pitch-perfect clipped recitation, and the thudding impact of “Dear Bill,” stop the show. It is the least likely, most surprising showstopper so far this Broadway season in a show defined by a distinctly British quirkiness rooted in its source material. \n\nMincemeat’s verbal and physical comedy bring to mind Monty Python and pantomime, appositely enough for this wackiest of true stories about how the British military plotted to use a corpse, fictitiously styled to be a Royal Marines officer named Captain (Acting Major) William Martin, to deceive the Nazis over the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943. An opening statement outlining the show’s basis in history was added to the Broadway production because director Robert Hastie kept hearing many Americans thought it so nuts it had to be fiction.\n\n‘Buena Vista Social Club’ Is Broadway’s Most Fabulous PartyFIESTATim TeemanThe cast of five play the real-life core characters involved—Malone as Leggatt, Natasha Hodgson as Naval intelligence officer Ewen Montagu, David Cumming as intelligence officer Charles Cholmondeley, Zoë Roberts as British army officer Johnny Bevan, and Claire-Marie Hall as MI5 secretary Jean Leslie—as well as a dizzying array of subsidiary characters. \n\nAll five also pop us as a panoply of other characters, including deep-of-voice seamen, gossiping secretaries, and an incredibly louche British vice-consul in Spain when the last thing you need to execute a sensitive, war-altering plan is an incredibly louche British vice-consul in Spain. \n\nA significant part of the joy of the show, directed with invention and dazzle by Hastie, is watching the five switch characters in a flash, somehow momentarily materializing in a new costume as a new person, as plans to find and deploy the corpse grow even more complicated and relations between the five key characters grow testier. The musical ricochets between zany comedy, history lesson, and deeply felt memorial.\n\nIts cast and producers cleave to the show’s modest beginnings. Hodgson, who first heard about the real-life Operation Mincemeat via the “Stuff You Should Know” podcast, sent it to Cumming, Roberts, and Felix Hagan, her SpitLip theatre company co-founders. Next, they read London Times columnist Ben Macintyre’s 2010 book, then Montagu’s 1953 book, The Man Who Never Was, and watched its 1956 film adaptation. (The musical makes a pointed joke of Montagu’s ambition to cash in on the operation after its completion.)\n\nEight Andrew Scotts Star in One of NYC’s Hottest TicketsSEEING DOUBLETim TeemanSpitLip debuted the musical in 2019 at the 80-seat off-West End New Diorama Theatre, moving to the West End in 2023. At last year’s Olivier Awards (the British Tonys), Mincemeat won Best New Musical, while Malone won the Best Supporting Actor, Musical award. (Let’s see if “Dear Bill” earns him mirroring acclaim at the Tonys.)\n\nThe actors inhabit characters of all genders and ages. This fluidity is not played in and of itself for laughs; you simply accept, for example, the swaggering Hodgson as the scene-chomping, caddish Montagu and Malone as the steadfast Hester. Separately, the show reveals how women like Hester and Jean were particularly used, then marginalized, in a sexist institution.\n\nScaling up to a Broadway house doesn’t rob the show of its innate small-scale charm, but it presents a challenge of necessary sizing-up that makes you want to see the original iteration. The show retains its appealing make-do-and-mend feel (Ben Stones designs both costumes and sets), meaning that the crazy efforts of the group of five to successfully execute Operation Mincemeat mirror the crazy efforts of Cumming, Hall, Hodgson, Malone, and Roberts to put on the show. Mincemeat’s charm is in how determinedly unshowy it feels until its finale when it decides, tongue-in-cheek, to give the audience all the glitz and pizazz expected from a Broadway finale (and even then it subverts itself). \n\nOne typically daffy set-piece features characters passing a briefcase around amid a tangle of landline phone cords. Rousing songs like “Born to Lead” sit alongside the jazzy “Spilsbury” about the Sweeney Todd-esque pathologist tapped to find the corpse. At the top of act two, a raucous Springtime for Hitler-in-spirit number, “Das Übermensch,” combines dancing Nazis, boybands and K-pop. The song intends to skewer authoritarianism, though tonally—at this moment in America and the world more generally—the song finds itself on an uneasy interpretive knife-edge. \n\nWhy ‘Purpose’ Is the Most Explosive Family Drama on BroadwayTRUTH BE TOLDTim TeemanWhen serious points about fascism are more soberly spoken, an audible rumble of recognition by those less than enamored living under Trump’s second term ripple through the Golden Theatre. The show’s focus skis all over the place, slaloming from hilarity to dense plot explanation to deeper meditations on patriotism, sexism, and loss. While accepting the real Operation Mincemeat was indeed complicated, the musical feels overlong; its brilliant cast ensures it never drags, but it sometimes feels too in service to its admirable mission to explain.\n\nHowever, the show’s serious and ultimately successful intention is to celebrate heroes forgotten by history—principally the five characters themselves (particularly the women), but also the real person, a homeless man named Glyndwr Michael, who was the corpse used in Operation Mincemeat.\n\nThe group is thrown into dispute over using Michael’s body so cavalierly, and then—in the final scene—the cast come together to pay resonant tribute to him. This concluding narrative beat reveals, beyond its ribald humor and impressive physical exertions, that Operation Mincemeat seeks to underscore a more damning truth about the ruthlessness of our leaders and the human cost of war—a truth that reverberates sharply to our present day.",

      "pullQuote": "A zany little West End show about World War II charms its way to New York City.\n\nBoasting 74 five-star reviews, a marquee so bright yellow you can see it all the way on 9\n\nWritten by the musical-comedy troupe SpitLip (made up of cast members David Cumming, Natasha Hodgson, and Zoë Roberts, along with Felix Hagan), this is the improbably true story about a British deception operation designed to mislead Nazi Germany about the location of the Allied landing at Sicily. The mission—stay with me on this—entailed dressing the corpse of a Welsh vagrant as a British officer, planting falsified documents on the body, and setting it adrift off the coast of neutral Spain. The hope was that the Spanish would discover the cadaver and pass the intelligence on to the Germans, who would then redirect their forces to Sardinia, leaving Sicily strategically vulnerable for the Allies to capture.\n\nLeading the charge are intelligence officers Charles Cholmondeley (Cumming), a socially inept scientist, and smug bureaucrat Ewen Montagu (Hodgson), who is responsible for convincing their commanding officer Johnny Bevan (Roberts) that the plan is worth enacting. Alongside stenographers Hester Leggatt (Jak Malone) and Jean Leslie (Claire-Marie Hall), this group of bureaucrats create their man—fake Royal Marines major William Martin—from scratch, and essentially hope for the best.\n\nIt's a fascinating story, and a piece of history that Americans aren't likely to encounter anywhere in their high school curriculum. Depending on your tolerance for breathless silliness, you might prefer sticking to the 2021 movie with Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen, because this musical is the most unapologetically goofy thing since\n\nThe assorted issues that I had with the show in London still stand. There isn't a lot of melodic distinction between the songs, and as a result, most of the big production numbers tend to blend together. Mike Walker's tinny sound design doesn't help; the fast-moving lyrics are rendered almost completely unintelligible, and the band feels like it's miles away. And I still think it needs to be shorter: Pushing two hours and 40 minutes, the show stretches past its welcome, especially in the second half, which plods along through story padding as the officers await word of whether their plan worked.\n\nBut whereas I merely appreciated the show in the West End, I loved it on Broadway. There's not much discernible difference between Robert Hastie's irreverent staging here at the Golden and there at the Fortune, besides a handful of upgrades to Ben Stones's deceptively versatile set and Mark Henderson's glitzy lighting. Knowing what was coming allowed me to better appreciate the dedication of the five actors to their craft; they've done the show\n\nTheir complete seriousness is what allows all the peculiar stuff to work, whether its Cumming's elongated physical movement or the second act opener, an EDM Nazi dance number replete with sequined swastikas (the one instance where Stones's costumes shift away from trousers and suspenders). Jenny Arnold's choreography shouldn't be underestimated either; clearly, a lot of careful consideration went into the way the actors' bodies move in their multiple cross-gendered roles.\n\nLeading that charge is Hodgson as Montagu, her voice growling with a Clint Eastwood purr, and carrying herself with a swaggering self-assurance that is enough to make all the straight ladies in the audience change their majors to Ewen. She and Cumming make for a delightful double-act, the macho man who takes the uber nerd under his wing that allows his confidence to grow. Hall is terrific as Jean, the plucky woman from the typing pool determined to make her mark, while Roberts kills it with one of the most surprisingly real figures from this espionage mission: Ian Fleming, an eccentric intelligence officer in a black tux who's writing a novel about a British secret agent with a penchant for martinis shaken, not stirred.\n\nBut the show is undeniably stolen by Malone, whose array of roles includes the vampiric coroner supplying the officers with their body and, most notably, Hester, the fastidious head of the M15 secretarial pool who crafts a fake love letter for the fictional soldier to carry. He and Hall take command of the second act with \"Useful,\" a great song about the unsung contributions of the women who toil behind the scenes while men reap the glory. Yet it's Malone's first-act solo \"Dear Bill\" that lingers long after the curtain falls. One of the most poignant musical-theater ballads in recent memory, Malone delivers it as a masterclass in stillness and emotional acuity, hitting us like a ton of bricks. It's the kind of performance that wins awards, and it wouldn't surprise me if Malone collects a Tony come June to go with his Olivier.\n\nIf I'm being honest, I'll admit that I was among the cynics who didn’t think this little-show-that-could was cut out for the spotlight on 45\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.

Audiences are always receptive to flights into jubilant escapism—perhaps particularly now—and this plucky musical provides it in generous doses. Sara Holdren, Vulture: Operation Mincemeat isn’t exactly blazingly clever—the jokes fly thick and fast, and they tend toward broad grin-crackers rather than breathless zingers—but it overflows with good humor and heartfelt commitment… While some moments certainly sizzle more than others, there’s more than enough sincerity and goofy charisma on stage to keep the show powered. Frank Rizzo, Variety: Though the main characters are played for laughs, each one, amid all the comic chaos, also reveals their own dignity, heart, and humanity. The show also manages to teeter between patriotism and subversiveness: admiring the derring-do of the mission while poking at its shortcomings, too.

And if some of its design elements feel sparse in Lincoln Center Theater’s 1,050-seat Vivian Beaumont, its glorious cast of 34 and “the music of something beginning” land with a visceral impact that marks a uniquely American art form. Rob Weinert- Kendt, America Magazine: Still, the mantle of “relevance” is a heavy thing to lay on a Broadway musical. An earlier version of this same staging, also by director Lear deBessonet, ran at the Encores! series last November in the weeks before and after the U.S. presidential election, and depending on when audiences saw it, they felt either the show’s bursts of hope or its cries of despair with a fr",

      "pullQuote": "Good morning, and welcome to Broadway News’ Broadway Review by Brittani Samuel — our overview of reactions, recommendations and information tied to last night’s Broadway opening of “Stereophonic.”\n\nRUNDOWN Sometimes, a song is so good you want to live in it. You want to nestle into its melodies, unravel the chords holding it up and more than anything, wander in the mind fields of the people who created it. David Adjmi’s “Stereophonic” is the play that sparks this very desire. It presents an unshakeable, hyperreal slice-of-life drama, employing artists to make art about making art — a salivary meta-trifecta. Adjmi’s script captures a year-long span of time with a Fleetwood Mac-esque music group in the 1970s. Fresh from the success of their debut album, the band gathers in a Sausalito studio to embark on constructing the next one. We’re trapped in the room with them, their two sage engineers and, crucially, their egos. The conversations between bandmates toggle with such finely-tuned naturalism, we almost feel like we’re encroaching on the privacy of real human beings. Adjmi builds complex portraits with painstakingly tiny brush strokes. An entire scene hinges on drummer Simon’s (Chris Stack) frustration about his snare’s hum. Another, unleashes a sea of dramaturgical implications over lead singer Diana’s (Sarah Pidgeon) inability to hit one note. \n\n            This post is for paying subscribers only\n            Subscribe now\n            Already have an account?

(There’s a cast album on the way.) The show is part concert and part breakup drama, part sound-design marvel (Ryan Rumery is the hero responsible) and part beautifully observed period piece (everyone’s legs look dynamite in Enver Chakartash’s bells and flares, and that lovingly intricate set is by David Zinn). But it’s the thing Adjmi conjures up at the end of Act One that makes Stereophonic such a meaningful and exceptional piece of work: In its bones, it’s a love song, bittersweet and wounded and ferociously loyal, to the act of making art — specifically, art that requires that most exhausting, infuriating, transcendent element: collaboration.\"     },           {       \"@type\":\"BlogPosting\",       \"headline\":\"Variety - ‘Stereophonic’ Review: Behind the Music, There’s Theatrical Solid Gold in This New Broadway Play\",       \"datePublished\":\"2024-04-20T08:24:16-05:00\",         \"articleBody\": \"Audiences may feel the same way after seeing this work of theatrical virtuosity, realizing that all the tiny details, wild rhythms, and clever hooks presented on stage have added up to a work that is brave, purposeful, and rich. \"     },           {       \"@type\":\"BlogPosting\",       \"headline\":\"Time Out New York - Stereophonic\",       \"datePublished\":\"2024-04-20T08:24:16-05:00\",         \"articleBody\": \"David Adjmi’s intimately epic behind-the-music drama Stereophonic has now moved to Broadway after a hit fall run at Playwrights Horizons.

      "pullQuote": "David Adjmi's drama about a band recording an album goes even deeper at the Golden.\n\nWho'd have thought the most musically satisfying production of the season would be a three-hour-and-15-minute play? That's David Adjmi's miraculous\n\nSet within the confines of a recording studio in the mid-’70s,\n\nHyper-realistic in its fly-on-the-wall examination of the art of making art, Adjmi is tracking the downfall of the group's two romantic couples at the same time. Vocalist and keyboard player Holly (Juliana Canfield) is at the end of her rope when it comes to her bassist husband, Reg (Will Brill), whose proclivities include chugging Jack Daniels and snorting enormous amounts of cocaine. Singer Diana (Sarah Pidgeon) is quickly becoming the breakout star, and her snide boyfriend — the band’s guitarist and album producer, Peter (Tom Pecinka) — seizes upon her insecurity to berate her in the name of love and success. Observing are stoic drummer Simon (Chris Stack), desperate to return to his wife and kids in the UK, and engineers Grover (Eli Gelb) and Charlie (Andrew R. Butler), who are facing their own pressure to not screw things up on the other side of the studio's soundproof partition.\n\nOut of nowhere, the unnamed band's year-old record becomes a chart-topper. Diana is thrust into the spotlight when her song explodes. Reg and Holly break up and get back together and break up again. Songs and riffs and licks are invented out of thin air. Columbia Records triples their budget. Nothing happens and everything happens, and it's riveting from start to finish, one of those shows that unassumingly lures you in and then socks you with a punch of emotion that leaves you on the edge of her seat.\n\nYes, it's still long (and a little ironic that one plot thread is about Diana refusing to cut some of her new song for timing), but the Broadway mounting — with the same company and creative team — feels tighter and faster than it did last fall. The transitions are quicker, the silences less demanding. The performances are so exquisitely rendered, so beautifully lived-in, that every moment is full, whether they're bickering, snorting coke, or simply knitting. Holly and Grover's discussion of Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland's explicit sex scene in the occult thriller\n\nEach actor has their own arc and showy bits. Butler's quirky diffusion of the tension in the room is made even wittier when he realizes that nobody remembers his name. Gelb's quiet intimidation quickly becomes a short-fused irritation that leads to a first-rate explosion. Stack is more present as the erstwhile voice of reason, and Brill is even zanier as he swings from the doorframe or collapses with exhaustion in the fetal position. Pecinka's Peter is such an extraordinarily awful person that you just hate him and his lavender pants (Enver Chakartash's perfect costumes are period without being Halloweeny). And Pidgeon, the heart of the group and the play, infuses Diana with palpable and genuine heartbreak as terror overtakes what should be the most thrilling time of her life.\n\nEven with their individual strengths, the seven actors still coalesce into a true ensemble, a testament to Aukin's sharp eye for detail. That level of realism extends to Ryan Rumery's sensationally convincing sound design, Jiyoun Chang's subtly shifting lighting, and, particularly David Zinn's set. With its wood-paneled walls, central mixing table, and analog tape decks, it looks like it could function as an actual recording studio. Their work is just remarkable.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBroadway performances start on March 27 at the Majestic Theatre.\n\nGet the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania&#039;s newsletter today!\n\nBy providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.\n\n©1999-2026 TheaterMania.com, Inc.

      "pullQuote": "The Act One climax of David Adjmi's Stereophonic is one of the most exhilarating moments I've experienced in a theater in recent memory. We're in a recording studio in Sausalito, California, evoked in gorgeous detail, down to the smallest dial, the scuzziest beanbag chair and crocheted throw. The year is 1976, and an unnamed band, hovering on the verge of serious fame, is recording an album. They've been at it for months. The air is clogged with cigarette smoke and marijuana smoke and tension as viscous as Marmite. The drummer, Simon (Chris Stack), does not want to use a click track, but it's been 36 takes and he's still dragging. Diana (Sarah Pidgeon) sings beautifully and has songwriting chops that get stronger by the day, but she's fragile and defensive and feels constantly under attack from her lead-guitarist boyfriend, Peter (Tom Pecinka), who's brilliant, creatively domineering … and also fragile and defensive and convinced that he's constantly under attack from, well, everyone. The wry, aloof vocalist-keyboardist, Holly (Juliana Canfield), has, for the moment, reached a détente with her philosophizing, self-pitying, cocaine-and–Jack Daniels–fueled husband, the bassist, Reg (Will Brill), but hostilities could resume at any moment. The engineers, Grover (Eli Gelb) and Charlie (Andrew R. Butler), just want Simon to use the fucking click track so that they can get the fucking take and everyone can go the fuck to sleep. Then — suddenly, gradually, somehow both — a miracle happens. Take 37 is perfect. The song bursts into driving, dazzling life. People throw down headphones and instruments and grab each other, hugging and hooting and doing stupid dances. Simon howls at the universe, \"WE'RE SUCH A GOOD BAND!!!\"\n\nStereophonic is an echo-portrait of Fleetwood Mac and the hard birth of Rumours (Simon, Holly, and Reg are British and played together for years before joining up with Peter and Diana, the Americans). It's also a stunning feat of scoring by Adjmi — whose hypernaturalistic script captures the ebb and flow of overlapping speech both inside and outside the studio's sound room — and by director Daniel Aukin and composer Will Butler. Aukin and the show's stellar cast play Adjmi's rigorously constructed, deceptively casual prose with as much exactness and audacity as the actors, all playing their instruments live, pour into Butler's songs: Smart, well-crafted tunes that blend the folk and blues and prog vibes of the '70s with the soaring indie yearning of Butler's former band, Arcade Fire. (There's a cast album on the way.) The show is part concert and part breakup drama, part sound-design marvel (Ryan Rumery is the hero responsible) and part beautifully observed period piece (everyone's legs look dynamite in Enver Chakartash's bells and flares, and that lovingly intricate set is by David Zinn). But it's the thing Adjmi conjures up at the end of Act One that makes Stereophonic such a meaningful and exceptional piece of work: In its bones, it's a love song, bittersweet and wounded and ferociously loyal, to the act of making art — specifically, art that requires that most exhausting, infuriating, transcendent element: collaboration.\n\n\"It's a torture to need people,\" sighs Holly. She and Simon — the Brits who aren't continuously neck deep in substances — pride themselves on keeping their composure. Simon is the manager and the designated group \"dad,\" and Holly has the kind of great posture, posh vowels, and naturally regal mien that all the slumming in the world can't tarnish. But no one in the band is actually okay. They're all broken, all frightened, all experts in hurting themselves or others or both. But there is something they're capable of, even called to, amidst the constant raging of egos and reopening of wounds. \"I WANNA PLAY MUSIC!\" Peter bellows as he stomps from the studio's control room, where people are still passing around the enormous coke bag and bitching about the broken coffee machine, into the sound room: the temple, the sacred space where things get serious, where everyone suddenly turns from a fucked-up human into a necessary part of a whole.\n\nPlenty of art has been made about the artist as egomaniacal monolith, as genius or tyrant or lonely freak. But Adjmi is looking at something more complex and contradictory — that ineffable thing that pulls a bunch of egos together. The torture and the elation of needing people: Music has it, and theater has it. And anyone who's thrown themselves into either knows that the same project, the same people, can somehow leave you more battered and drained than you thought possible while also being, as Diana whispers, \"the best thing that ever happened\" to you.\n\nRight from the title, Adjmi has built into his play this fixation on the harmonies and discords of collaborative creation. Stereophonic sound comes at you from more than one source, blended by the ear and the brain to form a greater whole. That's the task for the show's seven actors: Both on instruments and as instruments, they've got to weave together individual lines of a precisely built score, and tempo and blend are everything. This is the great trick of high naturalism: To sound the most \"real\" takes the most careful listening, the most painstaking dedication to style. Adjmi's script is orchestrated down to the beat — pauses, overlaps, shifts in intonation all noted (one of my favorite stage directions: \"proleptic apology\"). Language like this takes an ensemble of athletes, along with a great deal of trust — and the show's transfer from Playwrights Horizons has only given Aukin's extraordinary company more time to grow together. No one misses a beat, from Brill's itchy, writhing, slurring, somehow still strangely sweet mess of a bassist (just wait for his mind-blown effusion on houseboats) to Butler's cheerfully bizarre assistant engineer — his lack of room-reading skills is one of the show's great entertainments, and the band members' repeated inability to remember his name is one of its small, hilarious heartbreaks. Canfield gives the outwardly cool Holly gorgeous depths — it's devastating to hear her, enraptured, tears in her eyes, describe the sex scene from Don't Look Now as beautiful \"because you know it's coming from grief\" — and Stack expertly turns Simon into that guy who's at once the most lovable and least readable in the room. He seems like the peacemaker, the caretaker, the one who's there to cheer you up with a bump from the bag and a tickle — but there's also a distance in him, a cost that's been paid, a mountain of words unsaid.\n\nAs the quasi Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks figures, Pecinka and Pidgeon have to generate the churning, molten emotional core of the play, and both their chemistry and the sharp edges of their portrayals have only grown since the show's first run. In contrast to her phenomenal voice, Pidgeon has found something a little uglier in Diana as a character, and it works: It's all too possible, especially given the teams that we tend to run toward automatically these days, for the exacting, damaged Peter to become the show's villain. Just listen to the audience gasp when, after the band lays down an absolutely smoking recording of one of Diana's songs, Peter, stone-faced and toneless, hits her with: \"It's good but … your ego is getting in the way and you need to decide if you're gonna be a mediocre songwriter or push it to the next level.\" Yet it's crucial that we don't assign bad guys and good guys in a show like this. Peter — to whom Pecinka completely commits, giving him terrible hardness, immense hurt, and bravely daring to be anything but likable — has got to be as human as Diana, as right and as wrong, as sinned against as sinning. Pidgeon and Pecinka have been nimbly messing around with the dials of their characters' relationship like Grover at his soundboard, and have found a dynamic that feels marvelously complicated, a rich, sad place where it's no easy task to point to a singular victim.\n\nAnd as for Grover — the character is the secret heart of the show, hidden in plain sight at center stage, as we concentrate on the colorful artists behind the glass wall. Gelb quietly crafts a long, aching arc with the suffering, aspiring, not-as-cool-as-he'd-like-to-be engineer. He's funny, he's lost, and he's also every inch an artist: dedicated, ambitious — ultimately, whether he likes it or not, both a perfectionist and a believer. Grover, along with everyone else in this smelly, volatile studio, could shout along with Reg when, at the climax of a ganja-assisted revelation, he declares, \"I want to live in art.\" It's not really a joke — it might even be a tragedy. Or maybe it will be the best thing that ever happened.\n\nStereophonic is at the John Golden Theatre.",

Are there enough of the fans and the curious to make it last and pay off?

      "pullQuote": "Good morning, and welcome to Broadway News’ Broadway Review by Brittani Samuel — our overview of reactions, recommendations and information tied to last night’s Broadway opening of “The Great Gatsby.”\n\nRUNDOWNI love American literature, yet I’m decidedly un-precious about the classics. Strip them, translate them, reset them on a different planet. All I beg is that the rejiggering unlocks a new purpose. Beyond pageantry, the musical adaptation of “The Great Gatsby” at the Broadway Theatre has none. Director Marc Bruni’s production simultaneously looks pricier and feels cheaper than when I saw it at New Jersey’s Paper Mill Playhouse last year. Scenic and projection designer Paul Tate dePoo III’s work there already glittered, but on Broadway it gleams. Evidently, Jay Gatsby is not the only nouveau riche in town. All of dePoo’s brassy, geometric shapes and gorgeous jewel-toned set pieces as well as costume designer Linda Cho’s period-appropriate glitz, while visually seductive, are sinister distractions from what is actually a disappointingly emotionless two and a half hours. Book writer Kait Kerrigan winks back to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s literary source material to set up her narrative framework. She orients the story through Nick Carraway’s (Noah J. Ricketts) lens. Nick introduces us to the fictional Long Island towns of East and West Egg, his old-money cousin Daisy (Eva Noblezada) and his debonair, new-money neighbor Jay Gatsby (Jeremy Jordan). \n\n            This post is for paying subscribers only\n            Subscribe now\n            Already have an account?

      "pullQuote": "We have made it folks. Today marks the end of an insane, yet wonderful year of theatre as the season officially comes to a close. And what better way to go out than with a party to end all parties. That being a Gatsby party of course. \n\nBased off F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel of the same name, The Great Gatsby, which opened tonight at the Broadway Theatre is one wild ride from start to finish. As in the book, we follow our narrator Nick Carraway (a lovely Noah J. Ricketts) as he moves to New York and soon becomes entangled in the lives of the wealthy and elite. Carraway ends up renting a cottage on the property of the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby (a formidable Jeremy Jordan). When we learn Gatsby is in love with Nick’s cousin Daisy Buchanan (a stunning Eva Noblezada,) this tragic love story set amongst the Jazz Age of the 1920s explores one man’s quest for love and depths at which he will go to to get it. \n\nAdaptations is a key word of this Broadway season. From megawatt film IPs to beloved novels, this Broadway season is chock full of translations to the stage. Once “Gatsby” hit the public domain in early 2021, it was only a matter of time before one of the world’s most popular novels was going to tread the boards. Last summer we received an earnest yet underbaked immersive version practically across the street at the Park Central Hotel, and a Rachel Chavkin helmed version is currently in rehearsals for a run this summer at the American Repertoy Theater in Cambridge, MA featuring the music of Florence Welch, so it begs the questions, why so much Gatsby?\n\nOn the surface the answer is plain, it's a well known story with the potential to glitz and glam up Broadway, and boy does this rendition, with a book by Kait Kerrigan, music by Jason Howland, and lyrics by Nathan Tysen, deliver on that. When Daisy Buchanan’s best friend Jordan Baker (a wonderful Samantha Pauly) sings early in Act I of what “New Money'' in New York society can provide, we are overstimulated to the extreme (positive connotation!!) with a balls to the walls full out dance number that includes bubbles, a full car, and pyrotechnics on stage — and that’s just in the first 15 minutes of the show. \n\nThis Gatsby comes to Broadway rather quickly following a run at Millburn’s Paper Mill Playhouse last fall. Here at the Broadway Theatre the show is tighter and fixes certain weaknesses that were in the original book. Where the musical still stands on unsteady ground is in the overall tone of the piece. Jeremy Jordan’s Gatsby is too often comically cartoonish jumping over fences and throwing tea cakes off stage that one finds it hard to believe he is secretly running a high stakes covert bootlegging operation with his partner Meyer Wolfsheim (the always fun Eric Anderson.) Different dialects fill the stage that range from fabricated turn of the century Mid-Atlantic tones to friends discussing the latest backstage gossip at Glass House Tavern after a show. The discordant mood we feel from one scene to the next often varies and differs to a great array, yet I found myself not particularly bothered by this. Why? This show is FUN. One wildly entertaining night at the theatre with a score that will be stuck in my head for years to come. (hums: where’s the party and can you take me there refrain over and over)\n\nMarc Bruni directs this entertaining, if uneven at parts, production with ease and style reminiscent of his stunning work on Beautiful: The Carole King Musical. With fierce, high octane choreography by Dominique Kelley on top of Paul Tate DePoo III’s stunning scenic and projection design (ay my performance the back LED wall did fade to black unfortunately quite a few times), pleasant costume design by Linda Cho, and on the money lighting design by Cory Pattak, the world of Gatsby comes alive. \n\nThis is modern day American musical theatre at its finest, that feels right for the whole family. When you have an uber talented company of some of today’s favorites, it’s hard to go wrong. Howland can create a score that is so delectable, you could sit there for another two hours to soak in every last note. Kelley has Jeremy Jordan borderline tap dancing, I mean, come on! Debates will continue to occur for generations on the artistic value of stage adaptations, but when you find that magic of opulence and charm, you find your green light. Cheers Old Sport. \n\nThe Great Gatsby is now in performance at the Broadway Theatre on West 53rd Street in New York City.",

      "pullQuote": "Jay Gatsby lives in West Egg. Daisy Buchanan lives in East Egg. And the new musical about them that opened Thursday at the Broadway Theatre lays a big egg.\n\nIt’s debatable whether one of American literature’s most mysterious characters should ever sing. What Gatsby should definitely not ever do is lead a chorus of tap dancers. That not-since-\"Carrie\" spectacle sums up what goes wrong with the new musical “The Great Gatsby,” with book by Kati Kerrigan and score by composer Jason Howland and lyricist Nathan Tysen.\n\nKerrigan runs into the same problem that confronted the screenwriters of the three movie versions of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1925 classic novel: what to do with narrator Nick Carroway. The beauty of the novels is less the tragic love story between Gatsby and Daisy than the prose that is Carroway’s view of how old and new money clashed, creating an explosion of hedonism after the Great War. Kerrigan’s solution is to pump up the romance between Carroway (Noah J. Ricketts) and Daisy’s cynical friend Jordan Baker (Samantha Pauly). In the novel, they date. On stage, they attend an orgy together and get engaged.\n\nHowland and Tysen’s score is a romantic throwback to the 1970s-80s heyday of Andrew Lloyd Webber, who borrowed heavily from Puccini and other verismo composers. Especially effective is the way in which several songs weave dialogue in and out of the recitative and the arias themselves. Howlands’ arrangements too often go for big brassy effects, but in comparison to most new musicals on Broadway, “The Great Gatsby” sonically is a study in understatement.\n\nVisually, it’s another story, and watching this musical, I was taken back to 1997 when Maury Yeston and Peter Stone’s “Titanic” opened on Broadway. It was a good if not great musical sabotaged by a literal and bloated production. It will be interesting to see what Encores!, famed for its pared-down production aesthetic, does with “Titanic” when it is revived at New York City Center in June.\n\nThis new “Gatsby” musical has a slightly different case of elephantiasis under Marc Bruni’s over-the-top direction. For instance, when Carroway lets Gatsby (Jeremy Jordan) use his cottage for the rendezvous with Daisy (Eva Noblezada), it’s turned into a “Hello, Dolly!” moment with lots of dancing servants at the ready with flowers, food and tea. All that’s missing is the staircase in Paul Tate DePoo III’s sometimes grand, sometimes gauche scenic design.\n\nWhen Gatsby’s business partner Meyer Wolfsheim (Eric Anderson) sings about their crimes, the chorus swoops around him waving their long coats and otherwise being ridiculously sinister. Bruni should be thinking Kurt Weill, not Cirque du Soleil.\n\nMuch worse is what you’d expect to be the most dazzling aspect of a musical based on “The Great Gatsby.” The blowout parties at Gatsby’s West Egg estate see the chorus dipped in glitter, rhinestones and satin – and those are the costumes, by Linda Cho, for the men. These partygoers are supposed to be the nouveau riche, not the “Gildettes” as they are credited in the Playbill.\n\nNoblezada’s Daisy enchants, floating above the production’s excesses; then again, she is never asked to participate in any of the big numbers choreographed by Dominique Kelley.\n\nRicketts wisely resists turning Carroway into too much of a prig – until the very end when he replicates Ato Blankson-Wood’s scene chewing over at “Cabaret.” Both actors are their respective show’s moral compass, and both actors can’t resist veering off course to deliver their big moment of chastisement on stage.\n\nJordan presents a truly bizarre Gatsby. Granted, his tap dancing is an odd spectacle. There’s also the mid-Atlantic accent that Jordan uses to suggest the character’s patrician aspirations. As the show progresses, he moves farther and farther east. Near the end, Gatsby’s mansion on Long island has been transformed into Bela Lugosi’s castle in Transylvania. And with his strange way of speaking, why does this Gatsby have a country twang when he sings?",

Over the past two months, four new eagerly anticipated musicals have opened, and the first three — The Scarlet Pimpernel, Triumph of Love, and Side Show — made this season look like no exception to the rule. But then, on Nov. 13, The Lion King bounded onto the stage, and Broadway roared. Based on Disney's blockbuster 1994 animated feature, the musical version of The Lion King might have been mounted like the spectacular but ice-showish Beauty and the Beast, which is still charming children and making money a few blocks away. Fortunately, Disney didn't leave well enough alone. To bring The Lion King into three dimensions, Disney tapped Julie Taymor, an experimental director known for her cerebral productions meshing puppetry and poetry. The unlikely partnership has turned the most successful animated film in Disney's history into the most exciting Broadway experience since Rent routed the Great White Way into the '90s two seasons ago.",

This long-running New York City musical is based on the 1994 Disney animated flick about a Hamletesque lion who must win back his kingdom from the clutches of his evil uncle. Featuring a catchy score by Elton John and Tim Rice, Taymor’s adaptation is infused with additional spectacle and songs inspired by African culture.",

Simply said, Julie Taymor’s staging of Disney’s The Lion King is a marvel, a theatrical achievement unrivaled in its beauty, brains and ingenuity. Leaping far beyond its celluloid inspiration, the stage version improves upon nearly every aspect of the hit 1994 animated film, from visual artistry and storytelling to Lebo M’s score and the newly African-ized pop songs of Elton John and Tim Rice. With this production, the Walt Disney Co. stages itself as a serious and ambitious contender on the legit scene, all but demanding that its first theatrical foray, 1994′s too-literally adapted Beauty and the Beast, was little more than a warm-up.",

And for those new to the tear-jerker story of Allie and Noah from opposite sides of the tracks, does it still resonate at all? The answer to that last question is most certainly yes, it does resonate.  I think you'd have to hail from another planet not to feel something for these appealing characters.

And singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson, in her Broadway songwriting debut, delivers almost two dozen  largely folk and country-inflected melodies, most of them lovely, if blandly so; only a few stand out. Little in this musical may soar, but, given the potential of the material for over-the-top melodrama, the relatively low-key approach is part of the show’s appeal.",

The musical’s use of interracial casting is also frustrating. Younger and middle Allie are both Black, while older Allie is white. The Noahs are cast in a similar fashion. The issues with casting isn’t a problem of believability, but consistency. It’s strange why the racial unity in casting is interrupted, especially with no discernible dramatic choice. Sympathizers will waive off the choice as negligible, a side effect of race-blind casting. But race isn’t a minor detail, especially with swaths of the play taking place right before and after the Vietnam war – well into the civil rights era. The Notebook musical hasn’t lost its romantic magic, by any means. But without the equally touching music and a fleshing out of its core courtship, it’s a story that remains underwritten.",

      "pullQuote": "A musical adaptation of The Notebook, Nicholas Sparks’ weepy novel about a longtime couple whose love outlasts class barriers and degenerative illness, later immortalized on film, provides as good a cry as you might imagine. It banks on a sweet, golden-haze-of-summer score by Ingrid Michaelson and genial performances from its three duos that play the central couple Noah and Allie through puppy-love adolescence (Jordan Tyson and John Cardoza), a separated adulthood (Joy Woods and Ryan Vasquez), and an autumn (Maryann Plunkett and Dorian Harewood) complicated by her struggles with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nBekah Brunstetter’s book cleverly has actors playing significant people from Allie’s past — Andréa Burns and Charles E. Wallace as her disapproving parents — double as the hazy figures she sees at the nursing home at which she resides, like her nurse and now-adult son. David Zinn and Brett J. Banakis’ scenic design also swiftly riffs on its main set: a gorgeous wood-beamed skeleton of a Southern home, complete with a watery brook at the lip of the stage.\n\nThe middle pairing, which makes up most of the second act, feels both rushed yet incomplete at points, though Woods’ nervous doe energy and Vasquez’ resolve nicely set up their elders’ characterizations. Plunkett’s poignant performance evokes tears at every turn, and Harewood’s wise, warming presence creates a veteran atmosphere of sturdy storytelling. \n\nMichael Greif and Schele Williams’ shared direction match Michaelson’s ability to capably blur the line between past and present, and what’s lost at each generational turn. One song memorably laments each Allie not knowing “the last time I’d leave the house was the last time I’d leave the house;” though the show’s best number, a standalone ballad titled “What Happens,” cautiously yearns for updates on a former lover’s life.\n\nA shrug from a tear-stained shoulder is certainly not the worst way to exit a musical, so even if The Notebook isn’t reinventing any wheels, it turns them with earnest, somehow not-too-sentimental, precision.\n\nThe Notebook is in performance at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre on West 45th Street in New York City.",

Hinton’s Greasers and Socs (short for “socialites”). The musical adaptation of the middle-school bookshelf staple uses the familiar antagonist framework found in those other works and treads closely to its original text, but book writers Adam Rapp and Justin Levine take creative (but unfortunately, not comprehensive) liberty to enhance the drama by sketching out all-white Socs and a mixed-race group of Greasers. All of our principal characters are still intact from the novel: the endearing, poetry-spinning protagonist Ponyboy (Brody Grant), his sheepish, ill-fated best friend Johnny (Sky Lakota-Lynch), his dudish brothers Sodapop (Jason Schmidt) and Darrel (Brent Comer). They are broken in some ways, deeply caring in others and wildly attractive. Case in point: A gaggle of young folks at the performance I attended squealed when Schmidt opened his shirt. (This demographic will undeniably be the lifeblood of this musical’s success.) But, scenic designers AMP and Tatiana Kahvegian’s tactile set of crunching dirt, exposed scaffolding and tire towers captures more authentic grit than any of the pugnacious characters do. That’s not to say that these actors lack talent. The production’s strenuous vocal, acting and dance demands are evident, and director Danya Taymor’s tight ensemble works like a well-oiled (well-greased?) machine. \n\n            This post is for paying subscribers only\n            Subscribe now\n            Already have an account?

      "pullQuote": "And yet the musical version of “The Outsiders” that opened on Thursday has been made with so much love and sincerity it survives with most of its heart intact. Youth is key to that survival; the cast, if not actually teenage — their singing is way too professional for that — is still credibly fresh-faced. (Five of the nine principals are making their Broadway debuts.) That there is no cynical distance between them and their characters is in itself refreshing to see.  Also key to the show’s power is the director Danya Taymor’s rivetingly sensorial approach to the storytelling, even if it sometimes comes at a cost to the story itself. Many stunning things are happening on the stage of the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater — and from the sobs I heard the other night, in the audience, too.",

Teller of the tale, if not leader of the pack, is Brody Grant’s Ponyboy, the youngest of three brothers whose parents died in a car accident, with the oldest, Darrel, played by a touchingly conflicted Brent Comer, unhappily taking charge, while the middle boy, Sodapop (a buoyant, sometimes shirtless Jason Schmidt, winning the beefcake prize), tries to soothe the tension between his siblings.

Here, Taymor brings a nice low-tech look to the show, aided by the “scenography” of AMP featuring Tatiana Kahvegian.

      "pullQuote": "Danya Taymor’s production brings fire and rain to the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre.\n\nIt’s raining on Broadway. I’m not just talking about the 14 new shows pouring into theaters this month, but actual water falling onstage. It rains in\n\nThe deluge arrives during the climactic rumble scene, perversely transforming this coming-of-age story about brotherhood and the gravitational pull of class into an Abercrombie & Fitch photoshoot. It adds nothing to the story and gives several of these tough (tuff?) boys the Sharon Stone wet look just in time for the show’s heartfelt conclusion. This may seem like a petty thing to highlight at the top of a review, but this expensive and superfluous scenic effect exemplifies everything that is wrong with\n\nFor the record, there is plenty that is right. The score (by Justin Levine and Jamestown Revival’s Jonathan Clay and Zach Chance) starts out especially strong with the rousing opener “Tulsa ’67,” which tells us everything we need to know about the time, place, and central conflict in this story about 14-year-old Ponyboy Curtis (Brody Grant, affable but with a catch of sadness in his voice) and his gang of east side “greasers,” who regularly do battle with the rich “socs” from the west side of town.\n\nRick and Jeff Kuperman’s choreography is similarly evocative as these Tulsa boys kick up the Oklahoma soil (the stage is dusted with a synthetic rubber granule called EPDM, giving the impression of a dirty junkyard). From the very beginning, Danya Taymor’s production has purpose, momentum, and a strong point of view. So how does it all derail over the course of two-and-a-half hours?\n\nI won’t entirely blame Levine and Adam Rapp’s book, which is a vast improvement on Francis Ford Coppola’s treacly film adaptation. The writers make it clear that this isn’t a superficial story of teenager gang warfare — a tale of hair product and switchblades — but one boy’s realization that he and everyone he loves are trapped in a machine that has largely determined the trajectory of their lives from birth.\n\nThat interest in class is reflected in the score, with Ponyboy’s 20-year-old brother, Darrel (Brent Comer), getting the song “Runs in the Family,” about how a tragic auto accident killed both of his parents, trapping him “between the role of a brother and a father” as he raises Ponyboy and his 16-year-old brother, Sodapop (Jason Schmidt). With an attractive country twang and a stillness that projects stoic strength (or perhaps just exhaustion), Comer hits a home run with the number. We immediately understand that Darrel was meant to be the family’s best hope at social mobility, but circumstances got in the way — that he feels a confusing mix of love and resentment when he thinks of his brothers. Ponyboy also seems to grasp Darrel’s thwarted potential from the first act, which somewhat undermines the growing-up journey he takes more convincingly in the novel.\n\nThe supporting actors deliver competent performances as the other greasers: There’s the wise-cracking Two-Bit (an attractive and playful Daryl Tofa) everyone’s at-risk kid brother Johnny (a genuinely vulnerable Sky Lakota-Lynch), and consummate bad boy Dallas Winston. Joshua Boone brings a seen-it-all coolness to Dallas so we never question his quick thinking in getting Johnny and Ponyboy out of town after a deadly encounter with a drunk soc. Johnny and Pony are wanted men by intermission, but a sudden conflagration at the abandoned church where they are hiding out, into which a group of schoolchildren has unwisely wandered, gives them an opportunity to be heroes.\n\nIn addition to water, Taymor and the producers have expended considerable resources to bring the real element of fire into the theater. You see your ticket money onstage, but to what end? Taymor has devised a highly theatrical staging concept by having every scene take place in the vacant lot in which the greasers hang. An old car on blocks remains stage left throughout, with the actors creating every other scene using tires and wooden boards, which they whip through the air with balletic grace (scenic design by AMP featuring Tatiana Kahvegian).\n\nThe upstage wall represents the old church, and when it goes up in flames, the front rows feel the heat (special effects by Jeremy Chernick and Lillis Meeh). And while we are told that Johnny is knocked out by a falling beam, we never actually see that moment — which seems like a missed opportunity when the production has two choreographers and a staging conceit built around flying beams. Frustratingly, Taymor has not figured out how to integrate this spectacle into her larger vision.\n\nNot everything can be laid at the feet of the director. While there are some instant classics in the score\n\nThe designers compensate with high gloss: Brian MacDevitt’s lighting is powerful and precise, essential in creating Taymor’s cinematic moments. Hana S. Kim’s projections enhance the atmosphere and bring the drive-in experience to Broadway. Cody Spencer’s sound design is top-notch and provides for excellent balance.\n\nCostume designer Sarafina Bush should be especially congratulated for delivering authenticity by resisting excess: No one is wearing a $1,000 leather jacket. Instead, the greasers’ outfits look like they’ve been washed and dried a hundred times, which is exactly how it is for working-class kids both then and now.

      "pullQuote": "When I attended a recent performance of The Outsiders at the Jacobs Theatre on Broadway, there was a certain buzz in the air. Something we don't always see in a Broadway house—a mass of young people eagerly awaiting the start of the show. Not since Beetlejuice or Newsies-mania back in the day have I felt the energy of young audience members rallying around a musical, especially so early in the production's life.\n\nBut that's what happens when you have all the right ingredients to deliver what is perhaps the best new musical of this decade. Based on S.E. Hinton's beloved novel which was adapted by Francis Ford Coppola in 1983 for the big screen, The Outsiders brings us to Tulsa, Oklahoma, 1967. 14 year old Ponyboy Curtis (Brody Grant) and his two older brothers Sodapop (Jason Schmidt) and Darrel (Brent Comer) are part of the Greasers, a bonded group of working class teens with their leather jackets and greased hair who come from the east side of town. And then we have the Socs, the west side privileged kids with their new cars and perfect varsity jackets led by Bob (Kevin William Paul) and his sweetheart girlfriend Cherry (Emma Pittman). When Ponyboy's best friend Johnny Cade (Sky Lakota-Lynch) kills one of the Socs, they find themselves on the run and have to navigate life on their own.\n\nWhat makes The Outsiders so brilliant is director Danya Taymor at the helm of the ship. Her swift yet intuitive direction is stunning and the team she has surrounded herself with both onstage and behind the curtain is a match made in heaven. Taymor's ability to hone her storytelling while marrying it with a contemporary theatre gaze is a pure delight on stage, and we should be so lucky to experience whatever she cooks up next.\n\nFor a story that centers masculinity, brotherhood, and family, the ensemble cast shines and breathes new life to a property that is so beloved by millions across America. An ardent and impassioned Grant leads the company as Ponyboy who brings the audience along for his story. A smart retooling of the narrative by book writers Adam Rapp with Justin Levine since the show's previous La Jolla Playhouse run last year, they now center Ponyboy as our shepherd of the story.\n\nIn a gorgeous Broadway debut, songwriting duo Jamestown Revival (Jonathan Clay & Zach Chance) and Tony winner Justin Levine have crafted a score that sonically creates the elemental world of Tulsa on stage. From rustic blues to vintage Americana with a dash of classic musical theatre, this thrilling new score (my favorite I've heard in a long time) brings a new sound to Broadway that I hope we get more of soon.\n\nRick and Jeff Kuperman's impressive and striking choreography aids the narrative and never detracts from the moment at hand. Their much-talked about rumble late in Act II is just as astonishing as it was out in La Jolla and simply must be witnessed in person. When you pair that with intricate scenic design by AMP featuring Tatiana Kahvegian, wonderful lighting by Brian MacDevitt, fitting costume design by Sarfina Bush, and engaging sound design by Cody Spencer, it all fits perfectly.\n\nIn a historical theatrical season with more shows than even the critics can count opening, The Outsiders stands out far and wide—this revelatory new work is sure to be talked about for generations to come. And although it might be the ultimate cliche, S.E. Hinton wrote it best: The Outsiders is theatrical gold, and Ponyboy, you are gonna wanna stay with it.\n\nThe Outsiders is now in performance at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre on West 45th Street in New York City.",

Her point was that kids who might be dismissed as juvenile delinquents are teenagers like any others, with complicated feelings and dreams. But in the musical, they mostly seem neither juvenile—Grant is a terrific singer, but he doesn’t sound remotely 14—nor delinquent. Rapp and Levine add cuss words to the dialogue, but otherwise their version scrubs the Greasers clean. In the book, they are low-level criminals. Here, they are presented as innocent victims, targeted by the villainous Socs merely for being poor, and perhaps for not all being white guys: Their leader, Dallas (an excellent Joshua Boone), is now Black, and their group includes an Anybodys -style tomboy. It’s like a version of  West Side Story  in which one of the gangs is entirely to blame, and the other is just trying not to die while crossing from the wrong side of the tracks. And this sanitization makes the musical feel oddly superficial. It approaches its subjects from the outside.",

      "pullQuote": "Much pop culture has flowed from the saying that Britain and America are “two countries separated by a common language.” The transatlantic clash of the brash and modest, the old and new countries, the deciphering of accents and words, the stiffly self-contained and let-it-all-hang out—with both sides of the pond cherishing and deriding the characteristics of the other—has been a longtime staple of books, movies, TV, and theater.\n\nIt’s also a lived experience for those Brits visiting or living in the States and Americans doing the same in Britain. At the beginning of the musical Two Strangers (Carry a Cake Across New York), British visitor Dougal (Sam Tutty) is trying to impress upon New Yorker Robin (Christiani Pitts) the beauty of iconic British savory spread Marmite—a food passion I not only share with Dougal, but like him have also tried to impress upon American friends. (With one pal I neglected to make clear the yeast extract spread should be used sparingly on toast; they spread on gloopy dollops of the stuff and made themselves violently sick.)\n\nThe familiar terrain of blunt Yank meets eccentric Limey comedy burns initially bright in Two Strangers, which was a big hit in London (from the small Kiln Theatre to the West End), and is now having its New York moment at Broadway’s Longacre Theatre (booking to July 5, 2026). \n\nThe show opens with an overlong segment contrasting British and American radio, which deflates on impact because they don’t sound so different. Still, it sets the culture clash theme. Robin has come to JFK to meet Dougal. Her sister and his dad are getting married, he has arrived to attend the nuptials. But Dougal was expecting to see his dad (for the very first time), and Robin is doing a favor for her sister with whom she has a testy relationship. \n\nDougal is a not-snazzily dressed, curious-in-manner goofball—inappropriate, slightly creepy but not threateningly so, crazy about all things American. Robin is a Black, direct, firmly focused New Yorker, who thinks he’s just a weirdo with no sense of personal space, and far too wide-eyed and strange for her to want to spend any time around. He wants to do all the tourist stuff; she balks at the idea. “I’m walkin’ here!” he recites joyously. \n\nBut—and I think you can see this coming—for all their differences, Dougal and Robin discover they are very much alike—both are not wealthy like his unseen dad is, and they are hiding pain rooted in their familial relationships. The musical mulls whether Dougal and Robin’s fledgling friendship could become a romantic relationship. \n\nAdorable ‘Spelling Bee’ Makes Its Big, Delightful ReturnREJOICE!Tim Teeman“Two Strangers” is funny in places, occasionally moving in others, and just a little off-feeling throughout, as if it is trying too hard to charm across the storytelling and whimsy chasms it creates for itself. Its flaws are not fatal, thanks to the singing skills, charm, and likeability of Pitts and Tutty who generate the right kind of tricky, rather than star-crossed, chemistry. (Can and should a would-be step-aunt and nephew really get together?)\n\nThe title of the show, directed and choreographed by Tim Jackson, is a bit of a misnomer. While it’s true that Dougal and Robin do indeed pick up and carry her sister and his dad’s wedding cake, it is not “across New York,” by any means. But an accident involving the cake does mean an extension of Dougal and Robin’s journey in and around the city, and themselves, in search of resolution, wider truths, and personal freedoms. \n\nIn a great song set at the coffee shop she works in, Robin imagines a life away from serving others. Dougal relishes the idea of finally getting to know his absent father—even though, early on, we can see that his father is avoiding the same. And soon we learn why Robin’s sister is so freely exploiting Robin’s time, and why the sisters are at odds.\n\nTheater’s Most Notorious Strange Beast Finally ReturnsCHECKMATETim TeemanJim Barne and Kit Buchan’s story is played out on a strikingly designed, minimal set: an unattractive double mountain of suitcases on a rotating stage, colored a mummified grey. From and within these suitcases spring colorful eruptions of objects, signifying where the duo are, like the Plaza Hotel or (the loveliest-realized setting) a noodle restaurant. \n\nThe suitcases also light up to signify New York buildings and its streets. Perhaps symbolically they represent the emotional baggage all humans carry, as well as the journeys people are on in a more profound sense than just physical transportation. Whatever, the cases look imposingly ugly, and act as a creative handcuffs on the show. In a smaller theater they might look charming, on a Broadway stage they are an inadequate visual anchor.\n\nOne of Our Greatest Actresses Stuns in Reinvented ‘Oedipus’COMPLEX Tim TeemanThe musical packs a more precise punch charting the grittier realities of Dougal and Robin’s emotions. It is very funny when Dougal rightly identifies Robin as his kind-of-new-auntie. It is sad when he realizes the truth about his dad, and it is also puzzling that he is so in the dark about it all pre-landing in America; Robin’s relationship with her sister is also under-explained and underwritten. The show is beautiful when it explodes with an old-fashioned song-and-dance number (“American Express”), the pair dressed to the nines, sweeping Fred-and-Gingerishly through the city for one night of expense and extravagance.\n\nTwo Strangers is on shakier ground as it orbits the possibility of romance between Dougal and Robin. Here, their chemistry and show’s intentions feel confected. The duo seem more natural as two opposites who (despite his romantic liking for her) find a platonic simpatico through pain, and a shared determination to chart a path through it. Their not getting together, the joy of their unexpected friendship, make most sense. Dougal and Robin are definitely a couple to root for—just not together.",

Robert Hofler, The Wrap: Jim Barne and Kit Buchan wrote the songs and the book for this rom-com two-hander, and they begin “Two Strangers” with real promise. The young man Dougal (Tutty) is newly arrived at JFK from London and eager to meet his American father for the very first time. Dad’s getting married and the bride’s sister, Robin (Pitts), picks him up at the airport. As meet-cutes go, this one turns very problematic in Act 2, if not before. Jonathan Mandell, New York Theater: But then I thought: It’s symbolic of the unsettled lives of these two young characters. And it shows a bit of resourcefulness: Sometimes the piles of luggage seem to suggest a Manhattan avenue lined with skyscrapers, sometimes a hill in Central Park in a snowy Central Park.

Instead, there are too many novelty numbers about Christmas carols and Tinder swiping not really grounded in who these people are, plus wispy soliloquies that can only credibly inch each character forward. Two Strangers, spanning two days of personal growth in two hours and 20 minutes (including intermission), is both far too long for the audience’s attention and far too short for Dougal and Robin��s transformations.",

      "pullQuote": "I felt a disorienting generational whiplash throughout the treacly rom-com Two Strangers (Carry a Cake Across New York). The latest British musical to make it through that country's off-off ranks and onto our shores, it follows two 20-somethings during a whirlwind wedding weekend in present-day New York. And yet it fundamentally misunderstands Gen Z, is shot through with elder Millennial sensibility, and had a mostly older crowd wiping tears of laughter from their eyes. They seemed to thoroughly enjoy it, so congrats to all involved, but let me submit my dissenting opinion anyway.\n\nThe story follows Dougal, a British twentysomething, and Robin, a 26-year-old New Yorker, as they navigate a wedding weekend in Manhattan, picking up a cake and encountering various tourist attractions. Sam Tutty brings charm despite playing maybe the most grating character in musical theater history, while Christiani Pitts keeps her deadpan takedowns impressively fresh. However, the characterization of Robin embodies the unfortunate subgenre of Black woman as wet blanket of wokeness, constantly correcting Dougal's cultural missteps.\n\nThe score receives criticism for platitudes about romance and outdated humor, including a number that reheats BuzzFeed-era jokes about whether classic Christmas songs are problematic. Despite praise for the production design and performances, the show lacks substance for a nearly two-and-a-half-hour runtime. Its agreeableness will charm audiences but ultimately it's not for me, and the twee little title accurately signals its sentimental, lightweight approach.",

But the second act brings a stark shift in tone, getting darker for a while before rebounding with great silliness and gratifying sympathy. Jackson McHenry, Vulture: As you grow, you do the hard work of parting with the vision of the world you had in your head. That’s a dynamic repeated throughout Two Strangers. Dougal is learning to give up both his idealized image of a foreign city and the relationship with his father he thinks he could re-ignite during this trip, and Robin learns to abandon the myth she’s telling herself about her own failure. When the show’s creators zero in on those feelings, something a lot more specific and wistful than a love story between two strangers, the piece comes alive. If only it stayed there.

      "pullQuote": "It’s not easy being green. Or blonde, for that matter. Those are just two of the many lessons to be learned from this big, murky new Broadway musical. But maybe the most salient pointer is that it ain’t easy being a Broadway musical. A strenuous effort to be all things to all people tends to weigh down this lumbering, overstuffed $14 million production. “Wicked” is stridently earnest one minute, self-mocking the next; a fantastical allegory about the perils of fascism in one scene, a Nickelodeon special about the importance of inner beauty in another. There are flying monkeys, flying witches and flying scenery, but the musical itself truly soars only on rare occasions, usually when one of its two marvelously talented leading ladies, Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel, unleashes the kind of vocal magic that needs no supernatural or even technical assistance.",
