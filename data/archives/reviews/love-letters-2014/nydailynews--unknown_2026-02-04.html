Good news, she's still got the magic. It's in full view in the first-class Broadway revival of A.R. Gurney's 1988 play, \"Love Letters.\" And Farrow's matched note-for-note by Brian Dennehy. The two-character play takes the audience on an emotional ride through the lives of free-spirited Melissa Gardner and the conservative, law-abiding Andrew Makepeace Ladd III. Wealthy and privileged WASPs, they're lifelong friends and sometime lovers who share their most intimate thoughts through 50 years of notes, cards and letters. The play \"is designed to be read aloud by an actor and actress of roughly the same age, sitting side by side at a table,\" the prolific Gurney writes in an author's note. Director Gregory Mosher follows the instruction. An hour-and-a-half of \"he read/she read\" on a bare stage, save for a ghost light, could be a static and blah affair. In lesser actors' hands, the play could end up a pity party you don't want to attend. With this duo, though, the play emerges as sweet, elegant and touching, as two lives come into vibrant focus. The evening also makes the case for the value of letter-writing. Melissa, who's sometimes catty, has money that buys her ski trips to Aspen and life in Florence. But happiness is elusive. Marriages go bust. Same with motherhood — and a grip on life. Through all her trials, she's always honest with Andy, whom she accuses of being too obedient. Andy is ambitious and occasionally callous, a man who knows what his life should look like. A Japanese woman he loves doesn't fit into the picture on his way to becoming a family man and U.S. senator. Stage vet Dennehy brings a steady sturdiness as Andy, narrowing his eyes and shifting in his seat to suggest regret and uncertainty under the calm surface. Melissa is the more colorful character. Farrow brings her to life with vivid facial expressions and vocal inflections. One of her many fine moments comes when an adolescent Melissa anticipates a trip to meet her dad's new wife and their kids. She dreams that it'll be a happy new beginning for her. \"I hope, I hope,\" she says. But then the look on her face tells us the visit was a disaster. The actress makes us care about doomed Melissa. It helps that Farrow and Dennehy, who share the stage through Oct. 10, look like the people Melissa and Andy would grow up to be. Waiting in the wings are Alan Alda, Candice Bergen, Carol Burnett, Anjelica Huston, Stacy Keach, Diana Rigg and Martin Sheen — fine actors ready for their own special delivery. jdziemianowicz@nydailynews.com"}</script><script data-schema="Organization" type="application/ld+json">{"@type":"Organization","name":"New York Daily News","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20220630014727/https://www.nydailynews.com/pf/resources/logo/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack.svg?d=45","width":467,"height":60},"sameAs":["http://web.archive.org/web/20220630014727/https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews","http://web.archive.org/web/20220630014727/https://www.instagram.com/nydailynews/","http://web.archive.org/web/20220630014727/https://twitter.com/NYDailyNews","http://web.archive.org/web/20220630014727/https://www.youtube.com/user/nydailynews"]}</script><script src="http://web.archive.org/web/20220630014727js_/https://cdn.onesignal.com/sdks/OneSignalSDK.js" async=""></script><script async="">

It's in full view in the first-class Broadway revival of A.R. Gurney's 1988 play, "Love Letters." And Farrow's matched note-for-note by Brian Dennehy.</p><div id="inline_cube_11561_wrapper" class="ad_wrapper" style="min-height:50px"><div class="ad_container width_100 bg-color_white flex flex_justify_center " style="min-height:50px"><div class="flex_basis"><div class="text_center"><span class="ad-label font_normal font_open-sans color_grey_6 transform_uppercase">Advertisement</span></div></div></div></div><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 gaccNQ body-paragraph">The two-character play takes the audience on an emotional ride through the lives of free-spirited Melissa Gardner and the conservative, law-abiding Andrew Makepeace Ladd III. Wealthy and privileged WASPs, they're lifelong friends and sometime lovers who share their most intimate thoughts through 50 years of notes, cards and letters.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 gaccNQ body-paragraph">The play "is designed to be read aloud by an actor and actress of roughly the same age, sitting side by side at a table," the prolific Gurney writes in an author's note. Director Gregory Mosher follows the instruction.</p><div id="inline_cube_11562_wrapper" class="ad_wrapper" style="min-height:50px"><div class="ad_container width_100 bg-color_white flex flex_justify_center " style="min-height:50px"><div class="flex_basis"><div class="text_center"><span class="ad-label font_normal font_open-sans color_grey_6 transform_uppercase">Advertisement</span></div></div></div></div><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 gaccNQ body-paragraph">An hour-and-a-half of "he read/she read" on a bare stage, save for a ghost light, could be a static and blah affair. In lesser actors' hands, the play could end up a pity party you don't want to attend. With this duo, though, the play emerges as sweet, elegant and touching, as two lives come into vibrant focus. The evening also makes the case for the value of letter-writing.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 gaccNQ body-paragraph">Melissa, who's sometimes catty, has money that buys her ski trips to Aspen and life in Florence. But happiness is elusive. Marriages go bust. Same with motherhood — and a grip on life. Through all her trials, she's always honest with Andy, whom she accuses of being too obedient.</p><div id="outstream_4945_wrapper" class="ad_wrapper" style="min-height:50px"><div class="ad_container width_100 bg-color_white flex flex_justify_center display-none" style="min-height:50px"><div class="flex_basis"></div></div></div><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 gaccNQ body-paragraph">Andy is ambitious and occasionally callous, a man who knows what his life should look like. A Japanese woman he loves doesn't fit into the picture on his way to becoming a family man and U.S. senator.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 gaccNQ body-paragraph">Stage vet Dennehy brings a steady sturdiness as Andy, narrowing his eyes and shifting in his seat to suggest regret and uncertainty under the calm surface. Melissa is the more colorful character. Farrow brings her to life with vivid facial expressions and vocal inflections.</p><div id="nativo_376985" class="trb_ar_nt_m"></div><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 gaccNQ body-paragraph">One of her many fine moments comes when an adolescent Melissa anticipates a trip to meet her dad's new wife and their kids. She dreams that it'll be a happy new beginning for her. "I hope, I hope," she says. But then the look on her face tells us the visit was a disaster. The actress makes us care about doomed Melissa.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 gaccNQ body-paragraph">It helps that Farrow and Dennehy, who share the stage through Oct. 10, look like the people Melissa and Andy would grow up to be. Waiting in the wings are Alan Alda, Candice Bergen, Carol Burnett, Anjelica Huston, Stacy Keach, Diana Rigg and Martin Sheen — fine actors ready for their own special delivery.</p><div
