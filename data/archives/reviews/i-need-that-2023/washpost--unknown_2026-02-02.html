It’s treated, rather, as a cause for harrumphing and rolling of eyes by Amelia, the daughter of DeVito’s character, Sam, and played by DeVito’s own daughter, Lucy DeVito.</p></div></div><div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body type-inline-ad subtype-desktop preceding-anchor" data-qa="article-body" data-target-index="1"><div class="cb w-100 dn db-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-desktop" data-slotid="enterprise"><wp-ad-wrapper data-testid="enterprise" data-slotid="enterprise" data-variant="incontent" class="dividers article-margins label bgColor" style="height: auto; width: 100%; min-height: 332px;"><wp-ad id="slug_enterprise" class="chromatic-ignore" data-chromatic="ignore" style="min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px; margin: auto; width: 100%; display: block; height: auto;" data-slot="/701/desktop_web/article/incontent_1" aria-hidden="true" data-renderbehavior="lazy" data-refresh="true" data-json="{&quot;targeting&quot;:{&quot;zeus_rendercount&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;kpi&quot;:&quot;ctr&quot;,&quot;zeus_slot&quot;:&quot;slug_enterprise.ref.dsk&quot;,&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;enterprise&quot;,&quot;ctr&quot;:[&quot;zeus_enterprise_refresh&quot;,&quot;refresh&quot;],&quot;wp_ad_refresh&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;wp_refresh&quot;:&quot;enterprise_1&quot;,&quot;pwt&quot;:[&quot;enterprise_refresh_sub_sin_v_0&quot;,&quot;enterprise_refresh_sub_sin_mab_0&quot;],&quot;seamless&quot;:&quot;7172009432&quot;}}" data-google-query-id="COHz3oqtu5IDFVKH7gEdR3ImXA" data-slot-size="970x250"><div id="google_ads_iframe_/701/desktop_web/article/incontent_1_0__container__" style="border: 0pt none;"><iframe id="google_ads_iframe_/701/desktop_web/article/incontent_1_0" name="google_ads_iframe_/701/desktop_web/article/incontent_1_0" title="3rd party ad content" width="0" height="250" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" aria-label="Advertisement" tabindex="0" allow="private-state-token-redemption;attribution-reporting" data-load-complete="true" data-google-container-id="6" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; min-width: 100%;" data-integralas-id-6b6fac8e-e77e-29d4-de8d-713c79de6fb8=""></iframe></div></wp-ad><style>

If this is so, you wonder, why are the health authorities in this unnamed New Jersey community so intent on evicting Sam?

And if similarly off-putting vibes permeate the leading men in all of these projects, the artistic results are wildly varied. Director Trip Cullman, for instance, brings inordinate skill to his staging of “I Can Get It for You Wholesale,” with a cast that gleams with Broadway polish: it includes Judy Kuhn, Adam Chanler-Berat, Rebecca Naomi Jones and Sarah Steele.

As it constructs its critique of American capitalism with mounting evidence of Harry’s misdeeds, “Wholesale” stays true to a compelling mission: a rogue can fool everyone with charm.

Even with an actor as magnetic as Turturro, “Sabbath’s Theater” — about an ex-puppeteer disgraced by accusations of inappropriate behavior with a student — comes across as terminally unpleasant. I know, I know: This contrarian portrait, directed by Jo Bonney is supposed to be redeemed by Roth’s insights and language (as adapted by Turturro and Ariel Levy). For me, it was just a tedious exercise in nihilism.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body type-inline-ad subtype-desktop preceding-anchor" data-qa="article-body" data-target-index="4"><div class="cb w-100 dn db-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-desktop" data-slotid="enterprise_3"><wp-ad-wrapper data-testid="enterprise_3" data-slotid="enterprise_3" data-variant="incontent" class="dividers article-margins label bgColor" style="height: auto; width: 100%; min-height: 332px;"><wp-ad id="slug_enterprise_3" class="chromatic-ignore" data-chromatic="ignore" style="min-height: 1px; min-width: 1px; margin: auto; width: 728px;" data-slot="/701/desktop_web/article/incontent_3" aria-hidden="true" data-renderbehavior="lazy" data-refresh="true" data-json="{&quot;targeting&quot;:{&quot;zeus_rendercount&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;kpi&quot;:&quot;ctr&quot;,&quot;zeus_slot&quot;:&quot;slug_enterprise_3.ref.dsk&quot;,&quot;pos&quot;:&quot;enterprise_3&quot;,&quot;ctr&quot;:[&quot;zeus_enterprise_3_refresh&quot;,&quot;refresh&quot;],&quot;wp_ad_refresh&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;wp_refresh&quot;:&quot;enterprise_3_1&quot;,&quot;pwt&quot;:[&quot;enterprise_3_refresh_sub_sin_v_0&quot;,&quot;enterprise_3_refresh_sub_sin_mab_0&quot;],&quot;seamless&quot;:&quot;7172009432&quot;}}" data-google-query-id="COvh9Imtu5IDFXo7RAgdGHsZoA" data-slot-size="728x90"><div id="google_ads_iframe_/701/desktop_web/article/incontent_3_0__container__" style="border: 0pt none; display: inline-block; width: 728px; height: 90px;"><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://721b9decf7efa1f0b7dd2623752e2121.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-45/html/container.html" id="google_ads_iframe_/701/desktop_web/article/incontent_3_0" title="3rd party ad content" name="" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="728" height="90" data-is-safeframe="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" allow="private-state-token-redemption;attribution-reporting" aria-label="Advertisement" tabindex="0" data-google-container-id="2" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;" data-load-complete="true" data-integralas-id-ce096fa5-49e0-5777-ff84-529e2cd549bc=""></iframe></div></wp-ad><style>

For me, it was just a tedious exercise in nihilism.","type":"text","originalIdx":18,"itid":"lk_inline_manual_18"},{"adIndex":3,"displayAdIndex":true,"subtype":"desktop","type":"inline-ad","originalIdx":19},{"type":"inline-ad","adIndex":2,"displayAdIndex":true,"subtype":"mobile","originalIdx":20},{"adIndex":2,"displayAdIndex":true,"subtype":"rail","type":"rail-ad","originalIdx":21},{"_id":"7YYS43EL7RAO7FOASEZUNHIF3A","additional_properties":{"_id":1698964053324},"content":"The intended effect of DeVito’s character in “I Need That” is diametrically opposite.
