As in the 2003 movie, an elder Allie (Maryann Plunkett) has forgotten her decades-long romance with the dreamy Noah (Dorian Harewood), who recounts their saga from a notebook. Here, both younger and middle-aged versions of Allie (Jordan Tyson and Joy Woods) and Noah (John Cardoza and Ryan Vasquez) act out their shared past.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The familiar broad-strokes theme — love overcoming the passage of time — is spelled out upfront: “Time, time, time, time; it never was mine, mine, mine, mine,” sings a gentle and genial Harewood in the characteristically on-the-nose opening lyrics. (Plunkett is a standout as an audience surrogate, skeptical until she is lulled into a misty stupor.) All six iterations of the lovers are onstage, though it may take the audience a moment to catch on.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="PJLV PJLV-iPJLV-css hide-for-print" data-qa="article-image"><div style="min-height:358px"></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The directors Michael Greif and Schele Williams have assembled a talented array of performers to embody Allie and Noah. The fact that they are of various racial backgrounds allows audiences a welcome opportunity to stretch their imaginations. But the scrupulously colorblind casting also hamstrings the show from making many other narrative choices, to the detriment of its own logic and appeal.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="cb dn db-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-desktop"><div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-md mt-none pt-lg pb-lg" style="min-height:250px;border-top-color:;border-bottom-color:"><div class="center absolute w-100 border-box" style="top:"><div class="dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md" style="--primary-border-color:var(--wpds-colors-alpha25)"></div></div><div data-testid="placeholder-box" class="w-100 h-100 absolute flex flex-column justify-center border-box bg-offwhite" style="width:300px;height:250px"><div class="flex flex-column justify-center font-sans-serif center font-xxs light gray-dark lh-md"><div>Advertisement</div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="cb db dn-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-mobile"><div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-md mt-sm pt-sm pb-sm ad-mobile" style="min-height:250px;border-top-color:transparent;border-bottom-color:transparent"><div class="center absolute w-100 border-box" style="top:"><div class="dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md" style="--primary-border-color:var(--wpds-colors-alpha25)"></div></div><div data-testid="placeholder-box" class="w-100 h-100 absolute flex flex-column justify-center border-box bg-offwhite" style="width:300px;height:250px"><div class="flex flex-column justify-center font-sans-serif center font-xxs light gray-dark lh-md"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Race might have been a dynamic tool to enrich an otherwise vanilla plot. Teenage Allie and Noah meet-cute on the heels of the civil rights movement, when even in the coastal Mid-Atlantic, their interracial sparks could have partly helped explain why Allie’s mother (Andréa Burns) disapproves. (The shift in setting from the novel’s 1940s North Carolina at least saves us from a loss-of-White-innocence scene on the floor of a crumbling plantation house.)</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p><span class="wpds-c-sFUaP wpds-c-sFUaP-jtHNGr-variant-interstitial wpds-c-sFUaP-iPJLV-css hide-for-print"><a data-qa="interstitial-link" data-testid="interstitial-link" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240315082611/https://www.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/style-memo/?method=SURL&amp;location=ART&amp;itid=lk_interstitial_manual_13">Sharp.

Allie still likes to paint and Noah is good with lumber, but an effort to maximize their relatability winds up sacrificing their flesh and blood. The roles can be played by different actors because there’s nothing very particular about either character. The result is anodyne — and lacks the erotic charge of an attraction with distinct flavor set against a recognizable world.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="PJLV PJLV-iPJLV-css hide-for-print" data-qa="article-image"><div style="min-height:358px"></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">Michaelson’s pop score sticks to expressions of emotion — “Sadness and Joy,” “I Wanna Go Back,” “We Have to Try” — that could slot into nearly any boy-meets-girl tale, with acoustic guitar, swelling violins and plinking harp all standing in for heartstrings. The songs draw little inspiration from the various musical eras traversed by the story, instead maintaining a pleasant and palatable contemporary gloss.</p></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="cb dn db-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-desktop"><div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-md mt-none pt-lg pb-lg" style="min-height:250px;border-top-color:;border-bottom-color:"><div class="center absolute w-100 border-box" style="top:"><div class="dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md" style="--primary-border-color:var(--wpds-colors-alpha25)"></div></div><div data-testid="placeholder-box" class="w-100 h-100 absolute flex flex-column justify-center border-box bg-offwhite" style="width:300px;height:250px"><div class="flex flex-column justify-center font-sans-serif center font-xxs light gray-dark lh-md"><div>Advertisement</div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-bHCGeL-isStandardLayoutAd-true article-body" data-qa="article-body"><div class="cb db dn-ns" data-qa="article-body-ad" data-testid="article-body-ad-mobile"><div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-md mt-sm pt-sm pb-sm ad-mobile" style="min-height:250px;border-top-color:transparent;border-bottom-color:transparent"><div class="center absolute w-100 border-box" style="top:"><div class="dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md" style="--primary-border-color:var(--wpds-colors-alpha25)"></div></div><div data-testid="placeholder-box" class="w-100 h-100 absolute flex flex-column justify-center border-box bg-offwhite" style="width:300px;height:250px"><div class="flex flex-column justify-center font-sans-serif center font-xxs light gray-dark lh-md"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null">The same is true of the physical production, which glistens in the reflection of a downstage water’s edge, below a canopy of A-frames and vertical fluorescent bulbs glowing like stationary falling stars (the set is by David Zinn and Brett J.

Teenage Allie and Noah meet-cute on the heels of the civil rights movement, when even in the coastal Mid-Atlantic, their interracial sparks could have partly helped explain why Allie’s mother (Andréa Burns) disapproves.

Allie still likes to paint and Noah is good with lumber, but an effort to maximize their relatability winds up sacrificing their flesh and blood. The roles can be played by different actors because there’s nothing very particular about either character. The result is anodyne — and lacks the erotic charge of an attraction with distinct flavor set against a recognizable world.","type":"text","originalIdx":10},{"_id":"U5LYZN7IGJCQ3FH5GYO5LX47XE","additional_properties":{"size_normalized_url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20240315082611/https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/U5LYZN7IGJCQ3FH5GYO5LX47XE_size-normalized.jpg","media_size":"medium"},"credits":{"by":[{"name":"Julieta Cervantes"}]},"alt_text":"","credits_caption_display":"Jordan Tyson and John Cardoza in “The Notebook.” (Julieta Cervantes)","distributor":{"category":"handout"},"height":2925,"image_type":"photograph","type":"image","url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20240315082611/https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/U5LYZN7IGJCQ3FH5GYO5LX47XE.jpg","width":4387,"originalIdx":11},{"_id":"LKC6V754FFCFTIZTZSGEQ3YUOI","additional_properties":{},"content":"Michaelson’s pop score sticks to expressions of emotion — “Sadness and Joy,” “I Wanna Go Back,” “We Have to Try” — that could slot into nearly any boy-meets-girl tale, with acoustic guitar, swelling violins and plinking harp all standing in for heartstrings.
