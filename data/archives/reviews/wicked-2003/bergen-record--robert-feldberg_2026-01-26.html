<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: justify;">October 31, 2003</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By Robert Feldberg<span style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Wicked," which opened Thursday night at the Gershwin Theater, is a huge, ornate, serious, amusing, ponderous, and clever musical. I could probably add another half-dozen adjectives to describe this one-of-a-kind show that never quite decides what it wants to be, but is nonetheless oddly compelling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on Gregory Maguire's popular novel, it&rsquo;s the back story of the witches In "The Wizard of Oz" &ndash; what made them who they turned out to be. Glinda (Kristin Chenoweth), who becomes the Good Witch, and Elphaba (ldina Menzel), who turns into the Wicked Witch of the West, to a large degree have their destinies determined by circumstance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elphaba is born with skin that's green, the color of pistachio Ice cream. So, even though she's a member of a prominent Munchkinland family, she's a freak, an outsider. Her father has assigned her to be the caretaker of her crippled sister, Nessarose (Michelle Federer).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By chance, Elphaba ends up rooming in college with Glinda, a blond cheerleader type who's her opposite in every way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elphaba is intelligent and passionate, and becomes an activist on behalf of the animals of Oz, who are being officially marginalized. A beloved professor who happens to be a goat (William Youmans) is mysteriously undermined, and then loses his job, and, ultimately, the right to speak, being reduced to saying nothing but "baa."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The presentation of the Oz of beloved memory as a fascist state, with its clueless citizens going docilely along with the official line, while Elphaba, with the spirit of a Sixties radical, alone fights back, is chilling and fascinating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the political theme isn't fully explored or brought to a satisfying dramatic resolution. It's just one strand in a show with many ideas, moods, and styles &ndash; varying elements that can work against one another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A major conflict in style occurs with the two main characters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elphaba Is played superbly by Menzel, with a fierce, gripping intensity that still allows us to see the vulnerability underneath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chenoweth's performance is just as accomplished, but it&rsquo;s in a vein that seems to belong to a different show. As conceived and performed, the character is a sendup, a very funny stand-up routine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From her opening line - ''It's good to see me, isn't it?" delivered with a big, self-aware grin as she floats onto the stage - Glinda is a parody of an entitled prom queen, someone whose girl-next-door prettiness is automatically equated with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nobody can do this kind of<em>&nbsp;</em>thing more hilariously than Chenoweth, who, with her small-girl voice, perfect timing, and expert mugging, is a great comedian. But while 'Wicked," with its essentially dark tone, needs some laughs for balance, the kind of comedy Chenoweth delivers doesn't blend with the show's texture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond that, Glinda remains an elusive character. She alternates between being Elphaba's sympathetic friend and her treacherous enemy, and the book writer, Winnie Holzman, never satisfactorily explains her switches.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">'Wicked," which cost $14 million and shows off every penny, opens with a big production number, "No One Mourns the Wicked," that seems to be a cue that we're in for a lavish, old-fashioned Broadway musical. And there is a big cast, lots of costumes, and an enormous set that stretches beyond the proscenium across the front of the theater.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But many of Susan Hllferty's costumes are in drab colors &ndash; the residents of Munchkinland aren't cute; they're full-size and grim - and the often dark scenery designed by Eugene Lee is dominated by enormous gears, suggesting a harsh, soulless society.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scenes in which 'Wicked" works best are not the indifferently presented big numbers - the angry-crowd activities reminded me of "Beauty and the Beast" - but the smaller scenes, in which character and conflict are often vividly conveyed. This isn&rsquo;t surprising given that the director, Joe Mantello, is a highly proficient director of plays ("Take Me Out," "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune") who's never done a Broadway musical before.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elphaba is most compelling musically when she's alone onstage, singing her feelings directly to the audience. Similarly, the intimate moments are when the score written by Stephen Schwartz ("Godspell," "Pippin") is most effective, with his lyrics making a greater impression than his music.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides being a pre-story for 'The Wizard of Oz," the show also often refers to it. A big part of the enjoyment of 'Wicked" comes from its playing off our awareness of L. Frank Baum's classic tale.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wizard (Joel Grey) is still a faker, but in a much more sinister way. For Elphaba, he originally has the same heroic stature as he did for Dorothy. When she meets him, and tells him what's happening, he'll make everything right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But when she gets to the Emerald City - where, being green, she finally feels at home - he explains, to her disgust, how he's perfected the art of ruling by misdirection. He's united the people under his banner by giving them a common enemy, a scapegoat - the animals. And he hopes to use Elphaba's sorcery to cement his control.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even with the wizard, however, the show sends a mixed message. When Grey performs an engaging vaudeville number called 'Wonderful," he transforms the character into a sweetly old-fashioned song-and-dance man.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Elsewhere, the show is enormously clever in clicking into our connections to 'The Wizard of Oz." It reveals, in a stark, disturbing scene, how a human being happened to be turned into the Tin Man - this isn&rsquo;t a musical for little kids - and also has cunning explanations for the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, the ruby slippers, and the tornado.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And there's more, much more, including the dashing young prince loved by both Glinda and Elphaba and the malevolent head of their college (played expertly by Norbert Leo Butz and Carole Shelley, respectively). And I can't leave out that there's a very touching and satisfying surprise ending.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">'Wicked" tries, in its ambition, to do so much that it's inevitable that it fails to be a smooth, cohesive show. It's too long - two-hours-45- minutes - and it often has a lumbering quality. But its reach, its attempt to be meaty and relevant and theatrical, is not only admirable, it&rsquo;s stimulating. This is a musical that offers many pleasures as you watch it, and - this is rare - also stays with you.</p>            </div>
