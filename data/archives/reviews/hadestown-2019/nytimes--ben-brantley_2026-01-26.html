class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">“It’s a sad song, but we sing it anyway.” We certainly do. The words refer to the classic myth of <a class="css-yywogo" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20250429134744/http://www.mythweb.com/encyc/entries/orpheus.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Orpheus and Eurydice</a>, which has been told and retold — sung and resung, danced and filmed — over the centuries in many genres and styles. Now it has become a folk opera, “Hadestown,” by the gifted singer-songwriter <a class="css-yywogo" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20250429134744/http://anaismitchell.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anaïs Mitchell</a>, which opened on Monday at <a class="css-yywogo" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20250429134744/http://www.nytw.org/show/hadestown/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York Theater Workshop</a> in a gorgeously sung, elementally spare production directed by and developed with Rachel Chavkin (<a class="css-yywogo" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20250429134744/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/theater/reviews/natasha-pierre-and-the-great-comet-of-1812-at-kazino.html?version=meter+at+0&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26contentCollection%26region%3DTopBar%26WT.nav%3DsearchWidget%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26pgtype%3DHomepage&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click" title="">“Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812”</a>).</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">New York Theater Workshop is rare among the city’s major theaters in bringing fresh imagination even to the regular reconfiguring of its auditorium. For “Hadestown,” the audience almost surrounds the stage, sitting on an assortment of wooden chairs placed on a series of tiers. (Thankfully, cushions are provided.)</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">While the action primarily takes place in a circular playing area, with the excellent band tucked in the back, the performers intermittently move through aisles in the audience, bringing an inviting intimacy to the production. It’s a smart tactic, because while its score is continually beguiling, “Hadestown” might feel static were it not for Ms. Chavkin’s simple but inventive staging, which is enhanced by the fluid lighting design of Bradley King. (“Hadestown” began as a concept album Ms. Mitchell released in 2010, and at times those roots show.)</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The setting for this particular reworking of the myth remains unspecified. The minimal props include antique lanterns, and the performers sometimes sing into old-fashioned-looking microphones. We might be in the Depression, but then again we might not. (The costumes, by Michael Krass, are mostly contemporary.) In any case, as the tale begins, hardship and natural disasters have come upon the land: “Flood’ll get ya if the fire don’t,” sing the Fates, portrayed by Lulu Fall, Jessie Shelton and <a

Eurydice (Nabiyah Be) and becomes instantly entranced, immediately promising to shield her from want through the magic of his music.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">In a duet shaded with anxiety, Eurydice asks, “Lover, tell me if you’re able, who’s gonna set the wedding table?” Orpheus’s swaggering answer:</p><blockquote class="css-1ggt3fz etf134l0"><p class="css-12wzsk6 evys1bk0">Lover, when I sing my song<br/>All the trees gonna sing along<br/>And bend their branches down to me<br/>To lay their fruit around my feet.</p></blockquote><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Hermes, the tale’s narrator, portrayed with a nifty sense of been-there-seen-that-sung-it-before wisdom by Chris Sullivan, sums up Orpheus’s powers of persuasion nicely: “He could make you see how the world could be, in spite of the way it was.”</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-3"><figure class="sizeMedium css-sx232s" aria-label="media"

data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Ms. Be’s Eurydice has a luminous beauty that makes Orpheus’s quick fall quite believable, and her singing is equally spellbinding. She also imbues the character with a transparent innocence that makes Eurydice’s susceptibility to doubt and seduction palpably believable.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">For, while the details remain vague — there is little in “Hadestown” that qualifies as specific action — Eurydice quickly becomes disenchanted when Orpheus’s sunny promises are not immediately kept. He might sing of a world where want and need are banished — and Mr. Daunno’s handsome, high-lying tenor matches his sunny ardor nicely — but his absorption in song-making apparently doesn’t bring much manna from heaven.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div data-testid="Dropzone-5"></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Enter Hades, played with an air both sinister and suave by <a class="css-yywogo" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20250429134744/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/theater/patrick-page-onetime-green-goblin-on-playing-in-cyrano.html" title="">Patrick Page</a>. He’s the ruler of Hadestown, an underworld hell where workers toil in his foundries and factories. Mr. Page’s charcoal baritone seductively wraps itself around Ms. Mitchell’s songs as he hymns the comforts that await Eurydice down below, and mocks Orpheus’s promises:</p><blockquote class="css-1ggt3fz etf134l0"><p class="css-12wzsk6 evys1bk0">Hey little songbird, let me guess<br/>He’s some kind of poet, and he’s penniless<br/>Give him your hand<br/>He’ll give you his hand-to-mouth<br/>He’ll write you a poem when the power’s out.</p></blockquote><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Ms. Mitchell’s lovely music and well-turned lyrics are tightly bound together, and recall traditional folk music with a distinctive Southern flavor (although she hails from Vermont). While most of the words, and for that matter the melodies, feel as if they could have been written in the 1930s (or at least the 1960s), there are witty contemporary touches, as when Persephone, Hades’s wife, portrayed with a polished glamour by <a class="css-yywogo" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20250429134744/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/theater/amber-gray-on-an-octoroon-at-soho-rep.html" title="">Amber Gray,</a> refers to “pay-per-view” at one point. The orchestrations, by Michael Chorney and Todd Sickafoose, are simultaneously rich and spare, deftly echoing the sounds of traditional folk music while also having an indie-pop flair.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Just why Hades takes a shine to Eurydice is among the details left vague in “Hadestown” — perhaps during the six months when Persephone is allowed to roam the earth he grows a little restive. In any case, as in the myth, down she goes, and — nonspoiler alert — Orpheus soon follows, determined to win her back. I probably don’t need to tell you how things turn out, either. As Hermes also says, “It’s an old tale from way back when.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">And yet, at least at one startling point, the musical resonates in a shivery-funny way with today’s America. It’s pure coincidence. Ms. Mitchell began work on “Hadestown” even before she released it as an album, but the first act concludes with Hades leading one of the more rousing songs, a gospel-tinged anthem entitled <a class="css-yywogo" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20250429134744/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAgiK07Py9M" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Why We Build the Wall.”</a> With the company portraying his masses of workers, Hades leads them through a song celebrating the importance of a nonporous border.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">“Why do we build the wall?” the chorus sings. “We build the wall to keep us free.” They continue: “How does the wall keep us free? The wall keeps out the enemy.” The enemy, put simply, is the people up above who lack what those in Hadestown have — a superficial prosperity, or at least work to do — and desperately want it.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">One more thing I probably don’t need to tell you: Why this song made me sit up in my chair, and wrap my jacket around me a little tightly to shake off the goose bumps.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div></section><div class="bottom-of-article"><div class="css-5dm9xx"><div class="css-acwcvw"><strong class="css-1vg6q84">A correction was made on</strong> <div class="css-dzvz0g e16638kd1">May 26, 2016</div>: <p class="css-o5w3xl evys1bk0">A theater review on Tuesday about “Hadestown,” at New York Theater Workshop in Manhattan, misspelled the given name of the actress who plays Eurydice.
