<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Hell's
Kitchen</span></i></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">By
Deirdre Donovan</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">The
new Alicia Keys-scored musical <i>Hell's Kitchen </i>is now heating up the
boards at the Shubert Theatre. Inspired by the life of Alicia Keys&#8212;global
megastar and winner of fifteen Grammy Awards&#8212;it focuses on several months in
the life of a musically precocious seventeen-year-old girl in New York in the
1990s.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Hell's
Kitchen</span></i><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif"> got its stage
legs during the fall 2023 season at the Public Theater. While the show received
mostly favorable reviews, some critics felt it was a tad repetitive. The good
news is that the Broadway version has a stronger spine, the characters' arcs
are more clearly defined, and the dancing is crisper.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Primarily
set in the midtown Manhattan neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, we meet Ali
(Maleah Joi Moon in a powerful Broadway debut) who yearns for art and love, and
her mother Jersey (Shoshana Bean), a sometime actress who works part-time at
various office jobs. They live at Manhattan Plaza, an apartment building that
offers affordable housing for artists. The relationship between Ali and Jersey
provides most of the conflict in the story: Ali wants her mother to stop
smothering her with love and restricting her freedom; Jersey wants Ali to stay
off the city streets and not make the same mistakes that she did as a teenager.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Kristoffer
Diaz' book doesn't sugarcoat this coming-of-age story. He portrays Ali as a
rebel and Jersey as a devoted, if overreactive, mom who's trying to prevent her
daughter from becoming involved with Knuck (Chris Lee), the drummer who jams
with his friends, 'Riq (Lamont Walker II) and Q (Jakeim Hart) outside Manhattan
Plaza. To this end, Jersey talks with their doorman Ray (Chad Carstarphen), in
hopes of having Knuck and his buddies arrested. But Ray reminds Jersey that
he's not a policeman:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Jersey:
"Listen: if you see any of those boys talking to my daughter, have them
arrested. Hell, you have my permission to arrest her."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Ray: "I'm not
a cop. I'm the doorman."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">While
Jersey plans to upend Ali's budding romance, Ali does what teenagers have been
doing for ages: she dreams up how she and Knuck can secretly continue their
relationship. Suffice it to say, things don't go smoothly for the young lovers.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">The
music is front and center in this show. And it's not only because of Keys'
signature anthems baked into this confection. It begins with Ali giving us an
elevator tour of Manhattan Plaza, with the door opening up on various floors
and her giving the audience a snapshot of who lives there. Or as she puts it:
There's "Mr. Gordone, 32<sup>nd</sup> floor, forever on his trumpet... and a
whole string section on 27". Little wonder that Ali herself began playing a
musical instrument: the piano. But, unlike what we see in the musical, Keys
actually began tickling the ivories at the tender age of seven.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif"><img width="554" height="369" src="/web/20241006170924im_/https://theaterscene.com/Hell-Kitchen-DD_files/image002.png"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Kecia
Lewis, Maleah Joi Moon (Photo: Marc J. Franklin)</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Ali's
relationship with her piano teacher and mentor, Miss Liza Jane (Kecia Lewis),
is vital to the story. A kind of Nina Simone-esque figure, Miss Liza Jane is an
anchor for Ali, offering the teen both musical instruction and lessons on life.
Ali's bonding with Miss Liza Jane, however, leads to some resentful feelings
from Ali's mother Jersey. Or as Jersey bluntly says to Miss Liza Jane in the
Ellington Room:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Jersey:
"Listen: I get that you and this piano are her shiny new toys and I'm just the
annoying old monster who constantly reminds her to do dumb things like eat
dinner, stay out of trouble, you know, maybe not get pregnant before she
finishes high school. She likes you. She hates me. That's fine. But she is my
daughter."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">If
the mother-daughter battles keep the audience leaning in, the nearly two dozen
musical numbers from Keys' catalog that waft over the footlights are utterly
mesmerizing. There are her mega-hits, including "Girl on Fire," "If I Ain't Got
You," and "Empire State of Mind." Keys also composed some new songs for the
musical, most notably "Kaleidoscope," which focuses on Ali's first meeting with
her piano teacher, Miss Liza Jane.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Manhattan
Plaza is a key character in the musical. Beyond providing real New York flavor
to the piece, it also points out that Ali was not born with a silver spoon in
her mouth. Indeed, whether we witness her arguing with her single working
mother or briefly reconnecting with her often-absent dad, Ali evidently is <i>not</i>
a child of privilege. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif"><img width="536" height="367" id="Picture 1" src="/web/20241006170924im_/https://theaterscene.com/Hell-Kitchen-DD_files/image003.png"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Maleah Joi
Moon, Chris Lee, and the company of Hell's Kitchen (Photo: Marc J. Franklin) </span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">The
acting is top-notch. Maleah Joi Moon is a triple threat with titanium pipes,
hip-hop dance moves, and a natural acting style. Shoshana Bean is well-cast as
the mother who finds it difficult to let go of her only child. Kecia Lewis
looks regal as Ali's piano teacher and delivers her speeches with ancestral
wisdom. Brandon Victor Dixon, as Ali's father Davis, comes across as an
ambitious artist who hasn't yet learned how to balance his art and life. Chris
Lee's Knuck is spot-on as Ali's love interest, a street-smart young man who has
a vulnerable side.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Camille
A. Brown's dazzling choreography is the pulsating heartbeat of the musical,
pushing the story forward with its hip-hop vibe. <i>Hell's Kitchen </i>is the
fifth Broadway show that Brown has worked on, and it shows her at her very
best. Little wonder she has snagged her first Tony nomination for her work on
this musical, not to mention her Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle
nominations.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">Robert
Brill's dynamic, ever shifting set captures the landscape of the city and
reflects its vibrancy. Brill, who also designed the set for the show's Off-Broadway
run at The Public, had to fill the larger spaces of the Shubert. And he did,
with sensational results.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">While
cargo pants and matching tops might not be the stuff of glamor, Dede Ayite's
urban outfits for the cast cut the mustard and are right in step with the 90s.
Theatergoers might remember that Ayite worked on another Broadway show earlier
in the season, <i>Jaja's African Hair Braiding, </i>and her costumes have also graced
many others on the Great White Way.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif">As
ably directed by Michael Grief, <i>Hell's Kitchen </i>is a musical that tells
an uplifting New York story. Why not visit the Shubert and be inspired?</span></p>
