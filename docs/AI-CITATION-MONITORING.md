## Content Optimization Based on Monitoring

When monitoring reveals gaps:

### Not Getting Cited for a Topic?
1. Create/improve dedicated page for that topic
2. Add FAQ schema with that exact question
3. Include specific data/stats (AI loves citable numbers)
4. Update llms.txt to highlight that content

### Competitor Getting Cited Instead?
1. Analyze their content - what makes it citable?
2. Create more comprehensive version
3. Add unique data they don't have
4. Ensure proper schema markup

### Being Cited but Low Position?
1. Add more authoritative signals (data, sources)
2. Update content more frequently
3. Improve page structure/formatting
4. Add more specific/unique information
